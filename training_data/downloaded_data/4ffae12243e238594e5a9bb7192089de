  "content": "From time to time, we all find ourselves pondering what currently troubles the mind of X Factor-winner, Nine Inch Nails interpreter and equine cheerleader Leona Lewis, and for many of us the self-proclaimed global songstress's infuriatingly brief Twitter updates merely skim the surface. Well, there is good news this week, with the launch of Lee-Loy.com, a lifestyle blog set up by Leona and her friend Maloy. Leona's work we already know. Maloy, meanwhile, is a \"crazy, upside down crunking, animal loving, free spirited diva\", and her arrival as a household name is perfectly timed because, as we all know, crazy, upside-down-crunking, animal-loving, free-spirited divas are in criminally short supply these days, particularly in light of the story dominating this week's front pages. Fair play to Leona for getting this venture up and running \u2013 it's clearly a labour of love for now \u2013 but it's true to say that her own content is taking a while to find its feet. So far her musings have covered the colour pink (\"My favourite colour is everywhere right now and I'm loving it!\"), her review of 52 Mondays: The One-Year Path to Outrageous Success &amp; Lifelong Happiness (\"I'm finding it very helpful in organising my life\"), and the topic of how far into a relationship to say \"I love you\" (\"The bottom line,\" she helpfully notes, \"is that there's no right amount of time\"). But there is hope. For a start, the internet is bursting with hundreds of similar blogs that are almost infinitely worse than Lee-Loy.com, and many of them attract terrifying volume of traffic and revenue. Plus there is another side to Leona, which Lee-Loy.com readers are yet to see. Leona's Twitter followers met this Ms Hyde character last week. Her feed is usually the place to find heartwarming comments such as: \"You are loved, you are love x.\" Her thoughts were more colourful on Saturday, as the nation's attention switched to the goings-on at Aintree. \"Fuck the grand national,\" Leona suddenly tweeted. This was followed a minute or two later by: \"How about we put down the little twats that run those poor horses into the ground. Can't stand this bullshit.\" This is the Leona Lewis we want to see on Lee-Loy.com. In fact, if every single post consisted of Leona swearing about horses, this could be an internet goldmine. She could concentrate on how much better her four-legged friends are than the men who persecute them, and call it Horse Before Bros. I'm sure there would still be some chances for crazy upside-down crunking along the way.",
