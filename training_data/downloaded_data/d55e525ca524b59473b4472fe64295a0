  "content": "Using the #GuardianCam hashtag on Instagram, reporters Paul Lewis and Dan Roberts are giving readers behind-the-scenes views during one of the biggest nights in US politics. While President Obama's State of the Union address isn't likely to unite Congress or introduce a course of action on pressing issues, the night has historically been a way for Americans to watch political theatre unfold in real-time during prime-time. Paul and Dan will be snapping photos throughout the evening on the Guardian Instagram account. Find their updates by visiting the page here or by following #GuardianCam on Instagram or Twitter. Here's a selection of their updates so far: The Senate's underground train Art on Capitol Hill Reporting essentials A panoramic of the US Capitol rotunda So many wires, so little battery life TV crews get ready to spin View the latest from #GuardianCam below Viewing on mobile?
