  "content": "Peeple, the controversial app that lets users review people the way some people review restaurants or tourist attractions, is to launch after a period of beta testing in which its co-founder says it was used for \"spreading kindness and accolades\". Peeple, subtitled \"where your character is your currency\", was met with almost universal criticism when the concept was first publicised in October last year; the Washington Post called it \"the terrifying 'Yelp for people'\". A more moderate version than was first outlined will be available for download from Apple's App Store from Monday. The initial design of the app let users add people to its database and give them star ratings and reviews without their consent. Reviews could not be deleted, though they would expire after a year to reflect people's capacity to \"grow and change for the better\"; users were also unable to delete their profiles. Media and commenters exploded over the apparent practical, ethical and legal challenges presented by this scenario. Model Chrissy Teigen tweeted: \"In an age where both truth and gossip can literally ruin lives, this #peeple app is horrible and scary #yelpforhumans???\" Co-founder Julia Cordray responded to criticism by saying Peeple was a \"positivity app for positive people\" that had been misrepresented by media, and said it would be launched in November \"unless we change major features\". In a video posted to Peeple's YouTube channel about going \"viral &amp; global in 24 hours\" Cordray was filmed in her bathroom, talking about her resolution to make the app a success. \"What I want to stress is that when I speak about this one day on a stage and you guys are watching me, as somebody who pioneered me the start of something this big, I want you to remember that it takes bravery and it takes courage and it takes humility and it takes exposing yourself, the way [\"the power of vulnerability\" academic] Bren\u00e9 Brown talks about, by stepping into the arena ... You all deserve a seat in my arena.\" Comments for the video were disabled. Peeple is currently only available to iOS users in North America. The statement announcing its release referred to the \"ironic\" backlash Cordray and her co-founder, Nicole McCullough, experienced from people who felt Peeple would threaten their privacy and facilitate online abuse. \"The developers of Peeple were threatened, their privacy was invaded, and they were castigated and shouted down on Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn and Facebook. They were overwhelmed by thousands of harassing emails, comments, and phone calls. All this before the Peeple app ever actually saw the light of day.\" Changes to how the app functions appear to have largely addressed those early criticisms. Users can still review people according to professional, personal or romantic relationships, but the star ratings have been replace by a tally of the total number of recommendations received. They will also have full control over what is shown on their profile, and the ability to deactivate it. No one can be added to Peeple without their consent. Cordray told Guardian Australia that more than 10,000 people applied to be beta testers for the app; of 1,500 invitations issued in mid-January, 500 accepted. Cordray said use of the app during beta test proved \"that people are very positive\": users, she said, \"have enjoyed spreading kindness and accolades while reading what people really think of them\". Cordray said the beta period went smoothly; the app's launch was delayed in January when Apple requested more Facebook integration. Now users will be able to invite their Facebook friends to join them on Peeple and see them listed in one view on the app. (\"Which is great for us!\") Cordray hoped that the app would translate to \"better jobs and better networking opportunities or even dates\" for its users. \"We want our app to be a safe place to manage your own online reputation, while making better decisions about the people around you.\" A premium, paid-for service called The Truth License will be introduced \"in the near future\" and allow subscribers to see all the reviews of other users, whether publicly posted or not. This is billed as helping to keep commenters \"accountable for what they write\", but concerns have been raised that it means those early criticisms of the app still stand. \"This is the same thing Peeple wanted to do when it was first announced, only now you'll have to pay for the 'privilege',\" wrote Amanda Connolly for The Next Web.",
