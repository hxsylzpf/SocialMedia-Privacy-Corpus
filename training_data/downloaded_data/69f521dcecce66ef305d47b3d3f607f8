  "content": "Rupert Murdoch has dubbed the Sun's page 3 and its daily diet of topless pictures \"old-fashioned\", as he raised further doubts about the future of the 44-year institution. His remarks in a series of tweets cheered campaigners against page 3 and apparently came as a surprise to senior executives at his biggest-selling British newspaper. The media mogul's first tweet on Wednesday repeated the view that the \"Brit feminists [who] bang on forever about page 3 \u2026 never buy paper\" before adding: \"I think old fashioned but readers seem to disagree.\" He then went on to solicit views about the daily feature among Twitter users. \"Aren't beautiful young women more attractive in at least some fashionable clothes? Your opinions please.\" A spokesman for the Sun said a \"large number of our readers don't use Twitter or Facebook\" and said that it would be business as usual with no decision made on the future of the page. The Sun editor, David Dinsmore, is understood to share Murdoch's views about the outdated nature of page 3. However, last year he made it clear that the paper would continue showing topless women on page 3 as long as readers wanted it to. He said: \"I make the Sun for its readers, not for the No More Page 3 people, or the twitterati or Guardian readers. We held focus groups in which it was clear that we shouldn't touch it [page 3]. People don't want to be told what should be in their newspaper. As far as I'm concerned I've parked the issue.\" Murdoch's comments were enough to prompt Alison Webster, the Sun's page 3 photographer who tweets as @Page3photog to tweet: \"Anyone have a spare photography job going? Think I might need one. Also models available, not many fashionable clothes!\" When contacted by the Guardian, Webster said the tongue-in-cheek tweet was probably sent out by her daughter. \"If it all goes tits up I'll let you know \u2026 I am quite sure that if commercially if wasn't viable they would lose it. But obviously it is.\" Page 3 took a four-day break from its regular slot before returning on Tuesday as part of the weekly \"Coppafeel\" slot to raise awareness about breast cancer. In February last year, Murdoch made his first negative comments about page 3 when he suggested it might be better to show women as \"glamorous fashionistas\" rather than topless. Lucy-Anne Holmes, who set up the No More Page 3 campaign after noticing that the most prominent picture of a woman was a half-naked one during the 2012 Olympics, welcomed the renewed signs that Murdoch was tiring of the feature first started in 1970. Holmes said: \"What is really encouraging is that Rupert Murdoch's tweets certainly show that he's reconsidering the future of Page 3.\" It was though, she added, \"unfortunate that he misses the point entirely by asking a question about whether young women are more attractive clothed or unclothed\". Dinsmore has compared page 3 to art and also to Kate Moss appearing in Vogue over the past year. But No More Page 3 has a list of reasons why he should stop publishing the picture. \"Page 3 comes from an era of Jimmy Saville, the Benny Hill show and on the buses. It mocks and disrespects women just like racist features like the Black and White Minstrel Show and gollywogs used to mock people of colour. The world and its moral perspective have moved on and we think its time the Sun did the same and brought its readers with it.\"",
