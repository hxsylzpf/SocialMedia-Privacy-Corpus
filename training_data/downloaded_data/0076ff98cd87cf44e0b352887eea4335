The site, which has been a major irritant to governments and big businesses since it launched in 2007, says it cannot keep going without more public donations. Wikileaks' organisers announced the suspension in a statement on its site. \"To concentrate on raising the funds necessary to keep us alive into 2010, we have reluctantly suspended all other operations, but will be back soon,\" it says. Pleading for more cash, it explained that publishing hundreds of thousands of previously secret documents each year costs money. \"If staff are paid, our yearly budget is $600,000 [\u00a3372,000],\" it said. The site, which is part of the not-for-profit group Sunshine Press, adds: \"We have raised just over $130,000 for this year but cannot meaningfully continue operations until costs are covered. These amount to just under $200,000pa.\" Wikileaks refuses to accept corporate or government funding for fear of compromising its integrity. Described by the Guardian as the \"brown paper envelope for the digital age\", it rose to prominence last year by hosting the Minton report on the activities of the oil trader Trafigura while the firm's lawyers were trying to prevent the press from revealing its contents. Last year it also published a membership list of the British National party and it told the unfolding secret story of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon by releasing 500,000 intercepted pager messages. Wikileaks's appeal for cash has prompted widespread support on the web. A Facebook group called Save Wikileaks has been formed and there are numerous supportive messages on Twitter. Blogging for the Spectator Martin Bright, the former political editor of the New Statesman, wrote: \"I know money is tight, but I urge anyone who cares about liberty to visit the site and donate.\"",
