  "content": "It's great, isn't it? Someone sends you a link to a Tumblr of Trees That Look Like Benedict Cumberbatch (NB That's all trees, really, isn't it?). You tweet it. It sinks without a ripple. A fortnight later, someone tweets the same link to Caitlin Moran. She retweets it and in moments Twitter is afire with Cumbertrees. Moran is carried shoulder high. The guy who tweeted her the link racks up messianic follower numbers. Your fists whiten as you sit at your MacBook in impotent rage. All you can do is tweet to Caitlin, through gritted beak, your voice lost in the howling cybergale, \"It's great, isn't it?\" Those four little words whose true, neurotic meaning is: \"I want you know I'd already seen this thing before you tweeted it. I am not one of those people slavishly retweeting you, rather I am adopting a paternal, knowing aspect reflecting the fact that this is old news to me.\" She doesn't care, pal. No one cares who tweeted it first, which wasn't you anyway. Are they your photos of trees? No. Get on with your life. Placename, i am in you \"Nottingham, I am in you!\" Ha ha! It sounds like a hilariously baroque way of declaring you're having sex with Nottingham! But actually you're just saying \"I am in Nottingham\". Which takes up four fewer characters, so that's something to think about. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to Twitter\u2026 If, a week ago, you'd been asked to compile a list of the 500 people you'd like to see join Twitter, would the J-lister you're currently affecting breathless giddiness about have been on that list? No. So stop pretending to be all excited about them now, you whinnying berk. Also, you're not a town crier.",
