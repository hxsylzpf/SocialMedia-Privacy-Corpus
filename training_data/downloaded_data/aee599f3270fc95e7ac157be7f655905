  "content": "There is no quicker way for old institutions to look irrelevant than to insist on their relevance. Today The Australian did just that by publishing an editorial not only bragging about its superiority, but underlining the \"path to ruin\" that is (other) journalists using Twitter.  The thrust of the argument made in the editorial is that Twitter is contributing to journalism's decline; that it exists as some sort of \"alternative media universe\" run by narcissists with no hardcore news values. It proclaims that \"this mad plunge into social media-driven journalism would be mildly diverting if it wasn't so dangerous to the future of news reporting\", before conceding that Twitter is a wonderful tool for journalism when it comes to, um, marketing. The editorial has left many ex-Australian writers rather perturbed (I'm assuming many current ones would have safely mumbled misgivings among themselves rather than make them public). Former writers from the media section \u2013 including Amanda Meade, Nic Christensen and Simon Canning \u2013 openly mocked the piece on Twitter (after all, they were active on the platform during their time at The Australian). Meade was one of the first mainstream journalists who saw Twitter's reporting potential, which she embraced to her former employer's benefit. To take aim at the claims in The Australian almost seems too easy. Twitter is one of the most powerful journalistic tools available to newsrooms, and inherent to their survival. That the only national Australian daily newspaper would publicly fail to understand that is alarming. We need newsrooms. We need professional journalists. We need a diverse media landscape. Twitter and social media play a vital role in that future. Not convinced? Here are some of the ways in which Twitter has contributed to journalism (both the profession and the act of it) that is important to our democracy, and not the meaningless \"infotainment and fleeting fashions\" the editorial suggests it perpetuates. Egypt and the Middle East. Many journalists, most notably Andy Carvin from NPR (based in the US) and Jess Hill formerly at the ABC (based in Australia) used Twitter to develop trusted sources in Egypt and the Middle East during the 2011 uprisings. They relied on those sources to report and collate what was happening at a time when many media organisations could not get reporters in on the ground. Twitter has also been used to track and analyse political polarisation in Egypt. The London Riots. During the 2011 riots \"citizens collaborated extensively with reporters in the middle of the riots, often advising on and helping refine the coverage.\" The Guardian's Paul Lewis relied on Twitter to connect with citizens on the ground as unrest was unfolding across the capital. Bin Laden's death. In May, 2011 it was Keith Urbahn (who formally worked for Donald Rumsfield's office) who broke the news on Twitter that Osama bin Laden had also been killed by the US government. Asylum seekers in Australia. The Guardian's Oliver Laughland uses Twitter to get tips on Nauru at a time when the Australian government has developed an aversion to talking to the media about the issue. Laughland has relied on users such as Clint Deidenang to alert him to planes carrying transferred asylum seekers arriving on the island. It was Deidenang who tweeted the first pictures of RPC 3 on Nauru \u2013 which is where families and pregnant women are held. The value of Twitter extends to everyday reporting, with journalists using it to stay on top of their beats. This is particularly useful for journalists reporting in rural areas or niche fields. Jesse Graham from the Mail Newspaper Group said he has search-bars running with the names of some of the towns he covers. \"This is particularly useful when CFA incidents occur (such as car crashes or fires), and for finding out about upcoming events that may not be heavily publicised or updates from community groups,\" he said. In response to the editorial's accusation that Fairfax journalists were not \"getting out into the suburbs of our great cities and towns,\" Fairfax journalist Alana Schetzer pointed out that using Twitter and other social media platforms were part of her job in the same way that going out and meeting people were. \"One is not more important than the other, and all offer ways to meet and talk to different people and conduct research for my stories,\" she said. Lastly, there is no \"alternative media universe\". Media is an all encompassing word, and Twitter is now very much part of that. The Australian's editorial might be mildly diverting if it wasn't so dangerous to the future of news reporting.",
