  "content": "Stephen Fry has had a very public falling out with social networking site Plaxo, accusing it of making his details available to anyone who cared to look, in a spat that exposes the privacy dangers of the web. Plaxo, which has more than 20 million users worldwide and is part of the American media conglomerate Comcast, denied that its website had been hacked, saying the comedian and actor had been too lax with his privacy settings. Fry told his million-plus followers on microblogging site Twitter late last week that he was livid when he noticed that his details were being made available to all other Plaxo members. \"I've got the hell out of Plaxo which was distributing my details to every casual passerby. Grrrrr,\" he \"tweeted\". It is not the first time Fry has fallen foul of the social networking craze. Last month he threatened to quit Twitter after a fan accused him of being boring. Before he deleted his profile on Plaxo, anyone logged on was able to see details including the number of his mobile phone (work) and what looked like a home address. With other social networking sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn, only people whom a user has befriended in some way can view certain parts of that user's profile. On Plaxo last week, however, it appeared that many members were sharing perhaps more than they intended. For instance, anyone looking up Andrew Neil, former Sunday Times editor, could get his home phone number and address. Fry's spat highlights the need for anyone with an online profile \u2013 whether on Facebook, Twitter or the myriad of smaller internet social networking sites \u2013 to know exactly what information they are sharing with others and to be aware of who is following them online. Facebook has recently become the target of cybercriminals who hijack people's profiles and use them to mount \"phishing\" attacks on their online friends \u2013 using the bond of trust to their own advantage. Plaxo, founded by one of the creators of online filesharing phenomenon Napster, is designed to help people connect for business ventures. Although US-based it is slightly more European focused than its rival LinkedIn. Because of its focus on business connections, much of the personal information which users seem willing to share relates primarily to work contact details and phone numbers. Some of that information may still be embarrassing: it is unlikely, for instance, that all 832 of the people identified as connections by one Plaxo member, 30-year-old Amy \u2013 who describes herself in her profile as \"escort, model\" \u2013 would necessarily want their friendship publicly acknowledged. Many are senior business executives. Plaxo's marketing head John McCrea said: \"There has definitely not been a breach of the security of our service. As best I can tell, all that's happened is that one user (albeit, a rather prominent one!) was surprised to find that the sharing settings he'd previously applied to some of his personal info were more public than he'd intended.\" He had asked Fry for more details of his problem, adding \"we certainly have not made any changes to settings, features or policies that would make anyone's personal information more widely available than it had previously been\". But Fry told the Guardian: \"My settings haven't been changed since I was first on it. So v [sic] odd that I should get two emails telling me I was compromised... No plans to return.\" Although Plaxo did \"enhance\" its profiles feature a few months ago, McCrea stressed \"the emphasis was on making Plaxo profiles even more professional in appearance and on giving users even easier control over how they present themselves online\". Plaxo makes it easier than many other social networking sites for users to see exactly what information they are sharing with others users. McCrea stressed that anyone building an online profile should only ever put on it \"the information you're interested in sharing with others\". \"In addition, I recommend to everyone, whether a Plaxo member or not, to periodically Google yourself. That is, search for your name on all the major search engines to see what sort of public image of you is out there.\" He advises people to assert their identity on multiple sites. \"Even if you don't actively use all of them, having a decent, accurate profile on each, with whatever information you want projected about you, is the best way to take control of your online identity and your personal brand.\"",
