  "content": "Poor old David Cameron. Last week the prime minister was mocked after tweeting a photograph of himself phoning Barack Obama to discuss the crisis in Ukraine. Now it appears the PM has made another social media gaffe \u2013 buying friends on Facebook. The Mail on Sunday reports that the Tories have spent thousands of pounds on advertising to encourage Facebook users to \"like\" Cameron's page. Marketing experts estimated that the campaign cost about \u00a37,500, and succeeded in boosted Cameron's \"likes\" by 47,000 to 127,000, overtaking Nick Clegg's 80,000 in the process. Labour MP Sheila Gilmore said: \"It looks as if David Cameron is buying popularity. There is no end to his ego, paying for fake Facebook friends.\" The paper also quoted a Lib Dem insider as saying the strategy was \"pretty pathetic.\" Meanwhile, one spoof Cameron Twitter account tweeted: Cameron clearly has a long way to go with his social media strategy \u2013 if nothing else, he's still more than 600,000 \"likes\" behind Dappy fron N-Dubz.",
