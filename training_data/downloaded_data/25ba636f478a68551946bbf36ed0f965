  "content": "Passengers on the Qatar plane escorted into Manchester airport on Tuesday have said they discovered what was going on on social networking site Twitter. \"We stopped at the end of the runway and I found out what was going on by looking at Twitter,\" Matthew Qox said. \"I found out what was happening on Twitter,\" said Josh Hartley, who said the cabin crew had given no information. The QR23 flight from Doha to Manchester was escorted to its destination by an RAF jet after its crew received a threat about a possible device on board. It arrived safely at 1.15pm and a passenger has been arrested on suspicion of making a bomb threat. As is often the case with a breaking news situation, details came in thick and fast in 140-character bursts, beginning with eyewitnesses on the ground, who spotted the fighter jet from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire escorting the passenger jet. Of course, Twitter is often the first place for speculation \u2013 a reminder that while it's a useful tool during breaking news, sometimes hashtags should be taken with a pinch of salt. Local media outlets were soon on the case: As eyewitnesses and news outlets on the ground wondered what was happening, one passenger was tweeting updates and posting videos to Instagram from within the plane as it was escorted to its destination. Cox, said he found out about the situation via breaking news apps and Twitter, was also tweeting updates from the air. Just over half an hour later, he sent a photo of a man appearing to be escorted off the plane by police at Manchester airport: He and Hartley have continued to post updates on their respective Twitter feeds, as passengers alighted the plane and waited for their luggage to be returned to them. An hour after the first tweet was sent, Greater Manchester police's Twitter feed sent out their first official statement. Manchester Airport tweeted its own response at 3.21pm.",
