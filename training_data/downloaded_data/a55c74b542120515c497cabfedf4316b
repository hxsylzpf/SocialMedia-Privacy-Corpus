  "content": "Sir Ian Blair's secret taping of his phone call with the attorney general breaches the Data Protection Act and European human rights laws, legal experts said today. Solicitor Mark Stephens, of Finers Stephens Innocent, said: \"It is clear that the attorney general gave Sir Ian some of his thoughts and opinions on the phone, it was after all a personal call. \"By the act of recording those thoughts and opinions, Sir Ian therefore 'processed' (in the meaning of the act) personal data about the attorney general. The first principle of data protection is that data must be processed 'fairly and lawfully' - by secretly recording the call Sir Ian was acting unfairly. Moral principles are the guide here.\" He said Sir Ian had an obligation to tell the attorney general who was going to keep control over the data and why it was being recorded. \"By failing to tell Lord Goldsmith, Sir Ian has again acted unfairly and so in breach of the DPA,\" he said. A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it would investigate \"to find out if there are any data protection compliance issues\" if it received a complaint from either party. Stewart Room, the head of data protection at Rowe Cohen solicitors, said there were circumstances in which police could be exempt from the act for \"operational necessity\". However, Sir Ian's explanation that he had recorded the conversation because it dealt with complex issues and his note taker was unavailable \"would seem to fall way below the test\". Sir Ian's actions probably breached European human rights laws as well, Mr Room added. \"There is a right to privacy under article eight which covers communication. I would have imagined that the head of the Metropolitan police would be aware of how the convention on human rights would have applied in this.\" He said he was concerned that police still fail to recognise the importance of data protection laws despite a number of high-profile cases. In 1997, Alison Halford, a former assistant chief constable of Merseyside police and Britain's highest-ranking female officer, accused the police of tapping her phones and had her complaint upheld by the European court of human rights. The Soham murderer, Ian Huntley, was able to take up his job as a school caretaker because Humberside police had deleted sexual offence accusations against him, after misinterpreting data protection laws.",
