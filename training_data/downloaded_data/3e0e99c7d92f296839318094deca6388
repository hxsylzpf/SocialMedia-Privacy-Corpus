The paper ran allegations by Wallace's former boyfriend and father of her daughter, after a judge refused the actor a gag order after a two-hour telephone hearing. Partly she failed to get an injunction because she had put details of her private life, which flattered her, in the public domain. The case followed David and Victoria Beckham's failure a fortnight ago to stop their former nanny revealing details about their private life. Wallace was said by Mr Justice Andrew Smith to have forfeited her right to privacy. He said she sought publicity for herself, and he claimed that much of it was \"provocative\". Wallace's lawyers had sought the injunction on Saturday, and the paper only got the go ahead to publish at 7.30pm. Tom Crone, legal manager for the News of the World, said that while the two cases had similarities the Wallace case did not represent a sea-change in the law. \"If the person trying to get the injunction is prone to putting a version of their private lives in front of the public, and making commercial gain, they're going to get less protection than someone who does not do that.\" He said judges were now showing \"common sense\" over celebrities who choose to live in a \"goldfish bowl\" of celebrity. He added: \"In both cases the judges formed the view that for those who have volunteered a great deal of their private life to the public on a commercial basis it's a bit rich for them to say, when someone comes along to correct that view, that they are entitled to privacy.\"",
