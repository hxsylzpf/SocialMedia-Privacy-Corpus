  "content": "I love Dune. It was one of the first science fiction books I read on returning to the genre after putting aside my early-teen love for the likes of Douglas Hill and Diana Wynne Jones for few years. And I love Kyle MacLachlan for his turn as Paul Atreides in David Lynch's much ridiculed film version of Frank Herbert's novel. So I don't believe there's much better to see as I write than the emoji version of Herbert's tale that MacLachlan came up with when asked to explain the story on Twitter: There's a hand-box-dagger sequence, which I'm assuming is referring to one of my favourite scenes: \"From the folds of her gown, she lifted a green metal cube about 15cm one side. She turned it and Paul saw that one side was open \u2013 black and oddly frightening. No light penetrated that open blackness \u2026 Paul put his hand into the box. He first felt a sense of cold as the blackness closed around his hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as though his hand were asleep.\" Fantastic stuff. MacLachlan has also got the worms, the sand, the lack of water, a Fremen-ish type character, and a mouse, old Muad'Dib himself. It's a pretty good effort. Inspired, we asked on Twitter if you could write any other book plots in emojis \u2013 and of course you could. R042 gave us a good stab at Moby-Dick: And Luciano Vandyar's Grapes of Wrath is ... interesting. It's been a while, but I don't remember the panda. MacLachlan's outing certainly isn't the first venture into books-as-emojis - here's a host of them collected by Buzzfeed \u2013 with thanks to the author Maris Kreizman \u2013 and #emojireads has regular updates on Twitter. But I'm not sure MacLachlan's contribution can be beaten. As MobyLives says, it is, \"as they used to say on the internet, flawless\". If you think you can beat it, tweet us on @GuardianBooks.",
