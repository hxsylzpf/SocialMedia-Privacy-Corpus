  "content": "Prince Edward showed \"the most crass insensitivity\" in allowing his TV company, Ardent Productions, to film Prince William at St Andrews University, according to a top PR adviser. The prince must now choose between being part of the royal \"firm\" or leading his life as a private citizen, said the Burson-Marsteller chief, Deborah Saw. According the Ms Saw, the prince should change his PR advisers for someone of the calibre of Mark Bolland, the man who helped turn around Prince Charles's image. \"Prince Edward needs to decide if he is part of the royal firm or not. If he is, he should take on more royal responsibilities,\" Ms Saw said. \"If he is a private citizen, he should find another area - away from royalty - for his company to work on. Edward, it's time to choose. \"He needs to hire a credible person in the film industry to be the public face of his company while he becomes a sleeping partner. The prince needs to change his PR adviser - and soon.\" Ms Saw, whose company's clients include BT, BP and Johnson &amp;Johnson, continued: \"The Wessexes are showing poor judgment and could do with some dispassionate advice because it seems they have lost their perspective.\" She pointed out that Mr Bolland, Prince Charles's deputy private secretary, had been very successful in improving the prince's image since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. \"If you get the right advice, you can come back from what looks like an untenable situation,\" Ms Saw explained. \"This morning, Edward should have apologised because he was part of it [the decision to keep a TV crew in St Andrews]. If he did not know about it, why not? It's quite a small company. If this is the case, he needs a professional manager for his company. \"All the problems arise from Edward's dual position. This debacle shows the arguments about the professional lives of the young royals was not resolved after the R-JH affair,\" Ms Saw concluded. The fresh controversy could open yet another inquest into the royals' professional lives. It comes only months after an undercover News of the World reporter revealed Prince Edward's wife, Sophie Wessex, was using her position to benefit the clients of her PR company, R-JH.",
