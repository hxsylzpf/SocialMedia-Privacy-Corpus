  "content": "Of all the people one would expect to understand how Twitter works, the company's own chief financial officer is probably fairly high up the list. And yet Anthony Noto, Twitter's CFO, briefly lost his account after falling for a simple hack on Tuesday. At least, that's the assumed cause of him tweeting hundreds of followers with spammy links such as \"this pic of you is funny lol\" and \"I can't stop laughing!\" Shortly after the spammy links started flowing, Noto's account was suspended by the company. Twitter explained: \"His account was sending spam Tweets. We've locked down the account and deleted the tweets.\" It's not the first time Noto's fallen prey to elementary Twitter mistakes, either. In November 2014 he managed to leak details of apparent merger talks through a \"DM fail\" \u2013 accidentally sending as a public tweet a message meant as a private direct message. Noto tweeted: \"I still think we should buy them. He is on your schedule for Dec 15 or 16 \u2013 we will need to \u200bsell him. i have a plan.\" Observers were quick to point fingers at Mic News, a youth-focused news website, as the topic of his DM, appeared in part prompted by yet another Twitter indiscretion: he had followed both co-founders and two other editors shortly before sending the accidentally-public tweet. Whether or not the talks happened is unknown, but no merger occurred.",
