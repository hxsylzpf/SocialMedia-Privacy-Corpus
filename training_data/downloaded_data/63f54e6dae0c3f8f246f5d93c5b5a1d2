Telegraph Media Group apologised unreservedly for using the pixelated image, which was taken from the 15-year-old's Facebook page. The Crown Prosecution Service took action over a story and picture published by the Telegraph on 3 March, the day after the former Sunderland midfielder was convicted of child sexual activity. It is a criminal offence under the Sexual Offences Act to identify any alleged victim of a sexual offence unless that person has waived their right to lifelong anonymity. Westminster magistrates court heard that the Telegraph had only sold four copies of that edition of the paper in the area where Johnson's victim lived, but the court was told that the Telegraph Media Group accepted that the pixelated image was likely to identify her. Gavin Millar QC, for the publisher, said the newspapers would no longer use such pictures with reports of sex offence cases. The pixelated image was the same as that used by the Sun in March 2015 which led to the newspaper's then editor, David Dinsmore, having to pay \u00a32,300 in costs and compensation. The Telegraph Media Group, which admitted a charge under sections 1 (2) and 5 (1) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992, was fined \u00a380,000 and ordered to pay the teenager \u00a310,000 in compensation, as well as \u00a31,473 in prosecution costs and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120. The publisher said in a statement: \"As we made clear in court, we have apologised unreservedly to the victim for the distress she has been caused. The picture should not have been published and we have put in place robust procedures to ensure that such an error can never happen again.\" The \u00a35,000 limit on fines which magistrates could impose was lifted when relevant parts of section 85 of the Legal Aid, Punishment and Sentencing of Offenders Act 2012 were brought into effect from 12 March 2015 after the Sun's publication. The maximum fine the Sun could have faced was \u00a35,000, but the Telegraph Media Group faced a court which had power to fine it an unlimited amount. In the case of the Sun, the image of Johnson and the girl was cut out from the original photo on Facebook and put on to a white background before photoshopping and airbrushing were used to leave the girl with a blank face. The Sun team then took a photograph of the Irish president, Michael Higgins, at a tree-planting ceremony in a Dublin park and used Photoshop to remove all of the people so the remainder could be used as the background in the picture of Johnson and the girl. The Sun's article also included a warning that anyone who identified the child online would face prosecution and referred to a case in which people were convicted of identifying a sexual offence victim on social media. The teenage victim told Johnson's trial that she had suffered a huge backlash after she was identified online as the complainant. She told the court: \"The gossip on social media and hearing all of the horrible names that people have been calling me has been devastating to me, my friends and my family. People were lying about me and what I had said.\"",
