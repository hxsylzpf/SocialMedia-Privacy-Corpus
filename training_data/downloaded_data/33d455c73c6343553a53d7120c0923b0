  "content": "Longer than Harry Potter, shorter than Proust, denser than Tolstoy. Brian Leveson's report thumped into the world at just under 2,000 pages and just over a million words. What the Leveson report lacked in literary elegance, it made up for in detail and clarity. It is, it should be said straight away, an immensely seriously argued and comprehensive document. The prime minister, who commissioned it and who has had very little time in which to study it, should think carefully before dismissing significant parts of it. The press should treat it with respect \u2013 and not a little humility. In the past few weeks there have been many column inches devoted to arguing that the press is a noble and independent estate motivated by truth-telling, holding power to account and serving the public interest. Some of that is true. But Leveson paints a very different picture of another reality. He doesn't tar all journalists with the same brush, but nor does he accept that there was one rogue reporter, or even one rogue newspaper group. He describes a widespread indifference to ethical concerns, professional standards, or the effects of intrusion, whether criminal or legal. The cumulative picture \u2013 from phone-hacking through to the \"industrial\" use of private detectives, with no legitimate case by numerous titles \u2013 is darker than anyone can have suspected at the start of the inquiry. There will be many in the press who disagree with the judge's conclusions, but no journalist should fool themselves. The fact that the industry is now threatened with statutory controls is no one else's fault. Leveson is merciless in exposing the feebleness of the Press Complaints Commission, which virtually all journalists once saluted as feared, robust and independent, but which, nearly everyone now agrees, was no such thing. It lacked any meaningful independence, powers or sanctions. It was, bluntly, not a regulator. As Nick Clegg noted in a cool and crisp statement, the voices shouting most loudly about political influence over the press seemed quite unconcerned that three out of the PCC's five chairmen have been Conservative peers. Two of those peers \u2013 Lords Hunt and Black \u2013 did their best to stitch together a reformed version of the PCC which was a considerable improvement on its predecessor \u2013 having teeth, a concern for professional standards, the ability to investigate and the power to levy fines. But in his press statement Lord Justice Leveson said the Hunt-Black proposals \"did not come close\" to his idea of a truly independent regulator. It was, he said, neither stable nor durable \u2013 and he rejected outright the plan to have an industry funding body with the power to pull strings through nominations, appointments and rotations. He was quite right to do so. Some advance billing suggested that the judge would instead propose a system of statutory regulation little different from that which exists in Zimbabwe or Kazakhstan. In the event, he put forward something he described as independent regulation, organised by the press itself, with a statutory underpinning and verification. It would be voluntary \u2013 but participation would be incentivised by the carrot and stick of belonging to an arbitral system that would give significant cost and damages advantages in libel or privacy actions. In order to cement these legal benefits, Leveson advocated some statutory underpinning. He also wanted the media regulator Ofcom to be involved in three possible roles: to certify the new regulator complied with the Leveson criteria; to audit it on an ongoing basis; and as an alternative regulator to any refuseniks who declined to join the system. There are many good things about Leveson's ideas. The new regulator would be tough, independent and durable. It ought to answer many of the concerns of the victims of intrusions, whose voice should never be forgotten during the coming debate. News papers \u2013 which have complained for years about the iniquities and cost of the law \u2013 ought to welcome a more flexible, quicker and cheaper alternative. As we have argued consistently, this is a real prize worth having, even if it needs statute to achieve it and to make it stick. The processes of appointment and governance he outlines are fairer, more open and more transparent than the old PCC club. Publishers \u2013 including digital players \u2013 would have compelling reasons to want to be inside the tent. Anyone outside the tent could be regulated by Ofcom. But a 2,000-page report is bound to provoke questions. Is Ofcom really the right body to be involved in all, or any, of these roles? Can any system be both voluntary and still have compulsion? While statutory underpinning may be necessary to achieve the carrots and sticks needed to make the system work, there are reasons to be nervous about what's in the proposed statute. First, setting out statutory criteria by which Ofcom or another certifying body would assess the regulator could have unintended consequences. Ofcom's view of what constitutes an appropriate code of standards, for example, might allow for mission creep. The statute would have to stay at a high level and prevent Ofcom taking artistic licence. Second, if Leveson's doomsday scenario comes true and major publishers choose to stay out of any self-regulatory body, he recommends that Ofcom becomes the direct backstop regulator for that publisher. More worrying still, he indicates that this would extend to any organisation of significant size and impact which is in \"press-like services\". Not only does this lean towards a form of licensing, it will worry large digital providers like Google and Yahoo, not to mention online news providers. Instead of having the carrot to join, they could now be required to. Clearly, therefore, the drafting of the Leveson statute requires great care, real deliberation and cross-party support to avoid endless amendments and additions that move it from light touch to something more sinister. And cross-party support does not look a rock-solid prospect after today's events. The prime minister has surprised many, especially the victims, with his multi-levelled concerns about statute. It is not clear if this is a position of principle, or to win friends on the Tory benches and in Fleet Street. Clegg has recoiled from this, although he has wisely noted that if Conservative fears relate to the pre-eminence here of their old enemy, Ofcom, Leveson allows for someone other than Ofcom to play the certifying role. Ed Miliband has found himself again in the role of champion of the victims against the vested interests of the press. And without any Leveson criticism of the prime minister over excessive cosiness to News International, Miliband may open up a real dividing line with the Tories on press regulation, an issue he may have otherwise wanted consensus around. The odds are that the prime minister will try to find common ground with his opposite numbers, certainly given the possibility of parliamentary arithmetic being against him. Miliband has taken a principled position, for which most newspapers will attack him, not credit him. Similarly, Nick Clegg has chosen this moment to put his own beliefs ahead of coalition harmony. Leveson has set a testing challenge for politics, but he has also set a challenge for the press. His report is argued with such detail and formidable force that it will not be enough, in the coming weeks, to erect straw men, or to mount personalised attacks on the perceived enemies of press freedom. Leveson's arguments will not be answered by threats or lobbying. His recommendations require cool analysis and a collective response from an industry which is not used to speaking with a unified voice. While Lords Hunt and Black have done useful work in trying to draw up a reformed version of the discredited PCC, it is not clear that they are now the right people to be trying to build a consensus among a diverse group of editors, publishers and proprietors. Their past efforts confusingly married consultation with lobbying and they badly misjudged what would be acceptable, either to the inquiry or to Westminster. The press urgently needs to find a substantial figure above the immediate fray who can approach Leveson's proposals with something like an objective eye and who can make convincing responses on merit. Nothing else, at this late hour, will command respect from the party leaders, who have embarked on a cross-party endeavour to avoid a damaging clash between politics and press. Leveson was the seventh occasion in as many decades that an inquiry has been commissioned into the behaviour of the press. It's time to get it right.",
