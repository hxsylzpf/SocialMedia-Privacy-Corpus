  "content": "I didn't write, or have a hand in, today's Guardian editorial, Be careful what you wish for. But it echoes all that I've been writing and broadcasting in the past couple of weeks. It explains, yet again, that the gagging orders against which the tabloid press is mounting an increasingly hysterical campaign are not superinjunctions. It reiterates that judges are making their decisions very properly by balancing a respect for privacy with the right to free expression. Most importantly, it underlines the fact that the privacy clause in the editors' code of practice (one error - it isn't the Press Complaints Commission's code) is virtually identical to the wording in the human rights act. It also points to the absurdity of urging the government to regulate Twitter. In conclusion, while urging that we pay more attention to libel reform than injunctions, it says: \"If the press would rather people used self-regulation than the courts then it has to make sure that the PCC is a credible regulator.\" But, as I'll be exploring in an interview in Monday's Media Guardian, editors already know that because there is a great deal of below-the-line, behind-the-scenes work pioneered by the self-regulation system.",
