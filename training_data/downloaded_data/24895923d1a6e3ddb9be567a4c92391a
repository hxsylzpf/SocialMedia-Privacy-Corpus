  "content": "Now that Serial has ended, on the subreddit devoted to the show there is something of the feeling of the last day at a summer camp. People are congratulating the moderators, making Serial-based in-jokes about \"Mail Kimp\", a mispronounciation from the advertisement at the beginning of the show. Some are saying their goodbyes. Others are sharing the creative projects the show has engendered among them. Some have remixed the podcast's theme music \u2013 one with Biggie Smalls, another with the \"Mail \u2026 Kimp?\" mispronunciation. The show ended with a shrug rather than a bang, and for some members of the online community it spawned \u2013 almost 30,000 amateur sleuths, avid fans and true-crime enthusiasts \u2013 the story is over, at least until next season. \"I've seen a few users saying: 'goodbye, thanks, nice talking to y'all',\" says Jake White, a Queens resident who is one of the moderators of the subreddit, though he adds that for many others the community is now a permanent part of their lives. \"I'm sure the reader numbers will taper off,\" he said, \"but I still expect an active and vigorous core to remain.\" One user, a thirtysomething filmmaker from Los Angeles who was one of the early members of the community, thinks this will be a good thing. \"I'm looking forward to the 25,000 johnny-come-latelys melting away and the discussions returning to the smart and detailed posts we had before,\" the user, who goes by the name of Thousandshipz, tells me. Many seemed disappointed by the lack of a categorical answer in the case. For others, it highlighted the central philosophical problem with the form. \"I get the sense that there is a group of listeners out there who approached the show like a murder mystery, like a nice diversion until True Detective season two airs,\" said another user, whose username was CopaceticOctopus. \"They took each episode not as a real-life unfolding story, but as a set of clues, hoping each week to solve the case at home. These listeners were always destined for disappointment.\" But, Thousandshipz said: \"there has always been a conflict on this subreddit between those of us who wanted to pursue the case quasi-independently and those who didn't want to 'spoil' Koenig's narrative.\" Some were bothered about the ethical issues involved in this conflict. \"I think most journalists finish their research before broadcasting for a reason,\" said one user, Klute72. \"Choosing to start the show while still investigating opened the gates for everyone and their grandmother to start speculating and playing amateur detective. Of course, this was the main appeal of the show. But it was kind of eerie to watch how at some point everybody was a suspect: Jenn, Don, even Stephanie. And their full names and links to their Facebook pages have been posted all over the internet.\" For some, the ambivalent ending will allow them to continue to try to solve the puzzle of the case. One user has even started an Indiegogo campaign for a crowdsourced crime-solving app \u2013 though its legitimacy has been questioned. White, the moderator, tells me that by no means were all of the subreddit members sleuthing. Many were just looking for a community. \"There's all sorts of people,\" said White. \"We have hundreds of thousands of readers and tens of thousands of contributors. Sure, you're going to get people in their mom's basement who think they're going to solve this murder.\" He said he was doubtful they could succeed where Koenig failed. \"But there'll be people poking around,\" he added. \"And, of course, I'm interested to see news reports on Adnan's appeal.\" White also said he'd seen users expressing doubts about the ethics of the format, the blend of journalism and entertainment. \"I think people were feeling ethically uneasy \u2013 and I think the natural reaction was to do something positive,\" White said. One user, Pamela Mauerhan, who joined Reddit specifically to become part of the Serial community, came up with the idea of creating a scholarship fund at Woodlawn High School, the school featured in the podcast. Mauerhan contacted the school and spoke to one of the guidance counsellors. She was \"ecstatic\", Mauerhan said. Like everyone else in the community, Mauerhan has her own theory about the case. \"Sadly, I think Adnan might have done it,\" she tells me, though she adds: \"I wish, I really wish he was innocent, and I don't think it was premeditated.\" Many users are already looking toward the next season. The general consensus is that a fictional story \u2013 a rumour one of them had heard \u2013 would be a bad choice. \"The best idea I've heard,\" says CopaceticOctopus, \"is an investigation into corporate malfeasance, such as fraud in the financial sector, or a company mistreating their employees. \"That being said, season two could be a 12-part investigation into paint drying in Sarah's newly re-modeled bathroom, and I would still tune in.\" Then, in an imitation of Koenig's style, CopaceticOctopus added: \"What, truly, is the nature of dryness?\"",
