  "content": "The group behind LulzSec has never made its intentions clear \u2013 apart from a website which proclaims that \"we have now taken it upon ourselves to spread fun, fun, fun, throughout the entire calender [sic] year.\" However Tal Be'ery, lead web researcher at Imperva, has put together a profile of LulzSec based on their own work, plus some information that is publicly available. \u2022 LulzSec seems to be a spin-off of a group of hackers from the \"Anonymous\" organisation. \u2022 They hacked HBgary and Gawker under the umbrella of the Anonymous group, but then decided to create their own \"gig\". Why? Probably to be independent. \u2022 The supporting evidence for that is that the same nicks [nicknames] are used on both anonymous hacking-related discussions (early 2011) and LulzSec (mid 2011). \u2022 They communicate mainly via private IRC channels \u2013 and publish via Twitter and Pastebin. \u2022 They mostly use web application vulnerabilities: they used SQL injection to hack PBS and (one of) the Sony hacks (against Sony Pictures). \u2022 They also use automated tools to harvest databases, called Havij, as we can see from the leaked PBS hack screenshots. The group is small \u2013 less than 10 or so. (This is confirmed separately by security researcher Rik Ferguson of Trend Micro, who comments that \"it seems to be a tight-knit group \u2013 it only needs to be a few people, since all they need is a Twitter account and a web page. There's no evidence that they're a particularly sophisticated group.) The members, according to Imperva: \u2022 \"Sabu\" \u2013 HBgary hacker. Seems to be the leader. \u2022 \"Nakomis\" \u2013 Coder, rumoured to be one of coders of the PHPBB bulletin board. \u2022 \"Topiary\" \u2013 handles finance, such as donations and payment for services (eg botnets) \u2022 \"Tflow\" \u2013 Hacker. (Rumoured.) \u2022 \"Kayla\" \u2013 Hacker. Owns a big botnet. \u2022 \"Joepie91\" \u2013 Website admin. \u2022 \"Avunit\" - No more detail. From hacker discussion forums, it seems they might get arrested as soon as many \"real world\" details on their identities get revealed, suggests Tal Be'ery.",
