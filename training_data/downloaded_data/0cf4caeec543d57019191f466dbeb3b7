  "content": "The Guardian sent a number of questions to the Turkish hacker group, Turkguvenligi, who carried out the domain name server hack that affected the Telegraph, UPS, Betfair, The Register and a number of other high-profile sites. Here are those questions, and the group's responses: Q. Who did you hack? Netnames.co.uk or Ascio? Or both? It's unclear. A. In fact both of them in addition with some other ones. Q. Was this planned for a long time, or did you just find a weakness by chance? A. We usually choose some big targets and find a way to access them. sometimes it takes months. but harder makes it funnier ;) .[It was] not by chance because we are expert of all kinds of web vulnerability holes. Q Why target them? A. we target big domains. which company owns them differs. Q Did you also do the South Korea hack at zdnet.com A. Yep. in fact we attacked there in the past but forgot some domains to hack :D so reowned it [hacked it again]. you can check other korean domain mirrors here : zone-h.org Q. If so, what's so special about DNS hacking? Is it that it goes wider, or is it easier than hacking lots of sites, or ..? A. First we target site itself. if we can't find a vuln [vulnerability]. on the script of site we try accessing server or vps [virtual private server]. If none of them works we try domain company. The hardest one is reaching the domain company but if you can succeed there will be a treasure for you :D",
