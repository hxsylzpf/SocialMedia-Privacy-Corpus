  "content": "The post Compared to email and phone calls, letters sent through a post-box are souls of discretion. They are a rare example of technology improving privacy: post used to be marked by town, but now normally bears the name of one of just 73 hi-tech mail processing centres. At busy times the Post Office moves mail around the country for sorting - last Christmas, it processed mail from south-east England in Scotland. And, of course, you can post a letter from wherever you wish. The result is that the location of the sender suggested by the post mark is vague, and may be untrue. In the UK, there is no requirement for a return address - and even in countries where there is, this can be fictional. Pre-pay mobiles A mobile phone provides a stream of data, stored by your network for months or years. This can be undermined through an unregistered pre-paid phone. Networks encourage buyers to register themselves, but do not require it. It takes some effort to maintain this status. If the unregistered number communicates with monitored numbers, it can become monitored too. If it is used for a crime, its location data could be used to find the user's home and the shop they bought it from. Registered mobiles Orange appears to keep billing and location data for the shortest period. As of this spring, it kept this data for just six months, although several communications providers have lengthened their retention periods recently in response to anti-terrorism legislation. Other networks keep this data for at least a year, with Virgin Mobile planning to retain it for up to seven years. Anonymous email Any email you send - even through a webmail service such as Hotmail or Another.com - includes your Internet Protocol address. This can be used to trace your organisation or internet service provider (try the \"look up IP address\" on www.whois.co.uk), and they can then trace you. To remove the sender's IP address completely, the best option is a \"Mixmaster\" remailer service. These take a group of emails, strip away the data showing where they came from, shuffle them electronically send them to at least one more remailer to do it again. (See www.gilc.org/speech/anonymous/remailer.html.) But be aware that emails can take hours to get through, and may not arrive at all. Secure contents email The traffic data in email is very easy to read. If you don't mind that, but want to secure the contents, encryption is the answer. Strong encryption is available free at www.pgpi.org, and works with many kinds of email software. This provides you with a \"public key\" that you can send to associates. However, the strength of public key encryption is that only you have the private key for encoding emails, and it is virtually impossible to derive the private key from the public one. A free webmail alternative is provided at www.hushmail.com. You must remember your pass-phrase, which acts as a key - the Irish firm that provides the service has no way of recovering it, or of seeing your emails. Private web-viewing A web-server, the computer that provides a website's pages, logs the internet protocol address of the computer requesting the page. There are services that can act as a proxy for your requests, such as those at www.anonymiser.com, including a free trial. \u00b7 Additional reporting by Richard Clayton of the Foundation for Information Policy Research.",
