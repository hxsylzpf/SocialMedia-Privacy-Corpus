  "content": "Ministers are to publish all spending on government credit cards in order to expose profligacy and waste as part of new plans to reveal swaths of government data showing low-performing schools, GP services and transport services. The Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude will announce plans on Thursday to publish millions of new data items, from prescription rates at specific GP surgeries to how well individual schools are teaching low and high-attaining pupils. It will allow patients to shop around for the surgery most likely to prescribe an expensive drug, or parents to find out which school is best for high achievers or pupils with special educational needs. Ministers want this information about public services to drive competition as people become more informed \"consumers\" of government-funded services. The publication of the data comes after last year's spending was released under the Freedom of Information Act, revealing \u00a325m of previously secret spending by Whitehall officials in the year that the government implemented its deficit reduction programme. David Cameron has written to ministers setting out the plans. \"We recognise that open data and transparency can be a powerful tool to help reform public services, foster innovation, empower citizens ... we also understand that transparency can be a significant driver of economic activity,\" he said. \"These commitments represent the most ambitious open data agenda of any government in the world.\" Maude said: \"Information enables choice \u2013 which creates competition which drives up standards. The new commitments represent a quantum leap in government transparency and will radically help to drive better public services. \"Having this data available will help people find the right doctor for their needs or the best teacher for their child and will help frontline professionals compare their performance and effectiveness and improve it.\" The new datasets will include: \u2022 In the NHS, clinical outcomes for every GP practice in England using measures including cancer survival rates, diabetes and dementia treatments. Data on prescriptions by GP, which will help patients argue for a particular drug if they can show it is regularly prescribed elsewhere. Complaints rates and subjects for every GP. \u2022 More \"intelligent\" data on school results enabling parents to see precisely how well children from low, middle and high attainment groups achieve. Data on attainment of pupils who qualify a school for additional \"pupil premium\" funding to see how well it is being spent. \u2022 Sentencing data by court including age, gender and ethnicity of those sentenced and the sentence given, in order to identify any courts that are wildly varying form the norm and equalise sentencing across the country. \u2022 In transport real time data on road traffic incidents will be published, weekly rail timetables and increased data on service performance and complaints. Government procurement cards are held by 140,000 Whitehall officials who ran up a \u00a325m bill last year. Bills released to the Daily Telegraph under the FOI Act included apparently profligate spending such as a \u00a3370,000 bill for restaurants and takeaways, \u00a33m on foreign travel and \u00a3117,000 for leisure activities including theatre tickets, golfing trips and football matches. The new publication, from September, of those bills will only be for items above \u00a3500 \u2013 meaning they are unlikely to include some of the more controversial items of restaurant and hotel bills or gifts and flowers for staff.",
