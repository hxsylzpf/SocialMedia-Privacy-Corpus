  "content": "Social media gives readers unprecedented access to Guardian stories, but few platforms combine photography, news and conversation like Instagram.  In January, Guardian journalists began hosting the Guardiannews Instagram account while on assignment. So far, they've gone behind the scenes at the White House, documented the clean water crisis in West Virginia and released our documentary on Syrian refugees. Occasionally, they've even 'selfied' in the name of journalism.  With the #GuardianCam hashtag, reporters give Guardian readers access to the story as it happens, wherever it happens. So be sure to let us know what you'd like to see in the photo comments on Instagram \u2013 we'll be watching.  During this project's launch week, Guardian journalists will be updating Instagram from the following events:  US president Barack Obama's state of the union address The Guardian Cities launch NFL Super Bowl: San Francisco 49ers v Seattle Seahawks  View the latest from the #GuardianCam feed below  Viewing in mobile?
