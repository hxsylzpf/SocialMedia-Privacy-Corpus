  "content": "The media lawyer who represented Amanda Holden and Les Dennis in their landmark case against Express Newspapers has warned yesterday's judgment against Naomi Campbell leaves the way open for celebrities to sue the media under the Human Rights Act. Peter Crawford, who helped Holden and Dennis win a record \u00a340,000 settlement after the Daily Star published photographs of them on holiday taken without their knowledge, said the judgment would not deter other celebrities from suing because Ms Campbell's case had been relatively weak. Pictures of Holden and Dennis at a private villa in Tuscany appeared on the front and centre pages of the Star last June. The couple immediately won an injunction preventing a second set of pictures, taken by a freelance photographer, being published. They later sued the paper for breach of privacy under the Human Rights Act. \"Naomi Campbell's case was never seen to be that strong but today's judgment is significant in that it leaves the door open to a freestanding right to complain about breach of privacy,\" said Mr Crawford. \"Until now newspapers have tended to settle privacy cases out of court but I am sure one will get to court soon. The case of Amanda Holden and Les Dennis was a clear breach of privacy.\" Mr Crawford said Ms Campbell's concession that she did not mind the Daily Mirror revealing she was a drug addict, only the details of her Narcotics Anonymous treatment, meant the case had been decided on very narrow grounds. The Mirror won its appeal because the court considered the revelation of her treatment to be relatively insignificant. \"It is not obvious to us that the peripheral disclosure of Miss Campbell's attendance at Narcotics Anonymous was, in its context, of sufficient significance to shock the conscience and justify the intervention of the court,\" the appeal court judge, Lord Phillips, said yesterday. Mark Stephens, a media lawyer for Finer Stephens Innocent, welcomed the judgment saying it reinforced the media's role as a watchdog. \"This is to be welcomed and embraced as a cautious judicial step towards greater flexibility and a further step to a public figure defence,\" said Mr Stephens. \"It is clear that when you have public figures who are then exposed as liars the media has a right in its role as a watchdog to allow the public to know the truth.\" Although the appeal court threw out the model's complaints against the Mirror - arguing it was in the public interest to reveal her attendance at Narcotics Anonymous - the judge went out of his way to emphasise public figures had a right to privacy. \"We do not see why it should necessarily be in the public interest that an individual who has been adopted as a role model, without seeking this distinction, should be demonstrated to have feet of clay,\" Lord Phillips said.",
