  "content": "They may have a three-letter noun in common but Unilad chief executive Liam Harrington rejects any comparison to the lads' mags that dominated 1990s newsstands. \"We are absolutely not a lads' mag,\" he says. \"Sites like ours are social enterprises that are catering to everyone, as opposed to the lads' mags, which were catering to the niches.\" With 11.5m likes on Facebook \u2013 which Harrington says are split roughly 35:65 female to male \u2013 Unilad is not a niche product. In comparison, the Guardian's Facebook page has 5.2m fans and Mail Online's 3.4m. The brand regularly features in the top 10 Facebook video publisher lists from analytics firm Newswhip and its most successful video \u2013 of a man playing a game called Pie Face with his small son \u2013 has been viewed almost 183m times. They are numbers to make traditional media organisations weep. At the age of 24, Harrington hasn't had a great deal of management experience (despite his company's name, he hasn't been to university either). Prior to founding Unilad he was working in health recruitment and selling T-shirts out of his dad's garage. He tried and failed at a handful of digital projects, including a student-focused fashion brand, a New Year's resolution checker and a network of university TV stations. It wasn't until he and friend Sam Bentley hit on the idea of reviving an existing brand with a digital footprint that things took off, but their decision to choose Unilad presented some problems. The name was first used in 2010 by student Alex Partridge for a site called Unilad.com, which became infamous for misogynist content with titles such as \"How to pull a fresher\" and \"Lies to get you laid\" that seemed to sum up the worst of lad culture. It was closed in 2012 following extensive negative coverage from newspapers including the Guardian, centred on articles accused of promoting sexual violence, though it limped on through 2013 in various guises and kept gaining fans on Facebook. Harrington, usually enthusiastic and articulate, gets visibly uncomfortable when it's brought up. He insists that there is \"no shared association at all\" between the original brand and his version launched in April 2014, which uses the site address Unilad.co.uk. \"It's something we've had to deal with, there was a blog around beforehand that wasn't of the best quality, we had a lot to do with tidying up,\" he says. So why choose a name with such negative associations? \"It still had the attraction. A lot of people who knew about it, and if a lot of people knew about it, there's obviously something about it.\" A big part of that something was the more than 300,000 fans its Facebook page had accrued by the time Harrington got involved. He won't say how they came to take over the Facebook page and there are rumours of a legal tussle with Partridge. Unilad claims there was no copyright to violate on the brand and, when asked if it is involved in legal action, says only that \"we don't comment on legal matters generally\". Whatever the associations, that notorious Facebook page was the foundation for the new Unilad, and once an employee put them in touch with someone at Facebook who verified it (in return for an appearance on a Rap Battle YouTube channel) things began to take off. \"As soon as we were verified \u2013 I don't know the reason why it happened \u2013 all our old content was being regurgitated on to the timelines of people.\" At this point much of the content they were posting was still very \"lad\" heavy, such as January 2015's \"5 On 5 Fighting Is Back And It's F*cking Brutal\", but a long way from its earlier nastier incarnation. It wasn't until Unilad posted about an anti-domestic violence ad by the Salvation Army last March, which used The Dress meme, that Harrington says he realised more serious topics could still be a hit on social media. \"It ended up being our most shared article ever. It took off and I was just dumbfounded. I thought 'This is it, we can now change the way we write our content, we can change the type of content we go for because people will listen'. We were very proud of that, I am very proud of that.\" The Damascene conversion hasn't done Harrington or Unilad any harm. Though its most obvious competitor, TheLadBible (which was also based on a brand set up by Partridge) has a headstart, particularly on other platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat, Unilad's 11.5m Facebook likes put it just ahead of TheLadBible's 11.1m in its core territory. It claims to have moved beyond the original Unilad's rump of university-aged males to reach a diverse audience of 16- to 30-year-olds, and Harrington claims women are more likely to share and like Unilad posts than men. Unilad, which has always been self-funded, is trying to build out an advertising operation, though it remains well behind TheLadBible in terms of sophistication and personnel. It charges \u00a312 for a standard display ad on its own site and \u00a320,000 for a branded video which will also run on its social channels, four times as much as the same video posted just to Unilad.co.uk. One of their most recent ads \u2013 a stunt for the Robert De Niro film Dirty Grandpa involving an elderly busker singing a rap song on Carnaby Street \u2013 not only delivered more than 2.8m views on Unilad's Facebook page, but was also picked up by the national press and social media. \"Everyone knew it was going to get picked up,\" says Harrington. \"When you stick an old man in front of a telephone box rapping to Stormzy, you aren't going to be the only ones filming. \"As soon as you see the first video go up you get in touch and make sure they are crediting the right person, make sure they are pushing it in the right direction.\" Harrington concedes it's very early days for Unilad's commercial development. Some of the campaigns sail close to the wind, not always making it completely clear someone has paid, something Harrington insists they will be more careful about after recently hiring an advertising manager from the national press (significantly bumping up the company's average age in the process). The branded content is created by the same team of young multiskilled video-makers (Harrington calls them \"Predeators\" to stand for producers, directors and editors) who are also producing professional quality video for the site that he hopes will help push Unilad further into more worthy issues. Recent video projects include films on homelessness and a report from migrant camps in Calais, and they have worked with Bite the Ballot to film students visiting parliament to discuss education. \"It's quite easy to license a funny video and upload it, but it's a lot harder to go out and create something,\" says Harrington. There's lighter original content too - during the interview the video team are editing footage shot hours earlier at a morning rave, the kind where drug cocktails are replaced by fruit smoothies and you're as likely to find someone wearing a suit as fairy wings. It's clear the site - and Harrington himself - are seeking respectability, much in the same way BuzzFeed has moved from cats into investigative journalism. But can it really escape the Unilad name and its legacy? Kelley Temple, who was National Union of Students women's officer between 2012 and 2014, doubts it's possible to \"detoxify\" the brand while the culture it takes its name from is still going strong. \"Only once lad culture and its sexist hypermasculinity is no longer condoned and prevalent in campus culture, do I think that branding associated with it will be less tarnished,\" she says. However, Harrington believes that \"the way social works\" means the name is no barrier. \"If you go through your newsfeed, you go through Facebook, you don't look at the name before you like something. You just like the content that is in front of you.\"",
