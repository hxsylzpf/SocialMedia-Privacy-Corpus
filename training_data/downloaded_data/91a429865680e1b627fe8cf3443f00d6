The reality is nobody on Facebook really pays much attention to the advertising around the edges of the page: their eyes focus elsewhere. We will eventually all get bored of logging on as Facebook pales into yesterday's fad. The real suckers may turn out to be the venture capitalists who have paid over the odds for shares in Facebook and the multinational companies which pay millions of dollars to advertise on its pages. Here's hoping.
