  "content": "A health authority which has so far failed to warn patients of a former healthcare worker infected with the Aids virus that they could be at risk, began an appeal court battle yesterday to stop a Sunday newspaper naming it. The authority and the health professional, who has stopped working, argue that his right to privacy under the Human Rights Act would be breached if the Mail on Sunday named the authority because it would almost certainly lead to his identification. In its written argument for the appeal, the authority maintained that naming it would lead to \"public panic and alarm, perhaps on an unprecedented scale\". The worker is taking the authority to court to stop it notifying NHS and private patients treated by him that he is HIV positive. Philip Havers QC, for the authority, told the court no decision had yet been taken by the authority on whether patients would be told. The paper has agreed not to name the man, but it appealed against a ban imposed in November on identifying the authority. A high court judge lifted the ban though he upheld bans on identifying the worker's specialty and the date of his diagnosis. The man appealed against the decision to allow the authority to be named. The ban remains in place pending the outcome of the appeal. The Mail on Sunday argued that the public interest justified identification of the authority, which has not yet set up a \"lookback\" exercise to track down and warn patients who may be at risk. If, as seemed likely, the exercise went ahead, he would almost inevitably be identified in any event, the paper contended. The man has handed over most of the details of his NHS patients, but claims the rules of confidentiality prevent him from releasing the records of his private patients without a court order. The hearing continues.",
