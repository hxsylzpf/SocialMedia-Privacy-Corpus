  "content": "Social networking sites MySpace, Facebook, YouTube, Yahoo and Bebo exclude disabled users, according to AbilityNet, a charity bringing the benefits of computer technology to people with disabilities. In its State of the eNation report, it accuses those sites of \"locking out\" disabled visitors - for instance, by using Captcha visual verification code images to log in. Many users with disabilities are unable to use Captcha because of compatibility issues with, for instance, screen reading software used by blind visitors. \"With a disabled population of some 10 million potential users, these sites are inadvertently imposing a 'technological lock-out' on those who have most to gain from social networking - arguably, the most socially excluded members of the community,\" says Kath Moonan, AbilityNet's senior accessibility and usability consultant, and author of the survey. AbilityNet argues that, under the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act, website providers have to make \"reasonable adjustment\" for people with special needs. According to a spokesperson for Google, which runs YouTube, the firm has \"led the way in making web search more friendly to visually impaired users, and has developed ways to make tools like Google Book Search and Googlemail more accessible\". But the spokesperson admits that \"there's much more to do\". AbilityNet's next eNation reports will focus on sites offering music downloads. \u00b7 abilitynet.org.uk/web",
