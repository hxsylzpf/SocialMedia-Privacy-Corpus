  "content": "Facebook has defended the safety measures it employs to protect users from sexual exploitation and continued to resist calls to include a \"panic button\" on its website. The social networking website is today understood to be considering options including taking legal action against the Daily Mail, after the paper wrongly claimed in a piece published on Wednesday that 14-year-old girls who create a Facebook profile could be approached \"within seconds\" by older men who \"wanted to perform a sex act\" in front of them. Despite the fact that the Daily Mail has admitted the story was false Richard Allan, the former MP who heads Facebook's European public policy operation, last night moved to reassure the public that the social networking website is safe in an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"What we are really keen to do is to ensure that our users, the parents, the children, have a really good understanding of how to keep themselves safe online,\" he said. Yesterday senior police officers and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) accused Facebook of ignoring claims that it is providing a safe haven for predatory paedophiles by refusing to sign up to a \"panic button\" for children and young people. Facebook has refused requests by Ceop to put a panic button on the website. Rival social networking services including Bebo and MSN Messenger have the feature, which links users directly to Ceop to report suspected activity by predatory paedophiles. \"We simply believe we have some very effective reporting mechanisms already on the site,\" said Allan. \"They are very simple and well understood by our users and what they allow us to do is have really good real-time intelligence about the kind of activities taking place on the site. And when there are issues of concern we have a very strong team of technology experts who are then able to intervene and try and stop things happening before they become dangerous.\" Allan admitted that Facebook's system \"can never be 100% effective\" but said he believed that the social networking website has \"one of the safest environments out there on the internet\". \"We would hope people would look at the different services they can use and then judge whether or not they are taking reasonable efforts [to protect users],\" he added. \"Facebook will remove any reported photos of nudity or pornography from our site. That is not the case everywhere.\" Internet Watch Foundation, which polices child sexual abuse content online, said that Facebook joined its initiative last month. IWF already has members including Microsoft, MySpace and Bebo. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
