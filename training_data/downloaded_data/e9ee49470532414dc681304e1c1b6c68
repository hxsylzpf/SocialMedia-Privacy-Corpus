  "content": "A UK counter extremism organisation has launched a YouTube video focusing on the Muslim community in an attempt to fight back against the social media recruitment tactics employed by terror group Isis. London-based Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism thinktank co-founded by Maajid Nawaz, has launched the video targeting those who may be seeking out online call-to-arms messages from Isis and could be vulnerable to radicalisation. The latest video ad, developed by London agency Verbalisation, forms part of the Quilliam Foundation's #notanotherbrother campaign which aims to provide a counter-narrative describing the human cost of radicalisation and exposure to Islamist extremism. \"[Isis] are radicalising our brothers to fight in Syria,\" runs a statement accompanying the YouTube video. \"They are tearing families apart. Enough is enough. Sharing this film will show [Isis] that their extremist views have no place in our community. No family should lose another loved one to such hatred. Not another child. Not another sister. #NotAnotherBrother.\" The video was developed following a four-month research project produced by Verbalisation's team of psychologists, military experts and linguists. The YouTube ad was financed by crowd-funding from 150 donors from 10 countries. The launch of the campaign follows a call to arms against Isis's social media tactics by two of Google's top executives, legal chief David Drummond and policy director Victoria Grand, at the Cannes Lions advertising festival. The duo launched an attack, and an appeal, against terrorist propaganda on Google-owned YouTube calling for more opposition messages.",
