  "content": "After a neighbour had a break-in, taking a look at the security of my home seemed an appropriate step. Some form of CCTV was attractive, as I wanted to use my PC as the centre of a security system. Ease of use, fast set-up and wireless connectivity were also high on my list of ideal features.Better known for its vast array of keyboards and mice, Logitech now has a range of security devices based around CCTV. The Logitech Indoor Video Security Master System includes a surveillance camera that connects wirelessly to your PC. Once it's set up, you can monitor live video footage within the camera's field of vision, record events to your PC, receive email or SMS message updates from the camera and even access your recordings over the internet. The entire security system is based on HomePlug technology, which uses the electrical circuits in your home to transmit the video images from the cameras you have set up. The camera connects to the wireless transmitter via an Ethernet cable that plugs into the mains. You'll also need a spare USB port on your PC to accommodate the receiver that will also need its own power socket. I found the installation fast and easy. The WiLife Command Centre software installed on my Vista laptop without any issues. (Windows XP should work fine too.) The camera itself is basically a webcam that can sit on your window sill, or be stuck to a window with a suction cup. The installation instructions state that you shouldn't plug either the receiver or transmitter into a surge protection power strip, but as I didn't have any spare wall sockets, I tried this anyway. The monitoring software detected the camera without any problems. If you do encounter installation issues, then using two mains wall sockets should be enough to get the system up and running.The surveillance software has a simple interface that can be customised to your precise needs. Multiple cameras (up to five, including one cunningly disguised as a bedroom alarm clock) can be attached to the system, and their video feeds viewed on screen together or separately. You'll need to manually focus the camera's lens to get the sharpest picture quality. The best way to use the camera is to set it to begin recording when it detects movement in its field of vision. This worked first time and provided video footage that I could play back to check the camera was capturing the images I wanted, and was correctly focused. The system also enables you to set up email alerts and mobile phone messaging. A snapshot can be sent to any email address or mobile phone at set intervals. The most powerful feature is the ability to access your cameras online. The Wi\u00adLife service uses your favourite internet browser for a WiLife account where you can view the live video feed from your cameras. This worked perfectly first time, though the system prompts you to install Microsoft's Silverlight to view the footage. The WiLife software also lets you move the camera lens remotely \u2013 if you stump up for a platinum account (\u00a349 a year). This gives you an upgrade to your Command Centre software that offers online storage and access to video footage via any internet connected PC. The most attractive feature, however, is the ability to pan, tilt and zoom your cameras remotely. The quality of the video footage \u2013 the maximum resolution is 640x480 with a frame rate of 15 frames per second \u2013 is certainly adequate for most general surveillance. You can tweak the brightness and contrast, but don't expect this webcam to give you hi-def videos. Overall, I liked the fast and simple setup, and the ability to access the camera from any internet-connected PC. Having snapshots emailed to me is an added bonus. The software is intuitive and easy to use, but if you really want to get the most from the entire system, upgrading to a platinum account will be a must. But at nearly \u00a350, you should look carefully at how you will use your cameras before parting with the cash. You could build a complete surveillance system for your home \u2013 but the cost of additional cameras is quite high. Ultimately what looks at first glance like a bit of a gimmick in practice actually works quite well. If you want to experiment with CCTV for your home without going the whole hog of installing a professional system, this solution is a good first step. Pros Fast and easy setup, wireless connection, remote internet access to camera footage. Cons Expensive for just one camera, subscription needed for additional features, only adequate video quality. logitech.com",
