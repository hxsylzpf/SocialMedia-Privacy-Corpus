  "content": "Two years ago, when I interviewed the then-head of David Cameron's Webcameron, I asked whether \u2013 when and if he assumed office as prime minister \u2013 he would continue making his videos. \"If it suddenly stopped,\" the aide replied, \"that would be seen as a very cynical move \u2026 You can't stop communicating.\" Campaign by the internet, govern by the internet. Now that Barack Obama is in the White House, he must continue to use and spread the tools of the internet and transparency that he so brilliantly plied to win the office or else it would make his promises of change empty. We see the barest beginnings of his digital administration at the White House Blog. (Ah, how that link warms the heart of a blogger. Too bad that the president and vice-president of Iran beat the president of the birthplace of blogging to the platform. Oh, well, progress is progress.) Dave Winer, one of the fathers of blogging, complained on Twitter and his blog that the presidential blog is weak tea. But I think 24 hours is too soon to judge a revolution. The presidential blogmaster, Macon Phillips, promises communication, transparency, and participation and we'll see how well he and his boss live up to their broad goals. Before taking office, they asked the public to suggest policy and action at Change.gov \u2013 as Starbucks and Dell do (it's all the rage) \u2013 but, sadly, they took that down when they took office and linked instead to the new blog, where we can watch and read his inaugural address. A new age of government openness, and collaboration with the citizenry won't be made on one blog or Twitter or RSS feed or YouTube stage. It will be made by issuing and instilling a new ethic of transparency in government. I argue that we should abolish the Freedom of Information Act and instead make transparency the default for government's business, which should occur digitally and in the open, so citizens may search, link, comment on, and analyse it. Rather than our asking the government to release our information, the government should ask our permission not to. And the president should also instill an ethic of listening in the agencies of his administration. Some collaboration may occur at the White House site. But the real voice of the people is already out here, on the internet, in blogs, on YouTube, all around us. All you have to do is search for it and listen. That will be a new age in government.",
