  "content": "Today's six monthly cost report on the ID card proves beyond doubt that the scheme is in terminal decay. Costs continue to rise despite the removal of nearly all the core security features that were originally envisioned for the system. Yet another couple of hundred million pounds has appeared in the estimates even though the scheme has been ripped and gutted beyond recognition. And now, in the face of Treasury's sabre rattling, ministers have reneged on a 2005 commitment to cap the cost of an ID card at \u00a330. Now this cap will only apply for the first two years of the scheme. And as if by magic a new line item has appeared in the estimates to recoup the same amount again for interviews. So now a card will cost you \u00a360. This breach of the cap is a betrayal of trust. It was made as an ironclad commitment to placate opposition in parliament. Back then, the London School of Economics had estimated the median cost of the scheme at around \u00a314bn over 10 years. The report caused one of the most celebrated battles in history between government and an academic institution. Ministers lined up on a daily basis to condemn the LSE and the report's authors, insisting that the estimate was politically inspired. Four years on, we can confidently assert that we were right. The government's estimate has hardly changed, yet those figures do not include card readers or implementation costs throughout departments and private sector organisations. You have to laugh at this slow train wreck. Well, you'd laugh if it were not so expensively tragic. The LSE report argued that one way to bring down the overall cost would be to allow people to register at post offices. The then immigration minister Tony McNulty yet again went again on the attack against me on the Today programme saying, \"I think his alternative proposal is as preposterous as his original report.\" The LSE proposals were, he asserted, \"complete and utter nonsense\". So now the government has announced, guess what: registration in post offices. The problem is that in trying to keep alive the original fabric of the scheme's architecture there are few cost benefits in doing this. The government once argued that the benefits of the ID card scheme would at least equal the cost. We responded that ministers were living in a fantasy world. Now, to ensure continuity of the original claim, Jacqui Smith tells us that the benefits will amount to, surprise surprise, six billion pounds, just slightly more than the ten-year cost estimate. What she failed to prominently disclose is that this estimate has moved from a 10-year span to a 30-year span. Again, we were right. The government is now calling for volunteers from Manchester to kick off the scheme. What it is really looking for are \"early adopters\" who want a card in much the same way as they would queue up for the latest iPod. The difference is that unlike an iPod, the card will be of absolutely no use until card readers start to appear over the next five years. Now, rotten and discredited, the government's plans are being cryogenically sustained with nothing more than the most basic political life support system. The fact is almost nobody in the political world wants this odious scheme. Nobody ever wanted it other than a couple of high-profile politicians who were so fixated that they couldn't listen to reason. And support from the public plummets daily. We told the government the scheme was doomed to failure and that it would have to radically change. Now it has changed, and in the process the guts have fallen out of the plan. In the cold light of morning everyone realises that the scheme cannot offer perfect identity and its sponsors are bailing like rats from the ship. Even David Blunkett, once pathologically obsessed with the scheme, now believes the cards should be scrapped.",
