Lawyers acting for the man, who was described as having \"celebrity status and a highly-publicised lifestyle\", say there should be a blanket ban preventing journalists from attending because of the level of interest in the case. \"In family law cases concerning the children of celebrities \u2026 the media should be excluded from the hearings altogether,\" said Richard Spearman QC, representing the family. The case, which concerns the celebrity's child, is the first big challenge to new rules opening the family courts to the media since they were introduced in April, and is being strongly contested by a coalition including almost all the main television and newspaper groups. \"When the media reports on the courts this is a prime example of it acting in its public watchdog role,\" said Gavin Millar QC, on behalf of the press. \"Family law cases concerning the children of celebrities are no different in principle to those involving children of 'non-celebrities',\" Millar added, accusing the family's lawyers of \"a wholesale failure\" to comply with the guidance in the way they had conducted the case. A blanket ban preventing journalists attending the family's case was imposed by high court judge Vera Mayer this year, after one reporter from a foreign magazine said she wanted to publish pictures and information about the case. The Times, which also covered the case, misreported some of the legal issues, Spearman said, arguing that this confirmed fears that the press would concentrate on celebrity cases and put details into the public domain that would invade privacy. But some media lawyers said the way in which the celebrity family had conducted the case was \"scandalous\", because the ban had been imposed without notifying the press or providing them with information to challenge it. The family argued that by giving details to the media they risked information leaking into the public domain. \"It is difficult, if not impossible, to police compliance with reporting restrictions,\" Spearman said. \"In any event, there would appear to be nothing to prevent a journalist using the information \u2026 to uncover other information about the parties or about other people which could then be published.\" The case comes amid wide-ranging criticism of the new rules for \"openness\" in the family courts, which have changed the rules without parliament enacting any new legislation, leaving much of the decision-making to judges. In his first public comments since the new rules came into force, the president of the high court family division, Sir Mark Potter, said the changes were not sufficient. \"What judges have always argued is that if there is going to be change [in the family courts] it needs statutory change,\" said Potter, who was presiding over the case. \"You can't just rely on a little pigeon-hole which gives judges discretion under the existing rules.\"",
