  "content": "The producer attacked by Jeremy Clarkson in the incident that led to the Top Gear presenter's sacking by the BBC was subjected to a stream of abuse on social media after the announcement, including death threats. Twitter users were attacking Oisin Tymon under the hashtags #boycottBBC, #BringBackClarkson and #OisinTymon, with the BBC producer accused of causing Clarkson's departure. Some were particularly nasty, calling for the victim to be shot and hoping he \"visits the morgue VERY soon\", while others questioned his courage. \"Victim?! Is he a man or a mouse? He should squeak up! #OisinTymon\" BBC director general Tony Hall was also included in some of the abuse, with one person tweeting: \"Tony Hall BBC director, I wonder if Oisin's and your head can stop a bullet !!! just wondering.\" There were signs of a backlash, with many sticking up for Tymon, who said in a statement released shortly after that he had enjoyed \"a positive and successful working relationship\" with Clarkson during 10 years working for a show he \"loved\". One user tweeted: \"Man assaults another man and victim receives abuse because people can't watch a TV show about cars. Bravo society. Bravo OisinTymon\". while another asked: \"I wonder how the people out for Oisin Tymon's blood would feel if their boss punched them for no good reason?\"",
