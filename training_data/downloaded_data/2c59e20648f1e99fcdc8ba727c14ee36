  "content": "Samsung has partnered with Facebook, MySpace and Bebo to offer four bands the chance to have their music appear in an ad campaign later this summer. The competition to find the unsigned artists, which will be supported by radio advertising, will be promoted through the social networking websites because of their popularity with young music fans. Samsung's marketing campaign aims to get bands to visit www.f400share.com and upload a 45-second MP3 sample entry of a track. The public will then be asked to vote for the best four later this month. The winning tracks will appear in a radio and online campaign that Samsung will run later this summer to promote its new F400 phone. Having their work featured in advertising campaigns have long been a route to success for music artists. The Dandy Warhols' track Bohemian Like You became a huge hit after featuring on in Vodafone ads, and more recently Mint Royale's remix of Dancing in the Rain became a dance number one after appearing in a Volkswagen TV ad. The US singer Joey Ryan has had his music featured in recent ads for Wrigley's Extra promoting its Hollyoaks sponsorship, with the Radio One DJ Jo Whiley highlighting him as one to watch. And the British band the Ting Tings recently had chart success after the group's single Shut Up and Let Me Go appeared in an Apple TV ad. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
