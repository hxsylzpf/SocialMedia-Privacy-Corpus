But the encounter between Shapps and interviewer John Humphrys will probably be most memorable for a spat between the two over whether the housing minister had pulled out of a previous interview with the programme. Shapps launched into an attack on the programme, which on Thursday said he had been unable to talk about the new figures because he had pulled out of a scheduled appearance. He accused Today of misleading listeners and said he had never confirmed the booking, but Humphrys retorted that the interview had been confirmed by his staff, and the two-minute row sent Shapps \u2013 who is an avid tweeter with some 33,000 followers \u2013 trending on Twitter. The row had been stoked the day before by the Mirror's deputy political editor, James Lyons, who tweeted Shapps, setting off a Twitter exchange between him and fellow Today presenter Evan Davis. Lyons got the ball rolling: Hi @grantshapps - why didn't you go on @R4Today this morning? They say you pulled out at the last minute. To which Shapps retorted: @MirrorJames @R4Today Completely untrue. On train to Stoke to announce HMR funding. Wrong for Today to say pulled out. It was never set up! Lyons then batted the ball to Davis: Hey @EvanHD that @grantshapps says it is \"completely untrue\" that he pulled out of @R4Today appearance Which elicited this: @MirrorJames Odd. I'm told that @grantshapps had agreed to be interviewed between 7 and 7.30am. Cancelled at about 10pm And then this from Shapps: @EvanHD @MirrorJames completely untrue Evan! I didn't even know there was a #Today bid until 9.45pm. Was on train to Stoke this a.m. So when it came to Friday morning's interview, Shapps was itching to set the record straight, saying: \"John \u2026 can I just give you the opportunity to correct an impression left by the programme yesterday that said that I'd pulled out of an interview?\" He said he had been on the train heading for a meeting in Stoke, and that he had never confirmed the slot. \"I did try to see if I could leave for the train later or whatever. It was never possible. I was never booked in,\" he told Humphrys. Humphrys said he was standing by Today's version of events, adding: \"We spoke to you \u2013 we took copious notes, as is our practice \u2013 we don't want to make a big deal of it.\" He said it would puzzle listeners that the pair were spending air time on this and sounded eager to move on. Will the Today programme then release these \"copious notes\" and settle the matter? A BBC spokesman said: \"We won't be releasing the notes, but clearly given the interview was cancelled earlier on in the week. We're pleased that Mr Shapps came on this morning.\"",
