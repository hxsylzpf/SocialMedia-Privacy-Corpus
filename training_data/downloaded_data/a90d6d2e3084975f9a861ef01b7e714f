  "content": "Diet Coke's famous \"hunk\" is to return in a TV advertising campaign to mark the soft drink's 30th anniversary in Europe, with a British model chosen to bare his chiselled torso to female admirers for the first time. The company introduced the Diet Coke break man to its advertising in 1994 \u2013 featuring female office workers catching shirtless construction worker Lucky Vanous taking an 11.30am break \u2013 but has not aired a new \"hunk\" ad since 2007. The new campaign features Manchester model Andrew Cooper, a one-time wannabe singer who released a track in the late 1990s and was briefly represented by Take That's former manager Nigel Martin-Smith. The ad, set to Etta James's version of the track I Just Want to Make Love to You, will be released on TV in the UK in March. Cooper appears in the TV ad as a gardener joining the ranks of roles the \"hunk\" has been assigned over the years, including a lift technician, window cleaner and delivery man. \"It is not about the Diet Coke man being an object, it is not a voyeur thing, it is about cultural change, women being equal to men and you can see that,\" said Olivier Geyer, Diet Coke director for north-west Europe and the nordic region. \"We wanted to celebrate not just the brand, but also the women who have been with us for 30 years. We have tried to make sure it is not the past but a very contemporary execution. [It] showcases female empowerment and camaraderie.\" The TV campaign, created by ad agency BETC London, will run in at least 11 countries across Europe. Geyer said in early March that Diet Coke cans will be rebranded to celebrate the 30-year milestone, as part of a year-long marketing campaign. The launch of the high-profile campaign to support Diet Coke, which is positioned as a healthy no-calorie option, comes weeks after parent firm Coca-Cola launched a two-minute ad in the US in its first direct push to tackle the issue of obesity.
