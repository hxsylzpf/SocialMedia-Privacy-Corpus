  "content": "Ardent Productions, Prince Edward's film company, last night attempted to draw a line under the furore surrounding its attempt to continue filming at St Andrews University last week by issuing its fullest apology yet for disrupting Prince William's first week of studies. Following a meeting between Prince Edward and fellow directors, Ardent handed its tapes, which do not contain any footage of Prince William, to Buckingham Palace, promising they would never be used for any programme. In a statement, the company said: \"We have undertaken a full review of the events surrounding the filming and the countless allegations. Ardent... are incredibly apologetic for what happened now they realise the full picture and for any trouble they have caused.\" A freelance film crew employed by the company persisted in filming around St Andrews for more than two days last week despite being asked on several occasions to leave by the university. Ardent's statement claimed that the younger prince's privacy was never in danger of being breached and that it \"utterly respected the need for him to be left alone to undertake his studies in private\". The company's statement still appeared to avoid certain issues, however, particularly why it thought it could continue to film in defiance of repeated requests and why it did not consider the \"full picture\" at a much earlier stage. Students have said they were asked to take part in interviews, describing Prince William's time at the university retrospectively, as if they were being filmed next summer rather than three days after his arrival.",
