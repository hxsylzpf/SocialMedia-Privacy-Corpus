Last month, Sony was fined \u00a3250,000 by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) following an attack on the company's database by hackers in April 2011, which resulted in customers' personal data appearing online. The risks to corporations are not just fines, but loss of reputation, lost sales when ecommerce sites go offline or, in the worst case, loss of business-critical data. With cyber-attacks growing in number and complexity, both companies and their customers need to know that the full scope of their data is protected. But how can cyber-attacks be prevented and the damage contained? How are companies approaching the risks at present and the threats posed by security weaknesses on the internet and in mobile devices, and how can they be countered and mitigated? These questions were discussed in detail by a panel of online security experts at a recent Guardian roundtable, held in association with internet security provider Symantec. The roundtable was conducted under the Chatham House rule, meaning that comments are unattributed so contributors can speak more freely. One participant set the scene for the debate by describing the aftermath of a security breach by hackers: \"You don't know what they've done, you don't know what's motivating them, you don't know if it's malicious, or if they planted malicious code, or stole data. It's expensive to try and unravel what has happened.\" Unfortunately, getting to the bottom of what has happened and making systems secure again is difficult as cyber-risk is by its nature elusive, the roundtable heard. \"Every company suffers breaches, they just don't know about it in many instances, or if they do know about it they can't quantify what level of impact it really had,\" said a participant. As a result, an exact definition of cyber-risk is hard. \"It is anything that is internet related, or electronic-based threats,\" said a contributor. \"There are various ways \u2013 volume [non-specific] attacks, or more targeted attacks \u2013 which are generally financially motivated. It's not exactly business risk, it's IT risk with a business perspective.\" Responsibility to customers But the risks to business are real, the roundtable agreed. \"It is incumbent on all of us to look at IT security, because if the security stops the business from operating for a couple of days, there's a good chance the company will go bust,\" the debate was told. Businesses also have a responsibility to protect customers. As one contributor said, the term \"identity theft\" is now commonplace to describe what happens when a fraudster manages to pose as someone else, whether online or in a financial transaction. How identity is verified sits at the heart of internet security. Could using a login from a big internet identity such as Facebook or Google to access other websites be the answer? \"You can use Facebook to log in to a bunch of things. I've never used it, though it pops up all the time, because intrinsically I don't trust it, I don't like it, I don't think it is a good idea,\" said one panel member. Rather, the debate heard, there has to be a way of establishing online identity for customers that is not led by a single company. \"The secret ingredient is cross-industry collaboration, taking identity out of the competitive space, moving it into the collaborative space. Banks did that a long time ago for payments, to everyone's benefit.\" One area scrutinised at the roundtable was mobile devices, which are now used for financial transactions as well as being a gateway to personal data. \"As a platform, mobile devices are not as secure as a PC,\" said one participant. A modern smartphone is really a computer, but apps get installed with little attention to whether or not they are safe, the roundtable heard. \"On a laptop there are a few mainstream applications, but on a mobile the entire universe can create apps, it's very diverse and complicated,\" said one contributor. There is a contrast between the security of web browsing and the security of mobile apps, the roundtable was told. If you are using a full-size web browser, there is an easy and familiar way to verify the identity of the website you are visiting through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates, which facilitate secure communication over the internet. \"The infrastructure behind that is quite complex, but it's a very simplistic user experience. It's about identity, validating that a website has a genuine history. Browsers have those controls built in. It's a very consumer-friendly model. On mobile, if you are interacting with apps, there is no way of saying how trustworthy the application is,\" a participant said. \"A lot of the controls in place are more social controls,\" said one participant about mobile apps. \"How popular is the app? If it's popular it can't be bad.\" One contributor suggested it would be useful if all apps had to go through a validation process before being made available for download. \"Let's have that industry validated, let's have mobile devices able to recognise that they are looking at an app that has been through a validation process. That would help considerably to protect the consumer.\" A key focus of the roundtable was on what practical steps organisations can take to protect themselves. Insurance may be part of the answer, the roundtable heard, though it is no use simply taking out a cyber insurance policy and then ignoring the risks. Generally the insurer will impose certain requirements and, just as your house insurance might not cover you against theft if you leave the door unlocked, cyber insurance will fail if you do not have good enough security in place. \"We took out a cyber insurance policy\", said one participant, whose business moved one of its databases to an online service. \"One of the stipulations is that we have to get our own house in order as well, in terms of security controls.\" One contributor said security should be viewed as a chain, and controlling security means looking at suppliers as well as your own internal systems. \"The key things insurers ask for is that you must have [security] policies and they must be well defined. You must educate all your staff on those policies. Awareness and training is key. You need regular reviews of all your systems, especially the ones storing personal data, and the contract with your suppliers needs to be watertight, which means they must be contracted to meet certain standards of security.\" Many at the roundtable thought the need for insurance may actually drive up security standards more effectively than regulations. \"It is something that could potentially drive the quality of security controls up, rather than try and enforce it through standards and regulations that mis-focus people on just ticking boxes,\" a participant explained. So what can an organisation do to improve its cybersecurity? It starts with designing security into every system, the roundtable was told, and then not relaxing. Do not just put controls in place and sit back, stressed one contributor. \"Monitoring is important. Not just logging what's going on, but watching it.\" Another aspect of this is analytics, said one participant. Looking for patterns in data or online behaviour could identify malicious intent. When it comes to the future of cybersecurity, one theory aired at the roundtable was that it will take a major incident to concentrate minds. \"There will be a big cyber-only incident that takes out a major organisation or piece of infrastructure,\" said one participant. \"Unfortunately a lot of people will not implement stuff until there is an incident. I think within the next five years that's very likely.\" Some participants said that companies will have to change their approach to online security. \"SSL is currently the target of attacks. That will get an overhaul, because at the moment we're seeing a spate of compromised certificate authorities,\" the panel heard. Another contributor sees biometrics becoming more prominent. This technology uses computerised methods to identify a person by their unique physical or behavioural characteristics, such as eye \"maps\" or fingerprints. \"I don't mean DNA, but face recognition, voice recognition, devices that do palmprint, handprint, fingerprint. Someone will find it faster and simpler for their phone to recognise their face and voice in a split second, rather than type in a four-digit code. And that is unique to that person. The technology is already there.\" One participant felt that no matter how much cybersecurity technology improved, there would always be a weak point: \"The problem exists between the keyboard and the chair.\" Others, however, were more positive and suggested the mobile revolution together with new approaches to identity management have the potential to improve cybersecurity. \"There is a growing buy-in to authentication, validation and all the other things that go around security,\" the roundtable heard. \"In five years we should be a little bit ahead.\" Key points The term \"cyber-risk\" covers any computer or internet-based threat. This includes: hacking attempts; malicious code planted on a computer (malware) or network of computers (a botnet); stolen credentials used for an unauthorised login, known as \"phishing\"; denial-of-service attacks; or data intercepted on wireless networks or found on lost laptops and mobile phones. There is no single answer to cyber-risk, but rather a combination of security best practice and policy, technical measures to discover and prevent breaches, and mitigation including backup plans and insurance in the event of a disaster. Experts are frustrated by the continued use of weak security practices, such as simple username/ password combinations, or four-digit passcodes. New approaches to managing identity online will help, though there is no prospect of a risk-free internet.
