  "content": "China has started another official crackdown on online games, pornography and internet cafes as part of a campaign against juvenile crime, a state news agency said today. \"Operation For Tomorrow\" plans to target unlicensed internet cafes, known as \"black web bars\", and increase supervision of legal premises, as well as root out games seen as violent or unhealthy, the Xinhua news agency said. Xinhua added that authorities would \"use the law to attack, investigate and prosecute ... to cleanse the environment in which young people are raised and prevent and reduce juvenile crime and illegal activity\". Checks on domestic and foreign charities and other non-government organisations would be increased. As the Guardian reported last weekend, China's online population is about to overtake the US and become the biggest in the world. Users are mainly interested in entertainment and business information, with authorities rigorously policing anti-government content and uncensored news. Unlicensed internet cafes have been repeatedly accused of breeding juvenile crime and promoting truancy. Official rules bar admission to under-18s. Xinhua said the latest plan would focus on vulnerable youths, including school dropouts, runaways and children whose parents are in prison or who have migrated for work.",
