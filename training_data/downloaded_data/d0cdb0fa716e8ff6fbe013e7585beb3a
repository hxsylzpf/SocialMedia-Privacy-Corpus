  "content": "For people who find themselves at the centre of a news story, press attention can be intrusive and baffling \u2013 even for those who fully expect reporters to turn up and think they're equipped to handle them. After being on the receiving end of his own profession following the death of his nephew, journalist Chris Wheal has been campaigning for a change in the way \"death-knock journalism\" is conducted. \"The press was one many-headed monster,\" he writes. \"It knocked five times and phoned offering money twice. Each time it was told to leave her [Wheal's sister] alone. None of the individual journalists was harassing her but it felt, to her, like harassment by the press.\" Wheal is right to flag up death-knock journalism as problematic. Members of the public don't know how to handle journalists who come knocking \u2013 often junior or trainee reporters who, in many cases, don't want to go back to the office empty-handed because they will be shouted at and/or sent back to try again. But it's not just death-knock journalism that's at fault. Wheal has highlighted a much bigger problem: most people do not know how the press works, because no one tells them. When you are a victim of crime, or you are bereaved, or you feature in a news story in your local paper, nobody hands you a leaflet saying: \"This is how the press works and here is what to expect from them. Here is an explanation of why they may want to talk to you. And right now, the local paper may be flogging your details to a news agency. They may promise you copy approval, which an agency can't actually guarantee as their copy always gets rewritten. They may be standing in your garden path, right now, seeing off other journalists who have come to ask for your story by claiming you've already signed a contract.\" Sure, you can get a PR to handle the press for you \u2013 if you pay. Businesses, charities and the government have press officers to talk to journalists and money to spend on media training for people who give interviews. Members of the public are all too often left to figure it out for themselves and, more often than not, by themselves. I know of one victim of crime who testified against her attacker in court. She believed newspapers would not print her name without asking her permission first \u2013 she assumed data protection law meant they needed her say-so. She didn't know that, thanks to our open justice system, her name was there for the taking. And she didn't know that if she wanted it to remain confidential, the onus was on her to make that happen. Why would she? How can members of the public hold the press accountable if they do not understand how the media work? How can journalists claim to be upholding ethical standards when the press operates from what seems to members of the public to be an invisible rulebook to which they simply are not privy? We're used to press behaviour being decried as tasteless or tactless. Wheal's family objected to being offered money for their story, but it's standard practice for real-life magazines to follow up on news stories \u2013 and the subjects may end up at the centre of a bidding war without realising it. It's easy to say this kind of chequebook journalism is tasteless if you don't understand why a fee would be offered (to guarantee exclusivity, among other reasons). On the flipside, it's all too easy to say that members of the public have no right to dictate what the press should do when they don't understand what they are talking about. One of the comments on Wheal's blog says: \"...had you yourself acted differently and known the way the media worked in a situation like this, a lot of what happened could have been easily avoided.\" Great. How? What about all the other people in his shoes, who aren't journalists and have no way of finding out how things work? Journalists get labelled as \"scum\" and \"feral beasts\" not just because of the stitch-up techniques some use, or the fact that it's pretty much impossible for most individuals to sue for libel without going mad or bankrupt. It's simpler than that. There isn't enough clear, transparent, free advice on how to deal with media attention, and consequently people end up feeling harassed and confused. What is the media so afraid of? If there's nothing wrong with the way we currently treat members of the public, logic says there's nothing to hide. Or will people be even less keen on journalists if they learn more about how they operate? The press exists to hold everyone else up to scrutiny \u2013 but this shouldn't be at the expense of scrutinising itself.",
