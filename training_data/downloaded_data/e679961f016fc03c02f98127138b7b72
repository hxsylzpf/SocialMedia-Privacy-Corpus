  "content": "In a welcome sign of the coming singularity, Buzzfeed just announced that it has built a sentence generator that mimics the turgid writing style of New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. The auto-Friedman, which also posts to Twitter as @mot_namdeirf, operates on a principle called Markov chaining; essentially, it strings together chunks of Friedman sentences based on how often words tend to appear together. Friedman isn't the only writer with a Twitter bot. I've got one too, made using a Markov chain-related program and my tweet archives. The guy who made it, Brett O'Connor, made bots for a number of other people I know, and most of us follow each other's. (Most of our bots follow each others' bots, leading to some gloriously weird bot-on-bot conversations.) Interacting with the bots is a surreal experience; they seem to develop their own personalities and priorities, distinct from their parent tweeters. Some of this is built in by O'Connor \u2013 he has, for instance, decided that for some reason every bot he makes will be obsessed with butts \u2013 but mostly it's a combination of pattern-finding and anthropomorphism. We imagine the bots are people because they look and sound like us. But in many ways, interacting with bots is more pleasant than interacting with actual humans, and certainly much easier. Unlike human Twitter, which sometimes feels like the Fire Swamp in The Princess Bride, bot Twitter offers a simulacrum of communication stripped of social responsibility. You don't have to worry about a bot's feelings, or even its comprehension; no matter what garbage you spew, it will always \u2013 sweetly, gamely \u2013 respond. The response won't make any logical sense, but, at the same time, it could make all the sense in the world, at least to you; it will have only the meaning that you give it. Bot interaction has all the hallmarks of human interaction with none of the anxiety \u2013 it's the \"colorless green ideas sleep furiously\" of conversations. If social media is an infinite cocktail hour, bot Twitter is a tea party with stuffed animals. And sometimes, that's just what you need. Maybe this ease of interaction explains why people keep hitting on bots. In her 1995 book Life on the Screen, the sociologist Sherry Turkle describes a player in an online game making advances to a \"woman\" named Julia, actually a bot: Barry says, 'Hello, how are you?' Julia says, 'Hello, Barry.' Barry says, 'Are you a virgin?' Julia says, 'As far as you are concerned, Barry, I always will be.' Their continued interaction makes it clear that, whether or not Barry thinks Julia is real, he definitely thinks he's getting some cybersex. This, despite Julia asking \"have I convinced you that I'm a computer yet?\" As Turkle remarks, \"Frankly, it's not entirely clear to me whether Julia passed a Turing test here or Barry failed one.\" Two decades later, men on the internet are still treating female-named bots like women, and bot designers are responding accordingly: Apple's Siri comes pre-loaded with gently snarky responses to things like \"I love you\", \"will you marry me\", and \"what are you wearing?\" Perhaps not coincidentally, some men on the internet are also treating women like bots. With the exception of my friends and colleagues, many men who try to talk to me online seem like they would be a lot happier if I automatically responded with a series of properly deferential stock phrases. And I'd be a lot happier if they'd talk to a pile of code instead. I wish we could outsource a lot of the emotional labor traditionally expected of women, so us flesh-and-blood ones can get on with the stuff we actually want to do. I'm not the first person to have this idea, not by a long shot; ELIZA, an early chatbot that mimicked a psychotherapist, was programmed in the mid-1960s. ELIZA would tirelessly respond to input by prompting for more information, allowing users to explain themselves to it (her?) endlessly if they so chose. Think how much time that would save actual therapists, bartenders, strippers and women on first dates. Some genius has already tried using bots to take over annoying emotional caretaking jobs, with encouraging results. During the height of the Gamergate fiasco, someone set up an ELIZA-based Twitter bot, @ElizaRBarr, to respond to people using an associated hashtag \u2013 and it turned out to be exactly what these benighted souls needed. Several of them started expounding to the bot, who offered encouraging responses like \"tell me more about that.\" It was a perfect solution: Gamergaters got someone to listen to them spew bile, and real people got a moment of peace while their harassers focused on an effigy. So thank you, Buzzfeed, for replacing Thomas Friedman with a bot \u2013 we should all be so lucky. Maybe everyone should have a bot doppelganger, to have the unpleasant interactions that unpleasant people demand from us. I think, actually, the internet might be improved by the addition of all-bot spaces. Maybe they should even be vestibules, chat rooms you drop into before you get to the real internet. Jerks would get to spend their bile on human-like entities with no feelings to hurt \u2013 and if the @ElizaRBarr experiment is any indication, they'd be just as happy to hammer at a robot, as long as it would sit still and get lectured at. Meanwhile, decent people would be able get a break; nobody would bristle at your word choice, nobody would mansplain, nobody would say anything casually racist (as long as they weren't loaded up with casually racist source text). The bots wouldn't get your jokes, but they wouldn't not get them either. Once you'd hung out with the bots for a while, you could decide whether you wanted to proceed to the actual internet \u2013 but you might find that the bots scratched the itch for company better than your fellow meatbags ever could. People need interaction to feel human, but it doesn't necessarily have to be human interaction. And besides, sometimes interacting with bots leads us to realizations much more profound than we could achieve alone. As my bot would say:",
