  "content": "Twitter is rolling out an update to its profile pages that look very similar to Facebook, complete with tweet highlights and large pictures. The update, visible through the web version of Twitter, allows users to customise their profile pages with their favourite tweets, a larger profile photo and wide cover-image, mirroring the design update Facebook made to its profile pages in 2013. \"Moment by moment, your Twitter profile shows the world who you are. Starting today, it will be even easier (and, we think, more fun) to express yourself through a new and improved web profile,\" said the Twitter designer David Bellona in a blog post. Users will be able to pin tweets to the top of their page, while tweets that have seen more retweets, replies or favourites will appear slightly larger. Viewers of other people's profiles will also be able to filter the displayed tweet timelines to exclude pictures and videos or view tweets and replies. The new profile page updates are currently available for a select group of existing users, including a small list of celebrities, while new users will start with the new profile design when they sign up for a Twitter account. The update will be rolling out to existing users in the coming weeks.",
