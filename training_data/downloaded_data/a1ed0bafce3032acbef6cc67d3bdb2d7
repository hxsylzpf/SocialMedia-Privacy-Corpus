  "content": "It might comfortably be said that the London 2012 Olympics was the Games the internet meme and animated gif struck gold. But one sport in particular seems to have dominated the meme wars. First the Atlantic produced a series of gymnastics animated gif guides, then Gabrielle Douglas's hair, and Buzzfeed's tribute to Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina's steely-eyed stare and now American gymnast McKayla Maroney's podium performance has yet again got the meme-creators' juices flowing. Maroney's response to her surprise defeat on the women's artistic gymnastics vault, where she was tipped to take gold, was the subject of much internet gossip and has resulted in a slate of memes about her 'inner Mean Girl' - the most prominent being the 'McKayla is not impressed' Tumblr blog. The particularly witty users on reddit have put together a list of captions on the theme 'When I ask my girlfriend what's wrong' to go with Maroney's stance including \"You don't serve Coke? Oh Pepsi is fine\" and \"No, go ahead, go out with your friends\". Gymnastics seems to lend itself to the idea of the meme - what Sue Blackmore describes on Comment is free as: \"information that is copied, varied and selected \u2013 but the term is usually reserved for those that hit the big time, or \"go viral\".\" Maroney herself has shown good humour in getting involved with the mickey-take - retweeting a link to the Tumblr account during a London tour with the rest of the US gymnast team. She also defended her lack of hugs to fellow female gymnasts in tweets. But while gymnastics has been champion of the memes, other sports seem to have caught the viral loop of the internet too. Including funny diving faces, the whole of Tumblr being obsessed with Tom Daley, and the lack of medals for the Australian team (with reference to the Rock). The Queen of course has her own meme altogether. What were your favourite gifs and memes of the London 2012 Olympics? Leave a link in a comment below? Or feel free to leave your own caption to the McKayla Maroney picture.",
