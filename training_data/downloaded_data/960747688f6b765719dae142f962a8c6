  "content": "The editor of the Guardian today said he was \"extremely pleased\" to have won the legal battle to identify the royal servant who brought an injunction against the Mail on Sunday, saying the victory had \"significant implications for freedom of expression\". The injunction banning the Guardian from naming former royal servant Michael Fawcett was lifted at the high court today after the newspaper confirmed it had no intention of repeating allegations about him. \"We are extremely pleased with this outcome, which has significant implications for freedom of expression,\" said Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian. \"The identity of those seeking libel injunctions should be a matter for public record - even when there is a connection to the royal family. \"Today's outcome is reassuring in underlining the fact that those with links to the royal household are subject to the laws of this country in the same way as anyone else. \"The saga shows, however, the extraordinary lengths to which both sides are going in the current bitter battle between scandal-hungry tabloids and an increasingly bruised royal household.\" The agreement that the injunction against the Guardian should be lifted meant the newspaper and its sister online service, Guardian Unlimited, were able to publish Mr Fawcett's name in relation to his obtaining the injunction against the Mail on Sunday. The Mail on Sunday wants to publish a 3,000-word article about the former royal servant but the injunction remains in place. The Sunday paper is returning to the high court tomorrow to try to get it overturned. At the high court this afternoon Desmond Browne QC, for the former royal aide, said Mr Fawcett was \"delighted it has been possible to reach an agreement with the Guardian, which puts an end to these proceedings and saves further costs\". He added: \"The action will be discontinued by the claimant and your Lordship is asked formally to discharge the injunction granted by Mr Justice Henriques on 3 November 2003 and continued since then. \"The claimant's concern, ever since he learned of the utterly false allegations the Mail on Sunday intended to publish, has been to preserve his reputation and protect his family. \"No other consideration motivated his action against the Guardian. \"As your Lordship knows, the injunction against Associated Newspapers granted by Mr Justice McKinnon remains in force and this settlement in no way affects it.\" Adrienne Page QC, for Guardian Newspapers Ltd, told Mr Justice Tugendhat: \"The Guardian has fought this action for no other reason than the Guardian's belief that it is in the public interest that, save in the most exceptional circumstances, the press should be free to report the names of those who seek to suppress the publication of libellous statements about them by means of prior restraint. \"The Guardian has never intended to publish the Mail on Sunday's allegations and has no reason to believe them to be true.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857",
