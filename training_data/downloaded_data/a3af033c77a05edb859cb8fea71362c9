  "content": "Monkey's Twitter exchange of the day \u2013 probably not a regular feature, but stick with us \u2013 comes from Stephen Fry. Who else? Fry, it seems, was travelling home in a taxi last night when he urgently needed to take a leak. \"Still in cab,\" he tweeted. \"Clenched thighs so hard my testicles have shot up my neck. Dear me.\" Except his 600,000 or so followers appeared not to be entirely sympathetic, if his next tweet was anything to go by. \"As for all you wicked people who tWEEted \"sssssssss\" and \"tinkle\" and \"fountain\". Shame on you. Home now. Made it.\" But does gadget addict Fry have a Wii as well?",
