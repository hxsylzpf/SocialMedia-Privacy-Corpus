The phenomenon of \"Islamic hacking\", as the company, mi2g, calls it, is allegedly causing more damage as groups coordinate attempts to paralyse websites and disrupt businesses. The claim, dismissed by some industry insiders as \"alarmist\", comes at a time when Muslim groups in Britain complain that their organisations' computer systems have been targeted by rightwing opponents. The Muslim Council of Britain has endured deluges of hate emails, most recently after Ken Bigley was kidnapped. \"The emails purport to come from a friendly source, but they contain thousands of hate messages,\" said Jamil Sherif of the council. Political hacking among internet groups is common, especially over issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the rivalry between India and Pakistan in Kashmir. The Muslim Association of Britain admitted its website was hacked into twice this year, once shortly after the visit to the UK of the controversial Sheikh Qaradawi. Adnan Faour, a website designer for the MAB, said Muslim organisations had been targeted but he added: \"I don't see it being an organised event - it's more one-offs,\" he said. DK Matai, the executive chairman of mi2g, said his company had noticed more cooperation between hacking groups in Morocco, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. \"They call for American troops to get out of Iraq, Israelis out of Palestine and Russians out of Chechnya,\" he said. \"We have seen a lot of attacks on multinational corporations in the G7 countries. Some of them are well known consumer brandnames and high street banks.\" Other network monitoring companies were sceptical. Message Labs, the email security company which filters messages on the internet, said the only traffic it had noticed increasing recently was unsolicited emails advertising Rolex watches for $99 (\u00a354).",
