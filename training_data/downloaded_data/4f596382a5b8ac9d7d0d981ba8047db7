  "content": "Hollywood couple Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas will begin their battle for damages against Hello! in the high court on July 16. The date was set today by Mr Justice Lindsay, the judge who ruled on April 11 that Hello!'s publication of unauthorised pictures of the couple's New York wedding in November 2000 breached their rights of confidence. Now the Douglases and OK!, which had signed a \u00a31m deal with the couple for exclusive coverage of the wedding ceremony and reception, are to fight for \u00a32.5m in damages at a hearing expected to last up to seven days. During the six-week high court hearing to determine liability, which has already cost \u00a33m in legal fees, Zeta Jones, 33, said she felt \"devastated, shocked and appalled\" when she realised a paparazzo had gatecrashed her wedding at the Plaza Hotel. She and her 58-year-old husband had signed the deal with OK! after turning down a higher offer from rival Hello!.",
