  "content": "Stan's Facebook page looks much like any other thirtysomething man's. He enjoys Holby City and snorkelling, has \"very liberal\" political views and lists \"women\" as his main interest. But Stan's interchangeable genitals, ability to become pregnant and the fact that he dies on a regular basis mark him out as no ordinary social networker. Stan is one of two hi-tech teaching aids at Bristol University's applied and integrated medical science department. He is a lifesize mannequin plugged into sophisticated software that controls his breathing, pulse, blink rate and pupil dilation. Academics use Stan to teach students about basic physiology and more advanced patient diagnosis scenarios. Bristol is one of only three universities in the world using the technology - and the only one in the UK. \"The basic software simulates someone who's called Mr Stan D Ardman or 'standard man', so he's a healthy individual,\" says Professor Judy Harris, head of teaching in physiology and pharmacology at Bristol. But Stan's software brain can be tweaked to simulate a range of conditions, including septic shock, massive blood loss and pregnancy. Using Stan, students can make mistakes without killing a real patient. \"We'd prefer if they didn't kill him. But it gets across the point that you can make mistakes and there are consequences,\" says Pete Dickens, the technician who operates Stan. It also means that hundreds of students can see exactly the same set of symptoms. \"We can't take 240 of them on to a ward and show them the same patient each time,\" Dickens says. Dickens is also the voice of Stan, and can interact with students via a speaker next to the dummy as if he is the patient. The software produces appropriate physiological changes as the patient improves or deteriorates.",
