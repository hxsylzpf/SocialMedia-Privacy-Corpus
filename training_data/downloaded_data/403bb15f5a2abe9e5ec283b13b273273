  "content": "In a rare partnership between Google and Facebook, the UK's Digital Debate has been running on both sites since the start of the election campaign. If you felt the TV debates process was too closed, then this might be more to your tastes. More than 5,300 questions were suggested on dedicated pages on both Facebook and YouTube, and the best put to party leaders Nick Clegg, Gordon Brown and David Cameron. From today, the answers are online and users can vote for the best responses and the overall winner - to be revealed on 3 May. Tax, the NHS and Afghanistan were the most popular questions, but they were also asked about the Digital Economy Act and mephedrone. More than 180,000 votes decided the top ten questions that would be put to the party leaders, including: \u2022 \"May I ask why only 20 people debated the Digital Economy Bill in the Commons despite a lot of opposition? May I also ask why then 200 MP's from Labour and Conservative rammed the Bill through despite opposition from normal people with normal lives?\" Dave, Coventry \u2022 \"The flaws in our financial system that led to the crisis remain unresolved. The city still recklessly speculates with borrowed money. What reforms will you introduce to ensure taxpayers never again bail out banks because they are too big to fail?\" Charlie Kechman, London \u2022 \"Using the extradition laws as an example, Would it be fair to say the \"special relationship\" we have with the USA isn't as beneficial to the UK as it is to the USA?\" Andrew, East Grinstead One that didn't make the grade: \u2022 \"What's your favourite type of Pokemon?\" Sheridan, Northumberland Among the answers on the Digital Economy Act, Brown recognised that future digital policy needs \"a lot more debate\", Cameron said the Act was \"rushed through too quickly\" while Clegg said it was \"a stitch-up\". The three all chose where their answers were shot: Brown was in front of a school, Cameron in that now familiar back garden and Clegg in front of a LibDems banner. Leading so far - Clegg, by a long way. And the voting system is a popular topic so far.",
