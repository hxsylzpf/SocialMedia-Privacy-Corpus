  "content": "The debate over who is best, the Beatles or the Cribs, is a rather silly one. After all, one of those groups made a series of groundbreaking albums, expanded the minds of a generation and influenced the direction of pop culture itself \u2013 the other just held up some traffic in north-west London while they fannied around shooting an album cover. But still, early last year I felt the need to commemorate the Wakefield trio's superiority over the Fabs on Twitter, and so conjured up the hashtag #cribsbetterthanbeatles. (For anyone considering music journalism as a career, think long and hard about whether you're equipped to handle this kind of breakneck lifestyle.) So imagine my joy, 18 months on, when I was informed on Twitter that the hashtag was still going \u2013 not just in the ephemeral world of social networking, but scrawled on the hallowed wall of Abbey Road studios itself! It was big news. Huge news. News so gargantuan in size and scope that I just had to see the hashtag for myself, if only to check I wasn't trapped within some thrilling dream so deep I was unable to pinch myself out of it. And so I left the office on a pilgrimage to Abbey Road \u2013 to hang out with giddy Japanese girls writing \"give peace a chance\" on the wall while locals drove past, their eyes glazed over with fantasies of one day running right through that zebra crossing with their foot down and their wipers on. It felt strange finally seeing the hashtag IRL. But there it was \u2013 inked freshly underneath a hand-drawn octopus and slightly to the left of the Imagine chorus scrawled in Portuguese. If you stepped back to admire the \"bigger picture\", it was also resting on the lip of a face that could \u2013 for those fairly relaxed about artistic realism \u2013 have been one of the Beatles. I stared at the hashtag for a few moments and felt an overwhelming sense of achievement. I was basically Malcolm McLaren, mischievously pulling pop culture's strings while a generation of willing puppets caused havoc and uproar on the streets of England. I have to admit I didn't know what to do next. Eventually I asked a Spanish tourist to photograph me. He was happy to do so, and only slightly less happy to do so a second time when I explained that I needed the whole of the hashtag in the shot. But then what? What does a guy do after he's made a pilgrimage to see a wall decorated in marker pen with something he tweeted while drunk almost two years ago and had it recorded for posterity by a confused European holidaymaker? I decided to go home. Truth be told, I had little choice \u2013 this journey had already eaten into my entire lunch break and 50 minutes of salaried Guardian time. And so I stomped triumphantly back towards the tube, past a man dressed as Sherlock Holmes who was in a very long queue for the Sherlock Holmes museum. This at least made me feel a bit better about how I'd chosen to spend my day.",
