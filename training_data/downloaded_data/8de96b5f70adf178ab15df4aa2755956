  "content": "I think we all felt, in a very real sense, terribly violated by those unauthorised photographs of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones's wedding celebration, now the subject of an important court case within which such issues as the privacy of the individual will be paramount. I felt particularly violated by that one shot of Michael shovelling pound after pound of wedding cake down Catherine's fat gullet - so much so, in fact, that I was forced to run to the post office and buy a copy of Hello! to ensure that I felt even more violated when faced with the picture in colour, and full-sized. And I did, I really did. I feel violated every time I look at it, which is very often, because it is now pinned up on the kitchen wall. It is an awful thing to feel so violated, don't you think? Maybe I should claim damages from this ghastly couple.",
