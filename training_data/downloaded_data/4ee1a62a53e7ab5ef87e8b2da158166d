WPP-owned research company Millward Brown puts Apple at number one in its annual top 100 global brand power list, Brandz, up from third place in 2009, with an 84% increase in its estimated value to $153bn (\u00a393bn). Apple ended Google's four year run at the top of the global brand power list, in a year when social media darling Facebook also made its debut in the top 100. However, the fallout of the Deepwater Horizon disaster dogged BP, which was one of the biggest fallers, down 30 places to 64th with a 27% drop in its brand value to $12bn. \"It is really the iPad that has driven [Apple's growing brand value], although the iPhone has continued to do magnificently too, and the development of apps,\" said Peter Walshe, global director of the Brandz report. Millward Brown's report, which balances brand power with financial performance, shrugged off the potential impact of Apple chief executive Steve Jobs' medical leave, instead focusing on the seemingly endless production line of must-have products Apple churns out. Walshe added that on measures examined within the report such as \"desirability\", Apple scores in the top 10 in the world and on a \"buzz\" scale \u2013 taking in mentions on blogs, message boards and tweets \u2013 it comes fourth behind Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Facebook made it onto the Millward Brown list for the first time \u2013 this is the sixth year the report has been published \u2013 having been held back in previous years by poor evidence of financial clout. The social networking service, which has attracted a valuation of $70bn and is expected to float next year, was ranked 35th with a 246% increase year-on-year in its estimated brand value from $5.5bn to $19bn. \"Facebook had a staggering year,\" said Walshe. \"Time will tell if the financial part of the estimate is stable or not.\" The most valuable brand in the UK was once again telecoms company Vodafone, which ranks 12th on the global list, with a value almost flat year-on-year at $43bn. Toyota, which was hammered in the 2009 Brandz report, with its brand value plummeting 28% after the mass recall of faulty cars, bounced back to be the most valuable car marque, up 11% to $24bn in 27th place. Amazon also moved up a place to 14th to pass Walmart, down two spots to 15th, and become the highest ranked retailer on the list. Amazon increased by 37% in brand value last year to $37bn. Chinese search engine Baidu rocketed 46 places to 29th with a 141% increase in brand value to $22bn. Top fallers included Nokia, which has embarked on a restructuring programme after failing to keep step with rivals Apple and Google, down 38 places to 81st with a brand value of $10.7bn, down 28% year-on-year. Nintendo dropped 47 places to 79th with a 37% fall in brand value to $11bn. TOP 10 Most Valuable Global Brands 1. Apple $153bn 2. Google $111bn 3. IBM $100bn 4. McDonald's $81bn 5. Microsoft $78bn 6.
