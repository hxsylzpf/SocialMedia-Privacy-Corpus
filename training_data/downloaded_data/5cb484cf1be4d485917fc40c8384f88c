  "content": "Maybe the row between Spotify and Taylor Swift is about more than streaming music royalties. Maybe it boils down to a deep disagreement over pets. That's one (yes, ridiculous, but wait until you see the data) conclusion to be drawn from a comparison of these two brands on market research firm YouGov's new Profiler web app, which launched this week. It enables you to plug in any brand, person or thing to see what data YouGov's surveys have thrown up on its typical customer or fan. It turns out Spotify fans are cat people, while Taylor Swift fans are dog people. There are more serious insights to be gleaned from the data when you plug in various technology brands, though. According to YouGov, Apple customers skew more female, are 25-39 years old, and tend to work in professions such as media and publishing, advertising, marketing and PR, and business. Their favourite sports are skiing, tennis and athletics; their hobbies include exercising, sports and cycling; their most likely pet is a fish; and they describe themselves as clever, funny and confident (but also control-freaky, headstrong and insecure). Apple fans' favourite dish is grilled halloumi. Their general interests include mobile applications; fashion, design and cosmetics; and people and celebrities. How about Samsung, Apple's great rival? They skew more male and are between the ages 40 and 59, with typical professions including transport and logistics, consulting and information technology. Their favourite activities include DIY, looking after pets and computer programming; their favourite sports are ski jumping and acrobatic gymnastics; and their general interests are cars and motoring, computers and technology, and science. On the plus side, their most likely pet is a fish too. They find toilet humour quite funny, and describe themselves as polite, far-sighted and paternal, although also disinterested, difficult and untidy. There's a wealth of data to be mined in the Profiler. Google fans? Male, 25-39 and working in education, IT and advertising, marketing and PR; favourite dish is miso soup; favourite hobby is trekking and hiking; general interest is \"websites\" and most likely pet is a cat. Microsoft? Male, aged over 60, and working in IT, engineering or consulting; preferring lamb shish and venison casserole; watching motorsports and rugby union, and interested in computers and technology, science, business and finance. They're fish people too. Facebook? These are 25- to 39-year-old women, working in advertising, marketing, PR, media and publishing; eating guacamole; playing video games, swimming and enjoying \"communicating with friends\". And cats. How about the Guardian? Left-leaning, cricket-playing, politics and women's issues experts working in education, media and publishing, and chowing down on antipasti, aubergine parmigiana and braised endives with their cats. Which, I suspect we can all agree, takes this data into the realms of undeniable fact.",
