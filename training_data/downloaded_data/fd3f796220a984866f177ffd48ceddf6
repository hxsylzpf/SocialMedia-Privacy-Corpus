The Widget Channel will make selected content and functionality from some of the biggest internet names available through an interactive bar at the bottom or side of the TV screen. A demonstration at the giant Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas late yesterday showed that MySpace users will be able to update their profiles, message friends, browse photos and post comments. The MySpace widget will sit alongside similar tools from the Yahoo-owned photo-sharing site Flickr, messaging service Twitter, and a host of mainstream content firms including CBS Interactive, MTV, Disney and Comcast. Additional widgets could also offer click-through advertising or web-based retail and a development platform to allow more external companies to build applications for the service. Yahoo's president of Connected TV, Patrick Barry, said the service would \"revolutionise\" TV by bringing web widgets to millions of people. \"By combining the key attributes of the internet, including openness, community, and personalisation with the power of television, the MySpace Widget for TV users will be able to take new advantage of a device they are incredibly familiar with \u2013 the television \u2013 to access their important MySpace features and information,\" Barry added. The Intel and Yahoo project was first revealed last summer. Powered by Intel's CE3100 media processor, the service will be made available on a series of TV sets, set-top boxes and through Blu-ray players. This move reflects a wider strategy among web content firms to make their services accessible from as many outlets as possible, including mobile phones and other through websites, but also to bring interactivity to the television. Yahoo also revealed at CES yesterday that it has produced a \"widget engine\" for a series of Samsung HDTV sets, which will offer information and content from Yahoo Finance, Flickr and USA Today. The Samsung HDTV sets will be available in 13 countries, including the UK, from this spring. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
