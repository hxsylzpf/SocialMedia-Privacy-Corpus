  "content": "For decades the internet has been inhabited by many different groups of people, ranging from newbies taking their first unsteady steps to the \"trolls\" who lurk in sometimes unexpected places. As with any large collection of people, groups tend to form around shared interests or outlooks \u2013 any website with a comment facility has the potential to form such a network, but strong communities are far more likely to form on forums and discussion boards that have a focus on a particular topic. Such sites can be created by anyone with internet access, with subjects ranging from the trivial to the profound. A very recent addition to the latter category is the Black Dog Tribe website, launched by comedian Ruby Wax to provide a safe haven for people suffering with depression. The site is currently at its beta stage of development, but the jewel in its crown is the user-generated content: the genuine voices of people who are affected by this illness. The forum is divided into subsections known as tribes, which range from the bluntly honest Caring is Wearing to the positive Recovery. An emphasis on community and shared experiences is invaluable when dealing with a condition that slowly saps away any feelings of connectedness and willingness to socialise. Someone who was thinking rationally would easily be able to withstand an ignored or ridiculed comment on a social network but depression has a habit of twisting reality into something terrifying \u2013 an overlooked status could morph from something innocuous into a damning indictment against the sufferer's personality and social worth. This effect is amplified when seeing pictures or statuses from other people apparently having the time of their lives at various social events. These feelings of isolation and inferiority can break down an already low level of self-esteem and generate resentment in people who are connected to someone with depression, but social networking can also help to regenerate this lost confidence and promote understanding of a common yet deeply misunderstood condition. The Black Dog Tribe website is a part of this initiative, helping to create a supportive environment where people can talk about depression without fear of being stigmatised and providing a starting point for creating strong social bonds. This gradual restoration and unity is especially important during a time when people with mental illness are often used as a scapegoat for political issues beyond an individual's control. Time spent recovering from worsening mental health is occasionally misinterpreted as laziness or skiving. I have been in this situation very recently after failing to get into university this year, spending time rebuilding my confidence with the help of medical professionals and trying to cope with strong side-effects from new medication. This wasn't the walk in the park some people are keen to portray long-term sickness as \u2013 it was a time filled with self-doubt and frustration which was worsened by seeing news stories about health assessments that completely failed to grasp the complexity of mental health problems. The recovery process is still a work in progress several months later; it doesn't suddenly stop as soon as we secure a new job or embark on a new path of education. I honestly wish it did, as I'm sure many other sufferers do, but this simply isn't the case. Sites such as Black Dog Tribe could play a key role in helping to overturn the stigma surrounding depression, especially when these views are being perpetuated by various members of the government. The dynamic nature of user-generated content holds formidable power in a culture that is increasingly shaped and influenced by technology, and this is especially prominent in various social networking sites which could potentially trigger a societal shift with enough support and publicity. Technology itself is of course neutral and like any other development it can either be used with good intentions or wielded maliciously to create harm and negativity. People at all levels of power can either help defend people who are in need or destroy them entirely with a single venomous comment, just as if they were talking to or about us in person. What effect people choose to have on the very real minds behind the usernames and statistics is entirely in their hands.",
