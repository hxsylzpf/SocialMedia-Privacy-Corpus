But the shrinking size of computer storage devices with ever-greater capacity has made customer data from company systems easy pickings. Blackberries, mobile phones with in-built storage and data pens and memory sticks that fit onto a key ring can be surreptitiously plugged into a computer port and used to steal bank account details, insurance information or even medical records. An iPod could be easily configured to behave like a regular hard disc, which, like other devices, is capable of stealing confidential data quickly. Analysis of data from the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit and the Small Business Service Analytical Unit by independent risk consulting firm Protiviti says computer-based crime costs UK businesses up to \u00a3270,000 an hour, or an average of more than \u00a3550 a business per year. And industry analyst Gartner says 70 per cent of security losses are as a result of insider activity. Banks and other large organisations use software applications to 'lock down' ports to stop unwanted peripherals downloading data. Hinkley and Rugby building society says it uses such software and bans iPods and other data-downloading equipment at its branches and head office. Barclays bank has implemented SecureWave's Sanctuary Device Control, which locks down USB ports and prevents all unauthorised connection of USB devices. There are also systems in place that will send a query to the IT department when an employee logs on to a system and tries to download information. Martha Bennett, vice president of European financial research service Forrester, says some steps being taken by banks, building societies, insurers and other financial organisations to stop data theft include: disabling USB ports and CD burners; prohibiting the use of portable media; stopping devices connecting to the network that have not been specifically vetted; encrypting data; prohibiting storage of personal data of any kind on any portable device; and restricting the sharing of data. Graeme Pitts-Drake, managing director of Prefix IT, which specialises in preventative software for small and medium-size (SME) firms, says such businesses are particularly vulnerable because they are rarely able to invest in the kinds of preventative measures that larger businesses can. 'The most common attitude among SMEs is to say they trust their staff, which clearly is no protection at all.' All companies have sensitive data, he points out, not just banks and insurers. Payroll and tax data is vulnerable and employers have a legal obligation to protect this. Indian outsourcers are reputed to routinely search call centre staff. But Susan Hall, partner with Cobbetts law firm, in Manchester, says a physical search is not the answer. 'Not only would it be an enormous breach of civil liberties to attempt to search employees for magnetic storage media, there are far too many legitimate reasons for employees to carry such items.' The battle against this kind of theft is ever-evolving. Forrester's Martha Bennett says people will always find a way of getting at confidential information if they really want to. 'As was said a long time ago, the only secure computer is encased in six feet of concrete without network connection. But companies can and must make it a lot more difficult than they are making it today'.",
