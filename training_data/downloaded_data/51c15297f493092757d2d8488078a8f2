  "content": "The Sydney Daily Telegraph changed its online coverage of the death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman following protests on Twitter. After people condemned the headline, \"Kids grieve for junkie actor dad\", as disrespectful, the paper changed it to \"Revealed: Seymour Hoffman's last hours\". That's reader power for you and, it should be said, a good example of editors responding appropriately to feedback (or a backlash - take your choice).",
