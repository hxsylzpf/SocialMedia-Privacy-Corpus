The likes of Mochimedia, Newgrounds and Kongregate are all attractive, well-populated portals filled with engaging browser titles, and all offer reasonable deals to programmers who want to gain ad revenue from their wares. What they don't offer is that unavoidable buzzword of contemporary interactive entertainment: user-generated content. Enter Platogo - a brand name tortuously hewn from the phrase 'PLAy TOGether Online'. It's a new Flash game portal, developed by a group of Austrian coders who secured funding from Departure, Vienna city council's rather moddish entrepreneurial fund. Designed to resemble a social networking site (you know, lots of pastel colours, cute creatures, friendly language), it promises a new take on the browser entertainment business, offering a range of games with level editors, allowing users to create their own designs before uploading them for other users to play and rate. You'll need to register on the site, or hook up via Facebook Connect, before you can start tinkering with your own designs, but you can then develop, save and share your creations with a like-minded community. \"Today marks our second day online,\" says chief marketing officer, Simone Haider. \"We officially launched yesterday at 6:00 am. Before that, we had been in private beta for two weeks: in this period, we had about 8000 visits and a peak of 105 concurrent players on Platogo. So far, there have been more than 15,000 plays of user-generated levels.\" At the moment, there's only a handful of titles on there \u2013 one, Veggie Snake, was produced in-house, the rest have come from external developers - notably Exploit, by respected indie/Flash coder Gregory Weir. Naturally, the Platogo team hopes that more developers come onboard, attracted by the chance to share between 25-50% of the ad revenues from each game (it looks like revenues rise toward the latter figure if you include more features, such as UGC). \"Our plan is to release about one new game every week,\" says Haider. \"Right now, we have some rather interesting projects in the pipeline. Among them is a brand new game produced by Platogo. Another one is a novel title by LorenzGames (from Dynamic Systems fame) which cannot be found on any other gaming portal yet.\" There are questions marks over how much advertising revenue there is in the market at the moment, of course - especially via a start-up service. Right now, there are no in-game ads in place; the focus instead is on gaining ad revenue via exterior sources. \"Concerning banners, we are co-operating with an Austrian advertising network,\" says Haider. \"Globally, we're using Google AdWords at the moment but we're aiming to find an international advertising partner in the near future.\" Programmers can, however, introduce micro-transactions into their projects, from which they draw revenues of 70%. And gaining revenues from the gamers themselves can be a surer way to make money - especially if the game is good. Earlier this year, Gamasutra ran an article on Flash game revenues, and mentioned one coder who ended up making a \"six-figure\" income in a matter of months from his game Fantastic Contraption when he added a paid-for level editor. At the moment, the games are all simple physics-based puzzlers and versions of popular casual titles like Snake. It'll be interesting to see if more complex fare is gradually introduced \u2013 like browser versions of, say, LittleBigPlanet or Trackmania. Meanwhile, another key aim is to grow the whole community element. \"Among other things, we're focusing on extending our Facebook integration,\" says Haider. \"Furthermore, there will be a personal activity stream for each Platogo user, to keep him or her informed about what is going on at Platogo, e.g. which games are being played by his friends, has someone beaten his or her high score, has someone commented on a level he or she has created, etc. We also want to improve the possibilities for our users to interact with each other on the website.\" It's a fascinating endeavour, and there seems to be a real emphasis on quality rather than quantity - the UGC stuff is also nicely implemented in the games I've played. Have a look and see what you think though \u2013 it could be a more creative way of blowing your lunch hour than playing Desktop Defense for the millionth time...",
