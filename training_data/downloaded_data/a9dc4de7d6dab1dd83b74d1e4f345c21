  "content": "Dominic Mohan, the editor of the Sun, will return to give further evidence to the Leveson inquiry next week \u2013 with News International expecting him to be asked questions about the tabloid's daily Page 3 pictures of topless models. The surprise recall of Mohan in part follows evidence given to the inquiry last week by four women's groups, which argued that newspapers such as the Sun should ban \"sexualised images\" that they say would not broadcast on television before the 9pm watershed. Women's groups who made submissions to Leveson welcomed the news. Suvi Ramu of Object, a group which campaigns against the objectification of women, said that it was a watershed moment and the opportunity could not be lost. \"None of the editors who use these images have ever been questioned or challenged at this type of level before. For this to happen at the Leveson inquiry is groundbreaking,\" Ramu added. Holly Dustin, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said it was \"highly significant\" that the editor of the Sun was going to be questioned about the \"routine sexualisation and objectification of women\" at a major judicial inquiry. \"This signals a breakthrough in the way in which we as a society are beginning to understand the impact of women's treatment in the media and reflects the broader concerns being raised by women's groups and MPs, amongst others,\" she said. The Sun has been printing photographs of topless women on page 3 since November 1970, the first anniversary of the tabloid relaunching under Rupert Murdoch's ownership. Its existence has long been controversial, and former Labour MP Clare Short tried and failed to introduce a private member's bill banning the feature back in 1986. Short said this was a serious opportunity to make a change. \"The presentations to Leveson were very considered, serious and sensible. The bottom line here is that pictures that would not be permissible in the workplace or on broadcast media before the watershed can still be published in a daily newspaper.\" The fact that Mohan was being recalled and would be questioned about Page 3 pictures suggested Leveson had not \"dismissed the idea of making recommendations\", she said. \"If this is the case it is very good news. Since 1986 the standards of society have moved on, now the question is: can the press catch up?\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
