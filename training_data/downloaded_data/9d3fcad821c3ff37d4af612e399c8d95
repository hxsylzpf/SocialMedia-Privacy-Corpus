  "content": "Email overload has become a severe problem. In fact, in the past couple of years the problem has become so immense that the internet itself got overloaded with tips on how to get rid of it. Within easy reach, for example, are at least five ways of dealing with email overload, six tips for reducing email overload, 12 steps to getting control of your email inbox, or the secret to dealing with email overload, apart from several startup companies devoted to delivering a program that helps you manage your email. Yes, it is official: email is hell, especially when workers return from their holidays. In fact, email has killed holidays for some employees in their former sense \u2013 the sense of forgetting about work. These days, instead of clearing the mind of work during holidays, it is easy for people to succumb to the temptation to reach for the BlackBerry or laptop and clear out the inbox, to avoid having hundreds of emails on their the return to work. A former boss had the trick of simply not looking at the mail that was sent while he was away. He always said that if the mail was important, it would be re-sent. However, not everybody is a boss. And now there might be hope for the rest of us. Enter Twitter and Facebook, which may lead us out of our misery. At first sight, Twitter and Facebook seem to confront us with more information, not less. However, there is an important cultural difference: email never managed to entirely distance itself from its associations with the traditional \"snail mail\" letter. New email did the work of the old mail \u2013 but unfortunately better Certain aspects of email were always handled with a similar cultural approach as to letters, especially reading them. A delivered letter was a delivered message. The world didn't care if you refused to open your bills, divorce papers, or birthday cards. The message was delivered, therefore the message was valid. This culture of posting was passed from the old media letter to the new media email. What happened was what the Canadian communication theorist Marshall McLuhan famously once described: \"In the name of progress, our official culture is striving to force the new media to do the work of the old.\" And we gave in to that force, and started to deal with emails as if they were letters: they had to be opened and read. Only there was a lot more of them, and most of them were not as important as divorce papers, bills or even birthday cards. However, people expected you to read the emails, and being afraid to miss out on birthday wishes, we all obeyed. There seemed to be nothing to stop the flood of email. While physical mail is often expensive to send out, cheap, fast and direct email is easy to use. Always. Whenever. By anyone. Emails \u2013 and spam, in particular \u2013 have proliferated like an animal that has no natural enemies. While sending a letter was once a private act, sending an email has became a cut-copy-multiple-recipient-mass-mailout. This is where Facebook and Twitter can be a relief, as their cultural habit of dealing with a message is fundamentally different. You don't have to keep up with messages on Twitter and Facebook Thanks to social media, the privacy of a message has been reintroduced. Tweets and status updates might tell everyone how you feel, but nobody feels obliged to keep track of them all. What a relief! So if you decide, for example, not to use Twitter during your holiday for fear your significant other confronts you with a screaming fit, you can come back home, open Twitter and ... you have to keep up with nothing. Life can be so easy. After your holiday, you simply come back and start all over as if nothing has happened. You don't have to read all the tweets or status updates you missed, because you never had to read any tweets or status updates at all in the first place. You might have a look at your \"mentions\" in Twitter, because managing your reputation is part of work these days, but that's about it. Facebook and Twitter have cleaned up the email mess. While it may look, at first glance, as if these systems steal a lot of your time with irrelevant information, they are actually doing the opposite. Furthermore, since you can only get direct messages from people or accounts that you find interesting and decide to add or follow, both systems constrain the numbers of possible senders. Twitter will only forward a message from a person you follow, and the new privacy settings on Facebook allow you to only get messages from friends. Spamming? Once again impossible, or at least embarrassing. Think of the endless times you tried in vain to get off an email list. On Facebook or Twitter, no one will ever spam you, and if so they will have to do it in public, and you can simply unfollow or unfriend or block that account. Do we want the barrier of social introduction back? Sure, being able to contact someone will become a bit harder. It will be like in the old days, where people were only able to talk to each other after being introduced. Again, you'll have to ask friends to make a contact, or establish it by mention @her or @him on Twitter. In that way, your friends and followers will become the effective spam filter we always waited for. In fact, Yahoo Mail just introduced the feature to highlight email from your friends \u2013 and tells you with it forget about the rest. Years ago Marshall McLuhan wrote the sentence: \"One of the effects of living with electric information is that we live habitually in a state of information overload. There's always more than you can cope with.\" Social media finally seems to take that into account. Yes, please, save me from my email. Will email survive till 2020? And how do you handle email?
