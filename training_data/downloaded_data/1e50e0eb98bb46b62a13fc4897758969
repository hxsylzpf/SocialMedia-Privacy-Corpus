  "content": "A high-voltage row between media and politicians will explode today when a select committee calls for a privacy law, a system of media fines and an independent ombudsman to protect the British public from an over-intrusive media. The culture select committee, chaired by Gerald Kaufman, is to tell the press complaints commission (PCC) to give evidence annually on the progress it is making to clamp down on media excesses. One MP on the committee described the PCC as \"an absolutely dreadful institution\", and the committee's solutions as \"ambitious\". The MPs will call for a privacy law, citing the recent ruling by Mr Justice Lindsay in a case involving Hello! magazine in which he asked parliament to clarify the law of privacy and confidentiality. The magazine had been accused of breaching the privacy of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas by using paparazzi photos of their wedding - they won their case under confidentiality and data protection laws. Although the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, has rejected a privacy law, some MPs believe last week's reshuffle, especially the departure of Lord Irvine as lord chancellor, will make a privacy law more attractive within government. The committee will also point out that a de facto privacy law is in danger of being built in Britain by judges applying the privacy clauses in the Human Rights Act on a case-by-case basis. The committee's recommen dations will also name editors, expected to include Rebekah Wade of the News of the World and latterly of the Sun, who, they say, have been guilty of stepping beyond the self-regulatory code. The PCC, now headed by Sir Christopher Meyer, a former ambassador to Washington, started its fightback last night by threatening to take MPs to their own parliamentary ombudsman, the par liamentary commissioner for standards, Sir Philip Mawer, for failing to conduct their inquiry properly. The PCC's lawyers claim the MPs did not interview the full range of witnesses and also improperly conducted some cross-examinations in private. The committee was guilty of \"false allegations, failure to call a balanced group of witnesses and lack of due process\".",
