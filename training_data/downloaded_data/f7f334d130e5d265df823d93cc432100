  "content": "On 6 May, millions of people across the county will head to the polling booths to cast their vote. Tens of thousands of them use Twitter. The Guardian is teaming up with Tweetminster, Channel 4, and the New Statesman to map the day's action \u2013 and we need your help. When you head out to vote on Thursday, tweet #ukvote alongside the first half of your post code (for example #ukvote EH1) and we will plot votes in real time on a map. We're not asking you to include who you're voting for \u2013 that's a secret you don't need to share. The map and data will be made available online and anyone will be able to easily add it to their site. We will also showcase a regional breakdown of turnout. The goal of the experiment is to inspire more people to vote and to help get a sense of turnout (on Twitter at least) during the course of the day and across the country. The experiment is inspired by a similar initiative around the hashtag #uksnow. We'll tweet a reminder ahead of the big day. In the mean time, thanks for your help.",
