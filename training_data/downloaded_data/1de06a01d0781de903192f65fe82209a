  "content": "ITV has dropped the threat of legal action against Channel 4 over its Dispatches sting on Coronation Street stars. The broadcaster threatened to sue Channel 4 over suggestions the soap's actors had flouted marketing rules by promoting products on Twitter in return for free gifts. ITV said on Wedneday that it intended to take no further action against Channel 4 and claimed Dispatches had dropped a number of \"the most serious and defamatory allegations\" from the film, which aired on Monday night. But that was contested by Channel 4, which denied it had made any \"substantial editorial changes\" to the programme \u2013 Celebs, Brands and Fake Fans \u2013 before it went out. Dispatches showed a number of Coronation Street stars, including Brooke Vincent, who plays Sophie Webster, being covertly filmed receiving fake beauty products from a fictitious firm set up by filmmakers. Some of the actors later tweeted about the products, which included fake \"mystique spray\" and a bottle of toner that contained only water. An ITV spokesman said: \"We took legal steps which resulted in Dispatches making changes to its final programme last night \u2013 a number of the most serious and defamatory allegations against those featured were not broadcast. \"If any Coronation Street viewers happened to be watching the last part of this hour-long special they would have seen it for what it was \u2013 a stunt.\" Details of the show first emerged in June, prompting ITV lawyers to write to Channel 4 warning that airing the claims would land them with a hefty libel action brought by the company and its stars. A week before the film aired, ITV's legal director, Andrew Garard, privately accused Channel 4 of \"shoddy journalism\" in a sharply-worded letter to the broadcaster. A Channel 4 spokesman said: \"We firmly stand by our journalism. It is worth noting that our investigation did not set out to target any specific celebrity or broadcaster. As ever, we followed the journalistic trail. \"Standard right-to-reply procedures were followed, but no substantial editorial changes were made to the structure of the programme.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
