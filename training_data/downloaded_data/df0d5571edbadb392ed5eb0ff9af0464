  "content": "When the web was new, a lot of people kept lists of the sites they wanted to remember, and these were the forerunners of terse \"web logs\" such as Jorn Barger's Robot Wisdom. Eventually, the idea evolved into blogs, firing a revolution in personal publishing that has swept the world. But for people who still hanker after the old way of doing things, there are now \"micro-blogging\" sites, such as Tumblr. Many people find blogging takes too much time and effort. However, it can still be useful to have a place to post links, comments, quotations, photos and drawings that you want to share with friends. And while you can do that on Blogger, it's simpler to use Tumblr. Times have changed since web logs were plain text, so Tumblr offers another six menu options: photo, quote, link, chat, audio and video. If you click on, for example, the video icon, that brings up a template with space for a link (you can upload a video from your hard drive, or paste in a link to a video site such as YouTube) and a brief caption. That's it. It takes less than a minute to sign up at Tumblr: you just have to enter a screen name, an email address, and a password. After that, it can take less than a minute to make a post, if you have something in mind. It's about as easy as online publishing gets. Of course, most people will want to go further. Clicking Tumblr's customise button lets you change to a different page design or \"theme\". There are some simple word-processing options if you want to change the look of the text. It's also possible to link in to external applications, or to add your tumblelog to an external web page. As with blogging systems, Tumblr also provides a bookmarklet so you can post from your web browser, and you can also post from a mobile phone. But Tumblr also has another interesting feature, called following. You can decide to follow any other tumblelogs you like, and after that, their posts will appear on your dashboard screen inside Tumblr. Your friends or fans can also choose to follow you, to see what you are doing, and can even \"reblog\" your posts. You can attract a fan base, or create a private Tumblr group and invite only friends or colleagues. If you don't have anyone to follow, you can always add David's tumblelog by clicking the Follow button at davidslog.com or by pasting in the address. You wouldn't know this just from signing up, but 21-year-old David Karp founded Tumblr last year. It's not even his first startup, so he looks like someone to watch. If you're not sure whether tumblelogging is for you, there's an alphabetical list of tumblelogs at The Tumblelist. Try a few. Be inspired. Today, Tumblr occupies an interesting niche somewhere between Facebook's Wall and full-spec blogging systems. But it has the potential to become very big indeed.",
