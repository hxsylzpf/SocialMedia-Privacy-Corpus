  "content": "Hello! magazine's Spanish owner today accused Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas of seeking money not privacy when they sold their wedding pictures to rival publication OK! for \u00a31m. Eduardo Sanchez Junco is facing a claim for damages totalling \u00a32.25m after publishing sneaked photographs from the wedding. The Hollywood stars, who are claiming \u00a3500,000 from Hello! for breach of privacy, told the high court earlier this week they felt \"violated\" and \"deeply offended\" that a paparazzo photographer had gatecrashed their wedding at the New York Plaza Hotel in November 2000. They insisted they had struck an exclusive deal with OK! in an attempt to minimise media intrusion at the event, and Ms Zeta Jones said that \u00a31m was \"not that much\" for the Hollywood couple. However, Mr Sanchez told the court through an interpreter that the Douglases had sold the rights to their wedding not to protect their privacy but to make money. He claimed the couple's publicist, Allen Burry, had used Hello! to raise the price paid for exclusive coverage of the wedding. \"The wedding was offered to various media, including ourselves, not in order to maintain privacy but solely in order to establish competition which would raise the price for exclusivity.\" \"Exclusivity is not the way to maintain privacy, nor is exclusivity granted for that purpose.\" Mr Sanchez, whose company has published Hola!, the original Spanish version of Hello!, for more than 50 years, said he had dealt with many couples who wanted to sign an exclusive deal for their wedding. \"Celebrities choose to reach agreements with Hello! magazine for exclusive coverage of their weddings for a number of different reasons. This understandably includes a desire to have the expenses of their weddings paid for, and in fact often provides them with the opportunity to make a profit as well as allowing them to obtain controlled publicity.\" \"For some, the opportunity of protecting their image is closely linked to their aim of securing good publicity. However, for those who wish to protect their privacy, a feature in a magazine does not achieve that - bearing in mind in particular that photographs may be syndicated worldwide to other publications.\" Celebrities who did not want their wedding publicised - like Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston and Madonna and Guy Ritchie - all chose not to reach agreements with magazines, Mr Sanchez said. \"The result was much less media interest in their weddings than that attracted by the claimants.\" He said his solicitors had tried to find articles about the weddings of Richard Gere and Jamie Oliver, who did not sign deals. \"They were so effective at keeping their weddings a secret that no articles about those weddings have been found.\" OK! magazine, which is seeking \u00a31.27m from Hello! for the commercial damage caused by its spoiler, has claimed that Hello! offered the Douglases \u00a31.5m for exclusive rights to their wedding pictures.",
