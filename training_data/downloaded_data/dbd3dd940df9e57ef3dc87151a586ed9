  "content": "It was inevitable that the social messaging service Twitter would start attracting mainstream coverage when the celebrities piled in, and Stephen Fry has to take the credit, or possibly the blame, for some of that. But Fry stuck in a lift, or Jonathan Ross revealing his chatshow guests, is a new phenomenon for a service that has quickly become a must-do for the tech community since it launched in July 2006. So who are these Twitterers, and what do they do? Research by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project shows that 76% use the internet on their mobile, compared to around 59% of the rest of the online US population. Twitterers are more active in social media generally, and 27% are likely to blog, more than twice the national online average. Although Twitter is very popular with 18-24s (19% of users), 20% of users are aged between 25 and 34. The median age is 31, older than Facebook's 26 and MySpace's 27. Twitter won't reveal its user numbers, but recent well-educated guesses put the regular monthly audience at no more than 6 million globally. The results show Twitterers are less likely to read printed news, but 76% are likely to read a newspaper online, compared with 60% of non-Twitterers, and 14% will read news on their mobile compared with 6%. We shouldn't be surprised that Twitter is being used to discuss, and in some cases report, breaking news, says Om Malik, a veteran tech reporter on the GigaOM blog. \"Twitter is just one channel where people communicate. It's a megaphone for the planet, so why are we so surprised when people send messages on it?\" Where you might have phoned your friends before, now you'll Twitter them instead. Although the media may consider Twitter as a publishing tool, it is still essentially a communication platform. What it provides is a constructive, two-way medium that allows individuals to share ideas and make connections. Malik says: \"In a world where we have access to an infinite amount of information, [the journalist] can hold my hand and say: 'This is what you need to read.'\"",
