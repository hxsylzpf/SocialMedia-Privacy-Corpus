  "content": "After School is the latest anonymous messaging app to explode in popularity in the US, fuelled by students in particular. \"After School is an anonymous and private message board for your school. Post confessions, funny experiences, compliments, and more,\" suggests its App Store listing. But, as with previous anonymous apps \u2013 from Secret to Yik Yak \u2013 there has been growing discussion that After School's anonymity is fuelling cyberbullying. The app was actually removed from Apple's App Store late last week at Apple's request before returning with new features to prevent bullying \u2013 for example, by enabling users to flag such messages for removal by moderators. So, here's the question: when presented with an anonymous messaging app, will some teenagers inevitably turn to cyberbullying? Is this worse than what happens on decidedly-unanonymous social networks like Facebook? Parents' and teachers' views are welcome on this point. What should app developers be doing to be as responsible as possible in this area? The comments section is open for your thoughts. What else is up for discussion today in the technology world? Some links: Royal Mail to test 3D printing \"From now until January at the New Cavendish Street delivery office in London, users will be able to purchase and print digital items from MyMiniFactory.com and royalmail.com to be delivered by Royal Mail, or picked up from the iMakr Store. Additionally, the partners will print customers' own designs, as well.\" RIP video games pioneer Ralph Baer \"The result was a detailed four-page outline for a \"game box\" that would allow people to play board, action, sports and other games on almost any American television set. An intrigued boss gave him $2,000 for research and $500 for materials and assigned two men to work with him.\" Could Europe really break up Google? \"By charging Google with antitrust offenses, the Commission can take any measures it deems necessary to end that infringement. Could that really include a break-up of Google? In theory, yes \u2013 the European Commission's antitrust division has the right to force a company operating in the region to restructure. But Wagner-von Papp is willing to make a big bet that it won't happen.\" Why big tech firms create programming languages \"Google has Go, first conceived in 2009. Facebook introduced Hack last spring. And Apple unveiled Swift not long after. In war, as George Orwell had it, the winners write the history books. In tech, the winning companies are writing the programming languages. The Internet was built on open standards and code, but the era of social networks and the cloud is dominated by corporate giants. And they are beginning to put their unique stamps on the thought-stuff of digital technology.\" What else?
