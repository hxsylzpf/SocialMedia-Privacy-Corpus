  "content": "\"Listen,\" sang Billy J Kramer, \"Do you want to know a secret?\" Generally the answer is positive. This Lennon and McCartney composition, however, asked a second question: \"Do you promise not to tell?\" In a world apparently keener on disclosing secrets than maintaining them, Billy J's second question is more likely to be answered, \"It depends.\" How far, then, can we legally protect our secrets? Confidentiality can be implied in relationships involving good faith, such as employment, partnership, agency or the handling of client affairs. The information itself must have the necessary quality of confidence about it and be unpublished. Secrets have to be treated as secret. The second way confidentiality is imposed is by contract, typically in the form of a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement (NDA). This is a normal part of business negotiations for a host of media and commercial contracts. Confidentiality is part of a relationship of mutual responsibility. Most people will keep to their bargains, although some need reminders. When Ros Mark, the ex-nanny, found that her intended disclosure of the Blairs' family life was not acceptable to her employers, her publishing aspirations were rapidly curtailed by injunction. Her contract contained an explicit confidentiality clause and the Blairs had always been ardent in protecting their children from unnecessary publicity. This case is perhaps a model for those wishing to avoid unwanted exposure. John Lennon, too, finally had his victory when Yoko Ono recently won a long battle preventing a former PA from exploiting photographs of Lennon and son, Sean, taken shortly before the star's death. The confidentiality agreement went back 23 years. An injunction is only a preliminary judgment to preserve the status quo until full trial, but in practice it is nor mally the end of the case. The picture changes once the information becomes public, which is why an injunction, preventing further disclosure, is often the necessary remedy. Even if the discloser could pay substantial damages, the loss involved is difficult to quantify. Once the secret is out, the victim has little effective redress, and could finish up fighting, possibly up to the highest courts, not just the impecunious discloser but a major news group which has bought the story. Court history is also littered with failed applications, such as those by Garry Flitcroft and Naomi Campbell, the footballer failing because his sexual cavorting was all too public, the supermodel because she denied an addiction that it was later established she had. An injunction is a remedy at the discretion of the court at the best of times, but it has to be a brave figure in the public eye who has the nerves, the purse and the cast-iron case to justify the risk. In the Douglas case against Hello! magazine, the world knew of the Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones marriage, but the wedding party was covered by a bridal veil. The court accepted that the confidentiality of the occasion had been understood by and accordingly bound all who attended. Here, although confidentiality was the cornerstone of the case, the issues had little to do with secret information and everything to do with image control. How far, then, do obligations of confidentiality go? If, for example, an aspiring politician is drawn into an illicit private romp, would the signing of a confidentiality agreement by the other party (or parties) before the vital moment give legal protection? In principle, perhaps, yes; indeed the judge in the Flitcroft case held that sexual relationships are, by their nature, confidential, and to be pro tected. This partly extends the concept of the confidential nature of married life set down in the case of the Duke and Duchess of Argyll in 1964. But if the secrets reveal dishonesty by those in high places or those pretending to be different, public interest seems to demand, and the courts to support, that even express confidentiality should not prevent free expression. The more stories sell for cash, the more people are tempted to reveal secrets. There are claims of moral dimensions, allegations of double standards or danger to the public levelled against those to be exposed. But how many of these justifications stand up to scrutiny and how many are really driven by personal gain or revenge? These questions are surely relevant if we are to develop our sense - and our jurisprudence - of what really is \"the public interest\" as opposed to matters of human curiosity, a distinction that currently seems dangerously blurred in law. Ultimately, the erosion of mutual confidence risks eating away at the social mix as surely as deceit and depravity in high places. The balance will always be shifting, but wholesale loss of trust ultimately risks a world of lonely people. Confidentiality obligations are alive and well, if you have the position and the gall to claim the privilege. Perhaps all aspiring prime ministers being propositioned should be armed with a ready NDA, but be prepared for ever after not to promote family values. None of us wants to be a lonely person, but we also need to remember the risks of the wrong kind of company or seeking company for the wrong kind of reason. \u00b7 Charles Boundy is a partner at Fladgate Fielder",
