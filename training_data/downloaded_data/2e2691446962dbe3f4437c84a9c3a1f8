  "content": "David Cameron's national security adviser has put Whitehall on alert for the possibility of a cyber-attack on government websites after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange makes a court appearance today. Sir Peter Ricketts has spoken to permanent secretaries about the security of government websites amid fears that the government may be targeted by supporters of Assange, who will try to win his release today after being held on remand after Sweden requested his arrest over allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. A Downing Street spokesman said yesterday that the security priority would be \"websites where we are dealing with information that belongs to members of the public\", amid fears that supporters could target sites such as Revenue and Customs or the Department of Work and Pensions, which hold the personal details of millions of people. Last week, the Swedish government's website was forced offline as was the office of the Swedish prosecutor. The Times reported today that supporters of Assange have threatened to turn their sights on the UK government if the WikiLeaks founder is extradited to Sweden. A series of cyber-attacks have been conducted over the past week by networks of hackers in support of WikiLeaks under the codename Anonymous. Hacktivists have targeted several corporations as part of Operation Payback, including MasterCard, Visa, PayPal and Amazon over their failure to support WikiLeaks.",
