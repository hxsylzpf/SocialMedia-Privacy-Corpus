  "content": "A study has found that technology-savvy young people are connected to an average of 84 internet users through websites such as Facebook and MySpace. However, less than 10% would be caught using media industry jargon such as \"social networking\" and \"web 2.0\". On a global level, the study - Circuits of Cool/Digital Playground - found that 14- to 24-year-olds have on average 53 people they consider to be online \"friends\". Just six of those 53 are real-world, close friends on average, the study revealed, and a further 27 form a wider circle of friendly acquaintances. The remaining 20 come from online relationships but are considered to be proper friends despite the fact they have never met in person. When it comes to using instant messenger, the average 14- to 24-year-old globally has 78 \"buddies\" - as well as being a member of up to three social networking websites, connected to 84 people. However, there are regional variations. In the UK, young people tended to avoid industry jargon, only 8% used the term \"multiplatform\", 9% \"social networking\" and 5% \"web 2.0\". The most common digital terms recognised by the study's UK respondents are those relating to accessing content, such as \"download\" and \"burn\". Of young people canvassed for the survey in the UK, 61% said they could not live with without a mobile and 80% said the same about computers. In Brazil, the teen and 20-something demographic had a massive 239 friends connected via social networking websites and 136 internet messaging buddies. But in Japan, where mobiles are preferred to PCs for most contact, the average young person has just 18 social networking contacts and 27 internet messaging buddies. The international study, commissioned by MTV and Nickelodeon in association with Microsoft Digital Advertising Solutions, canvassed 18,000 young people from 16 countries, studying habits across 21 different media and devices including TV, mobile, instant messenging and the internet. It found that young people have on average 57 music tracks on their mobile phones, and only 14% of those surveyed regularly use their mobiles to talk to friends, instead preferring to use it for activities including taking pictures and texting. Despite the increasing adoption of a digital lifestyle the study found that a lot of what young people do has not drastically changed in the last 15 years. The Digital Playground element of the study found that among seven- to 14-year-olds, 85% said the thing they like doing most was watching TV, followed by listening to music, at 70%, and hanging out with friends at 68%. Fifty-one per cent said they spent time online. In the older demographic surveyed for the Circuits of Cool element of the survey, 70% of 14- to 24-year-olds said they listened to music, while the pastimes of watching TV and hanging out with friends both scored 65%. Just over half, 56%, used the internet. \"The survey revealed a strong dynamic between TV and the internet, especially for 14- to 24-year-olds,\" said Andy Davidson, the vice-president of Viacom Brand Solutions International Insight at MTV. \"Young people watch TV for stress relief, 60% of the sample said they watched most of their TV lying down,\" he added. \"The internet, on the other hand, is cognitive and active especially if kids are using it for homework or social situations.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
