  "content": "US Airways managed a doozy of a Twitter fail on Monday when it accidentally tweeted a pornographic image in a reply to a customer. The American airline tweeted the explicit image to an unhappy customer by mistake \u2013 but it took the firm nearly an hour to remove the post. It's not the first time a corporate company has fallen foul of social media. Here are five of the biggest corporate Twitter fails: 1. #AskBG Top tip for British Gas here: it's perhaps unwise to ask Twitter what they think of the company the very same day they announced an energy price hike of 9.2%. Except in October, they did exactly that. What started as an innocent Q&amp;A with British Gas' customer service director Bert Pijls soon turned into a Twitter free-for-all. Following the Q&amp;A, a spokesman said: \"We always value interaction with our customers.\" 2. Angry HMV employee tweets during firing If you're about to fire someone, it might be a good idea to change your company's Twitter password. HMV learnt this the hard way after an angry employee used the company's official Twitter account to tweet about mass layoffs at the company. A woman named Poppy Rose Cleere, formerly the company's social media planner, later identified herself as the HMV employee behind the tweets. In a series of tweets, she said she felt someone had to speak and claimed senior employees \"never seemed to grasp\" the importance of social media. A pub in Oxfordshire found itself in a similar situation after it sacked its head chef. Jim Knight was fired as the head chef of The Plough after he asked for Christmas Day off \u2013 except the pub forgot that he had access to its official Twitter account. 3. MasterCard's #PricelessSurprises It was meant to be a great campaign for MasterCard, coinciding with the Brits. They'd lined up all sorts of stars for videos, pictures and tweets before and during the ceremony. Except the PR company managed to wind up a journalist at a national newspaper by attempting to tell him what he should tweet in return for accreditation to cover the event. The demands sent by House PR included suggestions for tweets before, during and after the event, all with the hashtag #PricelessSurprises. After the story broke on Press Gazette, the promoted hashtag was soon the home of much mirth and mocking from journalists and the public alike. Bear in mind, you have to pay Twitter for a promoted tweet. Ouch. 4. Tesco \"hits the hay\" after the horsemeat scandal It wasn't exactly the best couple of days for Tesco's social media team after it was revealed the supermarket had sold burgers containing horsemeat. It got a little bit worse after the social media account tweeted an unfortunate and unintended pun: The customer care account later tweeted its apologies: 5. #susanalbumparty It was meant to be an invite to the launch of Susan Boyle's new album. Instead, an unfortunate hashtag meant Twitter was invited to an entirely different kind of party than the one the singer's PR team had in mind. Debunking site Is Twitter Wrong? tracked down the original tweet from Susan Boyle's official Twitter account, noting it was hastily changed to the more family-friendly #SusanBoyleAlbumParty. By then, it was definitely too late and there were mock-invites to Susan's party popping up left, right and centre. Of course, we're sure there are plenty more where those came from.
