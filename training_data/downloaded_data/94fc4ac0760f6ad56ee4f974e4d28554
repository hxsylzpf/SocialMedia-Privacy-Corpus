  "content": "Officials in the pro-UK Better Together campaign have said they are preparing a formal complaint to the Scottish charities regulator after the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign admitted it made an undisclosed payment to an academic to write a favourable newspaper article. The pro-independence campaign, however, insisted the row over its payment to Elliot Bulmer, research director for the Scottish constitutional commission, which describes itself as a politically neutral charity, was a distraction from a far more serious scandal about the alleged hacking of its emails. Yes Scotland made a formal complaint to Police Scotland last week alleging that the information about the fee to Bulmer, thought to be \u00a3100 for a pro-independence opinion piece in the Herald newspaper, came after the personal email account of a campaign official was hacked. Yes Scotland sources said the police and BT security experts are convinced the personal webmail account, which was also being used for Yes Scotland business, was illegally accessed. Detectives have spent several days this week in the campaign's offices in Glasgow and Yes Scotland posted a note on its Twitter feed stating it had suspended social media activity for an IT security check. The Daily Record reported one source claimed the police had traced the alleged hacking to a foreign IP address, and that it appeared to have been systematic. Alex Salmond, the first minister, said earlier this week the hacking allegation was a \"very, very serious matter indeed\", and linked it to the Guardian's exposure of systematic hacking by the News of the World. Warning the police investigation limited what people could say, Salmond added: \"What I would say is this: if it turns out, and of course it's still to be determined, that a newspaper has been involved in some way, given everything that's happened over the last few years with illegal hacking and the whole scandal that erupted from that; if that turns out to be the case then it would be a very, very serious matter indeed.\" Yes Scotland attempted to dampen down the controversy around the payment to Bulmer by insisting it was a \"small fee\" which it had been happy to disclose, and accused its critics of interfering with the police investigation through \"unhelpful speculation, accusation and misinformation\". This is contested by journalists involved, who insist they were told by Yes Scotland they could not report the payment \u2013 which, it is understood, was not disclosed to the Herald at the time of publication \u2013 because of the alleged hacking. Bulmer could not be reached for comment, but in a statement he insisted he had no qualms about accepting a fee from the campaign group. The article appeared under his byline, with a reference to his role as the commission's research director but no mention of Yes Scotland's role in commissioning it. But Bulmer said: \"I would do the same if anyone else asked for a working day of my time. I had full editorial control and was not given any direction on what to say, neither by Yes Scotland nor by my Constitutional Commission colleagues. \"Although my position as research director of the Constitutional Commission was mentioned in the author bio, the article was written in a personal capacity.\" Yes Scotland's opponents said they supported Salmond's anxieties about hacking. But they added that the disclosure that Yes Scotland had secretly paid Bulmer to write the article, but failed to tell the Herald, raised substantial questions about Yes Scotland's conduct. The payment also called into question the demands from its chief executive, Blair Jenkins, for honesty and transparency in the independence debate, critics said. Bulmer, who completed a PhD at Glasgow university last year, is the commission's research director and drafted an influential model constitution which has been closely studied by Salmond's advisers and Scottish National party MSPs. The group insists it is \"an independent, non-partisan Scottish think-tank, research organisation and educational charity\". Blair McDougall, campaign director of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, has asked the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) to investigate the payment to Bulmer because it contradicted the commission's statement of political neutrality and was undeclared. In his letter to David Robb, the regulator's chief executive, McDougall said the Yes Scotland payment admission was a significant test of the OSCR's recent decision to allow charities to campaign for or against independence, as long as they were open about it. \"It appears that a political campaign has made payment to an employee of a registered charity in return for an article which was published in the name of that charity,\" McDougall wrote, adding: \"[We] welcome and encourage the voices of charities in this debate but worry that the secret payment of a charity employee by one of the campaigns risks undermining confidence in this historic debate.\" As Better Together suggested other pro-independence articles may have been secretly paid for by Yes Scotland, Sir Menzies Campbell, the former Liberal Democrat leader, released a statement though Better Together, stating: \"It is important that any hacking allegations are investigated fully, but we cannot ignore the content of the messages that were leaked. \"This is about transparency and it is about honesty. There are real questions that Yes Scotland need to answer over why they felt it was appropriate for them to make this payment.\" The simple fact is that when writers are producing work on behalf of a campaign group, their readers need to know about it.\" Scottish Labour and the Scottish Tories also stepped up the pressure, stating that Yes Scotland and Jenkins had \"serious questions to answer\". A Scottish Labour spokesman said it was \"a serious breach of faith\", and suggested Jenkins should step down from his post. Yes Scotland has denied covering up its payment to Bulmer, and insisted it confirmed the payment when asked by reporters last week. \"We were perfectly relaxed and transparent about this,\" it said in a statement. \"Given that the illegal breach of Yes Scotland email has become the subject of an extensive and on-going police inquiry involving detectives from Police Scotland's digital forensics unit, we have \u2013 under legal advice and at the request of the investigating officers \u2013 been unable to discuss the content of the email relating to Dr Bulmer. \"However, given persistent unhelpful speculation, we can confirm that in the course of a wide-ranging discussion with Dr Bulmer it was suggested that he, as an academic working in a private capacity, might consider writing an article on matters about constitutional frameworks based on his expertise. \"At his request, he was paid a nominal fee for the considerable time and effort he spent on it. We had no input in, or any influence over, what he wrote. \"We would now ask that this serious criminal investigation is allowed to continue unhindered by further unhelpful speculation, accusation and misinformation.\" In a statement the Herald's owners, the Herald &amp; Times Group, said: \"We were offered an article for our opinion pages by a constitutional expert, which we accepted in good faith as a valid contribution to the referendum debate. \"We declined a request for payment and the author's background was made clear to our readers.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 26 August 2013. An earlier version described Elliot Bulmer as a PhD student at Glasgow university. He completed his PhD in 2012.",
