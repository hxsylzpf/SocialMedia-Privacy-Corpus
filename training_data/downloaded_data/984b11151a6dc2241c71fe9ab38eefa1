Grade is expected to confirm his decision to jettison the business, which helps people stay in touch with school and university friends and has branched out into genealogy, when ITV reports its annual results next month. It is part of an effort to reduce costs and refocus the business to be announced on 4 March. The measures will include a fresh round of job losses, possibly cutting as much as 10% of the workforce, as the company seeks to revive its finances in the face of the worst advertising recession for more than a decade. ITV is understood to be considering reducing up to 500 jobs less than six months after the last round of redundancies that saw 1,000 departures from the 5,500-strong workforce. Analysts believe Grade also faces the tough choice, before releasing the results, of either cutting the \u00a31bn programming budget or slashing the dividend payout. Either decision will be tantamount to an admission that the programming-led resurrection of the business he promised when he joined less than three years ago has failed. ITV snapped up Friends Reunited in 2005, before Grade arrived, in a \u00a3120m deal that made multi-millionaires of its founders. Husband-and-wife team Steve and Julie Pankhurst, who set up the website with their business partner Jason Porter during the dotcom boom, are estimated to have pocketed about \u00a330m. Under the terms of the deal, ITV was to pay a further \u00a355m this year and at least part of that cash is understood to have been paid, even though Friends Reunited has since been outpaced by the arrival of sites such as Facebook. The broadcaster refused to comment but Friends Reunited has become increasingly isolated within ITV after the departure last year of ITV's head of consumer operations, Jeff Henry. Since then ITV has launched its own version of the BBC's successful iPlayer and hopes to boost its share of online revenues. ITV.com is now overseen by Peter Fincham, the director of programming. It remains to be seen whether there will be any buyers for Friends \u00adReunited especially in the current economic climate where even online advertising growth has slowed dramatically. When Grade outlined his content-led strategy for the revival of ITV's fortunes two years ago he set its online business a target of tripling revenues to \u00a3150m by 2010. In August last year, however, he was forced to push that target back to 2012. That failure has contributed to a cash-crunch at ITV, whose international business has also failed to generate \u00adanticipated earnings, at a time when it is facing the need for huge payments into its \u00a32.6bn pension fund. Analysts reckon the broadcaster's \u00adpension fund deficit could balloon from the \u00a3221m reported in June last year to more than \u00a3300m and it will have to pump at least \u00a3120m into the scheme this year to cover the shortfall.",
