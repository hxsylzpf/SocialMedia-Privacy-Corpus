The use of this technology has made our lives more efficient in many ways, and it is now being used to make the process of delivering aid more straightforward and cost-effective. In many developing countries poor documentation is pervasive. Globally 2.4 billion people are not identified on official government documents. To tackle this identity gap, donors have turned increasingly to iris scans, digital fingerprints and other forms of biometrics to ensure secure and accurate identification for their citizens; from national ID cards to elections and social welfare payments. So far, the Centre for Global Development estimates that around 1 billion people in 70 developing countries have taken part in biometric identification programmes. As the interest in the potential of such systems to provide efficient and targeted aid grows, biometrics will surely play a key role in the era of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Biometrics is highly efficient, according to Andrew Hopkins, chief of identity management and registration at UNHCR, who says that the technology is being used to register people at refugees camps and monitor accounts so that there is not an overspend on distributing aid. \"Often you find that you are distributing food for maybe 20% too many people \u2013 in other words, you find that a camp of 100,000 there is in fact a camp of 80,000 people,\" says Hopkins. The technology can also offer greater efficiencies and value for money for aid and development agencies. In the context of refugee registration, biometrics can streamline aid, allowing humanitarian agencies to issue ration cards to an accurate refugee population, rather than transporting bulky food packages across countries. In terms of the SDGs, biometrics can offer the means to end the preventable deaths of newborns (SDG 3.2) by ensuring that every last child is registered under polio and tuberculosis eradication initiatives. It can also ensure social protection to the neediest in society (SDG 1.3), allowing beneficiaries to access welfare payments or cash transfers with the swipe of a fingertip. The World Bank states that biometrics can fundamentally support the achievement of at least 10 other SDGs. However, like other technologies, Hopkins warns that biometrics is not a panacea and that beyond the benefits of efficiency, it is only really \"a tool amongst many\". A 2013 report by Privacy International highlights the potential for computerised registration systems to be met with all too real human complications, which can put staff in difficult situations. In September 2013, 6,500 people at the UNHCR's Mbera camp in Mauritania, home to some 70,000 Malian refugees, were left without food and assistance. Among the refugees leaving and returning to the camp, Mauritanians from local communities were claiming Malian nationality, causing numbers in the camp to rise above those the UNHCR was tasked with assisting. Attempts to use a new biometric identification system led to altercations between refugees and camp registration officers, the storming of food distribution stores and the temporary closure of registration offices. Thousands were left without assistance for several days. The situation was eventually rectified when the UNHCR triangulated data with the Mauritanian government to cross-check that its nationals were not involved in camp estimations. This sort of incident causes headaches for the UNHCR, which \"has a mandate to protect refugees [but not] a mandate to protect nationals who are misrepresenting themselves as refugees,\" says Hopkins. The human costs of biometrics are also familiar to citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Biometrics have been used in the DRC for the last three elections, using a system operated by Zetes, a Belgian technology firm. According to a leaked report from Zetes in 2011 violence broke out when doctored ballot papers were found that highlighted irregularities in the voter registration process, whereby some 700,000 double registrations were counted. The incident raised serious questions about the integrity of the voting register, which DRC citizens had been complaining about in the lead up to the election. Many have asked whether it is democratically accountable to outsource electoral contracts to foreign corporations such as Zetes, an issue that worries Niall McCann, lead electoral advisor at UNDP. \"We are supposed to build the capacity of national counterparts to use this technology,\" he says. \"There's a real risk that rather than us building the capacity of the national authority, you are in fact displacing the capacity and just letting the foreign technology company have a major implementation role rather than simply capacity-development.\" Despite this, McCann is ultimately positive about the benefits of using biometrics: \"Up to 30% of children born in the world do not actually get registered. And so, in effect, they live without a legal identity.\" The effects of registering a child at birth can last a lifetime. Through biometrics, says Unicef, a child can \"obtain access to basic services such as health and education in order to thrive\". Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.
