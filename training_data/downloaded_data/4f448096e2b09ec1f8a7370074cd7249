  "content": "MySpace has admitted that it took down the profile of Tom Stephens, one of two men arrested in connection with the murder of five women in Ipswich, to \"preserve\" the information for police. Users can delete their own MySpace profiles, but in the case of Mr Stephens the social networking website took the decision to block access to his page following his arrest. \"We have taken down the profile and preserved the data should it be useful for law enforcement in their investigation,\" said Hemanshu Nigam, chief security officer at MySpace. \"While we cannot go into detail about the case because it is an ongoing investigation, we can say that since the site's inception, MySpace has met with law enforcement officials around the globe to solicit their viewpoints on how we can enhance our cooperation with law enforcement and increase user security,\" Mr Nigam added. \"In this particular case, we have taken action to preserve the account for law enforcement purposes and in order to provide information to investigators through the appropriate legal channels.\" Mr Nigam added that MySpace now has a \"dedicated law enforcement rapid response team\" that runs a hotline 24 hours a day, seven days a week to \"receive and respond\" to police requests. The aim is to assist law enforcement agencies and help \"navigate how MySpace can be helpful in their investigations\". Internet surfers who click through to Mr Stephens' MySpace profile are met with the message: \"This user has either cancelled their membership, or their account has been deleted.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
