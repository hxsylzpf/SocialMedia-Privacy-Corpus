The Daily Telegraph wondered about that too, citing \"legal experts\" who said the failure to object to their use, as has been the custom during her marriage, raises \"the question of whether she is exercising 'image control' rather than protecting her privacy\". Hello! published 12 pictures of the Duchess and Prince George, including one on the cover. They show the former Kate Middleton carrying her son while travelling to the island of Mustique. She is shown getting off a plane at some unidentified place in the Caribbean. The \"world exclusive\" pictures are credited to Xclusive Pix/OIC. The agency is run by a veteran photographer, Max Cisotti, who boasts on his website that he sells paparazzi shots. The website states that it has \"up to date photos of the latest royal couple, William and Catherine, and hopefully soon Prince George\". In the Telegraph article, the failure of the palace to complain is said \"to be at odds with past objections to 'private' photographs of her taken in public places\" and to reflect an \"unpredictable stance towards privacy\". It is the first time paparazzi pictures of Prince George have been published and are the first images of him since his christening in October. According to \"royal sources\" there was no objection because they were taken \"in a public place, without any harassment or pursuit\". This appears to be a relaxation of previous palace attempts to curb paparazzi pictures and will surely open the floodgates to more photographers eager to cash in on the new policy. Though no-one was prepared to speak on the record at Hello! I understand that the deal - said to be in six figures - was sealed between the agency and the magazine by its director of news, Thomas Whitaker. The magazine has been contacted about selling on some of the pictures. I further understand that a similar set of photographs will be published tomorrow in the US by People magazine. I have a feeling that the Duchess is going to find herself the centre of attention for the paps in coming months and we can expect interesting legal arguments over what does, and does not, constitute harassment or pursuit.",
