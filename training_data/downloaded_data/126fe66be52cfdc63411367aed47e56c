It has 3 million paying users \u2013 up from 1 million in March 2011, and is the market leader in a fast-growing sector. But it is beset by criticism. Three of the biggest albums of 2011, by Adele, Coldplay and the Black Keys, are not available on Spotify or its streaming rivals. That is because of concern from the artists' management that streams will cannibalise their existing sales on iTunes. \"Spotify competes with download stores,\" says Coldplay's manager, Dave Holmes. Spotify is clearly still trying to convert users from the free, ad-supported model to paying for the service. More than 20% of its active users pay for the service and, helped by that, Spotify has paid $150m in royalties to music labels and publishers. However, the problem is that $150m is not a lot when divided up between all the recording artists on its service. A number of smaller, independent artists have also criticised Spotify for its perceived low payouts. Mercury prize-nominated Jon Hopkins caused a stir in November, for example, with a tweet claiming he had been paid just \u00a38 for 90,000 plays of his songs on Spotify. The company is fighting back. Ken Parks, its chief content officer, says that there is \"not a molecule of evidence that there is any cannibalistic effect\" on iTunes sales. In fact, he suggests that the album holdouts are harmful. \"They are punishing the people they need to embrace: the 18- to 24-year-olds, who were previously paying very little or nothing at all.\" Nevertheless, the danger for Spotify is that more high-profile artists will look at the sales of the albums that were not available to stream last year \u2013 Adele's 21, in particular \u2013 and see cause and effect: they sold so well because they were not on Spotify. A domino effect of album holdouts would hamper the company's drive to sign up more paying subscribers this year and beyond. Spotify's new apps platform may help. Inspired by Facebook, it enables developers to create applications that live within Spotify's own desktop software, building new features on top of its streaming music catalogue. Parks believes artists will start launching their own Spotify apps this year. Spotify also sees its close partnership with Facebook as important. Users who link their Spotify and Facebook accounts are three times more likely to become paying subscribers \u2013 and the company suggests that artists who keep their albums off Spotify are missing out on the viral buzz. However, Adele, Coldplay and others are still benefiting, as their older albums are available on Spotify and its rivals. In six months' time, it would be surprising if 21 and Mylo Xyloto haven't been added too. Even so, more widespread adoption of \"windowing\" \u2013 where new albums are sold on iTunes months before they are available to stream legally \u2013 would not be good news for Spotify. The threat of piracy may be the service's best defence. \"Users are going to stream: you're not going to put the genie back into the bottle,\" says Parks. \"But if we can take people who weren't paying anything and get them to pay \u00a3120 a year \u2013 which is twice the amount of the average downloader or CD buyer \u2013 this industry can grow bigger than it ever was.\"",
