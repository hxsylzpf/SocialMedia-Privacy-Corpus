  "content": "Sex sells, or so one Dutch male fashion firm hopes. But Suit Supply's provocative \u2013 some say almost pornographic \u2013 \"Shameless\" advertising campaign has prompted cries of \"shame\" over a window display at London's Westfield shopping centre. Eight-foot-high (2.4 metre) backlit images at Suit Supply's west London store show a sharp-suited man alongside a woman touching her own naked breast and revealing a glimpse of nipple, a man driving as he gropes the breast of his female passenger, and a seated woman reclining obligingly while her male companion lifts up her dress to peek at her underwear. The pictures, two of which are in the shop's window, have provoked complaints to Westfield and the Advertising Standards Authority, along with protests on Twitter. Chief among the concerns are that the images are sexist in objectifying women, and that they are displayed where they can be easily seen by children. The images in the shop windows are tame compared with others on the firm's website, which, according to one complainant, border on \"S&amp;M style activity\". The Dutch advertising watchdog is investigating several complaints over a Suit Supply poster campaign in the Netherlands, and the company has said it has had to remove several images from its Facebook company website because they were \"deemed offensive\". Joey Abbis-Stubbs, 23, a women's charity worker from Westbourne Grove, London, wrote of her Westfield experience on the beyondretrograde blog: \"[In] a family-friendly shopping centre, I am sure many parents would be upset to have their children exposed to such material while taking them to the newly opened indoor ice-skating rink.\" Condemning the photographs as \"blatant objectification of women\", she added: \"As well as offending parents and children, did Westfield not think that this sexually submissive and explicit advertising campaign would cause offence to its many female visitors? \"At least with Facebook you would assume people would have to actively seek out the company page, not just walk past in one of London's busiest malls on the way to Marks &amp; Spencer.\" Abbis-Stubbs told the Guardian she had approached Westfield, and been told it was \"a sign of the times\". \"They said they would look into it. But the adverts are going to be up until the end of the January sales, so lots and lots of children will have the opportunity to see them.\" A reply forwarded to her from Suit Supply stated: \"Our campaign is called 'Shameless' and is shot by the renowned photographer Carli Herm\u00e8s. In our opinion the photographs of the campaign are a well-balanced mix of style, humour and sex, the essence of fashion! We fully disagree that our campaign would be obscene and denigrating towards women. On the contrary, the women depicted in the photographs are obviously in the lead.\" Abbis-Stubbs said: \"That misses the point, really.\" It is not the first time Suit Supply has launched a controversial ad campaign \u2013 last year it received criticism for a Start Smoking campaign aimed at selling smoking jackets. The Shameless campaign has been condemned on fashion and celebrity website Jezebel as \"creepy and porno-like\". \"Wearing a snazzy suit most def gets you free upskirt peeks and kinky kitchen play, guys,\" it said. There are calls on Twitter for people to complain to Suit Supply, though mixed among those are comments from tweeters who approve of the campaign as \"hot\" and \"sexy\" rather than \"sexist\". The Advertising Standards Authority confirmed it had received 10 complaints, but as it only deals with paid-for space, and not commercial premises, it has referred complainants to Consumer Direct, which would not comment. Westfield and Suit Supply did not respond to requests for comment.",
