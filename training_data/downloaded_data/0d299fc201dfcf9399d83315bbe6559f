However, for me, they are not heroes or mavericks at all \u2013 they are just doing their job. In today's digital world a charity chief executive, a leader who represents an important cause, should be accessible and accountable to their charity's supporters. Yet, there are many charity leaders who won't go near social media or new forms of communication, including my boss. And, frankly it is holding us back. I have worked in charity marketing and communications for more than 15 years and, now more than ever, understand the importance and impact of a personal social media presence. It raises our profile in a crowded space and can be more effective than sending out a press release or posting a story on our own website. And, most importantly we can better convey our values and our priorities to our service users. Recent research revealed that eight out of 10 people are more likely to trust and buy from an organisation whose chief executive and leadership team use social media. This shows that, increasingly, stakeholders expect leaders to act as an ambassador and point of contact for the organisation on platforms such as Twitter. It can be a useful and cost effective way for charity leaders to talk directly to our stakeholders and raise their and our profiles. It really is a no-brainer. There have been several occasions when I have spoken to my chief executive about the importance of raising our profile and brand online through their own social media presence. I am always met with the same response: \"I don't do social media \u2013 it's the job of the comms department. If you want to do it, then leave it to them.\" I have also given endless presentations to the executive team on creative ways we can use social media and how easy it is. I have even offered to sit with them and set it up but I am fighting a losing battle. Many of them say: \"I don't tweet or use Facebook \u2013 never have, never will.\" It should not be negotiable \u2013 senior leaders need to embrace new technology and communications and be a proud face of the organisation and brand. It should be part and parcel of their role. Their lack of buy-in is harmful to the organisation and we will be left behind in what is already a fast-moving world. It baffles me as to why a leader of a large charity who requires constant communication with stakeholders, so that we can gain trust and support, is so reluctant embrace new ways of doing so. Leaders must be accountable and accessible. As a chief executive you are a custodian of an organisation. Communicating well with your supporters and on behalf of your organisation is not an add-on, it is a requirement of the job.
