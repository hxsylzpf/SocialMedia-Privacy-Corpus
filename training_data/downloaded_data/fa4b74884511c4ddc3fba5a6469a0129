  "content": "I had no idea what to think when I got an email from LinkedIn, the Facebook for employed and want-to-be-employed people, congratulating me. Apparently, my profile was among the top 5 percent of all profiles viewed on the site in 2012. I grew up in the upstate New York blue-collar town of Amsterdam, where my father rested whiskey bottles upside down on our tavern bar to drain out every last drop. I had long ago decided I was going to do everything I could with my yeoman-like work ethic to become as much of a maker as I am a taker. But even for me, news of this feat was still surreal. Surreal because I'm not the type to seek attention or get it. I'm not a glory hound \u2013 never was, never will be. It's just not in my DNA. My professional career mirrored that image, as I always labored behind the scenes and behind the people with the bylines and the star power. I rose from copyeditor to managing editor at various newspapers and dotcoms, helping to deliver the news, hit deadlines and maintain the editorial integrity of each publication. So, when I received this LinkedIn email, I couldn't help but feel a bit odd and increasingly proud that I was getting some recognition from somewhere, even if it was LinkedIn. Then the creepiness set in, who was viewing me? As editor-in-chief of Zillow, a mobile and online real estate marketplace whose foundation was built on Zestimate home values, I've long understood that the web is where it's all happening for networking and a kind of limitless democratization of all kinds of mediums and industries. I like LinkedIn and used it from the start. I have even occasionally been wooed for jobs along the way via LinkedIn. There was a headhunter a year ago who, representing the Thomas Cook travel agency in London, asked if I'd like to move across the pond. Just a few months ago, a director-level position job for Sears was floated by me from the department store chain's headquarters in Chicago. And I have used LinkedIn to try to find writers and freelancers. It's a great service. But still, there I was \"one of the select 5% whose profiles have been among the most viewed\". I'm thinking I'm pretty special. That is, until I did the math and realized that I am the top 5% of LinkedIn's entire registered user base. More specifically, 200m people, which means I was one of 10m people to receive this mail. To put it in perspective, that's the size of the population of Greece, or Portugal or Rwanda. Suddenly, I didn't feel very special anymore. I am just a small drop in the bucket of LinkedIn's ingenious marketing ploy to tug at my vanity and make me feel special. Now what? Find out who viewed my profile on LinkedIn? For $7.95 a year, I can do that by \"unlocking the full list of people who have viewed me\". Pretty cheap to find out who's trailing me for an entire year. But let's do the math again. If just 20% of the 10m people who got this message were curious enough to pay $7.95 to see who's following them, that's 2m people generating approximately $15m for LinkedIn's bottom line. Fifteen million dollars \u2013 all as a result of an email telling us we are special. Brilliant, LinkedIn. But you're not getting my $7.95 today. Probably not tomorrow, either. I might be curious who is viewing my profile, but I've gotten this far without knowing. And if someone wants me, they seem to know where to find me.",
