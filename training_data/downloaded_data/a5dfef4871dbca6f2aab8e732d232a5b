With DLD, short for digital, life, design, the German publisher Hubert Burda is doing exactly that. From 24-26 January the three-day conference will see about 800 entrepreneurs, investors, philantropists, scientists and creative minds gather to debate pressing issues. This year Jason Kilar of Hulu and Owen van Natta of MySpace focus on the future of the moving image, Tero Ojanpera of Nokia will tell us what's happening with mobile, Esther Dyson gives an introduction to the internet of objects and Jeff Jarvis will talk about the issue on which American news organisations are pinning their hopes on, hyperlocal, not to forget the gathering of figures such as Conrad Wolfram of Wolfram|Alpha, Marissa Mayer of Google and Blaise Aguera y Arcas of Bing. As the speakers list shows, the conference is one of the most widely attended in Europe \u2013 and it is in its sixth year. Scheduled right before Davos, it is able to attract a lot of always busy high-fliers. Marcel Reichart, who founded DLD together with Stephanie Czerny, answered the criticism that the conference attracted the samed faces by saying: \"We have a large number of new speakers each year, but powerhouses Facebook and Google are simply still important, so we are glad that Marissa Meyer of Google is joining us again.\" Indeed, this conference is as much about meeting and greeting as about the panels, as you can talk to speakers and guests like the sister of Facebook founder Randi Zuckerberg, Shawn Colo of Demand Media, Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon or the futurist John Naisbitt. While up till now you had to be invited, you can additionally now buy your way in for \u20ac2,500 \u2013 a first for the DLD and still a lot cheaper than TED, which costs you $6,500. However, money isn't everything, and you can apply for a ticket \u2013 but since the DLD thinks of its audience as a community, you will still have to pass its audience curating.",
