  "content": "Sometimes nations, like individuals, say things in public that are better said in private. So it is with the announcement last week by the Pentagon that the US might treat cyber-attacks as armed attacks. The announcement would seem to make sense. \"Armed attack\" in cyberspace is now a reality. Last year, the Stuxnet computer worm physically destroyed the operations of an Iranian nuclear facility. And Stuxnet is hardly the first disruptive cyber attack. When the highly cyber-wired nation of Estonia had its networks disrupted by \"distributed denial of service attacks\" in 2007, Nato had to make a decision \u2013 did this attack constitute an \"attack\", as in \"any attack against a member state will be considered an attack against all\" \u2013 a key provision of Nato's mutual defence pact? Nato, characteristically, demurred, as it has subsequently. The American announcement at least provided some clarity, and sends a message to potential adversaries. The problem is the Pentagon is making the announcement at a time when America's defences against cyber-attack are in shambles. No doubt, the defence department's computer security is in good shape (or as good as computer security can get). But the Pentagon is not in charge of defending America's cyberspace. That is the responsibility of the feckless department of homeland security (DHS). Non-defence parts of the federal government routinely get failing grades from the congressional committees that oversee such things. For \"critical infrastructures\" like communications and electricity, DHS organises a set of so-called \"public-private partnerships\" that transfer the responsibility for national security to the self-interest of private corporations \u2013 a model of national security last seen with the East India Company. The doctrine that \"if you hit us, we will hit you back even harder\" makes a lot of sense when dealing with the possibility of nuclear attacks where the US (like everyone else) is otherwise defenceless. But the model of nuclear deterrence does not apply to in cyberspace. Nuclear bombs come in one size: large. Not so with cyber-attacks, which can have come in many forms, and where a devastating attack need not be destructive. With almost non-existent cyber defences, the United States is open to cyber-attacks of all sorts \u2013 think of a heavyweight boxer fighting off a swarm of bees. It won't be China launching a cyber Pearl Harbour (a beloved, but inappropriate metaphor of the cyberwar enthusiasts) \u2013 it will be the Washington metro being out of service, stranding government workers, or the New York Stock Exchange being disrupted. If that happened, the US might \"put a missile down one of your smokestacks\", to quote an American official, but how would the world react? Imperialist Americans killing innocent people for the sake of their investment portfolios? The other problem with weak defence is that it makes the problem of even knowing who attacked us even harder. \"Attribution\" of cyber-attacks is a big, big challenge. Take the ongoing \"he said, she said\" drama taking place between Google and China. Google says that China stole large numbers of passwords and has taken over accounts. China says that it did not. Probably China did, but who really knows? Stuxnet is alleged to be the joint product of the US and Israel; neither country is confirming the speculation. Russia denies having attacked Estonia, but also refuses to assist in finding the perpetrators. China repeatedly blames \"patriotic hackers\" outside of its control, when cyber attacks advance state interests. By making a public announcement that a cyber-attack could be an act of war, the US is basically saying, \"I dare you.\" That works if you know who your attacker is, and the attack crosses some threshold. What may happen, instead, is that as a country, we end up looking impotent \u2013 subject to small-scale disruptions, maybe even uncertain as to whether such disruptions were an attack, or just Microsoft Windows crashing. Until the US has a better cyber defensive posture, the Pentagon would have been better-off talking in private.",
