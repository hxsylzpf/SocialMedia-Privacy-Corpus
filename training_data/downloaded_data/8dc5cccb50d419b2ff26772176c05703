  "content": "The lazy parent's half-term soundtrack of choice? The infuriating beeps and squeaks emitted from a social networking site for the under-10s, Moshi Monsters. Only it just got worse. The monsters have escaped from the computer. Moshi Monsters started life as an obscure internet game for five to 12-year-olds, a last roll of the dice for British gaming company Mind Candy. Three years on and it has become, um, a monster. With 34 million users in 150 countries and one in two British children having adopted their own online Moshi Monster, the company has branched out into toys, video games, apps, magazines and trading cards. The first dedicated Moshi Monsters pop-up shop has just opened in Whiteley's in west London, with extra security drafted in to manage the crowds. As its bid for world domination gains momentum, Mind Candy expects to make $100m (\u00a362m) out of Moshi Monsters this year (the game is free to play but extras are available to subscribers who pay around \u00a35 a month). A not insignificant proportion of this is likely to flow out of my own pocket. There is no escape. I walked into a local toy shop this week and shuddered. There they were, monsters, hundreds of them, all different shapes and sizes, all ominously collectable. I am still concealing this information from Will, my seven-year-old son, who has already seized upon the trading cards with gusto. Will's online Moshi Monster, adopted last year, is a nasty- looking Tasmanian devil. In order to furnish the monster's lifestyle, you play games online and earn \"Rox\", Moshi currency which allows you to buy stuff. Thus the devil monster has a lavish home complete with fire wallpaper, a volcanic floor, numerous cakes of gigantic proportions and a space rocket. The devil monster leads a better life than the rest of us. He even has separate houses for his Moshlings (pets). \"Mum, you do not buy the Moshlings,\" Will explains patiently. \"They are attracted by plants, which you buy with Rox.\" His 10 Moshlings include: \"Baby Googoo, which is a baby dressed as Lady Gaga. Chop Chop, a ninja monkey. And Suki Yaki, a cat, also a ninja. The one I really want is Mini Ben. He is my favourite. He is like Big Ben. Only mini.\" The Moshi Monsters craze conceals a serious agenda: the race to establish the first Facebook for kids. Its biggest rival is Disney's Club Penguin. But if the idea of social networking for the under-10s sounds horrifying, do not be (too) alarmed. First, you are a monster or a penguin, you are not yourself. Second, these sites are rigorously moderated and controlled. There is too much at stake for these companies otherwise. A safe, fun way into internet life for children? I think so. I hope so. Either way I'm saving up my horror for the monstrous merchandising.",
