  "content": "Google's motto, lest we forget, is \"Don't be evil\". It seems that Snapchat's catchphrase might now be summed up as \"Don't be creepy\". Evan Spiegel, the 24-year-old chief executive of the messaging app, has told a gathering of advertising types that he and his colleagues \"really care about not being creepy\". That is one reason why Snapchat has adopted the 3V - \"vertical video views\" - approach to video advertising, he said on Monday at the Cannes Lions festival in Nice. Video ads slot into Snapchat content, rather than before a video like YouTube or around other content, as with Facebook. \"We love when the advertising fits the context of the story we are telling,\" said Spiegel, Business Insider reported. Following on from a badly lit video last week explaining to parents how Snapchat works, Spiegel released another video on Monday that highlights the app's outlook on video advertising. That attitude could help explain why Snapchat has proved so popular, particularly with young people, he said. The app now has 100 million daily active users who watch about 2bn videos. The drive to boost advertising revenue follows Spiegel's confirmation last month that he planned to list the company on the stock market rather than sell it. Snapchat was valued at $15bn (\u00a310bn) in its latest funding round. Spiegel also told the Cannes audience that \"we do stuff that's kind of hippy I guess\" based on the fact that groups of 10 employees \"talk about how we feel about things\" on a weekly basis. \"I don't think we pay attention enough to just listening to people and how they feel. I know sometimes I'm so focused on what I'm going to say next, that I'm not listening to what they're saying,\" he explained. \"In tech in particular, everyone is so serious all the time, and has these grand visions. But we really enjoy that people like having fun, and want to be happy, and enjoy being with one another: That's just as important.\"",
