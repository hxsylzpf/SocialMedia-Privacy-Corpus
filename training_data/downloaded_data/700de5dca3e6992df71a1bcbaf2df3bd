  "content": "Most tutors would go mad if they caught you fiddling on your phone in the lecture hall, but students on media-related degrees are being told to do exactly that. As part of the broadcast journalism programme at the University of Leeds, we're told to sign up to Twitter \u2013 we're even given a hashtag (#leedsbjs) to help us interact. But what happens when students are asked to voice their opinions during lectures? The resulting feed tends to be a healthy mixture of reading recommendations, questions about coursework, and declarations of hunger/boredom/sleepiness. It's reinvigorated childhood games. \"I spy\" is a favourite way to pass the time \u2013 something beginning with B? Boring lecturer, bad tie\u2026 Last year, #cityhacks trended during a lecture at City University London delivered by online journalism expert Paul Bradshaw. Students unreceptive to his innovative ideas flooded the hashtag with criticism. Given the cost of a degree, it's only right that students can speak out if they are dissatisfied. But Twitter is instant and public. When does constructive criticism become trolling? We need to think carefully about what we say on social networks, says UCLan journalism student Phil Harvey: \"People have used Twitter to make comments about university staff after tedious lectures, getting themselves into trouble.\" At the University of Greenwich, a Twitter account is compulsory for PR students, while those doing the course at Leeds Metropolitan are also pushed to get online. Tweeters compete to appear on #socialstudent, a list of the most \"social\" PR students in the UK. Hopefully all this time spent glued to laptops and iPhones will help students gain the knowledge they need in an increasingly digital world. Journalism students have discovered that potential sources can be found on Twitter. Internships can be achieved through following the right people. And many employers now ask for Twitter handles on CVs and applications. Between firing off tweets about unfashionable academics or where to meet for lunch, students are also scrolling through feeds rich with information, gaining more followers, and practising the skills needed to find information or network with colleagues in the future. So with all that good learning going on, perhaps the odd tweet about cute \u2013 or pompous \u2013 lecturers might be acceptable from time to time? .",
