The tweet raised the ire of Iowans not just because it implied that residents of the Hawkeye State were brain damaged; but it also seemed to imply that something was wrong with genetically modified crops with its reference to agribusiness giant Monsanto. The tweet raised questions about how Trump, who consistently brags about his first place showing in national and state polls, might cope with a drop in his fortunes. The Quinnipiac poll in Iowa was the first survey of the state since July not to show Trump in first place. It also opens a window into Trump's much ballyhooed Twitter account, which has served as an aggressive outlet for the Republican frontrunner's views, where he often retweets supporters.
