  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission is likely to wait to see whether new evidence of journalistic malpractice emerges from the Commons culture select committee inquiry before deciding what action to take over the News of the World phone-hacking allegations. However, the PCC said today it had already approached the Information Commissioner's office and the Guardian, which revealed on Wednesday that NI paid out \u00a31m to make legal settlements with three individuals whose mobile phones were hacked into on behalf of reporters at the News of the World. The commission has said that it would investigate any \"further transgressions\" at the paper \"without delay\". Senior sources at the commission concede that they cannot compel senior managers at News International, which owns the News of the World, to answer questions about fresh allegations of impropriety at the paper. \"We cannot subpoena people or documents,\" said one PCC insider. \"It is easy for people to forget that.\" The PCC is an industry body financed by the newspaper industry to deal with complaints about specific stories. It is not a statutory body and has no legal or investigatory powers. It was set up in 1991 to replace the Press Council, but has a narrower brief. Chaired by Baroness Buscombe, the PCC enforces a code of conduct that lays out how journalists should conduct their work. The code includes strict guidelines on invasion of privacy and obtaining information through deception. Most UK newspapers and magazines have signed up to the code and some companies have rewritten employee contracts so that they include a requirement to adhere to it. The commission has reopened an earlier 2007 investigation into the practices used by journalists to obtain information, conducted after former News of the World reporter Clive Goodman was jailed for hacking into the phone messages of royal staff. It will seek to establish whether it was \"misled\" by News International during the original inquiry and to discover whether phone-hacking and other practices, including obtaining information from phone companies, the DVLA and other agencies, continued after Goodman was jailed. PCC sources pointed out that it was not contacted by members of the public following the Goodman case but decided to launch its 2007 investigation in an effort to protect the reputation of the press. \"We never received complaints in this area but we sought to extend our remit\", said one insider. The PCC was criticised for failing to question Andy Coulson, who was editing the News of the World when Goodman was arrested. Coulson resigned when Goodman was jailed in January 2007 and the PCC spoke to his successor, Colin Myler. The PCC said it could not call Coulson because he was no longer a News International employee. It is thought that the PCC will draw heavily on hearings conducted by the Commons culture select committee, which will question News International executives next week. The committee is expected to ask Coulson to give evidence.",
