Net usage is booming across Europe, with more than half of users going online at least once a day, according to the annual Mediascope survey by the European Interactive Advertising Association. Usage is being driven by the 25- to 34-year-old age group, many of whom were originally shown the internet at school. They were the first generation that flocked to Google to navigate their new environment, having started with sites such as Lycos, Excite and AltaVista. They were the original users of MySpace and the first people to experiment with user-generated content sites such as YouTube, having grown bored with the portals their service providers offered. Their tastes for email and instant messaging, music downloads and funny videos have influenced the development of the web. But now they have got money and, in some cases, families and responsibilities, and they are changing the way the internet is used. \"One of the things that has come through strongly this year is that people are using the internet more to manage their lives,\" said EIAA executive director Alison Fennah. \"With the 25- to 34-year-olds, what you are seeing is a mixture of the fact that they are natural internet users, they know their way around the web, with their movement towards more mature types of lifestyle management as they themselves mature.\" The new survey of more than 9,000 people in the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Scandinavia and the Netherlands shows that 25- to 34-year-olds spend 13.9 hours per week online \u2014 up almost an hour in the past year alone and well above the average, with more than a third clocking up more than 16 hours. Two-thirds of them are online every day. Half of them regularly use social networking sites and a quarter maintain their own digital profiles. They are also responsible for the rise in the use of the internet for functions such as managing finances and accessing health or local government information. As if to underline the ascendancy of the internet's equivalent of the baby boomers, HarperCollins announced this week that the word \"meh\" will be included in the 30th anniversary edition of the Collins English Dictionary. The word is synonymous with the hard to please, blas\u00e9 attitude of the technologically literate. It rose to fame on the Simpsons but has been all over the internet for years, used by bloggers as the ultimate slacker put-down. The dictionary defines it as either an interjection used to suggest indifference or boredom, or an adjective used when something is mediocre or a person is unimpressed. Almost three quarters \u2013 73% \u2013 of European internet users, and there are 178 million online each week, say that as a result of the web they are staying in touch with friends and relatives more, while 54% say they have booked more holidays or made more travel arrangements. Almost half Europe's internet users report that they are better able to manage their finances because of the web, a trend that is driven by the web-boom generation. Comparing this year's Mediascope study with previous surveys shows the rise in web usage among European consumers. The average time spent online by the region's internet users is now 12 hours, up 36% on four years ago, while the percentage of people who spend 16 hours or more online has grown to almost a third from 17% back in 2004. Consumers are also using the internet more as a research tool before making purchases. In 2004, just 50% of consumers went on to buy something after carrying out research on the internet, that conversion rate is now 87%. Now they have cash in their pockets, the web-literate 25- to 34-year-old generation have helped drive the expansion of e-commerce over the past few years, with everything from clothes to food being bought online, compared with a few years ago when books and DVDs were the big sellers.",
