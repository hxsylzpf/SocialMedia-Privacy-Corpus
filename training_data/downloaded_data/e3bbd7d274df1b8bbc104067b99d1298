  "content": "Stephane Panier has been appointed global chief executive of AOL-owned Bebo, marking the first time the social networking website has had an executive take the post since Joanna Shields relinquished it 14 months ago. Panier, a former senior finance and operations executive at Google, joined Bebo as chief operating officer in January. He will report to Jon Brod, the executive vice president of the AOL Ventures division, of which Bebo part. Bebo has undergone a significant restructuring of its senior management in recent months, after Tim Armstrong's arrival in March as the new chief executive of AOL. Shields, one of the architects of the $850m (\u00a3518m) sale of Bebo to AOL in March last year, left her role as Bebo chief executive in May last year to take charge of AOL's wider People Networks division. She left AOL in May. Bebo's European vice president and managing director, Kate Burns, was promoted earlier this month to head AOL's European ad sales operation. In May it was reported that the People Networks division, which housed Bebo and other social media operations such as AIM and ICQ, would be dissolved and replaced by a new unit called AOL Ventures. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
