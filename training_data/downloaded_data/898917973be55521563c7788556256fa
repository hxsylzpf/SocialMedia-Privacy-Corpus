  "content": "The chairman of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) has appealed to the government and Lord Justice Leveson not to introduce statutory regulation of the press, even though he admits having sympathy with the campaign for new press laws led by Hugh Grant. Lord Hunt, who was appointed as chairman of the PCC last year to oversee its phasing out in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, said he was disappointed with his Tory colleagues, including the former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind, who last week called for new statutes to curb press excesses. Hunt said the vast majority of newspapers and journalists behaved within the law and the industry should not be penalised because of the alleged criminality at the now defunct News of the World. \"Because of criminal activities on the part of one national publisher, everyone, including the local and regional press, is threatened with statutory regulation,\" he said in a speech to the Society of Editors in Belfast on Sunday night. He has proposed a new regulator with power to investigate and fine that could be up and running almost immediately if the government or Leveson give it the green light. Hunt says the failure of the PCC to investigate phone hacking was not a failure of self-regulation because the commission did not have the necessary powers to take such action. \"I know a lot of water has gone under the bridge and this will be a controversial remark, but I do have a certain amount of sympathy with some of the views that Hugh Grant has expressed,\" said Hunt of the actor who has been fronting the Hacked Off campaign for statutory regulation. \"I think he genuinely does share my basic belief in freedom of expression and, like me, he understands that freedom is a privilege not an unqualified right, bringing with it certain responsibilities \u2013 not to harass, not to bully, not to intrude gratuitously,\" said Hunt. He said the new regulator proposed by the PCC would address Grant's concerns over invasions of privacy because it would force newspapers through legally binding contracts to make a solemn undertaking \"to disown those over-aggressive paparazzi who have no regard for the law, human dignity or even physical safety, and blight the lives of innocent people.\" Grant has frequently cited the behaviour of paparazzi as something that can only be curbed by laws. Hunt says the new body will be launched from a radically different premise, from a foundation that celebrates and promotes ethical, public interest journalism. \"Bending or breaking the rules to obtain tittle-tattle about a celebrity is not [public interest journalism],\" he said. It would have real powers to investigate allegations such as phone hacking, illegal computer hacking or general press intrusion by reporters or paparazzi. It would also have the power to impose fines and award compensation to victims of the press with newspapers signing binding contracts to adhere to its rulings for five years at a time. \"To those who claim the PCC can be equated with self-regulation of the press and that, therefore, self-regulation of the press has failed, I say this: self-regulation of the press has not failed, because it has never been tried,\" he added. Hunt said the newspaper industry's efforts to improve regulation before the Leveson report had slowed \"to a crawl\" after the appeals court judge indicated he would not be backing the proposals during the hearings this summer. Hunt said the industry was keen to move swiftly and to demonstrate it could create a radically different regulator on its own steam, but that Leveson had stopped it in its tracks. \"I sought a green light from him to carry on pressing forward with reform, but his response was disappointing,\" said Hunt. \"Not surprisingly, the process of transition slowed significantly, not to a stop, but certainly to a crawl.\" He said the code of conduct binding the new regulator also needed a review and should focus more on what is deemed best journalistic practice. \"I believe the new regulator, through its standards arm, should do more to promulgate, within the industry and more widely, a compelling vision of what constitutes good journalism and a good journalist. \"The new regulator must not only be the scourge of bad practices. It must be the true and loyal friend of good journalism which, whilst it may not always be pretty, has at its heart, as its foundation stone, the public interest,\" he said.",
