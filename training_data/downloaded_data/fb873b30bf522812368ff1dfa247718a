  "content": "Silicon Valley is a place where the young and thin dream of making millions on the next hot tech startup. Reid Hoffman is portly, \"old\" and far more successful than most can ever hope to be. The 43-year-old is set to make himself another $600m after announcing plans to sell shares in LinkedIn, the social network for suits widely used by headhunters to trawl for potential job applicants. LinkedIn will become the first US social network to go public when it joins the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, as increasingly frenzied investors clamour to get in on the new generation of internet firms. The share sale will value the whole company at up to $3.35bn (\u00a32bn), significantly higher than the $2bn expected when LinkedIn first filed IPO documents in January. The increase comes as its peers, including Facebook, online discount service Groupon, and social gaming firm Zynga, line up their own IPOs at ever-increasing valuations. Facebook's valuation is now approaching $100bn, Groupon is said to be worth $25bn, and all those people playing Farmville have driven Zynga up to $10bn. Hoffman is first in line to collect on all of them. The serial entrepreneur seems to be behind nearly every social media firm now heading to market. He founded LinkedIn eight years ago and owns 20% of the company. Hoffman's cash helped start Facebook, Zynga and Flickr. In 2009, he joined venture capital firm Greylock Partners where he has led investments in Groupon, among others. Twitter was about the only major social media pie in which he didn't have a finger. But, in 2009, Twitter bought a geo-location business called Mixer Labs, funded by Hoffman, and he got shares in that too. Hoffman is California born and bred. He grew up in Berkeley and went to Stanford University, where he got a BA in the university's \"symbolic systems programme\", an inter-disciplinary study that, according to the university's website, \"focuses on computers and minds: artificial and natural systems that use symbols to represent information.\" Then he went off to Oxford to do an MA in philosophy. Hoffman's original plan was to become an intellectual. \"When I graduated my plan was to become a professor and public intellectual. That is not about quoting Kant. It's about holding up a lens to society and asking 'who are we?' and 'who should we be?' But I realised academics write books that 50 or 60 people read and I wanted more impact,\" he told Director magazine in 2009. Academia's loss was the business world's gain. After stints at Apple and Fujitsu, Hoffman struck out on his own, setting up one of the earliest social networking firms, SocialNet.com. He quit after a disagreement with the board and went to join Peter Thiel at PayPal, the online payments company. Hoffman was to become a made man in what's become known as the PayPal mafia. Auction giant eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5bn and made fortunes for PayPal's execs. Thiel got about $68m and has gone on to become one of tech's most successful investors. He was one of the first people to back Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, putting $500,000 into the firm after an introduction from Hoffman. That stake is now worth about $1.7bn. PayPal's other alumni include Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla Motors, and Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim, founders of YouTube. A year after the PayPal sale, Hoffman had set up LinkedIn. According to the company, LinkedIn now has more than 100 million members in 200 countries and is adding about 1 million new members a week. The company makes money by selling its hiring and marketing software offline, and from members who subscribe to its premium services. It posted a profit of $15.4m in 2010, following operating losses from 2007 until 2009. But it doesn't expect to be profitable in 2011 because it is investing in technology and international expansion. In a filing, LinkedIn cautioned that it \"may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our profitability over the long term\". Investors can be fickle. Shares in RenRen, China's answer to Facebook, soared 29% when they debuted on the NYSE earlier this month. They are now below the $14 initial price. Who's to say what's in store for LinkedIn, Facebook, Zynga and co? But there are plenty of other Hoffman-backed firms to take their place, should they flame out. An executive at one of Hoffman's firms, speaking anonymously, said his secret was he is \"a really nice guy. He's very smart and he knows everyone\". Middle-aged, chubby, nice and soon to be unbelievably rich. It's one of the weirdest combinations Silicon Valley has ever seen.",
