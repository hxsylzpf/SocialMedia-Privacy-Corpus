  "content": "In what may prove to be an important moment, the Iranian president has tweeted a photo of the first woman to win the Fields medal \u2013 a woman of Iranian descent \u2013 with her head uncovered. Hassan Rouhani tweeted the photo of Maryam Mirzakhani on Thursday with the caption \"Congrats to #MaryamMirzakhani on becoming the first ever woman to win the #FieldsMedal, making us Iranians very proud\". The black and white photo shows two pictures side by side of Mirzakhani, who is Iranian but now lives in America. In one she is not wearing a head scarf and in the next she is veiled. In Iran it is compulsory for women to wear headscarves with fines and even jail for women who disobey. The dress code has been implemented strictly since the 1979 revolution. Rouhani, a known moderate, became president in August and has reportedly ordered the dedicated morality police to exercise more discretion in issuing fines, verbal notices and arrests of women considered to be breaking this code. Mirzakhani is the first woman to win the Fields medal, also described as the Nobel prize for mathematics. She is a maths professor based at Stanford University in California. Rouhani has faced fierce opposition from hard right political opponents, particularly for his efforts to engage with the west. He addressed them in a speech which was broadcast live this week in which he pulled no punches. \"Some of them chant slogans but they are political cowards. As soon as we negotiate they start shaking. Go to hell and find somewhere to stay warm,\" he said. The Guardian published an interview with Mirzakhani on Wednesday.",
