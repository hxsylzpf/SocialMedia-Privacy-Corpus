  "content": "Researchers have detailed the operations of a group believed to be selling highly valuable attack code to prolific cyber espionage hackers, including the team that was linked to a 2009 attack on Google. Whilst Symantec researchers admitted they could not be certain a computer exploit owned by the digital arms dealer, known as Elderwood, was used against Google, it has been operating since at least 2009, when the tech titan was hit. The Elderwood supplier has frequently been linked to the 2009 attacks, which Google blamed on China. One customer, known as Hidden Lynx, was also associated with the campaign against Google, which targeted a range of US organisations. Hidden Lynx was identified as the group that breached security company Bit9 in 2012 too. Elderwood exploits have been used against a large number of industries, including defence, technology and human rights organisations, throughout 2014 and before. It was previously believed only one hacker group used the attack code, known as \"zero-day\" exploits because they use unpatched vulnerabilities in computer software. But it has become apparent more than one threat actor is involved, pointing to Elderwood as a zero-day supplier, possibly a professional outfit selling to government entities. The dealer has been linked with various zero-day vulnerabilities this year, including ones found in Internet Explorer and Adobe software. Various links between the different teams and the Elderwood supplier have been uncovered. They include code being hosted on the same web server and common hacking tools across groups. This has led Symantec to two likely scenarios. Either Elderwood is a parent organisation for many different but linked groups who are being handed the attack tools directly, or it is single arms dealer supplying any buyers who have their own separate agendas. There have been no signs of any technical links between Elderwood customers, such as shared command and control tools for their maware, said Gavin O'Gorman, senior security response analyst at Symantec. That there is one central supplier providing such attack code is rare to see, O'Gorman added. \"We haven't seen that kind of common exploit development before,\" he said, comparing Elderwood to a professional software company. Despite leaving its footprint on the internet, O'Gorman is doubtful the Elderwood group will ever be stopped. \"It's not one central thing you can shut down. Although there are kind of little bits and pieces [that we can tie together], they change things up enough so that it makes it difficult for us to detect them. \"For these kinds of attacks, I'd be surprised if you could arrest them... they've been around since at least 2009 and they haven't slipped up and revealed identities. There's not a lot you can do.\"",
