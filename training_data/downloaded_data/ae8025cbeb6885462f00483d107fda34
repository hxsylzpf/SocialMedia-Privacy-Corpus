  "content": "Easter brought not eggs but worms to Twitter, the \"microblogging\"-messaging service. And not for the first time, the attack was mounted using cross-site scripting (XSS). The first attack caused users to unwittingly tweet puffs for another site, Stalk Daily. The second was about mikeyy. It turned out the two were related. BNO News reports: Mikeyy Mooney, the 17-year-old creator of StalkDaily.com from Brooklyn, has admitted responsibility for the Twitter worm that rapidly spread through Twitter on Saturday, stating in an email to BNO News, \"I am aware of the attack and yes I am behind this attack.\" He added: \"I am the person who coded the XSS which then acted as a worm when it auto updated a users profile and status, which then infected other users who viewed their profile. I did this out of boredom, to be honest. I usually like to find vulnerabilities within websites and try not to cause too much damage, but start a worm or something to give the developers an insight on the problem and while doing so, promoting myself or my website.\" The second attack used the same script with a different server, and different messages, such as \"Twitter please fix this, regards Mikeyy\" and \"Mikeyy is done\". Both attacks worked by adding obfuscated scripts to the Name and More info URL entries in a Twitter user's settings. In a brief statement, Twitter said: We've taken steps to remove the offending updates, and to close the holes that allowed this \"worm\" to spread. No passwords, phone numbers, or other sensitive information were compromised as part of this attack. On Sunday, Twitter published a longer blog post, Wily Weekend Worms. As Graham Cluley of Sophos observed, it was \"a bad 24 hours for Web 2.0 security\": Twitter is being put through the mangle at the moment - clearly a long hard look needs to be taken of how well it secures its users if it is going to survive its growing popularity amongst cybercriminals as well as the general public. Mikeyy was basically harmless, but the next attackers might have nastier ideas. @jackschofield",
