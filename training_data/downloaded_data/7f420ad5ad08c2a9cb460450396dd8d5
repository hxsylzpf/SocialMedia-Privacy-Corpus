  "content": "\u2022 Four years after first introducing the 'news feed' to its users, Facebook has patented the idea of a constantly updating stream of activities. But it's become the heart of many social networks in the meantime. Will Zuckerberg and co try to enforce their ownership of the idea? \u2022 It's been a while since we talked about Palm, and its ongoing struggle to reinvent itself - but given the fact that the company issued a profit warning yesterday, there may be a lot more to say on the subject. The company said that \"driving broad consumer adoption of Palm products is taking longer than we anticipated\"; the Wall Street Journal has a letter from boss Jon Rubinstein to employees. \u2022 And here's a little something to liven up your Friday afternoon: A series of little clickable puzzle games called Twitch.

You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
