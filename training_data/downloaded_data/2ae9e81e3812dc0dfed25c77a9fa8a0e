  "content": "Rachel Johnson, sister of London mayor Boris, has had her Twitter account hacked. At least that's her explanation for the fairly explicit tweet that was sent to Prime Minister David Cameron. The self-confessed blonde show-pony and literary agent must have been taken aback to see such a bold-faced enquiry on her feed. She quickly responded with an apology to her followers and \"the Leader\". Cameron didn't reply. As for Rachel's sibling, the other family blonde show pony, remained quiet. For once. The tweet was swiftly deleted but there's no escaping the magic of the screen-grab.",
