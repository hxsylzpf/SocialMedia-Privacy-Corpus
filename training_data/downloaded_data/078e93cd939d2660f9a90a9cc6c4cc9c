  "content": "The Scottish newspaper that published the lurid allegations about Prince Charles's private life claims it was told by the royal press operation on Saturday it was \"entirely comfortable\" with details emerging. Andrew Jaspan, the editor of the Sunday Herald, said that he considered the allegations to be \"ludicrous\", but took the decision to publish after the Irish Independent and other foreign newspapers printed the charge. The paper received legal advice that an injunction preventing the Mail on Sunday from publishing the allegations did not apply in Scotland. The Sunday Herald is not distributed in England and the article in question does not appear on its website. Jaspan said that the previous weekend, when Michael Fawcett's lawyers took out a last minute injunction to stop the allegations appearing in the Mail on Sunday, he had been contacted by Buckingham Palace and asked to provide his home and mobile telephone numbers. However, by last weekend the paper had received no further contact from either the palace or lawyers for Prince Charles's former aide, Michael Fawcett. When the Sunday Herald contacted the palace and informed them it was planning to report what had already been said in foreign newspapers and websites, an official said it was \"entirely comfortable\" with the allegations coming out, Jaspan said. However, he would not say to which palace official he spoke. As well as the Irish Independent, the allegations have appeared in two Italian papers - Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica - and in the Sydney Morning Herald, among other publications. \"On Saturday morning we got a phone call from Dublin to say the Irish Independent had spouted it out. We also saw the Sydney Morning Herald and two papers in Italy and Germany as well as a number of other websites had pulled the whole thing together,\" Jaspan said. \"We then consulted our lawyers. We at no stage heard anything whatsoever from anybody's lawyers. The previous weekend on Friday night we received calls from Buckingham Palace saying they needed all my numbers - home, mobile, work - because they were very concerned about something happening last weekend. \"We spoke to the palace, who said they were entirely comfortable about this stuff coming out, because it's ludicrous and without foundation and frankly would put an end to this whirlwind of speculation. \"We then got in touch with Michael Fawcett's solicitors and we told them precisely what we were doing and explained to them what was being reported in papers around the world.\" Jaspan stressed that all the Sunday Herald did was to report what had already been said in foreign newspapers. \"We don't believe [the allegation]. We published the fact that the palace said it was ludicrous,\" he said. The editor added that journalists on the Sunday Herald contacted a number of friends and acquaintances of Prince Charles who had known him for up to 25 years, who all said they did not believe the allegations to be true. The International Press Network, which distributes foreign newspapers in the UK, has been combing through overseas papers to check whether they contain the allegations and those that do have been destroyed to prevent them from going on sale. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857",
