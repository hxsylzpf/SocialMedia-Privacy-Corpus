  "content": "The upgraded Times iPad app has been greeted with something less than delight by its first subscribers. Scores of people who have paid \u00a314.99 to obtain the app have been hugely critical of it since its launch early last month. The new version of the app, which was supposed to provide better access to The Times and Sunday Times, has attracted a host of negative ratings. One reviewer on Apple's app store noted that it has received 780 negative reviews out of 800. He/she wrote: \"Truly awful\u2026 it crashes far too frequently\u2026 I have not been able to download the Sunday Times.\" Another commented: \"Sunday mornings have now become more complicated\u2026 I can no longer download all sections\u2026 I am unimpressed.\" A third, called Simon Harrison, wrote simply: \"I'm giving up. This is terrible and not worth the money. Sorry.\" One of the irate users is Richard Holway, the founder of digital technology analysis site, TechMarketView. He had been happy with the previous version of the Times app. But having acquired the upgraded version two weeks ago, he said: \"It is rubbish. It crashes my iPad repeatedly. I have never got past page one of the newspaper since.\" He then discovered that his experience was shared by many other people who had taken to Twitter to register their annoyance. App \"has failed spectacularly\", tweeted Dave Middleton. And Robin Smith wrote: \"Too many half-empty pages and crap formatting\u2026 whole thing feels like it's been rushed.\" The Times's publisher, News International, had promised that the app would allow for \"automatic download of all sections\" and improve the \"overall experience.\" But the technology website, Computer World UK, noted that the publisher was \"struggling to iron out bugs\u2026 after being flooded with complaints from readers.\" The site quotes Tom Whitwell, head of digital for the Times and Sunday Times, as saying: \"We are aware that some readers are having problems with the new app and we are working very hard to address these\". He pledged that \"some initial changes in a new version\u2026 will improve Newsstand overnight downloads and app stability.\" Whitwell also addressed readers with a statement on the Times's site after receiving what he called \"lots of feedback\" about the app. He said the company was \"working very hard\" to address the problem. He wrote: \"Before launching this app we invested in a very rigorous test process. Over 600 readers generously tested the app for a total of 20,000 hours, offering feedback that has been invaluable. Like all iPad apps, it was tested by Apple before release. Unfortunately, it was not enough.\" To help readers, he revealed that the Times had produced a guide to help users. Called \"Device suggestions for improving performance,\" it offers practical suggestions to overcome the crash problems. Despite the advice and some technical changes, there continue to be plenty of users unimpressed with the New International's remedy. \"Times advice is switch off all other iPad functionality,\" tweeted Mike Phillips. \"NO.\"",
