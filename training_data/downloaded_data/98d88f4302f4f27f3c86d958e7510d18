  "content": "It was hyped almost as much as the World Cup final \u2013 but the BBC's Doctor Who series 8 trailer, shown in the half-time break during the match, didn't disappoint fans. The BBC had done its best to build excitement with a string of short clips and tweets: In the (very dark-looking) trailer, a robotic voice \u2013 sounding something like the Doctor's old adversary Davros \u2013 told us that \"life returns\". Then Capaldi's Time Lord told us: \"I'm the Doctor. I have lived for over 2,000 years. I have made many mistakes. It's about time I did something about that.\" His companion Clara Oswald then asked \"Where are we going?\" \"Into darkness,\" replied the Doctor. A string of images then followed, including Daleks, Cybermen, a tentacled alien and a tryrannosaurus rex stomping past the Houses of Parliament. Plenty to look forward to, then \u2013 and the tantalising image of Capaldi on a horse. The Doctor then asked: \"Clara be my pal - am I a good man?\" Clara almost whispered: \"I don't know who The Doctor is any more\". Unsurprisingly, viewers went into a frenzy on Twitter, with many claiming the trailer was better than the (then goal-less) match: The new series starts on 23 August \u2013 Monkey hopes that, unlike the World Cup final, Doctor Who doesn't have to go into extra time to deliver a result.",
