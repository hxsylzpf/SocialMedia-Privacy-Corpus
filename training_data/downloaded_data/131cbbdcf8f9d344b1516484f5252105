  "content": "How refreshing to spend a day away from my home office \u2013 it's been slightly claustrophobic with Ollie home for half-term. He's taken to inviting his chums over to play a car-jacking video game in our living room. I've strayed in once or twice to cajole them into turning the volume down \u2013 oddly, they like to hold their hand-gun attachments sideways as they fire; I am mystified as to how this helps with aim. My day out was to the Luton Business Centre for Phil's one-day social media seminar. It was extremely popular and, I have to say, gave me a lot to think about. Phil opened with a stirring video by a chap called Erik Qualman titled The Social Media Revolution. If you haven't seen it already, I urge you to do so, as it has a succession of striking facts about social media set to a pulsating dance music soundtrack. There were one or two facts that I found very powerful. For example it seems \"social media has overtaken pornography as the No 1 activity on the web\". (When I Skyped my friend Derek \u2013 a former colleague from the bank who is on his uppers somewhat \u2013 yesterday to share this, he replied sardonically that he considered it his personal mission to reverse the trend.) I was also taken by the following quote: \"We don't have a choice on whether we do social media, the question is how well we do it.\" We were all a little awestruck after the video. In fact the lady seated beside me \u2013 also a business coach, as it happens \u2013 actually said: \"Awesome!\" \"So,\" said Phil, when the room had settled down, \"you can be sure of one thing \u2013 if you aren't doing social media, your competitors are.\" I took lots of notes and over the next few weeks will be building my presence on a number of platforms since with my LinkedIn profile I am barely scratching the surface. This will build my audience and increase my share of voice! On a more mundane level, Sandra insisted that I knock on Doug's door and borrow his ladder to stop starlings roosting in our roof. I drove up to the builders' merchant to buy replacement covers for the soffit holes and found myself envying the plumbers and carpenters bantering at the counter with their trade accounts, tool-belts and sense of purpose. Doug answered the door in a pair of shorts; oddly, our cat Rocky appeared from nowhere and went about wrapping himself around Doug's tanned calf. Doug was happy enough to lend me his ladder but not without first telling me about his up-coming sky-diving trip to Arizona and then asking me a few penetrating career questions. \"So, are you working from home or have you taken early retirement?\" I muttered something diffident about setting myself up as a business coach. Why do I feel like a simpering schoolboy beside this man of 70 who is wealthier, fitter and slimmer than I? \"Oh, I see,\" he said witheringly. \"If you can't do, teach. And if you can't teach, coach.\" With that, he laughed uproariously and tossed me the key to his garage.",
