The Sun chain, which has titles in Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary, Winnipeg and Edmonton, has announced that it is turning off the commenting facility. Other major titles also owned by the Postmedia Network, such as the National Post, made a similar move earlier this month. They require readers who want to comment to sign in using their Facebook credentials. In a message posted on Thursday to online readers, James Wallace, the chain's editorial vice-president, wrote \"We pride ourselves both on dishing out and taking criticism - especially when the latter comes from our readers... However, the increasing use of Sun comment boards for anonymous, negative, even malicious personal attacks, albeit by a minority, has led us to conclude our current commenting system is not serving the interests of the majority of our readers. Therefore we have decided, for the time being, to no longer allow commenting on most online articles until we sort out a better and more accountable way for our readers to interact with us and each other.\" Wallace argues that \"much\" of the debate about topics raised by the paper \"already takes place on social media.\" So, he added, \"we will continue to post our stories, columns and editorials on social media, including Twitter and Facebook, and you will be able to comment on them there.\" The problem of policing comments that are often filled with invective \u2013 some of it grossly offensive and some of it libellous \u2013 is hardly unique to Canada. At the end of last year, Media Briefing reported on \"a glut of news sites\" that were \"beginning to shut down their below the line (BTL) commenting sections.\" It cited Reuters.com as the foremost example, plus TheWeek.com and News.Mic. TheWeek, employing similar aguments to Reuters, explained: \"There was a time... when the comments sections of news and opinion sites were not only the best place to host these conversations, they were the only place. That is no longer the case... Today, the smartest, most thoughtful, and most spirited conversations are being driven not by pseudonymous avatars in the comments sections of news sites, but by real people using their real names on the social web. It is no longer a core service of news sites to provide forums for these conversations. Instead, we provide the ideas, the fodder, the jumping off point, and readers take it to Facebook or Twitter or Reddit or any number of other places to continue the conversation.\" But there are plenty of people who object to these decisions (quite apart from the trolls). If the debates stimulated by newspapers are taken off site, then the paper's online numbers fall and, by extension, its advertising or sponsorship pontential falls too. The Media Briefing article cites Matthew Ingram of GigaOm who believes that by building a strong community it can be monetised. So telling the community to go elsewhere depresses the revenue opportunities. Can newspapers, which are gradually losing a once-loyal print readership, really afford to annoy those readers who have come to their digital platform? Isn't one key part of the digital revolution the way it has enabled journalist-audience interaction? Or, as one commenter neatly put it, don't editors realise that comment is content too?
