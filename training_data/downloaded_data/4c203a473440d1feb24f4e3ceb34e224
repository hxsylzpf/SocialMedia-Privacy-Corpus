  "content": "Supporters Direct, the organisation set up more than a decade ago to further the case for greater fan representation in football, faces a funding crisis following a furious row over Twitter messages sent by its chief executive. It is understood that the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF), funded to the tune of \u00a36m a year by the Premier League, including \u00a3750,000 ringfenced for a new Fans' Fund, has rescinded the money it pledged to Supporters Direct over the next three years. Instead, it will invite individual fans' groups to apply for the funding directly. Under the last three-year funding formula, the FSIF channeled \u00a31.8m over three years through Supporters Direct. The FSIF board was believed to be dissatisfied with the reply provided by the Supporters Direct chair Dame Pauline Green in response to concern over tweets from the chief executive Dave Boyle celebrating the promotion of AFC Wimbledon. Following an exchange of letters, it wrote to the organisation on Wednesday to say the grant was being rescinded. Boyle has apologised for the \"crude and offensive\" tweets, which he subsequently deleted. One said: \"The Bible can fuck off. This is the greatest story ever told.\" The issue of fan ownership became a political football in the run-up to the general election, with all three parties promising to come up with new proposals at the height of fan anger over the balance sheets at Portsmouth, Liverpool and Manchester United. The ongoing parliamentary select committee inquiry into football governance, expected to report at the beginning of July, is expected to contain proposals on fan ownership. The question mark over the future funding of Supporters Direct, an umbrella organisation envisaged as an administrative, legal and financial resource for fans looking to take a stake in their clubs, will lead to fresh debate about its future funding and role. According to its mission statement, the organisation's goal is \"to promote sustainable spectator sports clubs based on supporters' involvement and community ownership\". It has helped establish more than 100 supporters' trusts across England, Wales and Scotland and now also extends help to rugby league fans hoping to increase supporter involvement. Last year, the FSIF \u2013 which was originally set up to fund improvements to facilities at all levels of football \u2013 was jointly funded by the FA and the Premier League, providing \u00a32.8m each. Under a new funding formula, the Premier League now funds it directly through the \u00a312m it provides to the Football Foundation.",
