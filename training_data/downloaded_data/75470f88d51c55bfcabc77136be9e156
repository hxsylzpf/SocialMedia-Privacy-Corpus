  "content": "What are we going to do with you, Imogen Thomas (@imogen_thomas)? There's no denying that since news broke of the high court superinjunction over your affair with a married premier league footballer you've been through the mill. Between the haters hating (\"WOW . . . If name calling could kill I would be dead by now\") and your restless nights (\"I had the most weird dream about Mr Justice Eady last night. I sleep, eat and breathe the situation\"), it's been a tough few weeks. However, you're allowing your private life to affect your Twitter performance, which is unacceptable. Allow me to guide you through these troubled waters with some advice. From me to you. Uncensored. Turn that frown :-( upside down :-) Before all this super injunction malarkey, Imogen, your problems were few (\"I'm trying to nap with rollers in. Is this possible?! X\") and you found pleasure in the simplest things (\"Doritos and sun. What more could a girl want? :-) x\"). Now the tabloid headlines have brought a darker mood. Many more of these downbeat tweets \u2013 \"Live everyday like its your last because one day it will be . . .\" and followers will desert you in droves. For an instant cheer-up, follow Jedward (@planetjedward). They get breathlessly excited about Weetabix (\"Guess whos going to have breakfast! we are going to have breakfast! we are gonna break that fast so fast that is breakslow\"). Let them turn that frown upside down. Make friends with some footballers Dating footballers has not worked out for you so far, so why not give being \"just friends\" a chance? The Neville brothers seem like nice upstanding guys who won't be getting up to any funny business. See if you can put up with the minutiae of Gary's (@GNev2) gym routine (\"Gym Session as requested 2 min @ level 14 bike 110RPM, 1 min boxing \u2013 20 sit ups \u2013 20 press ups \u2013 20 lunges \u2013 30 secs arm drives. Do 6 times !\") and Phil's (@fizzer18) less than impressive football commentary (\"Ryan giggs what a player!!!\"). I would stay away from Wayne (@waynerooney), though. Coleen (@coleenroo) will have your eyes out. Perspective In the last month you've been dumped, superinjuncted and had to give a teary mea culpa to Phillip Schofield (@Schofe). You might find this hard to believe, but things could be so much worse. Look at poor Jemima Khan (@Jemima_Khan) \u2013 falsely accused by an anonymous \"injunction busting\" Twitter account of sleeping with Jeremy Clarkson? There's always someone worse off than you are. Perspective, dude. Perspective. Love @scouserachel",
