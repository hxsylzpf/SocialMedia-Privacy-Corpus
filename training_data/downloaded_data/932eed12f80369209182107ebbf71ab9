  "content": "A month or so ago, we visited Blackpool on a TwiTrip, where for an entire day our reporter's actions were solely inspired by real-time advice from Twitter. All of our TwiTrips so far (Blackpool was preceded by Brighton, and before that by San Francisco and Paris) have delivered the goods ... churning out quirky recommendations and unexpected angles. And, of course, experiencing it live was a lot of fun. We've decided to roll the TwiTrip on to another destination - today we're off to Bristol, home of Banksy and trip-hop (back in the day). It's also got Fairtrade city status, and is home to the Soil Association, so we're expecting good wholesome feeds. But we'd really like your help in finding some of the good stuff that's out there - places, views, entertainments or anything that could make up the perfect Bristol day out - so join us on our day trip to the city and let's get the tips rolling in. Follow Rob, send tweets and find out more about his TwiTrip at twitter.com/rob_fitzpatrick. Please start the tweet with @rob_fitzpatrick and, if possible add #Twitrip to it.
