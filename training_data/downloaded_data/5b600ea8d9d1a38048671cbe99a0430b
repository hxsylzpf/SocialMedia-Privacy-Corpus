Even that odd halfway house - infotainment - is no longer an appropriate description of what they purvey in their meretricious diet of glitz, tits and naughty bits. Celebrity is no longer an aspect of the popular paper agenda: it is now its raison d'etre. It is surely significant that Richard Desmond, the owner of the fastest-rising title, the Daily Star, should remark of his newspaper business, \"We're a branch of showbiz, aren't we?\" Top marks, at least, for honesty. Piers Morgan, editor of the Daily Mirror, said much the same a few years back in a candid magazine interview. Then, in a U-turn after September 11, he won huge publicity by announcing the adoption of a serious agenda before - not months later - turning about face once more to run celebrity-based front pages. Morgan made his switch back to froth because he and his owners feared a dramatic fall in sales if he continued with his mission to inform. Like it or not, they felt they must give in to the supposed demands of their audience. That view of public taste acknowledges the strength of modern culture which, I readily concede, cannot be blamed on papers alone. To paraphrase a now-unfashionable philosopher, I think it's fair to say that celebrity, rather than religion, is now the opium of the people. People consume fame and chase fame, and the media as a whole play a fascinating role in this process, especially in encouraging people to strive for the limelight. The media - television, films, advertising, the press, every aspect of media - act as both the conduit for the would-be famous and the stage for the already-famous. They also make profits from showing off the famous to the non-famous. But they have also been subordinated by the fame game because their survival now depends on satisfying the appetite they've stimulated so successfully among their audiences. They are now forced to go on producing, and reproducing, the famous. They have become both the drug pushers and the drug addicts. They can't control the system in which they play such a vital role because, as perpetrator and victim, they cannot stop the world and get off. Morgan's reluctant acquiescence to the wishes of his celebrity-obsessed readers is a case in point, though most editors have never bothered to question their role. They have grown up in a journalistic environment which has made a virtue of the cult of celebrity, absorbing it so thoroughly that they cannot conceive of producing papers any other way. Nor should we confine this analysis to the populars alone. The serious broadsheet press has also been attracted by the showbusiness magnet. Rarely is there a day when some broadsheets don't carry a picture of a famous person on their front pages. So insidious has this process been that the BBC's news agenda has been similarly infected. The corporation's former arts and media correspondent, Nick Higham, has criticised the BBC's news output as being \"insignificant and trivial\". Another high-profile BBC reporter, Rosie Millard, the outgoing arts correspondent, has said that she often found herself \"standing on the red carpet reporting on some film that everyone knew was rubbish just because it had a celebrity in it\". TV's reality shows reveal just how desperate people are to be famous despite the obvious pitfalls, such as intrusions into privacy and inevitable public humiliation. They are willing victims who appear delighted to be used and abused by papers whose only motivation is to ramp up sales. It doesn't matter to editors whether what they publish about the famous is good or bad. There is no question of morality. In an honest, but breathtakingly cynical, speech to the Media Society last year, the News of the World's chief reporter, Phil Taylor, openly boasted that he and his colleagues didn't think personalities deserved any privacy or public sympathy. The audience overwhelmingly agreed with him. As far as journalists are concerned, celebrities forfeit their rights once they become famous. They have wealth and fame and should be happy to pay the price for it which means accepting that they are fair game for media misbehaviour. Papers regard negative, intrusive material as far more readable than positive, upbeat, happy stories. So, on the inverted scale of showbiz worth, a candid picture taken without a person's knowledge or consent is more valuable than a posed studio shot. But woe betide those celebrities who dare to complain about their treatment. Remember the case of Sara Cox and her husband who were embarrassed by the People's publication of pictures showing them in the nude while on their honeymoon. When I asked the editor and photographer responsible why they did it, both independently gave similar answers: she had yielded her right to privacy because she'd posed for candid pictures in the past and given supposedly intimate interviews. Newspapers treat anyone whose face or name is known to the public in the same way, as their choice of paparazzi shots from the world's beaches illustrates. Why were author J.K. Rowling, newscaster Anna Ford and current affairs presenter David Dimbleby considered fair game when they were pictured on holiday? Editors know there are no laws or rules against them publishing pictures of anyone snapped in a public place and they defend what they do by claiming that they're merely exercising their freedom. There is no greater trivialisation of the theory and practice of press freedom than newspapers raising its banner to excuse the publication of inconsequential trash. Did John Wilkes go to jail in his struggle for the liberty of the press so that the News of the World could invent a story about the kidnap of Victoria Beckham? This puerile freedom claim is normally accompanied by a second line of defence: we must be doing something right because so many people read us. Or, to put it the other way round, we're obviously giving the people what they want because they buy us. Surely, it's time to put this simplistic response to the sword. In so doing, I concede that the relationship between reader and paper is a complex matter. It's undeniable that there is a great deal of reciprocity between the two. Public standards about what can and cannot be published have changed in my lifetime: it's doubtful if a paper could have published a daily page 3 girl in the 1950s, for example. Indeed, the Sun was very hesitant when it began the habit in the early 1970s. That's a perfect example of the way in which editors, working on instinct about changed public taste, test reaction and - if favourable -then feed it and, in the process of course, stimulate it. But this process shouldn't blind us. It shouldn't be taken to mean that papers have no responsibility for what they publish beyond a slavish pandering to the general public appetite. Some measure of prescription about what is in the public interest - or, to use the more apposite phrase, the public benefit - should inform every newspaper's editorial values. In other words, it's a matter of exercising press freedom for the overall good of society. To do that, owners and editors have to ask themselves the most basic question of all: why do we exist? What's journalism for? It's not about being a branch of showbiz but about holding the state, in all its various guises, to account. It doesn't mean being dull or eschewing all coverage of entertainment, but it does mean regaining a balanced perspective. After all, has no one asked themselves the main, underlying reason for the decline in sales: pandering to the public does not appear to be working. Unless we wake up, unless we do something about this sad situation, we are surely on our way to hell in a handcart aptly decorated with the slogan: I'm a celebrity get me in here! \u00b7 Adapted from a lecture by Roy Greenslade, professor of journalism at City University, London given last Thursday",
