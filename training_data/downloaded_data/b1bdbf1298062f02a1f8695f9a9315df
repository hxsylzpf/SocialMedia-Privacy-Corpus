  "content": "The press complaints commission yesterday expressed reservations over a proposal to fine newspapers for breaking the editors' code of conduct. Guy Black, the commission's director, said that he had \"real problems\" with the plan, floated by the Commons select committee for culture, media and sport as a way of \"beefing up\" press self-regulation. \"Most complaints are from ordinary people about local newspapers. They don't want money, they don't necessarily even want anything published. They want an apology from the editor and an assurance that it's not going to happen to anyone else. \"We were never meant to be a watered-down version of the legal system,\" he told a meeting of the Westminster Media Forum. However, he broadly welcomed the committee's report, saying: \"I recognise the commission is not perfect and probably never will be. We have constantly to strive to make it better.\" The veteran Labour backbencher Clive Soley attacked the media at the event, accusing newspapers and broadcasters of muddling news with comment and manipulating facts to suit their agendas. He also called for the new media watchdog, Ofcom, to be given powers \"to review and report on\" the effectiveness of the press, although not to regulate it. \"Privacy is not the main issue. Increasingly the media, and not just newspapers, are replacing news with comment presented as news. \"Examples are now so frequent as to raise very serious questions about the public's right to be protected from news manipulation by editors, owners and some journalists.\" The government has ruled out the select committee's most controversial recommendation, a privacy law. Piers Morgan, the outspoken editor of the Daily Mirror, attacked the MPs' report yesterday. \"It's a vacuous exercise in self-indulgence by a bunch of busybody MPs with nothing better to do all day,\" he said. Martin Cruddace, former head of legal affairs at the Mirror group, said the committee's recommendations for the commission were unworkable, and that a privacy law existed in other provisions such as the law of confidence and the Human Rights Act.",
