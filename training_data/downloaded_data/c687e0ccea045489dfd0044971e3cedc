Two hundred RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) antennas have been fitted into the ceilings, and individuals taking part in the trial wear RFID tags round their necks and on their possessions. Their location is followed in real time, but unlike many Orwellian deployments of such technology - where hidden overseers know what we're all doing, but individuals don't - each participant in the RFID Ecosystem can also access the data. \"Our goal is to ask what benefits can we get out of this technology and how can we protect people's privacy at the same time,\" says Magda Balazinska, the project leader and assistant professor of computer science and engineering at UW. \"We want to get a handle on the privacy issues that will crop up if these systems become a reality.\" Close encounters Balazinska and a dozen other members of the team have been wearing RFID tags for the past year. The sensor data is collected in a central database and then passed on to applications such as Google Calendar and a Twitter widget called RFIDder (pronounced \"fritter\") which sends alerts to friends letting them know if they're in a meeting or have sat down to lunch. It also automatically logs every \"encounter\" event between participants. In April, the project will be expanded to include 50 students, who will be queried on a daily basis on their reactions to the experiment (more details can be found at rfid.cs.washington.edu/). \"If someone opts in, they can opt out at any time. The interface also lets them choose a level of access for others to their whereabouts and activities,\" says Gaetano Borriello, a UW professor behind the project. \"We hope if it's useful, it will become part of the building.\" RFID tags are now being incorporated into biometric ID cards, supermarket distribution networks, Washington State \"Enhanced Driver's Licenses\" and numerous public transport schemes. Yet regulations regarding the use of commercially collected RFID data are nascent. \"It's a wild west atmosphere,\" Borriello says. \"You put your stake down and mine.\" The question of being tracked by things we own has come to the fore in the past few months. In February, Transport for London's (TfL) Oyster cards drew attention when it was revealed that the Metropolitan Police had made 3,000 requests for passenger journey data in 2006. TfL holds the data for eight weeks for \"customer service purposes\", but most Oyster card holders only become aware of this if they query being overcharged for a journey. The RFID Ecosystem does have some obvious benefits: if you've lost your wallet, the tags will show you where it is. Another useful application is a \"web of things\", where PCs, posters and other objects around campus incorporate RFID tags. If a participant wants to get a copy of the music playing on someone's computer, they can scan it with a handheld device and get a link to the content. But these incentives are secondary to the main benefit of the system, which is enabling social networks. Balazinska has the system set so she can't see the whereabouts of her students, but they have access to her data. \"I don't know when I'm going to be in my office,\" she says. \"But if I am in they can pop by.\" Some of her students have used the alerts to catch her on her way out of the building. Student and participant Travis Kriplean says: \"Sometimes I forget that I'm carrying a number of tags, and then suddenly come across them. That's when I'm reminded of the location tracking taking place, and it can be kind of a shock.\" The RFID Ecosystem is based on a network of sensors fitted in hallways but not actual rooms, in accordance with Federal Communications Commission regulations. The ceiling-mounted antennae detect tags up to four metres away and use one watt of power. Probable causes The system software uses probabilistic activity recognition, associating people, objects and places to guess the most likely event happening. The software has trouble distinguishing between a formal meeting and two people who happen to be standing in the same room, so the team conducts \"Experience Sampling\" of participants to verify the data and explore their privacy concerns. \"There have been no malicious intentions from within the group so far, but we'd like to be prepared for it,\" Balazinska says. A similar trial has been taking place already this year in the UK, with researchers at Lancaster University in partnership with Carillion construction and BP testing an RFID-based system to monitor the safety of workers on construction sites. Sensor data is used to prevent drill operators from developing the painful condition of \"vibration white finger\" (caused by using a percussion drill for extended periods), but could also be used for employee monitoring. The majority of current RFID deployments, whether in public or workplace settings, offer limited benefits to their users in return for the potential loss of privacy. Balazinska says: \"This will change. The technology allows us to be at different points in the privacy-utility space.\" Lead graduate student Evan Welbourne says: \"Changes can be affected by building applications on top of existing sensor deployments, so they can be harnessed by the users of the system.\" In the experiment, allowing users to see who had looked at their data had an unintended effect. \"Some people were disappointed when they saw their friend hadn't checked up on them,\" Welbourne says.",
