  "content": "If someone you didn't know sat beside you on the bus and began divulging their family secrets and sexual fantasies, you'd probably slip on some headphones, discreetly search for another seat, and maybe scrunch your eyes closed in the childish hope they'd have vanished when you looked again. We don't normally crack open the inside of our minds for the delectation of strangers. How weird, then, that these restraints are suspended by so many of us online. Paul Venezia has a really interesting piece on the subject on tech site InfoWorld. His comment is interesting and pertinent here: \"A world of people out there \u2026 don't comprehend how deeply their internet usage is tracked and the level of detail they make available on a constant basis \u2026 and somehow, most of them don't care.\" He's right, I think. Many people don't care about their digital footprint. I'm not even talking about anonymous shenanigans such as trolling to stir mischief, which can rebound on you anyway (as Rod Liddle would presumably attest). Far more bizarre is what people put up under their own names: a noxious effluvium of personal detail, revealed intimacies, skewed views and solipsistic ego-stroking. They post pictures of their infants. They recount in tedious detail a row with their partner. They upload videos of last night's boozy lap-dance. They make barbed and libellous statements about named individuals. I've seen sports journalists on Facebook rip into various players and administrators \u2013 the very folks they also write about in their job. Professional integrity? What's that? And that's the family-friendly stuff. My innocent wee mind can barely comprehend those websites where exhibitionists strip (or worse) for the camera, presumably because it's \"empowering\", or whatever meaningless catchphrase is currently in vogue. I'm not prudish and can understand professionals carrying on like so \u2013 they're being paid. But these are regular people, with regular families, jobs and lives. And regular futures \u2013 until now. These eejits don't seem to realise that this is everlasting. Once something is on the internet, it can never be pulled back. It will always exist somewhere: on a server, a PC, a print-out or a CD. And if it exists, it can come back to haunt you. This fills me with horror. I realise cultural mores evolve, and the demarcation lines between private and public have been blurred, if not eroded. Sex, depression, addiction, emotions, grief: nothing truly happens if it's not played out under the spotlight. Are these things not meant to be private? I'm all for discussing sex, death and family in a broad sense \u2013 nobody wants to return to the killing silence of the bad old days. But surely the gynaecological minutiae of one's sex life should be private? Surely the neuroses of one's parents are their business? It's absurd and insane, a sort of self-chosen Big Brother existence. Creepy. Maybe it's a generational thing. A phone advert currently running in Ireland is aimed at the younger market, not old farts like me. I'm bewildered by the concept behind it: that you'd go to a house party and be having fun, getting drunk and acting stupid while others are filming and uploading the footage for the entire planet to see. It's appalling to me that private daftness and debauchery is no longer private. When I was a kid, if someone at a party showed you online pictures of you snogging a girl that very evening, you'd most likely punch them in the face and sarcastically congratulate them on being such a colossal asshole. But it's not just the kids, is it? Older people, who should know better, can be just as culpable. Maybe we should blame those twin cultural viruses of celebrity and confession instead, which insist that anyone can be famous, nothing is off-limits, and everyone's story is worth exposing to a mass audience. In the past you became a star, you were someone, because you did things. Now you become someone simply by selling yourself; and once you've decided to do that, why spare the details?",
