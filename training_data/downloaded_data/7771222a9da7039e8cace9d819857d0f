  "content": "You may have heard the news: cheating and sex addiction are not relationship deal-breakers for Gwyneth Paltrow. I know, right? Totally coincidentally at the same time as releasing her new film on sex addiction, \"Gwyn\" (as they affectionately call her) has \"revealed\" to online fashion magazine Refinery29 that she'd be \"open-minded\" and \"forgiving\" if she came across such speed bumps in her own relationship. The news quickly got gobbled up and regurgitated by the huge mother bird of the Mail Online, shoved into the mouths of all her hungry awaiting chicks, and then tweeted across the internet. Isn't social media fun? Now, I know what you're thinking: Gwyneth Paltrow is a woman who once said that life was about \"finding the balance between cigarettes and tofu\" and named her firstborn Apple. She is a woman whose advice we should therefore take with a pinch of salt, a block of soy and a Marlboro: someone we probably shouldn't reverse all our \"relationship deal-breakers\" for at the drop of a hat. Nevertheless, in the words of your own film, Gwyn, Thanks For Sharing. But I'm actually here to rain on your parade. Because despite all your movie credentials it seems completely unfair for you to wade in on this debate for two important reasons. First, you have a husband who is absolutely guaranteed never to cheat, having produced music so unsexy that they use it in nunneries to bolster abstinence morale. And second, there wasn't a debate in the first place. In these bad new days of \"celeb-spotting\" and selling your wedding photos to Hello! magazine and the Crazy About One Direction documentary, producing such inane titbits for the benefit of a ridiculously derivative click-bait headline is the main function of celebrities. It's not even really their fault: Paltrow's original interview saw her interviewer asking the question, and GP riffing that she could imagine herself approaching infidelity with an open mind. This was duly transformed into \"Gwyneth Paltrow says cheating and sex addiction are NOT deal-breakers in a relationship\" at the Mail, \"Gwyneth Paltrow: I would forgive Chris if he cheated on me\" at the Express, and \"Gwyneth Paltrow on why she's OK with cheating\" as far away as the South African News Informer. The global media entered into a collective conspiracy to label this a \"revelation\"'. And, like suckers, we clicked away. Like \"waity Katie\", \"tragic Jen fearing spinsterhood\" and \"cursed home-wrecker Kristen Stewart\", \"guru Gwyn\" dishing out relationship truths after 10 years trapped in a house with a Coldplay singer is about as real as her own macrobiotic diet. You know that, I know that, and even most people who work at the Mail Online probably know that. The same old shockers are shovelled up again and again to us through the misquoted mouths of celebrities in vaguely connected movies, the same old debates staged, the same old predictably vitriolic comments made below the line on news website pages. It's the persistent tinnitus of modern life. And, dear reader, I'm afraid that it's a noise I've been contributing to myself throughout this article. To which I can only say to you: I'm sorry, but this stuff sells. If you really want to reverse the status quo, you should stop funding it right now. Stop trawling the annals of the interweb for philosophical musings out of the mouths of actors. Stop wondering whether Gwyneth Paltrow holds the key to how you should act when your boyfriend cheats on you with that girl who's still at uni and gave him free MDMA (that's right, Jessica, I haven't forgotten.) Stop feigning interest in some actor's generic opinion on an extremely emotionally complex subject. In the sage and slightly paraphrased lyrics of Gwyn's husband Chris Martin: nobody said it was easy, and no one ever said it would be this hard. But let's take it back to the start.",
