  "content": "The government's data protection regulator has told the Leveson inquiry he has no evidence that newspapers are still breaking the law by obtaining private information about individuals illegally. In frequently robust exchanges on Thursday, the information commissioner, Christopher Graham, rejected arguments that he should be more proactive and launch a fresh investigation into newspaper practices. This follows the revelation at the inquiry last week that Express Newspapers had continued to use a company linked to Steve Whittamore, a private investigator who pleaded guilty to illegally trading private information on behalf of a range of newspapers, until 2010. Graham said his office was \"flat out\" on other issues such as breaches of privacy in the health and financial sectors. He told Lord Justice Leveson he did not see the justification for another press investigation when newspapers had already told him they were no longer engaged in illegal activities using the likes of Whittamore. \"I don't think we are going to get very far if we apply a scattergun approach and just go around checking different websites and different inquiry agents on the off-chance they might be breaking the law,\" Graham said. \"I have got enough work to do looking at people where there is a suggestion of breaking the law.\" When repeatedly challenged as to why the Information Commissioner's Office was not more interested in newspaper practices, he said: \"We are absolutely flat out on a whole range of issues, whether it's car insurance or cases of information security in the health services, in local government ... you are not dealing with a complacent regulator who can't be bothered.\" Graham added that his predecessor as information commissioner had alerted the country to Whittamore's activities in 2006 through the What Price Privacy? and What Price Privacy Now? reports. \"We are in an Alice in Wonderland meets Catch 22 world when the information commissioner, having sounded the alarm, then is asked by the inquiry to find out what is going on,\" he said. He added that his big concern now was to get the penalties for illegally accessing private information increased \u2013 at the moment the courts were only fining people \u00a3100 for breaches. Graham said this means people working in the DVLA or in the health sector had no \"disincentive\" not to pass on information for money, because the courts and society treated the offence as \"no worse than pinching the office stationery\". He added that if the newspapers are now the models of \"rectitude\", they should \"get out of the way\" and drop their opposition to his campaign for stiffer sanctions including custodial sentences. Graham had sometimes heated exchanges with Rhodri Davies, the counsel acting on behalf of News International at the inquiry. In response to Davies's questioning, Graham said: \"I'm not looking to jail lots of people. I can't imagine that a journalist going about his or her business with a proper story and a good public interest reason for doing it would be in any trouble with the ICO or with the courts. But I want to deal with the problem of the courts being limited to fines and then dealing with people who are of limited means and can only be fined about \u00a3100.\" Davies put it to him that the way forward might be \"to exempt from the threat of a prison sentence anyone whose acting for the special purposes of journalism, artistic or literary matters\". At this point Graham expressed his frustration, asking: \"How much of a good deal do you guys want?\" He said to Davies: \"Excuse me, sir, for being heated about this, but you fought everyone to a standstill back in 2006/07. You did it again in 2009/10. You've got so many privileges and exemptions. It's perfectly possible for a journalist to do a decent job legally.\" He added that it sounded to him as if \"the representatives of the press want to be somehow above the law\". Graham, a former journalist, said the press can do their job well enough without breaking the law and while an occasional use of the \"dark arts\" might be needed there were laws to justify this. He pleaded with the press to \"get out of the way\" of stiffer sanctions. \"Yes, OK, you sometimes have to apply the dark arts to get the story, and then you're accountable for it. And if you're really in trouble, that's the mitigation that you put to the court. But we can't keep having more and more carve-outs and reductions and special cases.\" Representatives of Google also gave evidence to the inquiry on Thursday, defending its privacy policies and saying it complied with the law in relation to defamation and privacy. Requests to remove content were taken seriously and it always did so when presented with a court order. Daphne Keller, Google's legal director, said the company had acceded to 65 requests to remove content between January and June last year in the UK. The single biggest category was national security, but matters of privacy also featured strongly. She added that Google had no \"switch to flick or button to press\" to remove content and it relies on users identifying websites with offending content. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
