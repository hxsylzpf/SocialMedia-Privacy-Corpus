People think I'm joking, but who would've guessed that computer engineers would've been the sexy job of the 1990s? That, combined with the McKinsey report into big data last year is a powerful blend. The report reckoned the US alone would need 190,000 deep analytical 'data scientists' - and another 1.5m data-savvy managers to make the big decisions. This week, in California, over 2,000 people grappled with this issue at the Strata data conference. Data is big business, with companies like Google, Facebook and LinkedIn - and possibly every other corporate body you've heard of - creating huge profits out of the way they use data. This is the 'big data' everyone's talking about - the 2.5 quintillion bytes of information created every day from our internet searches, purchases, mobile phone calls and social networking. (If you're interested, a quintillion is 1,000 times a quadrillion, which is 1,000 times a trillion, which is 1,000 times a billion). The result is: more jobs. This is a search on Indeed.com (care of a pretty good piece on the subject on CMSwire) So, what is a data scientist? Here at the Datablog, we might baulk at being described as scientists just because we work with numbers. We are journalists, who just happen to work with numbers. And that's a skillset which you will see become more and more common. If you asked me what a data scientist was, I would say someone who can bridge the raw data and the analysis - and make it accessible. It's a democratising role; by bringing the data to the people, you make the world just a little bit better. But is it science? The Collins Gem dictionary that I have on my desk (very retro, this) defines science as: Systematic study of natural or physical phenomena It helpfully defines a scientist as someone who \"studies or practises a science\". Does that fit the work of data analysis? We asked some of key figures from Strata this week what they thought made a data scientist - and scouted around for interesting thoughts on the issue. Here are a few (and we will update this as more come in). DJ Patil, Data Science in Residence at Greylock Partners and formerly LinkedIn A data scientist is that unique blend of skills that can both unlock the insights of data and tell a fantastic story via the data. Hilary Mason, chief scientist at Bitly who also writes for Dataist (\"Fresher than seeing your model doesn't have heteroscedastic errors\") with Columbia University professor Chris Wiggins A data scientist is someone who blends, math, algorithms, and an understanding of human behavior with the ability to hack systems together to get answers to interesting human questions from data Jake Porway, Data without Borders and the New York Times A data scientist is a rare hybrid, a computer scientist with the programming abilities to build software to scrape, combine, and manage data from a variety of sources and a statistican who knows how to derive insights from the information within. S/he combines the skills to create new protoypes with the creativity and thoroughness to ask and answer the deepest questions about the data and what secrets it holds Jeremy Howard, President &amp; Chief Scientist, Kaggle The four qualities of a great data scientist are creativity, tenacity, curiosity, and deep technical skills. They use skills in data gathering and data munging, visualization, machine learning, and computer programming to make data driven decisions and data driven products. They prefer to let the data do the talking Tim O'Reilly, who calls Larry Page - CEO of Google - the world's top data scientist. Google, more than any other company, has pushed the boundaries of what is possible with big data (Incidentally, check out James Ball today for more on Google and data) Monica Rogati, chief scientist at LinkedIn By definition all scientists are data scientists. In my opinion, they are half hacker, half analyst, they use data to build products and find insights. It's Columbus meet Columbo \u2013 starry eyed explorers and skeptical detectives Of course, it brings all sorts of questions - should people be qualified? Should there be certifications and professional bodies? And does it matter, really - are we all just obsessed with definitions? This piece by Neil Raden sums up that argument quite well, including the point: \"Certified Data Scientist? I don't think so. Fellow of Quantitiative Analysts Society? Better. Data Alchemist? I like that, but it's not really comprehensive enough\" What do you think? What would you say makes up a data scientist? NEW!
