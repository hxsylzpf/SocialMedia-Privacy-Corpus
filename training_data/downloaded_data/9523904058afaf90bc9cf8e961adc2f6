  "content": "On Twitter this week the mystery of Jeremy Corbyn's train seat quickly became simply #traingate, trailing clouds of speculation, wit and invective across the digital world. To older print readers the story was perhaps familiar, a recognisably August silly season tale, in which starved summer news hounds gorge on every detail of something unexpected. Television rolling newscasters gratefully chewed the juicy bone that had come their way too. Meanwhile, conspiracy theorists came up with the ingenious thought that Richard Branson may have launched his challenge to the Labour leader so that Virgin would dominate the news cycle on a day when his rival British Airways was pulling off a PR coup by flying Team GB back to London from Rio. No one can pretend that traingate is one of most important news stories of the era. All the same it is a very emblematic tale of our times. For one thing, it would not have happened in the pre-internet age at all, because even if Mr Corbyn had actually been compelled to sit on a train carriage floor on the way to Newcastle a generation ago, no one would have been there to capture an image of it, no newspaper would have been able to post the video of his denunciation of privatisation, and there would have been no CCTV footage of him walking past unreserved and unoccupied seats either. Whether the whole thing was an amateurish political stunt by the Labour leader, as Mr Branson implies, or rotten treatment by a privatised company, as Mr Corbyn claimed, no one else would have ever heard about it anyway. For all traingate's obvious pettiness in some respects, it also encapsulates a very contemporary war of political narratives. In what some call the post-factual or post-truth political era, what you would like to believe always trumps the facts, not least with Donald Trump. There are plenty of \"who, when and why\" facts that need to be tested about the story of the 11:00 train from London King's Cross on 11 August. But, in the end, those facts can seem to matter less than the different versions of events that many will prefer to believe in the first place. To those who champion Mr Corbyn, traingate plays into a narrative of a rich capitalist tax exile and the mainstream media trying to trash a socialist who threatens their power, wealth and interests. Media preoccupation with traingate at Mr Corbyn's NHS speech today is easily absorbed into that view. Meanwhile, to those who despair of him, traingate exemplifies something completely different: Mr Corbyn's almost comical hopelessness as a leader who is taking Labour into the wilderness. It didn't take traingate to make his critics believe in that reading. Journalism has a responsibility to stick to its principles and maintain its objectivity amid these warring narratives. The facts don't merely matter. Trustworthy journalism rests on them. Facts have to be checked, sources held to account, flaws and inaccuracies eliminated, and good judgment applied as much as possible. That was also true before the digital era. But it is particularly important today when, on stories that range from the siege of Aleppo through to the Labour leadership contest to the release of the latest movie or computer, news organisations are hourly and daily offered images and stories by protagonists with partisan narratives or unacknowledged interests to advance. Being transparent about sources is crucial, as the Guardian's use of video in both the Aleppo siege and traingate has been. The probability is that the traingate episode will have confirmed Corbynites and anti-Corbynites in their views. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge all the facts, not just the ones that suit one side or the other. Mr Corbyn has tapped a huge well of political energy and dissatisfaction. But he also has some of the most dismal ratings among Labour voters and the general public of any Labour leader ever, and these ratings are in decline. Traingate has many lessons, but it is unlikely to have changed that one.",
