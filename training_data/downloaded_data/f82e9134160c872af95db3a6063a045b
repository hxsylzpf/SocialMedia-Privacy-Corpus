  "content": "After a year of \"non-stories\" about philandering sportsmen and celebrities, Rio Ferdinand suffered a shock defeat in his privacy claim against MGN on Thursday, the publisher of the Sunday Mirror. In April 2010, the Sunday Mirror carried an article based on a \"kiss and tell\" by Carly Storey, a long-standing friend of the footballer. Judge Andrew Nicol determined that the public interest in correcting Ferdinand's self-generated but false \"family man\" image outweighed the clear intrusion on his private life. Far from breaking new legal ground, however, this was an exemplary application of the existing law from a judge on top of his game. On one level, this case was most unusual. Astonishingly few claims for misuse of private information ever reach a full trial. Most go only to an interim hearing, at which the claimant wins an injunction or the newspaper the freedom to publish. Like Max Mosley, however, Ferdinand was denied the opportunity to seek an injunction to prevent publication when the newspaper went ahead without informing him by asking for comment. Instead, the footballer was left to seek substantial damages and a final, permanent injunction. Beyond this, the case does not break any new ground. It might be argued that it resurrects the view that there is always a public interest in the conduct of \"role models\", as Lord Woolf once suggested in the Garry Flitcroft case. (You'd be forgiven for asking yourself, \"who?\") But that line of reasoning has been rejected on numerous occasions since, and Nicol stuck close to precedent. This was no general invitation to newspapers to publish gossip on every Tom, Dick or Sally. Rather, the judgment exemplifies the reality that the outcome in each case rests on an intense scrutiny of the specific facts. Like Naomi Campbell, Ferdinand had generated a false image by repeatedly presenting himself as a reformed character who had forsworn his formerly \"wild ways\". According to the judge, he had \"embarked on a campaign since 2006 to project a more responsible and positive image than the reputation which he had had in the past\". This campaign included a particularly confessional interview in the News of the World in which Ferdinand had publicly committed himself to the role of faithful family man. This was followed up by an autobiography and numerous further newspaper interviews in which he had reiterated this message. Most importantly, by accepting the England captaincy when the manager, the FA chief executive, the sports minister and numerous commentators had insisted that the incumbent must maintain high standards both on and off the field, Ferdinand was making a strong, if implicit, assertion that his private conduct by that time met the prescribed norms. Given how his predecessor lost the role, it would have been pure cynicism for the public to believe anything else. In that context, the newspaper was acting lawfully to correct the false representations. The judge didn't shy from the fact that this was a \"kiss and tell\": Storey was paid \u00a316,000 for her pains. It was indeed \"tabloid gold\" designed to appeal to prurience, and it did entail a significant intrusion on the claimant's private life. But stories serving the public interest aren't found in the \"unpopular\" press alone. The decision shouldn't chasten common or garden variety celebs. It should remind them to keep their indiscretions discreet, and their specific public pronouncements limited. What we have learned is that, rightly or wrongly, the England football captain sits next to the \"back to basics\" minister and just one along from the pope in the gallery of those who must sport lily-white private lives. But he's there by choice.",
