  "content": "It's a great honour to be giving this lecture in the memory of Anthony Sampson, particularly with Sally here this evening. Discussing libel is a good way of remembering Anthony. He was a great editor and writer who knew all about the legal risks involved in journalism, having worked in apartheid South Africa and written memorably about discrimination, repression, big business, the arms trade and oil. You would be hard-pressed to find grittier and more fraught subjects to tackle. He cared passionately about safeguarding the editorial tradition he represented \u2013 one that dealt in big ideas and taking on power. A couple of times a year he would invite me out to lunch and we had a conversation that veered somewhere between a good gossip and an interrogation. Anthony loved to keep track of who was up, who was down, who was doing what. But he was equally keen on finding out what was really going on \u2013 whether in government, international relations or politics. He would fix you with his soft yet steely eyes and probe you rather mercilessly. You could tell what a formidable journalist he was when he was on the trail of something considered important. Tonight we're discussing the long road to libel reform. The modern history of failed attempts to reform our defamation laws reach right back to 1938, when the government of the day managed to neuter a bill moved by AP Herbert with the support of EM Forster. The second world war interrupted the subsequent long-grass commission, and a much-weakened act eventually staggered past the finishing line in 1952. It took another 25 years before any government would engage again. We had the Faulks Committee in 1975 and the Neil Report in 1991. But it was more than 40 years, 1996, before we had any more statutory changes. Now, you invite an editor to speak on libel and you sort of know what you're going to get: a long whinge. We feel misunderstood, chilled and generally put upon. You know the story. Ben Bradlee's memoire of editing the Washington Post puts it succinctly: \"Other things being equal, I'd rather be publicly whipped than sued for libel, and lose.\" He writes about a case involving the two Washington Post reporters, Bob Woodward and Patrick Tyler. \"If I had known that the 84-inch story would cost the Post more than $1.5m to run the story, plus thirty lousy days as a defendant plus another seven and a half years of appellate litigation. I would have told them both to go piss up a rope.\" I know that feeling. But a long whinge tonight would be predictable and perhaps not the most interesting use of the time. Yes, I want and believe in reform, and I will touch on what changes I'd like to see. But I think it's more interesting to ask why reform has been so slow coming and how libel fits into a larger pattern of ethics and laws. To understand how difficult it is to isolate libel imagine if that was all I addressed tonight. The past seven days have seen a rising crescendo of outrage over superinjunctions; the challenge to the courts from Twitter; the PCC rapping the Telegraph for entrapment and this morning's European court judgment over Max Mosley. The truth is libel doesn't exist in a vacuum. And there are plenty who think that, as our libel laws are cleaned up, smart lawyers are switching horses to privacy. So you can't discuss one without the other. Journalists have powerful megaphones and we frequently use them to denounce this or that law restricting our right (as we see it) to tell a particular story. But who else should have a say on these issues? Unless we can be aware of those other voices \u2013 and deal with the complexity of the issues \u2013 we're unlikely to win the argument. In 1997 I devoted another forum at City University, the James Cameron lecture, to talking about the legal landscape as it seemed to me after 18 months of editing the Guardian. I called it \"The Freedom of the Press and other Platitudes\" because I felt a little aggrieved at the lip service we paid to the idea of a free press \u2013 and how little protection our laws actually gave to serious journalism in the public interest when push rudely came to shove. In those 18 months I had experienced a blizzard of high profile libel cases. Since then I think that \u2013 with one notable exception \u2014 I have had most of the law books in the country thrown at me. Here are some of them: 1. Neil Hamilton v Guardian This was a marathon case, which began under my predecessor, Peter Preston, when the Guardian accused Hamilton, the MP for Tatton, together with another MP, Tim Smith, of accepting cash from the Harrods boss, Mohamed Al Fayed, in return for asking questions in the House of Commons. Smith didn't contest the charges and eventually left politics. Hamilton claimed it was all lies and \u2013 together with a prominent political lobbyist, Ian Greer \u2014 launched a libel suit against the paper. In 1995 Hamilton succeeded in changing the British constitution in amending the 1688 Bill of Rights in order to allow an MP to waive parliamentary privilege in order to sue a newspaper. In September 1996 \u2013 on the eve of the high court hearing \u2013 the case, which could have cost the Guardian several million pounds \u2014 collapsed with nine minutes to spare. There followed another five years of inquiries, committees, libel actions (thankfully not directly against the Guardian) and appeals. At one stage I was certainly in contempt of parliament. Hamilton ended up out of politics and bankrupt. 2. The Police Federation v the Guardian This was a case in February 1997 brought by five metropolitan police officers against the Guardian and its well-respected crime correspondent, Duncan Campbell. The piece did not even name the officers concerned, who did not sue until 2 years and 51 weeks after publication. Up to this point the Police Federation had funded and won 95 libel actions in a row, netting a total of \u00a31.5m in damages. They were called 'garage actions\" because the damages were usually enough to build a nice extension for the cops who sued. With the aid of the wily old George Carman on our side we won \u2013 a miracle result entirely thanks to a jury, not the judge, who, by the end of the trial had ensured there was nothing left of our defence except arguments on meaning. It was the end of police garage actions. 3. Jonathan Aitken v the Guardian and Granada TV This was the famous \"sword of truth\" moment when a cabinet minister promised to \"cut out the cancer of bent and twisted journalism.\" Again, with Geraldine Proudler and George Carman on our case, we won a dramatic high court battle after producing, mid-trial; the airline tickets, which proved that Aitken had given perjured evidence. It was triumph of old-fashioned reporting by a team, which included David Leigh, then at Granada, now Anthony Sampson Professor of Reporting here at City. And, talking of the importance of reporters, we should never forgetting the heroic Owen Bowcott, the Guardian man who sat in the hotel basement going through hundreds of shoeboxes containing credit card payments until he came up with the crucial document. Aitken was subsequently declared bankrupt and went to prison. 4. Interbrew v the Guardian and others This was not a libel case, but another marathon action \u2013 it took nearly seven years from the start to its finish in Strasbourg \u2013 in which the Belgian brewer sued a number of news organisations for the return of a leaked document about a potential bid for another brewery. The news organisations refused to hand the documents over, fearing that they could reveal the anonymous source. At one stage, in 2002, we were threatened that all the assets of the Guardian would be seized in a bid to force us to cave in. I learned of nasty things called Norwich Pharmacals, customs and excise orders, which could be used to prise out the identity of whistleblowers. In 2009 the European court of human rights \u2014 often condemned by media organisations as suppressors of editorial freedoms \u2014 found for the news organisations, declaring that the overriding importance of protecting sources. By now there was a pattern developing. We were winning most of the cases (there was the occasional reverse along the way). If you stood firm; employed the very best (and most expensive) lawyers; had terrific journalists; were prepared to risk millions and spend years of your life involved in litigation; then you could sometimes win cases in the face of the apparent indifference of many judges. Sometimes you slipped up and lost. 5. Tesco v the Guardian and me, personally In 2008 we were sued by the grocery giant Tesco over an article which claimed they were tax dodgers. It turned out \u2014 (thank you Private Eye) \u2014 during the course of another long, drawn out and massively expensive bout of litigation, that they were, indeed, tax dodgers \u2013 but that our reporters (one of whom was a trained accountant) \u2013 had got the wrong tax and that we had considerably over-stated the sum. We had, in other words, made an honest mistake. A mistake about an immensely complicated matter of international corporate structuring \u2013 an issue of very high public interest. We corrected it and apologised. But that did not stop months of mind-boggling expense and time as Tesco launched four different actions \u2013 two against me personally, two against the newspaper. I now had to learn about the law of malicious falsehood \u2013 the company claimed I personally had deliberately constructed a lie \u2013 as well as a libel. Within nine weeks the lawyers had racked up costs of more than half a million pounds. Accountants and tax lawyers were hired to explain to Tesco their own accounts and tax stratagems at a cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds \u2013 having previously accused our reporters of having made absurd mistakes over elementary matters. The total cost of fighting the case to the bitter end could have been in the region of \u00a35m. Thankfully the courts intervened and stopped the increasingly baroque litigation. Then there was\u2026 6. Wikileaks v the world We weren't sued over Wikileaks. But, over a period of months, I was given some blood curdling learned opinions on what might happen to the Guardian \u2013 and me personally \u2013 if we persisted in our intended course of publishing. The reason we decided to partner with the New York Times was a simple one. We suspected that, if we went it alone under the framework of laws governing newspapers in this country, we simply wouldn't be allowed to get away with it. We would be sued or injuncted or prosecuted, or all three. It seemed a good idea to harness the whole exercise to a country with extremely robust media laws rather than risk it all on the quick sands of the British legal system. There have been other cases, including Keith Schellenberg, a multi-millionaire who bought a Scottish island, but didn't get on with the islanders; with Matthias Rath, who peddled vitamins as a treatment for HIV; and with Elton John, who had a sense of humour failure at a harmless piece of parody \u2013 a case involving fair comment. I've had the dilemma, familiar to many editors, over what to do about leaked documents \u2013 hold onto them in case they were needed to defend any libel action, or shred them to prevent them endangering a source if ordered up as part of a confidence action? I've had a judge in pyjamas awarding a midnight injunction to take down something about Barclays Bank and tax avoidance which was already on the website; and another judge at home \u2013 not quite in her pyjamas \u2014 finding herself just too late to prevent our vans from driving away from the printing presses. I've even had lawyers telling me that I could not report on parliament itself. This last case was brought by the oil trading company, Trafigura, which managed to get a superinjunction in September 2009 \u2013 partly on the extraordinary grounds that even listing the case in court could unfairly damage the interests of the company. I said there was one exception. The Guardian has never yet been sued under any kind of privacy law. There have been general injunctions, which bind us, like anyone else. There have been actions over confidence. And I stand ready to be outraged at the first time someone sues us over an invasion of privacy. But, as I say, it hasn't yet happened. Those, then, are just a few highlights of my life with lawyers, which will help explain my heartfelt desire to change the laws affecting the media. The overwhelming majority of these cases involved decent journalists trying to write about serious things about which the public ought (in my opinion) to know. We simply can't continue to make the risks of doing this sort of journalism so punitively expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable. So, as I say, it's always been obvious to me that our libel laws needed reform. But it's quite salutary to read the online comments below any article making the case for reform. On balance, they are rarely supportive of the need to give journalists better protection. It's worth asking why. And maybe also worth reminding ourselves, as journalists, that one of the reasons why there has recently been more popular backing for change is that non-journalists \u2014 I am thinking particularly of scientists and even doctors \u2014 have been caught up as defendants in libel actions. By their stubborn refusal to give into the frankly bullying use of libel laws, Simon Singh and Dr Peter Wilmshurst have achieved considerable progress. These cases \u2013 together with brilliant campaigning work by English PEN and Index on Censorship and the Lib Dem peer Anthony Lester \u2013 have succeeded in winning political support for the idea of reform. It's worth asking whether newspapers and broadcasters, left to their own devices and lobbying, would have made this progress alone? I suspect we know the answer. Megaphones are one thing. But, as journalists we have to convince other people, including the people we now especially want to influence \u2013 parliamentarians \u2014 that the public interest will be served by change. If we're going to win this argument we have to begin by acknowledging that our own interest \u2013 the journalistic instinct towards greater freedom of expression \u2013 clashes with other interests, laws, ethical frameworks and narratives. If we want to ask parliament for more permissive laws, people are bound to ask the question: to do what? During the process of thinking about how matters might be improved around the time of the Cameron lecture I met the former NY Times legal correspondent, a lovely man called Anthony Lewis, who told me to read his 1992 book Make No Law. And it was there that I learned, rather late in the day, about New York Times v Sullivan \u2013 the ringing supreme court judgment by Justice Brennan which \u2013 forgive my crude summary \u2013 essentially gives American journalists the right to be wrong. It acknowledges that journalism about matters of high public importance ought to be protected, not chilled; that journalists can and do make honest mistakes; and that the first amendment \u2013 \"Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press\" \u2014 is a rock on which to defend free expression. So, unless a claimant can prove \"actual malice\", a public figure is unable to recover damages for libel in America. For some, the weakness of the way the Sullivan law has subsequently developed since the supreme court case of 1963 is this so-called \"public figure\" test. There has been heated debate over whether, for instance, a school basketball coach is a public official, and therefore unable to sue. One definition to emerge is someone who has the authority to make policy affecting life, liberty or property. Think about that. In a world of celebrities and errant footballers, it's quite a high hurdle of \"publicness.\" People who have some form of power over us. These are some of the issues that have emerged over the nearly 50 years of the Sullivan rule. In any event, reading Anthony Lewis' inspiring book about Sullivan set me thinking. How could Britain have something that looked and smelled a bit like Sullivan? And it struck me, in the conversations I had at the time with politicians and judges \u2013 that, if the press were to be given something like Sullivan in the UK, there might have to be a quid pro quo. That is, if we argued that we wanted greater protection from the courts in writing about public figures, we needed to give some sort of reassurance that we recognised some border lines \u2013 maybe some agreed definition of the public interest, as opposed to the American \"public figure\" test. How else could we convince any government to grant journalists more freedom? Never mind the rights and wrongs of privacy: there was the simple turkey/Christmas factor. This was 1997, before the enactment of the Human Rights Act (HRA). I was hardly the first person in the world to make the link between privacy and libel. But I touched on the issue in the Cameron lecture. That seemed to me a reasonable proposal for discussion. But in my mind was also the European Convention on Human Rights and the fact that the Labour government was going to incorporate it into British law, thus requiring judges to think about what article 8 \u2013 with its respect for private and family life, home and correspondence \u2014 would actually mean. It seemed to me quite likely that it might have significant consequences, and that editors might not like very much judges introducing a \"backdoor\" privacy law. So I asked whether something be said for going through the front door \u2013 i.e. go to the politicians and propose a bargain \u2013 no steps towards privacy unless they were accompanied by a complete reform of laws to do with libel and freedom of information. So that, in my innocence, was one of the things I touched on in my little lecture. Little did I know that it was considered very poor form to voice such thoughts aloud. I thought I was just giving a lecture at City. How wrong could you be? I had unwittingly breached some fundamental \"no surrender\" protocol for editors speaking in public. I realised this when the PCC itself commissioned a 19th century historian called Richard Shannon to write a book, which revealed that \"alarm bells rang throughout the industry\" at the Cameron Lecture. Shannon recounts how leading editors and the PCC scrambled to kill the idea of any deal stone dead. One distinguished tabloid editor was quoted praising the PCC as a \"fantastic regulator of press behaviour.\" He added: \"I think the press as a whole is so much better in its behavioural pattern than it was ten years ago that any need for a privacy law is out of date.' The PCC agreed. \"Self regulation is working better than anyone ever thought it would, \" said its then director. \"Newspapers and editors are very different today from 10 years ago.\" So that was 1997. The consensus was that standards were higher; self-regulation was working brilliantly; bad behaviour by the press was a thing of the past; and it wasn't worth having a debate about improved libel laws if that meant discussing the future of privacy with politicians. Instead, the industry moved to insert a clause \u2013 section 12 \u2014 in the HRA compelling judges to pay special respect to the relevant regulatory codes \u2013 the PCC's code of practice, for instance. The industry \u2013 according to Shannon's book \u2013 breathed again. Quite a lot has changed since then. Re-reading the Cameron lecture I don't think you could say the ideas raised then were so totally mad. Article 8 of the HRA has developed in a way which has led some influential figures in the press now to argue that it would, indeed, be better to have parliament set the rules on privacy than let unelected judges make it up as they go along. Indeed, last month no less a figure than the prime minister weighed in on the issue, declaring himself \"a little uneasy\" at the judges and hinting that parliament may have to declare its position. So it looks as if some sort of consensus may now be developing that it mightn't be a bad idea, after all, to trust parliament to discuss this. And then there's self-regulation. 14 years after everyone told us that the PCC had reformed standards in the press and that the age of bad behaviour was over we can see better what a hollow claim that was. We can see how ineffective the PCC itself was in stopping the worst practices \u2013 or of even knowing about them; or even having much curiosity about them\u2026 far less any effective mechanism to find out what had been going on under their noses. If you want to compare effective regulation with weak regulation, compare the utterly feeble 2009 PCC report into phone hacking with the way the former independent television regulator, the ITC, reacted when, back in 1998, the Guardian published allegations about a programme on drug-running made by Carlton TV. The ITC imposed a \u00a32m fine after a thorough investigation, led by Michael Beloff QC and the former controller of editorial policy at the BBC. One person will be extremely familiar with that example: the head of corporate affairs at Carlton at the time \u2014 one David Cameron. As for libel, there have been some steps forward and some back. We've had the development of conditional fee agreements, which have widened access to the courts for some people, but which, many people think, were abused by lawyers to produce one of the most mind-bogglingly expensive media legal systems in the world. It's not unknown for newspapers to end up paying claimant lawyers between \u00a3400 and \u00a3800 an hour, not including insurance costs, in libel cases, Lord Justice Jackson called it \"the most bizarre and expensive system that it is possible to devise.\" The government has, thankfully, pledged to implement the Jackson reforms. Simon Singh \u2013 who had to risk \u00a3300k to defend his honest opinion about chiropractors \u2013 is a timely reminder of why they must keep this promise. We've had a watered down Freedom of Information Bill. But we've to come terms with superinjunctions and hyperinjunctions and cases so secret that claimant lawyers argue that parliament itself cannot discuss them. Who, 14 years ago, could have imagined the prospect of anonymised libel cases \u2013 where we are not allowed to report on who the parties are, let alone the substance of the case? We have our own, much watered down version of the Sullivan doctrine in Reynolds \u2013 the concept of so called \"responsible\" journalism, whereby a news organisation could theoretically get some protection if it could show it had gone through a number of pre-publication processes \u2013 a non-exhaustive list of 10 tests (or, in the wrong hands, hurdles) laid down by Lord Nicholls. That proved of limited practical use until refined by the important House of Lords judgment in the Jameel case in 2006. News organisations can now argue the public interest of the material, as well as demonstrating whether or not they acted \"responsibly\" in advance of publication. The net effect of all these advances and reverses is that London is still the libel capital of the world \u2013 the place where the rich and dodgy flock to keep their reputations intact. It is still comparatively easy to stifle the press, if only because fewer and fewer media organisations have deep enough pockets to put up a fight. The Americans, to our shame, now have a law protecting them from the libel decisions of our courts. So, it's not clear that, overall, there has been much overall progress since 1997. But, rather amazingly we do now have a bill, which proposes to change the libel laws in some promising ways. \u2022 It offers to protect responsible publication on matters of public interest. There are promising things here, though editors are nervous that the attempt to codify the Reynolds defence could mean that it will lose the elasticity envisaged by the House of Lords. \u2022 The single publication rule in clause 6 is welcome \u2013 finally moving British law on from regarding the internet in the same way it treated the notorious 1849 case involving Duke of Brunswick and his man servant. \u2022 The section on honest opinion represents some progress \u2013 it would, for instance, have helped Simon Singh in his honestly held opinion about chriopractors. \u2022 Clause 7, on jurisdiction, is a welcome attempt to defeat forum shopping. \u2022 The 'substantial harm test' in clause 1 is good news if it means that a lot of small libels can be knocked out early on in the process. Now \u2013 and of course I would say this, wouldn't I? \u2013 I don't think it goes far enough. Giant corporations such as Tesco can still sue*. We await the story on costs. I'm doubtful \u2013 based on our own experience \u2013 about the wisdom of abolishing jury trials. The honest opinion section still needs some polishing. I would like to see more movement on the burden of proof, or as Geoff Robertson calls it, \"the presumption of falsity\". With the exception of section 1, anything that speaks to 21st century web publication and user interactivity online is also missing. So, there's much still to argue for. But we do have a bill \u2013 and, should it go through in present form, life would certainly be better for tomorrow's journalists than it was for yesterdays. But there's some irony here that, just as parliament finally gets to debate some sensible new proposals on libel, there is now, as mentioned, growing pressure from the media itself to force it to debate privacy legislation. The latter issue has become caught up \u2013 in some commentators' minds, anyway \u2014 with the future of the Human Rights Act itself. And, as if that weren't enough of a tangled mix, we are in the middle of parallel civil, criminal, regulatory and parliamentary inquiries into the scandal of phone-hacking which now looks to have been happening on an industrial scale on at least one newspaper over a number of years. And, finally, there is ever increasing general unease over privacy on the internet. Can all these discussions all take place in isolation from each other? Can you really discuss libel and privacy without also asking whether self-regulation actually works? Can you pull at the tangled issues of libel without considering how you define the public interest in privacy cases? How, MPs reasonably ask, can we as an industry argue that self-regulation works when it evidently failed quite spectacularly over phone hacking? Phone-hacking \u2013 and the inadequate response so far of the regulator \u2013 matter because they betray a certain journalistic mindset to privacy and because they undermine the story we tell parliament and the public about why we should be trusted with self-regulation and with more permissive laws. We now know, for instance, that one newspaper employed at least four private investigators \u2014 one of them fresh from seven years in jail for blackmail and perverting the course of justice \u2013 to systemically hack, track, blag and otherwise pry into the private lives of numerous people in public life \u2014 from royalty, through politics to celebrities and blameless people who just happened to be caught up in the news, such as the relatives of the two Soham girls murdered by Ian Huntley. Inch by inch we are learning who knew about all this at the time and who was involved in the cover-up. The people at the eye of the storm discreetly suggest to anyone who will listen that it's unfair to pick on them since so many others were at it. Whether this is true or not, we are learning about an attitude to privacy that was evidently quite widespread among journalists: that, when push comes to shove, there's no such thing. If you're rich, famous, powerful \u2013 or even just newsworthy \u2013 then you forego the expectation that any aspect of your life should be shielded from the public gaze. One has to suspect that that was the prevailing belief in the News of the World newsroom for some years. Now, of course if newspapers were publicly to advance such a proposition to MPs it would not be very attractive one. Fat hope of asking parliament to improve on the judges on that basis. But \u2013 thankfully \u2013 that is not the official position of newspapers and the overwhelming majority of journalists, who are doubtless rather repulsed by what they are learning about how some of their colleagues were behaving during the past 10 or so years. Our official, collective position as an industry is quite different. We're all signed up to a code of practice, the PCC Code of practice, whose wording on privacy is virtually exactly the same as the hated Human Rights Act. Clause three says explicitly that \"everyone\" \u2013 yes, everyone \u2013 \"is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home health and correspondence, including digital communications.\" Any editor wishing to intrude on anyone's privacy must justify it and can plead (here are the magic three words again) \"the public interest\" \u2013 which, as defined by the PCC, is quite a high-minded one. It includes serious crime or impropriety, protecting public health and safety and preventing the public being misled. So newspapers' official position is to agree there is a balance to be struck between privacy and free expression and imagines that someone, other than editors themselves, will have sometimes have to make a judgment between conflicting interests. In the end that is either going to be judges or some form of self-regulation, or both. If it's to be the judges, then at least remember it was the media that insisted they pay respect to our own codes on privacy. If we want the majority of cases to be dealt with by self-regulation then it's obvious that our regulatory mechanisms have to be plausible. A weak regulator does the press no favours at all because it can never be convincing either to parliament, or to people who are considering their options for remedies. Now, suppose parliament did end up discussing privacy, as it is currently being urged to do. What could it suggest that would greatly change the present state of affairs \u2013 except in regard to secrecy, which is not, if course, the same issue as privacy? Some people who don't like the HRA want it replaced by a British Bill of Rights, though where that leaves this country's obligations under the European Convention \u2013 with its own jurisprudence on privacy \u2013 is an endless matter for speculation. The media QC Hugh Tomlinson recently broke down the future options for a privacy into four: \u2022 Renounce the European Convention and abolish the tort of privacy. He can't see how that could be done without withdrawing from the Council of Euopre and therefore leaving the EU itself \u2022 Introducing a statutory tort of privacy \u2022 Have a new 'privacy regime' under a statutory regulator \u2022 Steady as she goes \u2013 leaving judges to develop the law. Tomlinson comes down on the side of a statutory regulator, with the powers to award compensation, order the publication of apologies or corrections and grant injunctions. It's telling that he doesn't even mention self-regulation. If it comes to a debate over these, or other, options, it seems unlikely that MPs would arrive at a more permissive position than the industry's own codes of conduct . How big is the problem at the moment? Or, to be it another way, what is the problem? We can all unite in loathing superinjunctions \u2014 cases about which we can report nothing, not even the existence of the case \u2013 though it's not clear there have been any such things issued this year. The 2009 Trafigura superinjunction, for example, was designed to conceal the existence of a report about toxic waste. That was obviously mad. But let's not muddle them with anonymised judgments or privacy injunctions, where we can report the cases, but not who's involved. One media specialist lawyer says there were 11 \"ordinary\" injunctions between January and March, two of which were brought against newspapers and at least four of which involved attempted blackmail. In the first three weeks of April there were six more privacy injunctions, two involving the media. On what we know about these cases, there is certainly cause of concern in some instances. The ZAM injunction in April extended gagging orders from privacy to libel, which appears to be a classic case of mission creep. With other cases, generally not superinjunctions, the issues may be less clear-cut \u2013 though of course a cloak of secrecy makes it difficult for outsiders to judge. Take one case, which attracted much attention in late April, OPQ v BJM and CJM. According to the judge this involved a woman and her partner negotiating with a newspaper group to receive a large sum of money for intimate photographs and what he term \"clearly private information.\" It was also described as \"a straightforward and blatant blackmail case.\" The man, the woman and her partner eventually reached an agreement, including undertakings not to publish any of the information. So far so ordinary. But the man feared that, once the case had been settled, there was nothing to stop the media from writing about it. The complicating factor was that the judge said that there was \"solid medical evidence\" as to the health of the claimant and various family members. He speculated that this evidence was one of the reasons why various newspaper groups withdrew their opposition to the order being extended to others beyond the parties themselves. The device he came up with \u2013 a ban \"contra mundum\", or against the whole world \u2014 attracted a mixture of criticism and derision, conjuring up a ban on people discussing the case by water coolers or in pubs. The impotence of high court judges to act Contra Twitterum was demonstrated at the weekend. But \u2013 on the known facts \u2013 it's difficult to say that the judge's decision on the privacy issue was completely irrational. If it was a case of blackmail; if the information was about the private activities of consenting adults; if there was clear evidence that someone might come to mental or physical harm through publication which of us could be certain that we would \u2013 even as editors, never mind judges \u2013 approve of publication, or publish the identities of the parties? Wouldn't there have to be a really strong public interest in order to justify the distress, or worse, that might result from publication? Or take the appeal court decision, also in April, between ETK and News Group Newspapers. It involved another really difficult balancing act. On the one hand a man, his erstwhile lover and wife all asking for privacy. On the other hand the suggestion that the affair might have played a part in the lover, a former colleague of the man, losing her job. But the woman, perhaps out of a wish to keep things private, was not pursuing any case against the company. And the wife, who was trying to rebuild her relationship with the man, asked the court for privacy for the sake of the marriage and the children. Do their collective wishes count for nothing? Suppose the three parties had gone to the PCC rather than the courts? Would the PCC, bearing in mind its own public interest test, have come to a different conclusion from the three appeal court judges? Both these cases demonstrate the complexity of the issues affecting free speech \u2013 and the fact that there is seldom a black and white answer engaging just one of the multiple laws and ethical concerns that cover much of what we do as journalists. Each case is different\u2013 which is why it requires arbiters, be they judges or mediators or regulators \u2013 to reach a view on the facts. We can all imagine situations in which one could argue that there was a genuine public interest in exposure which over-rode the privacy concerns outlined above. Maybe the claimants were politicians who took a strict stance on moral issues, or people who had misleadingly used their family image to seek office or commercial gain? It's a cause for unease when the women are named, but not the men. There's a whiff of rich man's justice about some of it. There's a concern that some of this is about simple reputation management, not law. The secrecy means that it's difficult to interrogate the public interest in disclosure. Who are these people seeking privacy? Are they people with power over our lives \u2013 one of the Sullivan tests for a public figure? Or are these simply basketball coaches? Or, actually, not even coaches. Just basketball players? Are they people who don't have any power over our lives; who have never aspired to be moral role models, but are simply well known? They may have entertained us with their acting or singing or their football skills. And\u2026 and therefore, what? Do we think they deserve no privacy? Or is it that we deplore the secrecy around their wish for privacy? If the latter, how could the media take a constructive role in suggesting how openness and privacy can be reconclied? One more balancing act. How would the media behave were the judges to agree that anyone who got an injunction from the British courts should be named, even if the circumstances or subject matter were concealed? Should we be asking that judges always give the media the opportunity of making representations? Should we be asking that judges should be given a strict template for the wording of gag orders so information can't be kept from, for example, MPs, regulators or law enforcement agencies? Plain pragmatic considerations also apply. The law is limping along behind the digital revolution. On Sunday in the space of six minutes, an anonymous tweeter tweeted alleged 140-character summaries of five so-called superinjunctions \u2013 most, if not all, of them actually anonymised privacy injunctions. Four of them appeared on the face of it, to involve consensual sex between adults working in the fields of entertainment or sport. In one case there was the appearance of a public interest argument beyond the fact of the alleged sex. One of them was instantly denied by one of the people named. Reading the illicit tweets, some people may have thought, was that it? Were these the secrets that launched a thousand headlines? And, indeed, it's worth asking: where was the front page outrage when a judge ordered the blatant tax-avoiding strategies of a major bank to be taken off the web? What about Trafigura's attempt to gag parliament? It made it to p 21 of the Times and p14 of the Telegraph. We sometimes send confusing signals about what we really care about. What is the public mood in all this? An excellent 2009 Reuters institute report on privacy found that most people believe that sex should be treated as a private matter, along with health, family life, correspondence and finance, except when public funds are concerned. By all means let's deplore superinjunctions. But you would never guess, from the general sound and fury, that parliament is even this week, for the first time in 15 years, debating how to improve our libel laws in order to \u2013 just possibly \u2014 protect journalism in the public interest. If all this clashing of interlocking laws and conflicting interests sounds complex it is, I suspect, going to get still more complicated as numerous other issues of privacy in society bubble up the agenda. Increasingly the question is going to be asked: who has the right to capture, obtain, store and use \u2014 never mind publish \u2014 what kinds of information about us? I suspect this is going to become a very hot issue indeed. Is it ok when we do it, but not ok when Google does it? Ok for Tesco, but not for the state? Ok for media companies but not for insurance companies? Ok for our intelligence agencies, but not for theirs? Ok for the NHS but not for the police? Ok with emails but not with DNA? We, rightly in my view, recoil from any kind of statutory oversight. But \u2013 and here is where the history of phone-hacking impacts us all \u2014 can we plausibly argue that we, alone and with our self-regulator, should decide on these issues? Increasingly our standards we will be judged against the behaviour of other companies and agencies, with the onus to show that we operate to the highest standards. How do we measure up to other people whose business sometimes involves intrusion? Sir David Omand, the former UK Security and Intelligence Coordinator and before that boss of GCHQ, recently drafted five criteria that anyone in his former trade contemplating invasions of privacy should ask themselves: \u2022 There must be sufficient cause \u2013 the intrusion needs to be justified by the scale of potential harm, which might be result from it. \u2022 There must be integrity of motive \u2014 the intrusion must be justified in terms of the public good which would follow from publication \u2022 The methods used must be in proportion to the seriousness of story and its public interest, using the minimum possible intrusion. \u2022 There must be proper authority \u2013 any intrusion must be authorised at a sufficiently senior level and with appropriate oversight. \u2022 There must be a reasonable prospect of success: fishing expeditions are not justified Aren't they rather good questions for any senior editor to ask him/herself? Only today the PCC has found the Telegraph guilty of a fishing expedition over the targeting of Lib Dem MPs in their surgeries. It looks as though editors in future will have to demonstrate that they did, indeed, weigh the potential harm versus the public good; that they had thought about proportionality; about proper lines of authorisation and scrutiny; and about whether anything resembling a fishing expedition could possibly be justified. The problem with our current piecemeal approach to law-making is that each law springs from a different place. Libel out of sedition; privacy from scrabbling to keep up with constant technological change; data protection out of public and commercial law; RIPA from the fight against terror. As Christopher Graham, the information commissioner, recently told MPs, there's a questionable, uneven and unclear logic behind the whole basket of laws now concerning data. Some journalistic acts have public interest defences and are punishable by fines: others don't and involve jail. Graham described the present day intrusions into privacy \u2013 and not just by the media \u2014 as \"a modern scourge\". He told MPs that the \"mosaic\" of regulation and laws needed revising, pointing out that at least four different statutory regulators2 now had their fingers in different pies. So there's more untidy law waiting to be reformed or reconciled. What I've tried to suggest tonight is that it is increasingly difficult to look at one of the laws affecting free speech in isolation from each other \u2013 and from the sort of standards and expectations that are going to be widely debated in society in relation to government, the state, the internet and business. Where is the rounded debate about all this happening? In parliament, universities and think tanks; among lawyers and all over the web. Journalists themselves \u2013 caught between lobbying, a general defensive crouch, fighting cases and reporting \u2013 find it difficult to join in. One thing I'm sure of: it's not enough to assert our arguments as if they were self-evidently right and to use our privileged platforms to drive home one-sided advocacy. That's not how these issues will be resolved. We have to engage with the wider arguments. What unites these issues? We're back to the three slippery words again \u2013 \"the public interest.\" If we can truly show that what we do, and believe in \u2014 is genuinely in the public interest, we'll be on strong ground, as always throughout the history of our battles for free speech. The Guardian celebrated its 190th birthday last week. Its very first editorial discussed the problem with the libel laws, warning about the role of the editor: \"In the present state of the libel law, his duty to his country and himself will often be at variance.\" I don't quite see Europe, as others do, as a menace to free speech. But I do love our island story of the four hundred year, or more, fight for free expression. A hobby of mine is to collect reminders of that British struggle \u2013 a universal struggle, of course, but one that began here. Here are two recent purchases: two literally seditious texts. Now, in their leather bindings, they look like harmless relics, but at the time they were so incendiary the provoked the most draconian action to suppress them \u2013 and sometimes the most violent reaction in support of them. People lost their liberty, rioted and died over these texts. Laws were changed \u2013 notably the right to report parliament, threatened so recently by the Trafigura superinjunction. The first is edition number 45 of the North Briton. It was produced by the scabrous MP and journalist, John Wilkes, in 1763 \u2013 a reaction to a weekly newspaper called the Briton, funded by public money to promote the government's cause. Wilkes' newspaper exposed bribes and corruption, attacked the monarchy and was generally thoroughly scurrilous. Edition number 45 made Wilkes the most notorious man in England. The government finally rounded up everyone to do with the paper \u2013 printers, journalists, and publishers. Wilkes was sued for libel, he was sent to Tower, his house ransacked. There were riots and a massacre when he was eventually imprisoned. Wilkes reprinted all 45 issues in book form. Wilkes won the right to report parliament. The second exhibit is the political register of William Cobbett. This magazine was started in 1802 by the satirist, pamphleteer and journalist, William Cobbett. In 1809 Cobbett attacked the punishment (the flogging by German mercenaries) of local soldiers. He was prosecuted for seditious libel, financially ruined and spent the following two years in Newgate prison. I keep these books in my office as a reminder of the power of journalism \u2013 how, when properly deployed, it can be the most amazing challenger of power and agent of change. Think, 200 years on from Cobbett, to the disruptive power of WikiLeaks. But it's also a story about the law \u2013 and how power will always try to use the law to suppress the challenge that journalism represents. Two centuries ago it was the power of the monarch. Today it is more likely to be multi-national corporations. It is essentially the same story. Anthony Sampson, editing the Drum in South Africa in the early 1950s, understood all about this clash of power. I know which side he would have been on in the battles ahead.",
