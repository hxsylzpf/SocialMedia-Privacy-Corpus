A three day Christmas barrage from hackers nearly corrupted the site which is supposed to guide more than 20m pilgrims to Rome. In addition to attempting to insert blasphemy and porn, the attackers wanted to plant bugs that would block pages and crash the site. Rory Carroll, Rome. \u0095 A cult has emerged in Papua New Guinea in which hundreds of followers have been told that on Saturday the world will be plunged into darkness and all white men banished from the tropical island. Reports from the village of Kikisram, which lies along the Fly River on the Irian Jaya border, said the Rainbow Church had promised adherents rewards in this world if they paid a fee in money, shells or pigs to join the believers. Police said hundreds of people had left their homes just before Christmas, pulled their children from schools and headed for the village. Chief Inspector Saibu Aku, commander of the North Fly police, said the leader was helping police with their inquiries. \"We are still investigating where he put the money. At this point we have not come up with an answer.\" Christopher Zinn, Sydney. \u0095 In Hamburg, a 1,500 bed nuclear shelter beneath the main railway station is to be open on New Year's Eve. Additional accomodation for up to 450 is available at the airport where the council has installed a field kitchen and provided clothing and blankets. A spokesman said preparations were for the \"unlikely event\" of a power failure. John Hooper, Berlin. \u0095 A leading German doctor warned physicians yesterday against performing caesarean sections on women who are determined to give birth on New Year's Eve. \"It is morally and legally dubious,\" said Joerg-Dietrich Hoppe, president of the German chamber of physicians. He said that caesarean sections were only acceptable for medical reasons and that the operations carried added risks and costs. \u0095 All lifts in Hong Kong's public buildings will stop running from 11.45pm to 12.15am over millennium midnight for fear of the millennium bug striking. Experts said that this response is being overcautious. They added that it was more likely that someone would suffer a heart attack climbing 17 floors than a lift being affected by Y2K glitches. More cheerfully, Hong Kong's clubbing district, Lan Kwai Fong, is decorating each of its restaurants with Y2K themes. Various venues will be adorned with butterflies, glow worms, bees, wasps and bugs. John Gittings, Hong Kong.",
