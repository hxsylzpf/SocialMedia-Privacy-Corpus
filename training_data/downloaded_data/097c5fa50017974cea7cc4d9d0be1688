  "content": "The comedian Frankie Boyle has set up an alternative running commentary to Lady Thatcher's funeral, firing off edgy outrageous messages to his 1.3 million followers on Twitter. Boyle, who was last month reported to be under consideration for a BBC TV comeback, made several references to being sexually excited by the funeral proceedings and as Thatcher's coffin was brought through London, he tweeted: \"She hasn't brought central London to a standstill like this since the Poll Tax riots.\" As guests, including the Queen, the Thatcher family, David Cameron and Ed Miliband arrived at St Paul's Cathedral, the comedian said: \"This guest list is a damning indictment of the inefficiency of the IRA.\" As the bells of St Paul's tolled slowly, he tweeted: \"That bell ringing symbolises each of the strokes that finished her.\" Despite being offensive, his commentary appeared to attract support online. Boyle last appeared regularly on the BBC in 2009 on the panel show Mock the Week. He left following a series of controversial jokes, including one in 2008 about swimmer Rebecca Adlington that the BBC Trust ruled should not have been broadcast. Last month, Shane Allen, the BBC's new controller of comedy commissioning who worked with Boyle at Channel 4 where he made his last series in 2010, said he would like to see the comic have his own series at the corporation.",
