  "content": "Supermodel Naomi Campbell felt \"shocked, angry, betrayed and violated\" after a photo of her leaving a drugs conselling session appeared in the Mirror, the high court heard today. Her counsel, Andrew Caldecott QC, said she had recounted how a friend had rung her to say he was concerned that the publication would send her \"over the edge\". Despite support offered by friends, Campbell felt depressed and, for the first time in a long while, doubted herself and her resolve to go on, the court heard. She was worried about who the source of the information about her was and anxious about being seen to let down others attending the meetings, and felt \"miserable and very insecure\". Mr Caldecott said Campbell, who was discovered by a model agency when she was 15, was under pressure from her work and in a fragile state at the time the photo appeared. She had developed a drug problem some years ago, but recognised the danger and was determined to do something about it. She attended NA meetings daily and had also attended meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, although he emphasised she had never been addicted to alcohol but found the nature of the meetings beneficial. Mr Caldecott said: \"Someone in a position of trust had clearly betrayed her... It's also her case that this must have been clear as day to the newspaper.\" He added: \"It must be obvious that anyone taking the trouble to go to NA is extremely troubled about the condition they have - they are likely to be in an extremely fragile condition.\" \"Obviously, those attending meetings of this kind, if they think they are likely to be exposed in the papers, are likely to keep their distance.\" Mr Caldecott also told the court the story had put Campbell off going to further NA meetings.",
