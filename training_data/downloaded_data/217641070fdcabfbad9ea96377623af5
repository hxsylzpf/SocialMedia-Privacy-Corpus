The woman went against strict rules forbidding jurors from discussing cases with family and friends by posting details of the sexual assault and child abduction trial on the social networking site. After her actions were discovered, she was removed from the case at Burnley crown court, in Lancashire, and the trial continued with a jury of 11 people. A Courts Service spokesman said today: \"A juror was dismissed from a case on November 18 for discussing a case outside the court.\"",
