  "content": "Edgar Wright has briefly broken his silence after departing the comic book film Ant-Man, posting a Photoshopped shot of Buster Keaton in an apparent rebuke to Marvel Studios. The director subsequently deleted the tweet. Wright, who helmed the Three Cornettos trilogy \u2013 Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End \u2013 quit the Disney-owned studio's latest superhero adventure film last week over \"creative differences\". He is thought to be unhappy that Marvel commissioned rewrites of his screenplay for the long-gestating Ant-Man movie with fellow Briton Joe Cornish. Over the weekend, he posted a picture of Keaton looking downcast and holding a Cornetto ice cream. The shot is a nod to Wright's triptych of comedies and was accompanied by the single word \"selfie\". The quickly deleted picture suggests a sharp commentary on the film-maker's experience with Marvel on a movie he had been developing since 2006. Keaton famously said that leaving his own independent studio to work for MGM in 1928 was the \"worst mistake of my career\" because he lost creative control. Wright's deleted selfie \"follows\" an apparently supportive tweet from Joss Whedon, director of Marvel's The Avengers and a key figure in the next swathe of comic book films from the studio. Meanwhile James Gunn, director of Marvel's much-hyped Guardians of the Galaxy, wrote on Facebook that Wright's departure was like watching two close friends break up. He said: \"Sometimes you have friends in a relationship. You love each of them dearly as individuals and think they're amazing people. When they talk to you about their troubles, you do everything you can to support them, to keep them together, because if you love them both so much doesn't it make sense they should love each other? But little by little you realise, at heart, they aren't meant to be together.\" According to Marvel, the film Ant-Man, based on a comic book series about a size-shifting superhero, remains on course for a July 2015 release date. It stars Paul Rudd in the title role and features Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Pe\u00f1a and Patrick Wilson.",
