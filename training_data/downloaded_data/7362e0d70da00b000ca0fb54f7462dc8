  "content": "Lord Hunt, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, has held discussions with a series of senior Labour politicians, including David Blunkett, who holds a \u00a349,500 six-month contract to advise News International, as he attempts to establish consensus around a new regulator. Hunt said that Blunkett, a former home secretary, was one of a number of major figures who had been supportive of his plans. The head of the PCC is seeking to find a consensus for a press regulator that is in line with proposals contained within Lord Justice Leveson's report, but that avoids any press laws. The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, has shown disdain for any proposed regulator that does not have statutory underpinning, as proposed by Leveson. However Hunt said he was pleased by the discussions he had held with other figures within Miliband's party, including former home secretary Charles Clarke and former work and pensions secretary John Hutton. He said: \"I think everyone wants to find a solution. Lots of people have been ringing with ideas.\" Hunt said he not taken any advice from Blunkett but that the former cabinet minister was planning a major speech in a debate in the Commons on Monday in which he is expected to be supportive of Hunt's plans. Blunkett is paid \u00a349,500 every six months, on a rolling contract, to fill an \"advisory post for corporate social responsibility (volunteering and education)\" for News International, according to the Commons register of interest. Hunt said he was \"unaware\" of Blunkett's connections to Rupert Murdoch's empire, but that it was irrelevant because he was open to thoughts from a wide range of people. Hunt is meeting the newspaper industry this week to \"put to them material for taking this forward\" and to allow him to establish a body that will oversee appointments to a new watchdog. The former Tory employment secretary said: \"There is an opportunity but it is not going to be there for long. \"Part of the purpose of the meeting will be to ask for authority to approach people for the new regulator.\" Editors of national newspapers have also been in discussions about how to broaden the appeal of any new regulatory body. The culture secretary, Maria Miller, has asked to meet editors on Tuesday to find out how they intend to reassure the public and those victims of press abuses who are still calling for a statutory basis to control the print media. David Cameron will attend the meeting. The establishment of a body of independent figures who can help set up a new regulator will be a major task for Hunt. Among those suggested for advisory roles were Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards between February 1999 and 2002, Christopher Graham, the current information commissioner and former director general of the Advertising Standards Authority. Meanwhile, Dominic Mohan, editor of the Sun has pledged to write a personal letter of apology to Christopher Jefferies, the landlord his newspaper defamed during the investigation into the murder of Joanna Yeates. Last week, in an interview with the Observer, Jefferies said he had not received letters of contrition from any of the journalists or editors involved in his ordeal. Eight newspapers, including the Sun and Daily Mail, were forced to pay the 67-year-old damages following their coverage of his arrest in connection with the landscape architect's disappearance in 2010 but none had personally written to express their remorse. Mohan has responded to Jefferies's comments by pledging to write immediately to the retired English teacher, from Clifton, in Bristol.Mohan told the Nick Ferrari show on LBC 97.3: \"I would be prepared to write to Mr Jefferies. I will make that pledge now. I will write to him as soon a possible.\"",
