  "content": "The Mail on Sunday today issued a formal apology and agreed to pay damages to Noel Edmonds over allegations that he seduced a woman away from her husband and used their relationship to promote his career. In a statement at the high court in London, the paper admitted that the allegations, made in a story in October last year, were \"entirely untrue\". Edmonds, whose TV career has enjoyed a renaissance in the past six months with the hit show Deal or No Deal, had not sought publicity following the breakup of his marriage last year, his solicitor John Kelly told the court. The Mail on Sunday claimed Edmonds had targeted a married woman, Marjan Simmons, in order to seduce her away from her husband and had caused her to take her children away from their family home, Mr Kelly said. It also alleged the star was using the relationship for PR reasons to \"counter his image as a downcast loser and to help his efforts to relaunch himself as a television presenter\", Mr Kelly said. The paper claimed Edmonds had set up a publicity photograph of himself and Ms Simmons leaving a restaurant in Nice, the solicitor added. \"These allegations were not put to Mr Edmonds or his representatives before publishing them. Had they done so, they would have been informed of their utter falsity. \"Following Mr Edmonds complaint, the Mail on Sunday now accepts that the story is entirely untrue. The publication of these allegations has caused damage to the claimant's personal and professional reputations, in addition to obvious distress to both himself, his family, and Ms Simmons.\" Adam Cannon, representing the Mail on Sunday, said the paper accepted the story was untrue and apologised for the \"distress and embarrassment\" it had caused. The Mail on Sunday has agreed to publish an apology and retraction in the newspaper, and will pay an undisclosed sum in damages in addition to Edmonds' legal costs. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
