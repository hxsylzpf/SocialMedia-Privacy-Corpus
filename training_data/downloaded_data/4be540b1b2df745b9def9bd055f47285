  "content": "The return of Breaking Bad generated lots of buzz on social networks, while viewers in the UK were able to get the latest episode from Netflix and iTunes within hours of its US airing. Has that dented piracy of the popular TV drama? Figures collected by tech blog TorrentFreak indicate that plenty of viewers downloaded the Blood Money episode via torrent sites instead. The site claims that 80,000 people were sharing the episode within hours of it appearing online, and that torrented downloads had topped half a million within 12 hours. These figures only cover downloads, too: it's unknown how many people watched Blood Money on unlicensed streaming sites, which have become an increasingly high-profile headache for broadcasters in recent years. According to TorrentFreak's sample of downloads yesterday (12 August), Australian fans accounted for 16.1% of the Breaking Bad episode's BitTorrent downloads, ahead of the US (16%), Canada (9.6%) and the UK (8.5%). It's the latest sign of Australians turning to piracy in greater numbers, frustrated at the often-long delays between big TV shows airing in the US, and being broadcast in their own country. In the UK, there is evidence of a move by the AMC network to drastically shorten this kind of geographical \"window\", with Blood Money available to stream on Netflix and buy on Apple's iTunes Store within hours of the US premiere. The desire for \"instant syndication\" is partly being driven by social media, with shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones usually trending on Twitter as soon as they air in the US, risking spoilers for fans elsewhere in the world. AMC tells All Things Digital that 5.9m Americans watched Blood Money's premiere on Sunday (11 August), while ratings company Nielsen tracked more than 760,000 tweets from 400,000 users during the broadcast. Shortening geographic windows is one key tactic for the television industry to combat the piracy fuelled by fans' determination to join in the buzz around popular shows shortly after they air in the US. Time Warner chief executive Alan Bewkes made headlines earlier this month when he told analysts that piracy of Game of Thrones \u2013 made by his company's HBO subsidiary \u2013 was \"a tremendous word of mouth thing\". \"We've been dealing with this for 20, 30 years - people sharing subs, running wires down the backs of apartment buildings. Our experience is that it leads to more paying subs,\" said Bewkes. \"I think you're right that Game of Thrones is the most pirated show in the world and that's better than an Emmy.\" It's safe to assume AMC would prefer a tower of Emmy awards for the final season of Breaking Bad rather than a pile of piracy milestones. Even so, the anticipation around the new series may make the latter inevitable.",
