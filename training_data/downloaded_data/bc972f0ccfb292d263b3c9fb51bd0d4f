  "content": "The garrulous arena of social networking might seem a world away from the introspective quiet of the ballet studio. But dancers are proving enthusiastic tweeters, bloggers and posters, creating a daily hum of chatter about everything from rehearsals, classes and injuries to big breaking news. When Sergei Polunin made his shock exit from the Royal Ballet in January, his gnomic tweets (\"Just have to get through one more night!!! then will make my next moves\") were scoured for clues to his state of mind. San Francisco Ballet (SFB) may well be at the forefront of this new wave. At their modern, purpose-built base in the city's Civic Center, I find a company in thrall to social media. \"I'm not really a technology person,\" shrugs principal ballerina Maria Kochetkova. Yet in 2007, she was one of the first professional dancers to sign up to Twitter and, as @balletrusse, she now has 180,000 followers. Other SFB dancers aren't far behind. Meanwhile, in the marketing department, there's a full-time \"digital engagement co-ordinator\" posting comments on Facebook and Twitter, and drumming up online buzz. SFB was founded in 1933 \u2013 making it the US's oldest major ballet company \u2013 and the troupe has always boasted a pioneering spirit. Under the current direction of Helgi Tomasson, it has earned a world-beating reputation as a talent-spotter of original work. It was the first US company to dance the postmodern ballets of William Forsythe and the quirky classical inventions of Alexei Ratmansky. When the company comes to Britain in September, seven of its works will have been created inhouse in the last couple of years. It's a number made even more impressive by the fact that SFB receives little public funding, depending heavily on local support. This is one reason why the company has invested so much in engaging with its fans online. Tomasson admits that, personally, he's a refusenik when it comes to technology: he doesn't even use email. \"I see people in front of monitors,\" he says, \"and I wonder how they have the time.\" But he knows how vital technology has become in accessing younger audiences. The majority of people now buy tickets online and, according to Carly Severn, SFB's digital co-ordinator, social networking has become a crucial way of steering them towards the company's website. Numbers are hard to crunch, but since she's been in place, 11% of their website traffic has come through the 300,000 people who follow them on social platforms: the extra traffic that comes through dancers' individual networking counts just as much. Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Two people watching SFB closely are Emilia Spitz and Linda Uruchurtu, joint founders, in 2009, of the fan-friendly website theballetbag. As Spitz says, \"Social networking seems to suit dance very well. Its so rich in content, and ballet fans have that slightly obsessive quality that make them good followers.\" Spitz does however point out how difficult it is for companies like SFB to keep up with the different platforms and the different communities they attract, as the landscaping of social network constantly evolves. SFB does, however, have one major advantage in this project: their proximity to Silicon Valley. There's an almost visible cloud of digital chatter hanging over the Bay Area, so even if a dancer like Kochetkova claims not to be into technology, she can hardly avoid meeting people who are. She recently signed up to Pair, a new platform designed for couples to converse, in order to chat to her London-based husband. When I ask how she heard of it, she replies nonchalantly: \"Oh, I just know the people who invented it. This is a small city. You meet people from the Valley all the time.\" [see footnote] The ties go deeper in the case of Jack Dorsey, creator of Twitter \u2013 and a serious ballet fan. His former partner, Sofiane Sylve, was an SFB principal dancer; he also cites ballet as the inspiration for the pared-down, 140-character tweet. \"I've learned a lot from ballet,\" he told Vanity Fair recently. \"I appreciate the co-ordination and the discipline. Making something simple is very difficult.\" Severn says she has learned a huge amount from experts in the Valley. Twitter, for example, tends to be accessed by smartphone users, making it good for quickfire engagement. Facebook is better for offering ticket promotions because most people access it from computers, where they're also more likely to complete financial transactions. Wednesday is the best day to post comments and photographs on Facebook, and it's best to have images that feature red and yellow because they contrast with Facebook's blue background. The power of networks to access vast communities is astonishing compared to old methods, such as leafleting \u2013 but it has to be done right. Severn says: \"If you simply push out marketing messages, people don't like it.\" Sarah Hogarty is Severn's counterpart at San Francisco's De Young Museum, another institution investing heavily in social networking. \"There's a very fine line between talking and spamming,\" she says. \"What you want to do is harness the conversations that are going on out there, to find the most creative and innovative way of using these platforms.\" For her, the social networks create a kind of \"meta-museum\" where a huge variety of other activities and discourses can go on. \"Picasso,\" she says, \"would definitely have tweeted.\" American Ballet Theatre has just launched a phone app, allowing its followers to keep up with news, performance times and castings; and most companies now encourage their members to tweet and have an official presence online. Back on this side of the Atlantic, the Royal Ballet recently filmed an entire day of class and rehearsals, streaming it live on the web via YouTube and the Guardian \u2013 and attracting 200,000 viewers worldwide. Some of them were balletomanes; others were just curious passersby fascinated by what they saw. Everyone I meet at SFB caught the Royal Ballet event. While marketing regarded it with envy, dancers saw it as a means of expanding and developing. Historically, the discipline of a dancer's working life has kept them relatively isolated within the studio or theatre. Now, it's the potential for forging contacts outside that draws so many to the web. \"Dancers share the same world,\" says SFB soloist James Sofranko. \"We can tweet about having a bad class; someone at La Scala might tweet about performing in a ballet you've danced yourself.\" His colleague Garen Scribner is just as enthusiastic. \"When I started posting videos and photos of myself on Facebook, I started getting comments from people like Christopher Wheeldon and Jorma Elo. I thought, 'God, this is important.' If these choreographers come into the company to make a work, maybe they'll already have me in mind when they come to cast it.\" Both agree with Kochetkova that social networking gives them invaluable contact with their fans. \"Before, I might just have the opinion of one newspaper,\" she says. \"Now, 10 minutes after a show, people are tweeting me what they liked or didn't like. It's really useful. You realise how many different opinions there are.\" Yet there are drawbacks to this culture of instant sharing. Fans like to know about the raw stuff \u2013 pain, sweat, rivalry \u2013 but they also like a bit of scandal. So what counts as insight and what's simply gossip? New York City Ballet recently reined in the sometimes subversive commentary of its dancer Devin Alberda (@dalberda), who made a name for himself with his acerbic insights. One post read: \"My turns were off today because the pianist was playing The Thieving Magpie and I was thinking about gang rape. Thanks Kubrick.\" When he tweeted about NYCB's management, including one about his director Peter Martins being charged for drunk-driving (\"Thank goodness riding the subway while intoxicated isnt a misdemeanor offence #dontfireme\") there were steps taken to fix acceptable parameters of social networking with the dancers' union. Scribner accepts that lines have to be drawn. \"When you're tweeting or posting photographs, you have to be careful not to suggest anything disparaging about another artist or your own company, even accidentally. When the curtain goes up and there's this beautiful thing, part of the wonder for the audience is not knowing how it came to be there. You want to learn more \u2013 but also enjoy the magic.\" The question that also hangs over this giant bubble of internet chatter is whether and how it will last, especially in the light of Facebook's recent seesawing entry into the stockmarket. Even someone as deeply immersed as Spitz can feel dizzy that something that's grown so powerful, so fast, is almost nothing but hot air. \"It's all so busy and yet it rests on nothing.\" Over the summer, there will be a lot of virtual buzz about SFB's UK visit: a two-week season that contains new works by Mark Morris, Christopher Wheeldon and Ashley Page, performed by dancers of exceptional elegance and intelligence, led by the likes of Kochetkova. The chatter matters, but in the end no one could question Tomasson's assertion: \"However well you market yourself, what counts is what's on the stage.\" \u2022 This footnote was added on 2 August 2012: Maria Kotchetkova was referring to knowing the founders of Twitter and Instagram, not Pair. The article was also amended to correct the date when Kotchetkova signed up to Twitter from 2005 to 2007.",
