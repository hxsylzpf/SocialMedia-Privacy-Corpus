  "content": "Here are three headlines I found recently when I visited Viral Nova, a curation site I've got a horrible feeling may represent the future of the web: They Peeked In the Dumpster And \u2026 RACCOON! What Happened Next Warmed My Heart. This 12 Year Old Girl Hanged Herself. The Note She Left Behind Shattered My World. If I Gave You 30 Guesses, You Still Wouldn't Guess What's Behind This Door. It's That Awesome. Of course, you're not especially meant to visit sites like Viral Nova, nor the more established and for now much more popular site on which it's modelled, Upworthy. The stories they feature are scientifically calibrated to spread as widely as possible on social networks, powered ever onward by the emotional responses of users who encounter and then share them. To an extent, that's true of all successful online content today. But Viral Nova (which I discovered via the Awl) shows what happens when this approach is taken to its logical conclusion. And it's not pretty. Though it is heartwarming, devastating, unforgettable, awesome, heartwarming, unbelievable, cute and heartwarming. Viral Nova targets what Upworthy co-founder Eli Pariser has called \"the searching-for-meaning network\", to distinguish it from the \"bored-at-work network\" that Buzzfeed has in its sights. \"We reject the idea that the media elite or people who have been trained in a certain way somehow have the monopoly on editorial judgment,\" Upworthy's editorial director Sara Critchfield has said. In hiring people, she explains, \"I look for heart. What moves this person?\" She tells her staff: \"If you're not feeling it, don't write it.\" Viral Nova's headlines show every sign of rigorous A/B testing, while the choice of themes broadly reflects the finding that positive emotions spread more effectively than negative ones. But while Upworthy's creators like to talk about using emotional engagement to foster social change, Viral Nova has abandoned any such pretence: a constant barrage of emotional highs is all that's left. It must be exhausting to work there, exposed to the risk of having your world rocked, being freaked out and being made to rethink everything, quite possibly all before lunchtime. The problem with the relentless \"search for meaning\", though, is that pretty soon it extinguishes all meaning in favour of this pure emotion. It's fascinating \u2013 and troubling \u2013 to watch what happens when Viral Nova bumps into a story that might force it to take an ethical stance more controversial than \"animal cruelty is bad\" or \"members of the US military are worthy of praise\". See, for example, this excruciating effort to cover a story about a group of diners at a Kansas restaurant leaving an aggressively homophobic note for their waiter \u2013 but without alienating homophobes in Viral Nova's audience: ... what happened at this Carrabba's Italian Grill in Kansas is disgusting \u2013 even if you agree with the basic premise. \"The basic premise\", as far as I can tell, being that a \"homosexual lifestyle is an affront to God.\" Uh \u2026 right. But perhaps the most Viral Nova-ish story on Viral Nova so far \u2013 the story, therefore, that if my theory's right may represent the general tenor of the internet as a whole come 2016 or so \u2013 was posted earlier this month, with the splendid title Half Way Through This, I Totally Broke Down. I Don't Want To Spoil It, So Just Get A Tissue And Look. It checks an extraordinary number of viral-emotional boxes. It takes place in small-town America. It involves a cute but sad rescue dog, Reggie, who refuses to respond to affection, until his new owner discovers a letter revealing that his former owner was a US soldier who died in Iraq, and that the dog's real name \u2013 to which he eagerly responds, in heartwarming fashion \u2013 is Tank. (\"Not thinspo, but deserves a reblog,\" someone earlier in the forwarding chain has added, to give you a sense of what we're dealing with here.) Seriously, folks: Just Get A Tissue And Look. And whatever you do, don't check Snopes, where you'll find persuasive evidence that the tale of Tank the Dog is a completely bogus urban myth dating from at least 2009. Still, it's the emotions that count, right? The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking, by Oliver Burkeman, is published in paperback in the US by Faber &amp; Faber on 5 November.",
