  "content": "Two French photographers who took photographs of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed before and after their fatal car crash have been cleared in an appeals court of breaking French privacy laws. The two men, together with a third photographer who took pictures of the couple leaving the Ritz hotel before the tragic crash, were today acquitted in an appeals court of invading the couple's privacy. Christian Martinez, Fabrice Chassery and Jacques Langevin were first cleared of the charges last November, but French prosecutors and Dodi's father, Harrods owner Mohammed Al Fayed, appealed against the decision. They were among the hordes of paparazzi laying in wait outside the Paris Ritz on August 31 seven years ago. Diana, Dodi Fayed and their chauffeur, the hotel's head of security Henri Paul, were all killed in the crash. A French enquiry in 1999 ruled that Paul caused the crash by driving too fast while under the influence of alcohol. Mr Langevin, who was working for the Sygma agency, took pictures as the couple left the hotel, the court heard, while Mr Martinez and Mr Chassery were in the pack of photographers chasing the couple. After their Mercedes limousine crashed into the walls of an underpass, the two men managed to take photos of Diana and Dodi in the back of the car. The pictures were later confiscated and have never been shown in Britain, though in April American network CBS showed photocopies of the pictures, which they said had been obtained from French authorities. A spokesman for Mr Fayed declined to comment. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
