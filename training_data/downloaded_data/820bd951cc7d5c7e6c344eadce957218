  "content": "Not that much... \u2022 Te'o said he didn't lie. Then in the next sentence he said the lie he was most sorry for was the one he told his dad, about having met Lenny Kekua. \u2022 The hoaxer \u2013 Ronaiah Tuiasosopo is said to have confessed \u2013 apparently had an accomplice. We heard audio of \"Kekua\" speaking. It sounded like a woman's voice. \u2022 Tuiasosopo rang Te'o to explain his actions. \"He explained what he did and why he did it,\" Te'o said. \u2022 Tuiasospo did not explain his actions. \"He didn't say why [he did it]. He just explained that he wanted to help people and that was his way of helping people.\" \u2022 Of his draft prospects, Te'o said he was relaxed. \"As long as my family's ok, I can live with what happens.\" What do we still not know? \u2022 Who was the girl who left messages on Te'o's phone? \u2022 When he was falling asleep next to Lennay Kekua, running up 8hr phone calls, who was he really falling asleep next to? \u2022 What is this Tuiasosopo's problem? Why did he put Te'o through this torment? \u2022 What is Te'o's problem? Why did he never meet his supposed girlfriend, even after she was continuously struck by tragedy? Why did he carry on pretending she was dead of cancer? Why did he think he was in a relationship when he had never met or seen Kekua beyond a couple of photos? \"Have you tried getting in touch with this totally BRO prankster?,\" asks Couric, or something like that. It's peetering out a bit. The family sent a message through an intermediary, but are reasonably happy to let stuff lie. But will this affect the young starlet's chances of getting drafted? Teo: \"To be honest with you, as long as they're ok [point to family] whatever happens happens ... As long as my family's ok, I can live with what happens.\" We'll see about that. Piers Morgan is a British journalist. He hosts a daily talk show on CNN. They've wheeled out Te'o's mum and dad. Ottilia and Brian. Is this a joke, is it a sick prank, or something else? \"All these thoughts were going through my mind,\" says Brian. He had to sit down \"for a day or two\" to process the whole scenario. Ottilia is upset. She says \"it hurts\" that people say her son has been bending the truth. \"Te'o did exactly what you would expect a responsible young man to do,\" Ottilia said. All three Te'o's are crying now. \"The story of this, as bizarre as it may seem, was reality for us,\" says Brian. Jesus Christ. Lennay Kekua sounds like a right drag. We've just heard an answerphone message \"she\" left for Te'o, whinging about someone else answering his phone. Te'o says he doesn't know who was doing the voice. He doesn't think it is hoaxer Tuiasosopo, though. \"Well it doesn't sound like a man.\" Make up your own mind by listening to the audio here. Asks Couric. Well you see Te'o didn't dare ask his dad if he could go. But a kindly soul did hold a telephone to the comatose Kekua, and he could hear her breathing. So he was kind of there. \"It was very real, Katie. It was very very real,\" says Te'o. Interesting choice of words. \"So why didn't you ever meet up with this girl then?\" says Couric. Well the relationship developed over four years, says Te'o. \"It didn't start to pick up until my junior year,\" he said. \"She seemed nice, from her picture she seemed beautiful.\" To confirm that Kekua was real he \"reached out\" to people who confirmed she was real. (The picture was taken from a Real Girl's profile). Te'o laments his technological shortcomings. When the two would Facetime, he \"saw a black screen and ... she said 'you should be able to see me'\". But he couldn't see her. \"I wasn't paying attention I guess,\" says Te'o. Couric asks: \"Why wouldn't you want a real girlfriend?\" Well, there were just so many similarities with Kekua, Te'o says. They are both of Samoan heritage. They both knew about faith. Those were the two similarities. And then we're back to: why didn't the two meet? Te'o says Kekua would give him \"good reasons\" as to why she was unavailable for two years. One time her brother was borrowing her car. Next, Couric dives in and asks the question on some people's lips: Did Te'o make Kekua up to hide the fact he's gay? \"No,\" he says. \"Nooooo.\" He chuckles, and the camera pans to some attractive young women in the audience. We're into the good stuff. \"Why did you say you met her? Can you see that people would see it as misleading?,\" asks Couric. Te'o wants everyone to know that he DID NOT LIE, although he feels \"bad\" for people who think they were misled. He also wants people to know that he didn't lie despite overselling the relationship for a number of months, repeatedly claiming to have met his girlfriend of year when in reality he had never met his girlfriend of a year. \"But I didn't lie,\" he insists. \"I never was asked did you see her in person,\" he says. \"Aren't you splitting hairs here?,\" Couric probes gently. Te'o doesn't think he was. He seems to be suggesting he implied that he met Kekua, rather than explicitly saying he did. \"The biggest lie I am sorry for is the lie that I told my dad.\" \"Did you have any involvement in creating the scam?\" asks Couric. \"No, I did not. I think what people don't realise is that the same day that everyone else found out about the situation, I found out,\" says our Te'o. From December 6 to January 16, all Te'o knew was that she was dead, then she was alive, he says. The hoaxer, who has been named as Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, called Te'o after the fraud emerged and said he had been trying to \"help out\" by pretending to be an attractive young woman and pretending to go out with Te'o, Te'o says. Te'o says that actually, it wasn't that much of a help at all. Well, that was short-lived. We had about three minutes of the Katie show before cutting to the ad break. In order: Couric looking serious, lots of dramatic music, video montage of story so far, lots more dramatic music, three sentences from Manti Te'o, lots of teaser clips of Te'o looking stunned, ad break. Two minutes in, and we haven't heard from Te'o yet. ABC appears to have spent a lot of time and money on the opening video montage, bringing us up to speed on this whole sorry situation. They've even invested in a piano player, who seems to have a penchant for the more dramatic chords. It's all very serious. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Guardian's live coverage of Katie Couric's interview with Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o, who has been quite the story since it emerged that his much-discussed girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, never existed. As Te'o's team surged to the National Championship, eventually losing to Alabama, Te'o's own popularity was booming, thanks, in part, to the heartbreaking story that both Kekua and his grandmother had died within hours of each other in September during his team's run to the final. Te'o had apparently channeled the deaths into his football performances, as well as into several interviews, and was nominated for a Heisman Trophy along the way. But then, Deadspin broke the news that Kekua did not exist. The photo on her Twitter profile was of somebody else. It emerged that Te'o had never met his girlfriend of a year, declining to visit even when she was in a near fatal car crash and later when she was diagnosed with leukemia. Notre Dame said Te'o had been the victim of a hoax, but in pre-released extracts from the Couric interview, it seems Te'o may not be entirely blameless in the mess. Te'o insisted he had no part in creating the hoax, but said he had lied after finding out Kekua was not real in December, to save face in two interviews. \"Katie, put yourself in my situation. I, my whole world, told me that she died on September 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I committed myself to, died on September 12,\" Te'o said. Follow along the interview here from 3pm ET.",
