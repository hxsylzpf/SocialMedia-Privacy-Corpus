  "content": "I took the opportunity to enlist the wildly liked actor/writer Jessica Hynes, who happened to attend one of Simon's warm-up gigs recently. While she was incredibly enlightening, I think she may have misunderstood the point of this project slightly. I can reveal that, despite his somewhat negative Twitter attitude in the videos so far, Simon is definitely becoming more enthusiastic and in tune with the practices of Twitter. He is now on an average of three per week. There will be a more official and informative instalment next week, when we get to meet Simon's support act for the Numb tour, and dissect some key tweets. Mobile site users, please visit the desktop site to view the video",
