  "content": "On Friday, barring a lastminute change of heart, the authorities in Saudi Arabia will start to block instant messaging services for BlackBerry users. The United Arab Emirates has threatened similar action from October and India has raised concerns with BlackBerry's Canadian manufacturer, Research in Motion (RIM). Their concern is that texts, emails and other data from BlackBerry smartphones are difficult to monitor \u2013 partly because of the encryption technology and partly because data is routed through RIM's own facilities in Canada and Britain, rather than locally as with other types of mobile phone. The regulating authority in the UAE pointed out in a statement that \"in their current form, certain BlackBerry services allow users to act without any legal accountability, causing judicial, social and national security concerns\". The security fears have been highlighted a great deal, but considering that most countries have no problem allowing their citizens to use BlackBerry services, how realistic are these fears? Indian security forces reportedly suspect that BlackBerry services were used in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, though no details have been given. If they were an important factor, it's surprising that India did not make more fuss about it earlier. A source at Wired UK said this seems to be the first time that any government has officially viewed the BlackBerry as such an extreme problem or risk, though introducing it into China and Russia took years of negotiations. Thus it would be difficult to imagine that an apocalyptic national security threat would somehow involve a BlackBerry. True enough, the BlackBerry is used for business because of its security features. Communications can be encrypted and BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), a messaging service where BlackBerry users can talk to each other live, is apparently hard to monitor in real time. Or in bulk. Yet a BlackBerry is usually not bought as a mobile to use anonymously or throw away. BBM requires a special, personalised BlackBerry PIN to function \u2013 it's hardly a Hotmail account, which anyone can set up, from anywhere, with any name. As has been shown in the past, terrorists and insurgents tend to communicate using quick, cheap and untraceable technology. The BlackBerry is not really any of these things, since the handset's entire function is to weave its way into its owner's professional (often corporate) and personal life, so as to be an extremely efficient means to trace and reach them. So what else could this be about? Snooping, most likely. Matthew Reed, a mobile analyst working from Dubai, was quoted in the Guardian as saying: \"In Saudi Arabia, people are using BlackBerry Messenger to talk to members of the opposite sex. It is the fact that it is a form of communication which is quite anonymous that is part of its appeal to people.\" So perhaps they mean security in the sense of social control \u2013 that people communicating openly, in a way that transgresses norms, and maybe even laws, or whole systems of government, might be contrary to the Gulf states' own power geometry. Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia engage in internet censorship and according to Reporters Without Borders a number of BBM users were arrested last month after trying to organise a peaceful protest about high petrol prices in the UAE. As far as Mike Lazaridis, co-founder of Research in Motion, is concerned, these countries will only be harming themselves if they go ahead with the blocking. \"If you were to ban strong encryption, you would shut down corporations, business, commerce, banking and the internet,\" he said recently. He may well be right: this policy is a contradiction, on a practical level, with Saudi and Emirati desires to achieve a level of economic modernisation equivalent to that of the west. The style of government common in Gulf states may be putting them at a disadvantage when it comes to this goal of economic and technological development. This is a central theme in Neal Stephenson's epic cyberpunk novel Cryptonomicon, and idea as old as Athens: that a democracy, where the freedom to think and communicate thrives naturally, has an advantage when it comes to innovation. While Cryptonomicon may just be a rollicking adventure story reeking a bit of its author's own cultural background, the principle does seem to hold: democracy, unlike authoritarian systems, provides more space for innovation and, thus, economic development.",
