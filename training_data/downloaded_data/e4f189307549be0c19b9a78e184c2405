  "content": "\"While social networking sites can connect us with friends all across the world, we may not know our neighbours well enough to have a cup of tea with them.\" So said the communities secretary, Hazel Blears recently. With the increasing trend of connecting virtual strangers globally via the internet, it is important to remember how essential it is to maintain connections at a local level. It has been well documented that neighbourly relations have a significant impact on our daily lives. Recent research found that an individual's happiness depends on the happiness of others with whom they are connected. Interestingly, having a happy neighbour was seen to increase the probability of being happy by 34%. Furthermore, building strong local communities empowers residents to take action to improve community life. The Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 recognises the need to enable tenants to be involved in the management of social housing, and that registered providers of social and private housing can contribute significantly to the social and economic wellbeing of the areas in which the housing is situated. But with levels of social trust reported to be in decline people respond by retreating indoors. Now more than ever, local communities need a platform that combines social connection and empowers them to take control of the management of their neighbourhood. I set up Neighbo.com to bring people together around their homes, including tenants, leaseholders and housing managers, to achieve common goals, adhere to housing legislation and improve real-life experiences. These communities have not only become empowered to make life better by using Neighbo.com but have taken ownership of their social network and are working with us to shape the technology to meet their individual needs. Recent government actions portray the clear message that politicians understand the potential of positive community cohesion and the role the internet can play. This includes the recent Guidance to Build a Local Sense of Belonging, from the Department for Communities and Local Government, coupled with Lord Carter's interim Digital Britain report, announced last week, which calls for broadband internet access for everyone in the UK. But the new government guidelines offer little incentive or clear funding in terms of making this a reality. The key to implementing these guidelines is to give communities the tools to bring about change. Accessible broadband is a positive step towards improving communication. The next step is to build meaningful social networks, properly managed, uniting communities to achieve common goals leading to improvements in their real lives. The next generation of online social networkers must focus on the potential of using the web to make improvements in real-world communities. New online networks, such as Neighbo.com, provide exactly these tools and a perfect example of Marshall McLuhan's statement, \"We shape our tools, and our tools shape us.\" \u2022 Paul Fox is managing director of Neighbo.com",
