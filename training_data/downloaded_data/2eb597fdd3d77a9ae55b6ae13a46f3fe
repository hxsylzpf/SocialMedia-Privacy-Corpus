  "content": "The press watchdog has rejected a complaint from EastEnders star Leslie Grantham over tabloid newspaper reports that the BBC had ordered him to seek treatment for sex addiction. Grantham contacted the Press Complaints Commission claiming the newspapers, including the Sun, the Daily Star and the Daily Mirror, had breached his privacy by reporting that he had a \"specific medical condition in the form of an addiction\" and that he was to undergo treatment for that addiction. The actor, whose Dirty Den character was brought back to the soap last year following a 14-year absence in an effort to kick-start ratings, was suspended this year after he was caught indulging in internet sex using a BBC computer. Pictures of him stripped to his boxer shorts and sucking his finger in a suggestive manner in front of a webcam appeared in a newspaper. The actor's solicitors, the Simkins Partnership, claimed the reports breached clause 3 of the PCC code, which states: \"Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home, health and correspondence.\" They cited the case of model Naomi Campbell, who this year won her privacy case against the Daily Mirror after it published a photograph of her outside a Narcotics Anonymous session. But the Star said it had not revealed any details of Grantham's treatment and had simply reported the position of his employers. The Sun pointed out that its report followed large amounts of press coverage and said it \"did nothing more than inform readers that, in the well-known context of his sexual behavioural problems, the complainant had been told by his employers to seek professional help\". The PCC dismissed the claims in Grantham's complaint that the reports \"concerned a medical condition suffered by [their] client and treatment for which [their client was] undergoing for his mental health. \"The information complained about - rather than comprising private medical details that might have been found in the complainant's medical record - in fact related to a requirement that had allegedly been made by the complainant's employer following a disciplinary hearing,\" it said in its adjudication. The PCC pointed out that Grantham's internet sex sessions had received widespread coverage, adding that the newspapers had a right to report developments in the story, and that the public had a right to be informed of them. \"Convincing reasons would have had to exist to interfere with these rights - and in the commission's view, they did not,\" it said.",
