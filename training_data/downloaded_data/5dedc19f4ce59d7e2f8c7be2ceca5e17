  "content": "A lawyer for Vanessa Perroncel, the woman at the centre of the John Terry scandal, is investigating the possibility that Perroncel had her mobile phone hacked by journalists. The model's phone and those of her friends showed signs of being illegally accessed, Charlotte Harris of JMW Solicitors told MediaGuardian.co.uk. There was evidence that information from voicemail messages had appeared in national newspaper articles, she said. Harris added she was investigating the incident and was contacting various authorities, including the police and the information commissioner. She had also written to mobile-phone operator Vodafone. \"We believe that Ms Perroncel's tele\u00adphone and that of her close friend have been the subject of illegal interception and a complaint arrived with the Information Commissioner's Office this morning,\" Harris told MediaGuardian.co.uk. \"We have also written to Vodafone and are in the process of contacting the police with the details. We will continue to investigate who was behind this and will take action.\" Harris did not say which papers had aroused her suspicion but said she was carefully examining all papers that had written about Perroncel. The solicitor warned newspapers on Monday afternoon to check to ensure that any stories they wrote about Perroncel were not from information illegally obtained via phone hacking. A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it was not investigating the case. The spokesman told the Media Lawyer newsletter: \"Phone hacking is an offence under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. We do not investigate suspected cases of phone hacking and we do not have jurisdiction in this area.\" Harris also represents Perroncel's agent Max Clifford, who last week won a court action allowing him access to documents concerning the News of the World phone-hacking case, which saw a private investigator used by the paper, Glenn Mulcaire, and the paper's royal editor, Clive Goodman, jailed. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
