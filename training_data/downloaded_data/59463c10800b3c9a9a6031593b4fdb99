  "content": "Software giant Microsoft admitted late last night that it was the victim of hackers who left millions of customers without access to popular services like Hotmail and Expedia for most of Thursday. Yesterday marked the third day running that Microsoft web sites had been down, though the company said site failures on Tuesday and Wednesday were due to an error made by a company technician and not a hacker. The company has asked the FBI to investigate Thursday's incident, which Microsoft described as a denial-of-service attack. These attacks happen when hackers flood a network with useless traffic so that it cannot respond to normal requests from users. The company said that normal access has now been restored, and added: \"It is unfortunate that an individual or group of individuals would engage in this kind of illegal activity. Microsoft has made the FBI aware of this situation.\" Similar attacks caused problems for companies like Amazon, CNN, eBay and Yahoo! last year. Last week, a 16-year-old Canadian boy known as \"Mafiaboy\" pleaded guilty to 56 charges of mischief in connection with some of those attacks. Ten other charges were dropped. Microsoft, which prides itself on providing reliable internet access, was quick to point out that none of the site failures had anything to do with its software. \"This was an operational error, and not the result of any issue with Microsoft or third party products nor the security of our networks. Microsoft regrets any inconvenience caused to customers due to this issue,\" said a statement on the company's website.
