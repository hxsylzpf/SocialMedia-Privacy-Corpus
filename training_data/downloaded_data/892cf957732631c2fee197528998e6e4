  "content": "A tipoff from a computer company that was suspicious of a former employee's web searches led to a visit to his family's home by officers from a joint terrorism task force, police have confirmed. The company, based in the Bay Shore area of Long Island, in New York state, said the man had used a work computer to search for pressure cooker bombs and backpacks. On Thursday, the man's wife, Michele Catalano, speculated in a blog post that the visit had been caused by her search for a new pressure cooker, her husband's quest for a backpack, and her son's interest in the Boston marathon bombing. Late on Thursday, Suffolk County police said its investigation was in fact prompted by a tipoff, and not covert monitoring. \"Suffolk County criminal intelligence detectives received a tip from a Bay Shore based computer company regarding suspicious computer searches conducted by a recently released employee,\" Suffolk County said in a statement. \"The former employee's computer searches took place on this employee's workplace computer. On that computer, the employee searched the terms 'pressure cooker bombs' and 'backpacks'.\" The computer company's police report prompted a visit to Catalano's home by \"six gentleman in casual clothes\" who \"all had guns in their waistbands\", as she described the agents. \"After interviewing the company representatives, Suffolk county police detectives visited the subject's home to ask about the suspicious internet searches,\" the statement from police continued. \"The incident was investigated by Suffolk County police department's criminal intelligence detectives and was determined to be non-criminal in nature.\" Catalano says she and her husband were \"led to believe [the investigation came] solely from searches from within our house\". She wrote about the experience on medium.com, prompting outrage at what was taken by somme commenters to be an example of government intrusion into personal privacy. Late on Thursday night, Catalano issued a clarification, saying here piece \u2013 which was republished on the Guardian \u2013 had been written in good faith. \"We found out through the Suffolk Police Department that the searches involved also things my husband looked up at his old job. We were not made aware of this at the time of questioning and were led to believe it was solely from searches from within our house. I did not lie or make it up. I wrote the piece with the information that was given. What was withheld from us obviously could not be a part of a story I wrote based on what happened yesterday.\"",
