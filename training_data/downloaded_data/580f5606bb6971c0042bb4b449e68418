  "content": "Those who were plucked from its crowded and bloody beaches need few reminders of the precise chronology of the Dunkirk evacuation, but a new generation is being offered a real-time crash course in one of the darkest hours of the second world war, courtesy of the National Archives and Twitter. By trawling cabinet documents from 1940 and tweeting developments 70 years to the minute after they happened, the archive's staff have been able to build up a staccato narrative of the British government's response to the crisis. Each tweet links through to the original document, allowing people to seek out more detail from the government papers. The first hint of things to come arrived on 19 May, and was duly tweeted at 8.30am last week: \"[British Expeditionary Force] Commander concerned about force's right flank. If gap widens proposes withdrawal to Dunkirk 'to fight it out'.\" Churchill's characteristically blunt assessment of the situation also makes interesting reading: \"Churchill: Fallback to Channel ports 'a bomb trap'. 'Total loss only a matter of time.' Retreat through Amiens, Rouen.\" Over the last few days, the National Archive has laid bare the last-minute planning that went into Operation Dynamo. In the last 24 hours, bulletins on the life-or-death struggles on the beaches have been rushed out in messages of 140 characters or fewer: \"War Secretary Eden: 'Now clear' Calais has fallen. UK troops 'cut off from the quay', holding positions in the streets\"; \"First Sea Lord: 11,400 men evacuated from Dunkirk overnight. 2,500 men currently crossing Channel\"; \"2,000 troops on beaches, 7,000 among sand dunes. 'All these very badly in need of water' which army cannot supply.\" Just before 1pm this afternoon, news of the Royal Air Force's concerns about being stretched too thinly emerged: \"RAF concerned at drain on air defence of UK caused by support of evacuation. Fighter defence 'almost at cracking point'.\" Jo Pugh, from the National Archives' education and outreach team, is the man responsible for sifting through the papers and communicating his discoveries through Twitter. \"Working with real documents can make you feel very close to the past,\" he said. \"That's difficult to recapture online, but the sense of urgency and the lack of hindsight in the Twitter feed aims to take people back in time a little bit.\" The fruits of his labour have so far attracted just over 2,000 followers \u2014 although that figure is likely to rise as ceremonies to mark the 70th anniversary of Dunkirk are held. The online initiative, which has been updating the public on the progress of the war since the beginning of this year, aims to bring the archived information to a new audience. \"This provides a different perspective of events, seeing how things develop rather than a static overview,\" said a spokeswoman. \"History books condense events but with the Twitter feed the audience \u2013 like the participants in the events \u2013 have to take the slower path. You can see how long it takes for decisions to be made on various issues, such as the evacuation of Dunkirk.\"",
