  "content": "Another group is boycotting the internal police investigation into the undercover spies who were sent to infiltrate political groups for four decades. This became apparent in a recent statement by the group of trade unionists who were illegally blacklisted. The Blacklist Support Group have alleged that police secretly passed information on individual workers to the blacklist that was run and funded by big firms. Earlier this year, the Metropolitan Police agreed to investigate their claims. Responsibility for the investigation was given to Operation Herne, the internal police inquiry that is examining the work of the covert Scotland Yard unit, the Special Demonstration Squad. However the blacklisted workers have signalled their dissatisfaction. In the statement last week, they said : \"The Blacklist Support Group has no faith in the police investigating the police under the auspices of Operation Herne.\" \"All of our requests for information so far have been met by denial and obstruction. This smacks of a cover up.\" \"Only a full public inquiry with a wide enough remit to unravel all the institutions responsible for blacklisting is going to get to the truth of this ongoing human rights scandal.\" The group added : \"The police collusion in blacklisting is not one or two rogue officers, but standard operating procedure by the state to target campaigners under the guise of 'domestic extremism', routinely sharing information with big business.\" \"We are not terrorists: we are trade unionists and campaigners participating in perfectly legal activities in a democratic society.\" Others who have declared their disenchantment with the internal police inquiry include Doreen and Neville Lawrence, the parents of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, and the women who are suing the Metropolitan Police over their long-term relationships with the police spies. For more on the growing list shunning the internal police inquiry, see here and here. At issue here is the credibility of the internal police inquiry at a time when there have been calls for an independent, public inquiry. Last month, we reported how police are alleged to have gathered intelligence on trade union activists and passed the information to the clandestine blacklist. Peter Francis, the ex-spy who has become a whistleblower, said he believes that he personally collected some of the intelligence that later appeared in the files of the blacklisters. For some background on the blacklist, see this and this from the Guardian and this and this from the BBC's Panorama programme. Major companies funded the secret blacklist that was was exposed and closed down in 2009. Secret files were unlawfully stored on thousands of trade unionists who were prevented from working and forced into poverty.",
