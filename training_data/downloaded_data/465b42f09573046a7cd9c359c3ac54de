  "content": "So Rupert Murdoch finally hints in public at what he has been saying in private for 30 years or more: does the Sun really need Page 3? His tweet is anything but definitive. He uses the word \"considering\" and I recall him saying much the same when I was present in discussions about the paper back in the 1980s. On several occasions he hovered over the idea of ditching it. Incidentally, the editor responsible for launching the phenomenon, Larry Lamb, later wished he had never started publishing the pictures. \"I will be remembered only for that\", he lamented. His obituaries proved him correct. To be frank, Page 3 has been an embarrassment for several editors and many of the journalists down the years. How do reporters and sub-editors explain to their young children that the paper they work for carries pictures of topless women for no other reason than to titillate men? Some have refused to take it home. When the current editor, Dominic Mohan, gave evidence to the Leveson inquiry last year, he spoke of Page 3 representing \"the youth and freshness\" of \"natural beauty\" and it being \"an innocuous British institution.\" It sounded as if he was parroting a PR briefing. But Murdoch's sensibilities - oh yes, he has them - have always been overshadowed by his unshakeable belief in market forces. He will have nothing to do with elitism. If that's what the public want, then give it to them. And \"the public\" - meaning, of course, the Sun's regular audience - have appeared happy enough to see the pictures. At odd moments when Page 3 has been dropped, during tragic news events for example, many readers have protested about the pictures being omitted. The other problem for Murdoch is the fear of the Sun losing many thousands of sales to the rival Daily Star should he blink first and banish them from the paper. Since its launch in 1978 as a crude (and briefly left-wing) Sun-style red-top, the Star has always carried pictures of topless models on a daily basis. Indeed, it's fair to say that the Star's USP has more to do with sex and trivia than the Sun's, despite its invention of Page 3. Murdoch is aware that, should he dare to follow his anti-Page 3 instincts, he may jeopardise the Sun's circulation. And that is already in steady decline, as the latest ABC figures illustrate. The Sun sold a daily average of 2.4 million in January, but that was 350,000 fewer than in January last year, a fall of more than 12%. The News Corporation chairman also knows, as his company prepares to create a publishing-only division, that the Sun remains a major cash cow. To imperil its sales at this time, prompting the obvious consequent reduction in advertising revenue, would be foolish. He is, to be frank, caught between his desire to \"do the right thing\" and commercial reality. He must also take account of the galling truth that much of the online traffic to the Sun's website involves the consumption of Page 3. To pull it would threaten that audience. Murdoch might also reflect on the fact that the Sun, which held the newsprint grip for so long on celebrity scandals and assorted gossip, allowed the Daily Mail to steal a march by winning a huge website audience by running content that was traditionally the Sun's preserve. The Mail, not the Sun, is the go-to site for people across the world, most notably the United States, who want to see pictures of \"famous\" scantily-clad women and read stories about their exploits. Here's the first irony for Murdoch to reflect on: the purveyor of Page 3 has seen the Mail, quite literally, steal its clothes. He has been, in many ways, a great media visionary. But he has always been one step behind, sometimes two, since the arrival of the internet. The failure to develop the Sun online is yet another example of his failure. And the second irony? Online, the Page 3 brand, with 1.4m unique monthly visitors last month, has to be seen against the fact that the Sun site enjoyed a record 30m uniques. So the Page 3 \"brand\" is not as big a draw as might be thought. Oh yes, and let's not forget the overarching third irony. Murdoch's claim to be a hands-off proprietor has been exposed by his own tweets. They reveal that he calls the shots at his papers and editors can no longer rely on taking their orders via discreet phone calls. His tweet on the Gerald Scarfe cartoon affair undermined the initial response to complaints by the Sunday Times's temporary acting editor, Martin Ivens. Now his Page 3 tweet suggests that he disagrees with Mohan's upbeat Page 3 defence. Who would be a Murdoch editor nowadays? *This blog posting was amended to correct the original claim that, in terms of online hits, the Page 3 site is a bigger draw than the Sun site. The figures show it isn't so. Sorry for the error.",
