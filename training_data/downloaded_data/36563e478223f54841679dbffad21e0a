The Kabul event will take place in a small, secure venue somewhere in Afghan capital but, as with all of the organisation's events, details of the film and the location of the screening will be kept secret until the morning of the show on 8 December. This marks the first time that the company have hosted an international simultaneous screening. \"What's interesting to me is that it has to be secret in Kabul,\" says Secret Cinema's founder and creative director Fabien Riggall of organising an event in a war zone. \"People here [in the UK] automatically say, 'What the hell are you doing?' But there's a real scene there. They [the Afghanis] say, 'We want culture just like everybody else. Just because we're in this situation doesn't mean we don't want entertainment'. Secret Cinema Kabul is being organised in conjunction with Travis Beard - an Australian native and long-term resident who was responsible for the city's \"stealth music festival\", Sound Central, held in October. \"It's a bit of ad hoc fun\" says Beard. \"It's a test case. Security is a bit of an issue, but we try and keep the place off the radar. That fits into the Secret Cinema idea\". Beard, who is also organising a screening for Secret Cinema's sister company Future Shorts, talks of \"expanding and improving the cultural profile\" of the city. \"Anything to make Kabul a bit more fun,\" he says. \"People here are kind of bored. The only things being screened are commercial Bollywood films or local Afghan films. We don't look back much.\" Riggall announced the Kabul event by posting a message in Farsi on Secret Cinema's Facebook page. Publicity for the shows (called \"the pre-narrative\" by SC) has so far centred around a character known as Henry Rose Flemming who has traveled to Afghanistan on \"undisclosed business\". The company want to close the gap between audiences by asking audience members from both countries to write to their counterparts before the event, and hope to project a live Twitter feed from London on to the wall of the Kabul venue. \"It's about people experiencing culture at the same time and how the different audiences experience that culture,\" says Riggall. But while the Kabul screening is about \"bridging\" audiences, he says, it shouldn't be read as a sign that his organisation is branching into activism. Meanwhile, Secret Cinema has further plans for overseas events. The company will launch a New York operation next year and hope to expand into Paris and Berlin in the near future. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 December 2011. The original said the screening in Kabul would be the first time that Secret Cinema have hosted an event outside of the UK. This has been corrected.",
