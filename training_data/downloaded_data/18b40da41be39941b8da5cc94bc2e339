Within days of reaching that fifth birthday, Stardoll has announced its 100 millionth user, reflecting accelerated growth in sign ups in the past 12 months and what general manager Chris Seth describes as \"the general network effect of scale\". Stardoll has been focusing on expanding its userbase on local markets. Though core audiences are in the US, with 25% of total users, UK, Scandinavia, Germany, France and Italy, much of the traffic growth has been around developing markets in Russia, Poland, Brazil and the Middle East. Stardoll is now published in 21 languages. \"Dressing up, role play and creativity is a universal passion and interest for girls,\" said Seth. \"It wasn't invented with the internet and it's something that works across all markets \u2013 that explains Stardoll's popularity.\" Backed by Index and Sequoia, Seth would not disclose Stardoll's revenues, but said sales of virtual goods are the biggest income stream. Targeted ads also make money and Stardoll recently started working with merchandise partners including Mattel, whose Barbie Stardoll product line will launch this autumn. That core revenue from virtual goods leaves Stardoll less vulnerable to \"the vagaries of the ad market,\" admitted Seth. Another trial last year, a virtual book project with publisher Random House, is also being extended. \"There's a real book out now that came from that virtual book and we have real hope that there's significant revenue there. We'd learnt how to present and distribute that project and now we want to capitalise on that.\" How will Stardoll maintain the interest of its established audiences, particularly where it needs to push for growth in new markets? \"We have to keep innovating around the product, expand to other platforms like mobile and continue to localise what we do. We'll be stepping up our marketing effort in Asia where we are not well known, yet it's a region home to half the world's population.\" Stardoll has two iPhone apps designed around spin-off parts of the service using game mechanics and creative tools, and another two apps are due later this year. While many teens don't own their own iPhone, iPod Touch is very popular. Stardoll has 120 staff headquartered in Stockholm, with the sales base in London and other satellites in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Frankfurt. Seth would not pick out direct rival sites, saying users spend time across sites such as Facebook that aren't direct competitors but that there are few dress-up sites that have dented Stardoll's growth. Another European success story, Moshi Monsters, has proved a playground hit but attracts younger users, said Seth, mentioning a German Club Penguin clone and Nickelodeon as equally competitive.  \"Users graduate from Moshi to Stardoll. The fact we're in a tightly defined niche away from the rest of the social media world and from gaming has been a real strength.\" As the father of a 10-year-old girl, has Seth fought back against the tyranny of pink on sites and products targeted at young girls? \"Stardoll is definitely more purple than pink these days, but there are also collections like Fallen Angel (an emo range) that reflect offline trends and alternatives.\" Tucked away in the selection of celebrity dolls is a 'role models' range that includes Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, native American Indian Sacajawea and Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi \u2013 though Seth admitted Miley Cyrus will have been a far more popular choice. \"That said, they've been more popular than we expected them to be, particularly locally \u2013 so Frida Kahlo in Mexico, for example,\" said Seth. \"Creative personalities are popular and we do introduce elements that are educational as well as entertaining.\"",
