Daisley has run Google's display advertising business in the UK for over three years and joins as Twitter boosts its European operation in London and Dublin. Twitter's European boss, Tony Wang, announced the appointment of Daisley in a tweet on Thursday morning. The San Francisco-based social network is also hiring in business development and a sales marketing manager based in London. Daisley joined Google in September 2008 from Emap, the publisher behind Retail Week and Broadcast, where he was digital sales director. He will start at Twitter in the new year. Twitter launched its first UK-targeted advertising products in September, since when it has worked with about 20 well-known brands including BT, Shell UK and Sainsbury's. The company has also looked to benefit from its users' appetite for news, with a Top News feature with a headline and link to a news provider. The BBC and Huffington Post UK have both featured as a top result in a search for \"phone hacking\".",
