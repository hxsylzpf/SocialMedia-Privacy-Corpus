  "content": "Chris Killen's sharply observed second novel concerns a love triangle between friends who met in Nottingham 10 years ago, but its true subject is the way internet use has changed since then, and where it has left us. In 2004 Ian, Paul and Lauren are fresh out of university: Ian is hoping for a record deal, Paul dreams of his first novel and Lauren is exploring Canada (and herself). They use email \u2013 even, in Ian and Lauren's case, manage to use it to forge a more intimate relationship \u2013 and have signed up to MySpace but still largely live in the real world. Fast forward to 2014, and social networking looms darkly. For Lauren, it's a \"deafening waterfall of misery\" to keep away from. For Ian, it's an addiction that has him hiding his laptop from himself. For Paul, it's a place where his self-hatred about his ailing relationship and failed second novel can ferment destructively late at night. There seems to be a suspicion in all of them, to varying extents, that being on the internet is the opposite of existing in a good and kind way. In Real Life can feel a bit like Julian Barnes's Talking It Over rewritten by a modern Morrissey who has spent too much time analysing his Facebook friend requests. Its three-perspective narrative is expertly paced, and Killen is good on life's small sadnesses: Tesco Metro, and call centre workers \u2013 one of whose breath is \"a sour mixture of coffee and emptiness\" \u2013 absorbing the rage of the public on behalf of a faceless corporate entity. He leans too hard on cultural references for colour \u2013 indie bands, hipster films, an ill-chosen boyfriend who is like \"an unfunny Joey\" from Friends \u2013 and, in the same way the internet sometimes seems to shrink our lives, the focus on it here seems to shrink the book slightly. It's telling that one of the novel's most poignant moments involves an unencrypted wifi signal: an episode that leaves the reader simultaneously touched and hollowed out. But there is a kindness that runs through Killen's writing: an empathy for society's lonely, and a respect for those who opt out of the public waterfall and suffer life's setbacks with quiet dignity.
