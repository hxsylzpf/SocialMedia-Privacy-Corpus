  "content": "Men Behaving Badly actor Neil Morrissey has received an apology and \"substantial\" damages from the Daily Mail over an article that falsely claimed he was banned from a French bar for \"rowdy, drunken\" behaviour. Morrissey sued Daily Mail publisher Associated Newspapers for libel over the article \u2013 headlined \"Homme behaving badly: TV star banned from bar near his idyllic French retreat after locals object to 'le binge drinking'\" \u2013 published in March 2010. The Daily Mail apologised to Morrissey on page 2 in its new corrections and clarifications column and on its website last October. However, the actor was not satisfied with the apology and applied for permission to make a statement in open court. In the statement read out at the high court in London on Thursday, Morrissey said he now felt \"fully vindicated\" over the claims. \"The Mail alleged that [a] poster had gone up and Mr Morrissey had been banned because his behaviour had made him unwelcome to the proprietors and staff as a bad influence who encouraged the antisocial and offensive binge drinking for which English settlers had become notorious and were resented by local French people,\" Peter Crawford, solicitor for Morrissey, told the judge Richard Parks QC. \"Those assertions were not true. Most significantly, Mr Morrissey had not been banned from the bar. Nor had he been drunken or rowdy in the bar.\" Crawford refused to reveal the exact amount of damages but confirmed it was a five-figure sum. The actor, who is currently playing Fagin in Oliver at Cardiff, was not in court but was said to be \"happy\" with the outcome. Morrissey complained about the article immediately after it was published on 19 March 2010. The actor was further aggrieved in October last year when the Mail published an apology on page 2, which Morrissey complained was \"not given sufficient prominence\" compared with the original story. A separate press statement issued by Morrissey on Thursday claimed that solicitors for the Daily Mail had \"indicated that the apology would be published on the top half of a right-hand page with a suitable heading to draw readers' attention to it\". \"Mr Morrissey made this statement in court today to bring the Mail's unreserved withdrawal of these allegations and its apology for publishing them to the attention of those who did not see the Mail's published apology,\" Crawford said. Morrissey's press advisers and lawyers had warned the newspaper that the story was false and defamatory before it was published, according to the statement. The Daily Mail acknowledged that the story was false and defamatory in August last year, and agreed to pay Morrissey \"substantial\" damages in November. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
