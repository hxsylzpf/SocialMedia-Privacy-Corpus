  "content": "The Earl and Countess of Wessex have acknowledged they must chose between their chosen careers in television and public relations or risk their Royal standing suffering, according to reports last night. The couple are said to be shocked by the intensity of the public backlash against them following revelations about the way they conduct their professional lives, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph. The decision follows a review two months by the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Luce, which concluded that it would be wrong to force members of the royal family to choose between their jobs and royal duties. In an incident three weeks ago, Prince Edward was accused of hypocrisy after his television company, Ardent Productions, ignored a request to leave St Andrews University despite a media agreement not to film Prince William. The controversy surrounding the prince has continued since April, when Sophie Wessex fell victim to an undercover sting operation by the News of the World newspaper in which a reporter posed as an Arab businessman interested in hiring her PR company. In an attempt to stop the details of the sting being published she agreed to an interview that ended up as a PR disaster with the headline \"My Edward's not gay\". It was followed by indiscreet remarks she had made to the \"fake sheikh\" about politicians and members of the royal family. Yesterday, the News of the World, published details of a letter it claimed was written by Edward six years ago, outlining his royal connections to a television producer. In the letter, on Ardent notepaper, he was alleged to have written: \"I think we can agree that I am the key to this project, whether it be production, finance, access or marketing. No private finance could even be considered without my name being attached to the proposal.\"",
