If the hashtags #red or #laceupsavelives are included in tweets they will turn the font red from its usual black. The US version of Google.com has a red Aids ribbon on its homepage and provides a link to various charities connected with fighting the disease. And Facebook has also encouraged members to join red and change their profile pictures to a red logo, and to share a video about the low cost of the treatments it takes to keep patients with HIV alive. During 2008 some 2.7 million people became newly infected with the virus and an estimated 2 million people died from Aids. According to figures of UNAIDS, estimated 33.4 million people live today worldwide with the HIV virus. The World Aids day is dedicated to raise awareness of the spread of HIV infection. It is a day when people who died of thedisease are commemorated. Since 1995 the President of the United States makes an official proclamation. What do you think, are these good or bad examples for today's five-minute-activism? Are they just empty online symbols of a good conscious while nothing will change. Or are they raising awareness?",
