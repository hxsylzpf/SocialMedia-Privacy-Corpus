  "content": "On my desk are five crisp \u00a320 notes, which I will award to the person who provides the best argument in favour of the database state and the attack on Britain's tradition of liberty and rights. Of course many will see the point. No one \u2013 with the possible exception of Tony Blair in a brief article for the Observer in 2006 \u2013 has coherently argued for the loss of privacy and the attack on rights and civil liberties in Britain. The project got under way without debate or any well-known advocates willing to come into the open and say what they believe. This has been difficult for civil libertarians because they are always answering the question why not? It is now time for us to ask why; for people like Jack Straw to formulate the argument they have so cleverly avoided making in parliament and the media and give us their positive reasons. The prize is a genuine one and I will award it by the end of the week to the person who expresses views that are most coherently opposed to my own position. Of course that argument must survive the points made by others on the thread, and if there is no good argument, I will keep my \u00a3100. But I will be as scrupulous as I can be on this. I genuinely hope to be sending off the money by the end of the week because I want to see that argument. Let's be having you. The Guardian is the media partner for The Convention on Modern Liberty, taking place on Saturday February 28 2009, which will debate these and other issues. You can buy tickets here",
