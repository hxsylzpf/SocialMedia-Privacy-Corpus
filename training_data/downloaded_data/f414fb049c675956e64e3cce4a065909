The conference, which is modelled on the successful Netroots Nation campaign in the US, will take place on Saturday and aims to link local campaigns with anti-tax avoidance groups, student protesters, unions, and anti-racism activists. The NetrootsUK conference has been organised by bloggers, backed by the TUC. Sunny Hundal, editor of the leftwing Liberal Conspiracy blog, is one of the organisers. He said: \"There is widespread concern over what the coalition is doing to our economy and in recent months we've seen an enormous buildup of energy from across the country to do something about it. But most of it has been in separate campaigns. What we're trying to do here is bring together veteran campaigners with new movements so we can learn from each other, and use social media to keep on top of what works and what doesn't. It's the first time we have seen anything like this on such a scale.\" Over the past year prominent campaigns have used social media sites to mobilise tens of thousands of people. In June, the Hope Not Hate campaign helped defeat the British National party in Barking, east London, by adapting online techniques from the US. Over the past few months, student protesters have taken to the streets in their tens of thousands to oppose the increase in tuition fees after organising on Facebook and Twitter; while in December the tax justice group UK Uncut closed down scores of high street stores accused of avoiding tax after organising a nationwide campaign via Twitter. Organisers from all three groups will be taking sessions on Saturday. Clifford Singer, campaign director of the anti-cuts website False Economy, said there were great advances in online activity in the UK in 2010 but that \"much of what is going on is still fragmented. To mobilise hundreds of thousands of people behind anti-cuts campaigns in 2011, we're going to need a more co-ordinated effort, learning good practice in each other's areas and helping the public see the links between issues and the case for the alternative.\" The conference on Saturday is being held at TUC headquarters in central London and will host workshops on hyper-local campaigns, new social media tools and how to transform online campaigns into offline action. Activists from the Netroots Nation, the annual meeting of progressive bloggers in the US, are travelling to the UK for the conference. John Woods, from the TUC, said there would also be a video message from the founder of the Daily Kos blog, Markos Moulitsas. Woods said: \"Obviously the situation here is very different to that in the US on many levels but we've been impressed by what Netroots Nation have achieved there in terms of mobilising and co-ordinating the progressive community online. We want people to leave the event on Saturday with a better practical knowledge about how to organise campaigns and work out strategies, but also with useful personal contacts for their activity and a sense they are part of a wider progressive movement.\"",
