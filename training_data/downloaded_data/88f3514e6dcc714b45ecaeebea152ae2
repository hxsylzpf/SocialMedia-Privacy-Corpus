  "content": "There's an ancient adage in the computer industry - it may have originated at Microsoft - which says: 'Always eat your own dog food'. What it means is that if you are writing software other people are going to use, then you must use it yourself. If you're going to ask other people to commit their time, data and perhaps even sanity to using your product, you should take the same risks yourself. An analogous injunction ought to apply to technology commentators: do not write about something unless you've used it yourself. It was in this spirit that I signed up to Facebook, the social networking service, some time ago. As it happens, I seem to have signed up just at the moment that Facebook reached its tipping point and switched into a phase of exponential growth. It's been fascinating watching from the inside as more and more of my colleagues and acquaintances sign up and confide their innermost thoughts to a few thousand close 'friends'. Exponential growth does strange things to people. In most cases this involves abandoning common sense and any sense of perspective. And the odd thing is that in the past decade we have acquired enough experience to enable us to know better. The point about the net is that exponential growth is a feature, not a bug: it's what the system was designed to enable. What should astonish us is not that some services (file-sharing, social networking, instant messaging, YouTube) spread so quickly, but that there are so few examples of wildfire growth. The infrastructure of the net is always there, waiting to disseminate the next 'viral' idea, with no questions asked. In fact, Facebook's recent phase of breakneck growth was predictable and due to two obvious steps taken by its owners. The first was - having already established a reputation as an elitist service (it was originally only available only to people with an email address at a university) - to open up membership to any Tom, Dick or Harriet. The second was to publish its Applications Programming Interface, the technical details about how to write programs that will work with Facebook. In just over two months, this has led to more than 1,000 applications being written for Facebook by independent developers. Some are clever and useful; many are irredeemably banal. Subscribers can add any of them to their profiles, which means they are visible to their 'friends', who may then be tempted to add the same app. And so it goes on. Facebook's expansion has already prompted some daft speculation about whether it will be the 'next Microsoft' or 'the next Google'. These feverish ravings were given an additional boost last Thursday when Facebook made its first acquisition - of a mysterious outfit called Parakey whose website is a model of bland understatement. 'Computers are frustrating,' it burbles. 'Creating documents, finding files, sharing information - why do everyday things still seem so tedious and counterintuitive? We hope that Parakey will make your life easier.' And that's it. So why the fuss? First, Parakey was co-founded by Blake Ross, the 20-year-old genius behind web browser Firefox. Secondly, something he said in an interview: Parakey will be 'a web operating system that can do everything an OS can do'. Translation: something that makes it easy to store your stuff and share it without getting into a tangle of photo, video and blogging tools and services such as MySpace and Facebook. And thirdly, the venture capital firm backing Parakey is Sequoia Capital, which has famously good judgment. We'll have to see if Ross and his backers can deliver on their promises. Meanwhile, let's consider Facebook morphing into the next Microsoft or Google. Microsoft still makes colossal amounts from its operating system and Microsoft Office monopolies and sits atop a mountain of cash. Google rakes in huge revenues from advertising, and also has a substantial cash pile. Facebook, as far as I can see, has no significant revenue streams - yet. It's still in the 'let's build first and monetise later' phase. This looks like the triumph of hope over experience. If I were Facebook's owners, I'd try and flog it to Yahoo while there's still time. Then I'll cancel my membership and move on to something more interesting. john.naughton@observer.co.uk",
