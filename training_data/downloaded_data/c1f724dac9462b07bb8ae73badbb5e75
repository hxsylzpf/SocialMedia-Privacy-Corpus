The report found that 36% of women and 24% of men, aged between 18-24, named what was identified as \"fun or weird\" content as one of their five most important types of news. \"In many countries, there has traditionally been an amusing item at the end of a news bulletin or included prominently within a print newspaper but, in the digital age, this type of news has blossomed,\" says the report. Typically, this kind of news is found on sites such as Buzzfeed and Upworthy, where such material is often presented in a range of popular formats, like animated gifs or games or \"listicles\". Enthusiasts then tend to share the material with each other. They arrive at such sites through mobile and social media and then, in turn, use the same to share the route to pass it on. By contrast, says the report, the websites hosted by popular British newspapers have mainly continued to satisfy interest for more straightforward entertainment and celebrity news, although they too have been experimenting with new formats. Evidently, fun and weird content is particularly popular with Japanese (28%), French (22%), and Italians (21%) and is mainly driven by young men and women. Entertainment and celebrity news is skewed heavily towards 18\u201335-year-old women. Source: RISJ",
