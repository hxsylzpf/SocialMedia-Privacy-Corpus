  "content": "Wall Street opened in much the same way as Europe, with traders seemingly unconvinced, yet curious, with the G8 leaders declaration they want Greece to stay in the eurozone. After suffering from its worst weekly decline for a year, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 29.71 points, or 0.24%, to 12,399.09. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index added 2.73 points to 1,297.95. The biggest excitement stateside came on the Nasdaq, where its newest listed company Facebook continued to falter following the razzmatazz of its IPO on Friday. Shares plunged more than 13% to $33.12 in early trading. By comparison, rival social network LinkedIn saw its shares jump 109% after its IPO. The suggestion goes that Facebook's brokers (Morgan Stanley et al) bid to keep the price from dropping below $38 but the high-priced bidding could not be sustained. The Facebook floatation wasn't helped by the 30 minute glitch, which delayed the start of trading in the company on Friday. The shambles led to Nasdaq's chief executive Bob Greifeld admitting yesterday he was \"embarrassed\" by the stock exchange's problems. Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey, summed up the mood among traders. He said: \"It was just a poorly done deal and it just so happens to be the biggest deal ever for Nasdaq and they pooched it, that's the bottom line here.\" Elsewhere, rival Yahoo saw its shares drop 1% to $15.28 after rising in premarket trading. The rises were on the back of Chinese internet entrepreneur Jack Ma buying back up to half of the 40% stake in his Alibaba Group from Yahoo for $7.1bn. It is welcome news for Yahoo, which has had its own problems of late, including the resignation of CEO Scott Thompson after he admitted he lied on his CV. The former boss also stepped down from the board of data-analysis provider Splunk today, completing a miserable few weeks for Thompson \u2013 he also left the board of another technology firm F5 Networks last week.",
