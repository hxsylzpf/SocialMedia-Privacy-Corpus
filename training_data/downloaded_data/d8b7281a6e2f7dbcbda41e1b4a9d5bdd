  "content": "If we all make enough of a fuss about how much of an improvement the new white beta version of Seesmic is, perhaps chief executive Loic Le Meur might a) recover slightly from the battering he took over Le Web last week and b) ditch the hard to read white text on black for good. It was distinctive, true, but the balance has to fall in favour of usablity, and that racoon icon will keep the site distinctive enough. Le Meur said in the introduction that he wants as much feedback as possible; it's an entirely new CMS and has ditched Flash (other than in the player itself) to make the site lighter and faster - that was the number one request from the community. \"Many users didn't like the black interface - so here's a white one. Much more classic,\" he said. But the other good news is that it lights your face in the dark, so that's good for Seesmicking.\" Work has been done to reduce the number of clicks for each process, enable sending to multiple friends and user and video search. There are now RSS and Atom feeds of channels, thumbnail previews of videos and an auto-refreshing timeline. YouTube posting and language filters are on the way. Do be careful if you start experimenting with Seesmic though. It's about as addictive as crack.",
