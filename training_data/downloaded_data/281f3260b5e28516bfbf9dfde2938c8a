The fury comes after John Graham Kerlen, who tweets under the name @Sir_Olly_C, was found guilty on 13 April of an offence contrary to section 127(1) of the Communications Act 2003, which states: (1) A person is guilty of an offence if he: (a) sends by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character; or (b) causes any such message or matter to be so sent. A hashtag, #freethebexleyone, has already been created despite the fact that no sentence has yet been passed, and the suggestion is that to simply call someone a cunt is now a criminal offence. Of course, as is so often the case, the story is a little more complex. Kerlen, who apparently has a long-running battle raging with Bexley council, sent two tweets. The first, to which a picture of the house of a Bexley councillor was attached, said: \"Which cunt lives in a house like this. Answers on a postcard to #bexleycouncil.\" The second said: \"It's silly posting a picture of a house on Twitter without an address, that will come later. Please feel free to post actual shit.\" To successfully prosecute, the lawyers must demonstrate that a message of the proscribed character by the defined means was sent \u2013 that is, a message that was grossly offensive and/or of an indecent character and/or of an obscene character and/or of a menacing character, was sent over a public communications network. One would hope that we can all agree that Twitter is a public communications network, and screenshots show that the tweets were sent \u2013 it is understood that Kerlen has never disputed sending them. The question then is, were those tweets of the proscribed character? Are they grossly offensive, indecent in character, of an obscene character, or of a menacing character? And who is the arbiter of that? The test is that of the \"reasonable person\". Would a reasonable person find the proscribed character in those tweets? I consider myself to be a reasonable person, and I am sure you consider yourself to be. My personal thoughts are yes, grossly offensive, no to both indecent and obscene character, and yes to menacing. I have asked the Crown Prosecution Service which the judge decided the tweets to be, and will provide that in the comments once I have an answer. However, that is not the only hurdle the prosecution must jump. The House of Lords, in the case of DPP v Collins, determined that the prosecution must also prove that the person sending the messages intended his words to be offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing to those to whom they related or be aware that they may be taken to be so. Did Kerlen intend his words to be these things, or was he aware that they may be taken to be so? Unfortunately, Kerlen declined to give evidence, so there is nothing from him directly as to his intentions. It seems therefore that the prosecution will have asked the court to infer that Kerlen intended his words to be offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing, or infer that he would be aware that his words could be taken as so. Is that reasonable? I would suggest yes, it would be reasonable to infer that a person would be aware that words of the above nature could be taken as offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing, especially in the context of the history between the two. As for freedom of expression, that has been considered in the context of this offence before. Lord Bingham had this to say on the matter: \"Section 127(1)(a) does of course interfere with a person's right to freedom of expression. But it is a restriction clearly prescribed by statute. It is directed to a legitimate objective, preventing the use of a public electronic communications network for attacking the reputations and rights of others. It goes no further than is necessary in a democratic society to achieve that end.\" Is freedom of speech in need of CPR, the law having been misapplied, or is this a case of someone going a step too far, and finding themselves rightly before the beak? \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",
