  "content": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho believes that games of football begin in the pre-match press conference. Of course he does. But while Mourinho is orchestrating victories from the media room and the dugout, he is missing out on the other mind games going on behind the scenes during football matches: the great social media battle. Mourinho thinks he can influence football results from the sidelines, but he has not yet harnessed the power of Twitter. Of course, these things can backfire, as Manchester City learned this week. In the build-up to their match against Roma, the person behind City's official account pointed out that Francesco Totti, a player who has scored 235 goals for the club, was yet to score in England. That record did not last long. Totti scored Roma's equaliser on the night and later credited City for inspiring him. \"City's tweet? It really brought me luck,\" he said after the match. \"It was a beautiful goal and a good performance. I really wanted to score as soon as possible as I had not found the back of the net this season.\" You only have to look at the responses to the tweet from the club's fans to see that not everyone was amused. So we'd like to hear from you about your club's Twitter accounts: do you follow, and what do you make of their performance online? Manchester City FC lay out the welcome mat AS Roma respond Elsewhere, some welcome self-deprecation from Hyde FC All-out fandom from Charlton FC Childish simplicity from Manchester United FC 'Banter' from Reading and Bolton Wanderers Borussia Dortmund help out a lost music fan Do you follow your club and do you rate their performance?",
