  "content": "At first they ridicule you. Then they start using your app for certain things. Then you raise VC funding. That's the cycle of birth for new communication apps like Yo! and Snapchat and new content formats like emoji and internet memes. I remember when people would make fun of Snapchat as a \"sexting app\". I did too, before I understood it. Before that, people made fun of Facebook. Before that, SMS. But as we've seen over and over again, dismissing new communication platforms comes with an opportunity cost for brands, businesses, and consumers. What used to be a simpler world of emails, phone calls, and SMS has led to dozens of new ways to communicate with each other. The iPhone and iPad have kicked off a Cambrian explosion of communication methods that divide and sub-divide the human need to express ourselves in ever more nuanced ways. So what can be said in an emoji that can't be said in a phone call? Lots, actually. The communications format itself provides context and colours the meaning of the message. Marshall McLuhan may have coined the phrase \"the medium is the message\", but let me tell you that in today's world where every device can do everything \"the format is the message\". Each communication format functions like a dialect, sending an undercurrent of messages along with the specific content being expressed. Almost everything we say can be said via a phone call, or an email, but we all have our preferences in sending certain messages via certain platforms. New communications apps and formats are finding a natural niche in a rich spectrum of human expression. Are you sending an angry message to someone? Avoid memes (which can take the sting out of criticism) and try sending an ALL CAPS EMAIL or leave a nasty voicemail. Want to tell someone you are thinking of them in a non-serious, platonic, but kinda flirty way? Emoji will do. Want to engage your random Twitter followers without the need to carry on a conversation? Tweet your Yo! info. It is actually the constraints within an app that reveal the potential for a new form of expression. Take Yo! for an example. Pretty much the only thing you can do in Yo! is to send a message that says \"Yo!\" to one or more users. That's all you can do. This is the point at which you, the reader, throw your hands up in the air and say things like: \"These Silicon Valley idiots have lost their minds!\" Sorry. Did I tell you that the Yo! app has millions of users and raised venture funding? I'll wait until you're done with your expletive-laden rant. But when you start to peel back the layers, there's more to the app than just \"Yo!-ing\" people. The next time you walk down the street and say \"Hello\" and walk past a stranger, or ask \"How are you doing?\" without expecting an answer, you're live-acting the function of the Yo! app. The adoption of these internet-dialects are driven by millennials, who are looking for a wide range of communication methods that reflect their needs. While the previous generation was defined by their ability (or lack thereof) to nuance the messaging in an email \u2013 and the generation before that in the art of a letter \u2013 this generation is mastering the art of nuancing using content formats aided by the explosion of apps. What used to be said in words is now said in the format of the message itself. For startups, this represents a huge opportunity to unseat open systems and provide a specific benefit. Systems that try to do everything will lose out. Existing formats like letters, emails, and SMS are finding smaller but more important niches. And if you're still decrying the end of human civilisation as we know it, please, save your judgement; your mum never approved of you making mix tapes anyway. Overall, the mass adoption of apps and formats will increase the overall volume of communication. And like Facebook, as each communication format gains adoption, it will eventually spread to a wider and older audience, even if they aren't quite adept at using it. If brands and business are to remain relevant in communicating with its customers, they will have to not only adopt these new formats, but to understand how to use the correct vernacular of each format. Messages that are native to the communication platform will reach the biggest audience with the least friction. Shoe-horning old messages into new platforms will not be successful.
