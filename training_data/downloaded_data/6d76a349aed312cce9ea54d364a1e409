  "content": "Jamie Theakston and Jeff Brazier, the former partner of Jade Goody, are among the latest public figures to sue News International over alleged phone hacking by the News of the World. Theakston, Brazier, the journalist Ted Hynds and Colin Stagg, the man who was wrongly accused of the 1992 murder of Rachel Nickell, have started legal action against Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper group. Each of their claims against News Group Newspapers, the News International subsidiary that published the now defunct News of the World, relate to allegations of voicemail interception. The new civil actions were revealed on Thursday as it emerged that News International has settled a claim for phone hacking damages by Charlotte Church. The singer's case was due to go to trial in the high court on Monday. Theakston and Brazier have been the subject of intense media interest in the past decade. Both men have presented reality TV shows and Brazier fathered two children in a well-publicised relationship with the Big Brother contestant Jade Goody, who died aged 27 after a battle with cervical cancer in 2009. The lawyer for Stagg and Hynds confirmed to MediaGuardian that he was \"actively pursuing\" legal action against News International. Stagg was wrongly suspected of the murder of Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common in 1992. He said in July last year that he \"felt sick and angry\" after he was was told by the Metropolitan police that he was targeted by the News of the World. Hynds, an investigative journalist, wrote a book about Stagg's struggle for justice, called Pariah: Colin Stagg, published in 2007. He has also been told by the Met that he was a phone-hacking target. It emerged on Wednesday that Cherie Blair, the wife of the former prime minister, is also suing Murdoch's UK newspaper group over alleged phone hacking. Each of the fresh claims \u2013 except that of Blair \u2013 name News Group Newspapers as the sole defendant. News International settled 37 civil actions in January \u2013 including high-profile actions brought by the actor Jude Law and the son of serial killer Harold Shipman \u2013 in a bid to prevent them from going to trial, and paid out to another 21 victims of phone hacking earlier this month. However, News International faces at least 50 fresh civil actions. Others who have already filed claims include footballer Peter Crouch, singer James Blunt and Ukip leader Nigel Farage. Michael Silverleaf QC, counsel for News Group Newspapers, told the high court on Thursday that the publisher was attempting to settle \"quite a few more\" cases against it over alleged voicemail interception. News International had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
