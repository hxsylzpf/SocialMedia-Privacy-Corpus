  "content": "Welcome to Social TV, our weekly blog in which we dissect how Twitter has been watching television over the past seven days, using Second Sync's analytical tools and the wisdom of will.i.am's tweets. The Voice live final Little surprise that The Voice (BBC1, Saturday) topped the leaderboard this week, but it is notable that it wasn't much bigger on Twitter than last week's Big Brother live launch, with The Voice earning just 37,943 additional tweets. That's for a show with 7.2 million viewers, compared to the BB launch's 1.99 million. The tweeting pattern followed a steady incline, naturally peaking during the announcement of the winner and staying high for subsequent shock and outrage. But the real highlight was judge will.i.am's commentary. He was responsible for eight of the 10 most RT-ed tweets during transmission (Danny O'Donoghue got one, as did Cheryl Cole). And he wasn't happy about the result. \"@pambelaarrr: Think I will apply for the voice auditions just so I can meet Will\" dont \u2014 will.i.am (@iamwill) June 22, 2013 You should feel the audiences vibration in the room tonigh after the publics vote...its #unexplainable...so sad...#perplexed \u2014 will.i.am (@iamwill) June 22, 2013 #Discombobulated that @Mrmatthenry didn't get enough votes and he's going home...please vote for @leahmcfallmusic she isn't safe yet...#help \u2014 will.i.am (@iamwill) June 22, 2013 #unexplainable Back to reality Made In Chelsea (E4, Monday) beat The Only Way is Essex (ITV2, Sunday and Wednesday) again this week, peaking at 10.26pm with a strong outpouring of sympathy for Andy. MiC's Lucy Watson got 3,485 RTs (the most of the night) for noting just how sad she was. That just broke my heart #madeinchelsea \u2014 Lucy Watson (@imLucyWatson) June 17, 2013 As always I am using tweets to ascertain exactly what happened, so here goes: Louise was the Spencer of this week's episode and has done something terrible to Poor Andy which may or may not have involved One Direction. #sosad Meanwhile, in the world of Towie, Ricky has been cheating on Jess, but Jess knew all along (#instinct), but Ricky is really sorry and he will make it up to her. I knew all along #instinct \u2014 Jessica Wright (@MissJessWright_) June 23, 2013 So very sorry for letting Jess and Soo many people down. I will do all I can to make it up to Jess and prove to her how much I love her! \u2014 RickyRayment (@RickyRayment) June 19, 2013 An average of 1,164 people tweeted about this per minute, going up to 2,941 when it hit the big drama. For both shows, the gender split remains heavily weighted towards female viewers: 73%/27% for MiC; 71%/29% for Towie. The Valleys (MTV, Tuesday) was snapping at their heels this week, with a peak of interest in Nicole's departure, and a lot of people pointing out that it isn't as good as Geordie Shore. Two of the most retweeted tweets came from Nicole saying she didn't mind leaving: all I can say is that's not the end youv seen off me! had a amazin time with amazin ppl! this is just the beginning on Nicole's new chapter! \u2014 Nicole Morris (@NicoleValleys) June 18, 2013 Then asking if she could come back: Yay #bringbacknicole is trendin world wide!!! This means 1 things @MTVTheValleys bring me back!!!!!! \u2014 Nicole Morris (@NicoleValleys) June 18, 2013 #perplexed Question Time It was supposed to be the QT (BBC1, Thursday) of the year, with a panel including Russell Brand, BoJo and Melanie Phillips, surely ripe for combustion. Anticipation, for Brand in particular, was high as the proceedings began, and twitter peaks emerged during Brand's takedown of bankers, Phillips calling the audience \"ignorant\" during her call to neutralise Iran, and Johnson on London housing issues. Most retweeted of the night was Mehdi Hasan on Phillips' views: Melanie Phillips, expert on Shia Islam. Almost as much an expert on Shia Islam as she is on MMR and climate change. #bbcqt \u2014 Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) June 20, 2013 People were still keen to talk about the show after it had finished, with a long tail of discussion following transmission, and in fact, it turns out that the star of the night may well have been the \"rowdy\" audience, who heckled more than usual, much to twitter's approval. Tweeters were 66% male, 34% female. Off the grid There was no drama or comedy in the top 10 at all this week, and the only non-reality entrants were Question Time and the Zac Efron film 17 Again (Sunday, C4). So I looked at the stats for recent high-profile dramas to see how they were performing. The White Queen (Sunday, BBC1) was half as tweeted-about for its second episode \u2013 5,892 tweets compared to 11,109 for its debut. The Returned (Sunday, Channel 4) is holding steady with a respectable 5,034 tweets, and a huge peak for the last five minutes of the episode (well, cats are always big on the internet), meaning Victor was on a lot of people's minds as they went to sleep. Brrr. But The Americans (Saturday, ITV), has hardly anyone talking about it \u2013 just 551 mentions this week. #discombobulated",
