Science and telecoms specialists Debaeque Venture Capital and technology research firm Sequel R&amp;D have invested in MyStrands, a four-year-old company currently focused on developing and researching recommendation tools around music. A spokesperson for MyStrands said the site would also be investing in resources to allow the company to begin marketing its recommendation tools. \"The technology is content agnostic, which means it is able to recommend any type of content, not just music,\" said Gabriel Aldamiz-Echevarria, vice-president of communications for MyStrands. \"It should also be cross-platform. We live in a world of convergence so this is key for us. \"We believe that we will soon access the entertainment world through a mobile device and a mobile world will require personalisation.\" The company was founded by science entrepreneur, Francisco Martin, and has 30 staff in the US and 20 in Barcelona. Funding talks were led by Antonio Asensiuo, the chief executive of one of Spain's largest media companies, Grupo Zeta. He said recommendation technologies could become \"the standard for content personalisation on the internet\", allowing advertisers and content companies to deliver targeted, customised services. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
