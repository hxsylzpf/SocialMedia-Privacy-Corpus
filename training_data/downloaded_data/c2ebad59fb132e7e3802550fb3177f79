Ms Middleton's lawyers, Harbottle &amp; Lewis, have written to the editors of national newspapers and magazines setting out a number of issues they are unhappy with regarding press coverage of the 23-year-old's private life. The lawyers have asked news organisations not to publish material regarding Ms Middleton's private life. They also say the behaviour of some photographers amounts to a breach of the Press Complaints Commission code and ask editors to uphold the PCC rules. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
