  "content": "Australian singer Rob Mills has apologised for posting a homophobic image to social media after the weekend's AFL grand final. The Hawthorn supporter celebrated his club's win on Saturday by posting an image to Instagram depicting a Lego figurine in the team's brown-and-gold colours bending over another in Sydney's red-and-white. He hashtagged the image, #hilarious #criticssaidwhaaaaaat #b2b and #alwayshawthorn. The post met with a wave of criticism on Twitter. The former Australian Idol contestant, who has previously said he supports gay marriage, said he apologised \"unreservedly\" for posting the \"immature and offensive\" photo. \"In the excitement of celebrating the Hawks' grand final win, I didn't think about the homophobic implications of the image,\" he said. \"This incident probably shows how entrenched inadvertent homophobia is in our culture. \"As a long-time supporter of the rights of Australia's gay community, it's not good enough and I'm ashamed if I have contributed to it, even in a small way.\"",
