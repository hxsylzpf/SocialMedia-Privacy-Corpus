  "content": "The Daily Express has been forced to publish a prominent apology to Robbie Williams after wrongly alleging that the pop singer was addicted to gambling and had lost large sums at cards. The paper is also making a payment to a charity of Williams' choice and paying his legal costs over the false allegations, which appeared in a story on February 10 under the headline \"Robbie's new vice\". \"We are happy to put the record straight and make clear that Robbie is not addicted to gambling in any form and has not lost substantial amounts of money as claimed,\" the Express said today. \"He only gambles for small stakes and his losses amount to no more than \u00a32,000 over the last 18 months,\" it added. \"We apologise for any distress our article has caused Robbie.\" The false allegations originated from a fantasist who had never met the singer and first appeared as a splash in the News of the World by writer Lee Harpin. The Sunday tabloid is still working out a settlement with the star. The Express' arch-rival, the Daily Mail, was also forced to print an apology earlier this month after following up the News of the World story in a diary column.",
