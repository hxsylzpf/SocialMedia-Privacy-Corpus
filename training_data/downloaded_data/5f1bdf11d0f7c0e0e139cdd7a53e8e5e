  "content": "For more than 56 years the charity I work for, Bloodwise, has been working to beat blood cancer, the third most fatal form of cancer. In our work, we have had to constantly evolve and adapt to meet the ever-changing needs of our supporters and patients. Unsurprisingly, the rise of digital channels has been transformational for us, from the delivery of patient information online to communicating with supporters via social media. However, as the importance of digital grew, we knew we needed to use data and insight to understand our online audiences better and measure our performance. So with the help of social media analytics tool Crimson Hexagon and its digital library of more than 850bn unstructured social media posts, we were able to gain far greater insight into our supporters. We first used this service for our awareness campaign during Blood Cancer Awareness Month. It highlighted the fact that there are 137 different types of blood cancer. It combined outdoor and online advertising, social media, local and corporate activity and a press campaign. Using Crimson Hexagon, we analysed social media conversations about the campaign. We found out that supporters who have experience of blood cancer were talking about specific types of the disease rather than the umbrella term. We also realised how much of an impact our celebrity supporters had when discussing the campaign on social media. These insights not only helped to measure the reach of our campaign but also to understand how the campaign was being talked about. The findings have guided our planning for future marketing campaigns. We are now able to regularly measure the volume of conversations about Bloodwise online and the topics and themes being talked about \u2013 awareness, fundraising, patient stories and research breakthroughs. Previously, our focus was measuring our own campaigns and outputs, but now we plan to expand its use into cause-related activities. Collectively blood cancers are the fifth most common type of cancer, but they are not widely understood, they have different names, symptoms and challenges. Raising awareness of individual conditions such as leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma is vital, but so is raising awareness of blood cancer as a whole. Using social data we can now track long-term trends in the use of the term blood cancer across different channels such as social media and news sites, which allows us to see if we can measure an increase in its use. Back in May it was World Blood Cancer Day and through the social tracking monitors we set up, we were able to see that there was a 40-fold increase in people mentioning blood cancer on Twitter compared with the daily average. Changing public awareness of blood cancer won't happen overnight, but using this data we can now measure the reach of work to raise awareness in an area that we would not previously have been able to. We are still in the early stages of using social data to provide supporter insights, but it has already proven to be an invaluable asset in measuring our awareness campaign. After all, the better we understand supporters' and patients' needs the more effective we can be at meeting them. This article was amended on 3 August 2016. The article previously stated that Crimson Hexagon's database contained 1bn unstructured social media posts \u2013 the actual figure is 850bn.
