  "content": "Angus Deayton's complaint about a Mirror story - which reported his \"prima donna\" demands on a trip to Paris - has been thrown out by press watchdogs. The press complaints commission said it could \"not criticise\" the paper because there was evidence the TV star had caused considerable inconvenience to one of those involved in organising his travel arrangements. Under the headline \"which star has spoiled Mel's Lark de triomphe?\" the paper reported how the \"prima donna\" presenter of Have I Got News For You? made \"ridiculous\" VIP travel demands The piece appeared on the Mirror's 3am celebrity gossip page on July 4 last year. It concerned Deayton's invitation to a Paris celebration held by Talkback's bosses, Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones, to celebrate the \u00a362m sale of the production company to Pearson. It said Deayton insisted, at the last minute, on travelling first class on Eurostar, alone, in the corner and facing the direction of travel. The Mirror quoted the Talkback worker, Jacey Lamerton, as saying Deayton's special requirements caused her untold stress. It also accused Deayton of staying in a separate hotel to \"avoid the hoi polloi\". Deayton complained to the PCC and his lawyers subsequently demanded the Mirror publish an apology and desist from repeating the allegations. But the PCC found the Mirror did not breach its code. In its ruling, the PCC said: \"...regardless of whether the complainant was entitled to ask for the seat, it was clear from the statement by Mrs Lamerton that she had felt considerably inconvenienced by the lastminute travel arrangement, which had included - as stated in your newspaper - specificying which seat the complainant was to travel in.\" It added: \"In the circumstances, the commission should not criticise your newspaper.\" MediaGuardian.co.uk special report Press and privacy",
