Our lives are becoming public and our relationships permanent online. Though that frightens some self-proclaimed privacy advocates, I say this new publicness is likely to be a good thing. Living in public could keep us closer as people, and might even make us more civil and tolerant. Young people today need never lose track of their friends, as I have with most of mine. That's not only because they leave bits of themselves online that are findable via Google, but also because they will remain linked in ever-expanding social networks, such as Facebook. Like everyone today - come on, admit it - I have Googled old friends and, yes, old girlfriends. But at my age, that's not very fruitful, since few of my contemporaries have left visible Google shadows. I've even tried to leave shadows for these lost pals, putting their names in blog posts in the hopes that they might search for themselves - admit it, you've done that, too - and we'd connect. These \"Google calls\" haven't worked. But recently my high-school girlfriend did find me via a Google search on my name. Since my life is an open blog, my Google shadow is long. Without Google, we would never have reconnected and reminisced. But for today's young people, keeping in touch won't be so difficult. They are all Google-able and will have threads permanently connecting them in Facebook or whatever follows. According to the marketing firm Alloy, 96% of teens and tweens use social networks; they are now universal. And I think this means that they will maintain friendships longer in life. Which, in turn, could lead to richer friendships. No longer can you escape relationships when you move on; you will be tied to your past - and to the consequences of your actions. I hope this could make us better friends. But because you can't escape your past, this also means that you could do one stupid thing in life, forever memorialised in Google, and you are embarrassed in perpetuity. The Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt, jokes that we all should be able to change our names and start fresh at age 21. But I think we'll be protected by mutually assured humiliation: we will all have our moments of youthful indiscretion and so we will have to forgive others' if we want them to ignore ours. So you inhaled - so did I, what of it? That will be the golden rule of the social internet. And I say that could make us more tolerant. There are other benefits to living life in public and, as a result, collaboratively. When the photo site Flickr began, its co-founder Caterina Fake said it made the fateful and fortunate decision to \"default to public\". Other photo services assumed we would want our images to be private. But by going public and tagging photos in Flickr, we could now find others' pictures and even find friends through them. Sharing photos became a social act. And encouraging social acts would seem to be a social good. Young people have a different view of privacy and publicness because they realise you can't make connections with people unless you reveal something of yourself: you won't find fellow skiers unless you tell the world that you, too, ski. Privacy advocates would be appalled that I have revealed my most private information on my blog: my health data. But by writing about the heart condition I share with Tony Blair, fibrillation, I have found advice and support from others. Publicness has its benefits. Facebook has made important refinements in the idea of publicness on the internet by requiring real identity - not the anonymity and pseudonymity that dominate so much of the web - and by enabling us to control that identity and the communities around us. We decide how public we want to be. Doc Searls, a leading blogger, has argued that the real issue around privacy is our ability to exercise control over our own data, choosing whether to restrict or share it. That control will be a key issue in Facebook's implementation of its next-generation advertising, which associates brands not with content but with customers. That linking of products and people could have a fundamental impact on marketing and media, just as I believe that Facebook - or Google's Open Social, or the combination of the two - could have as fundamental an impact on society as Google has. This is why I do not think Microsoft's investment in and $15bn valuation of Facebook is insane. With 50 million active users, that's a lifetime value of $300 per friend - and those friendships will have long lives. \u00b7 Jeff Jarvis is a journalism professor at the City University of New York who blogs at buzzmachine.com",
