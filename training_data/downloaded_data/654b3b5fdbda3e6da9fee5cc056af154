  "content": "At long last, we have an official title for JJ Abram's Star Wars sequel: The Force Awakens. Which is OK, but we were hoping for something a little more, well, forceful. We'll hold our final judgment until the film's release next year, but that doesn't mean Twitter will show that kind of restraint. Judging by the reaction, this was not the title people were looking for. Fans proposed a few alternate names, often using the hashtag #RejectedStarWarsTitles. Some were so adamant they even took the effort to Photoshop their grievances. We collected some more of our favorites below. Want to take a stab at it? Tell us your rejected Star Wars title in the comments.",
