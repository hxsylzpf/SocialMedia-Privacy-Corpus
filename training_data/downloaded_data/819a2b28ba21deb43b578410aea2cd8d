  "content": "Australian Capital Territory police say they are baffled as to how an \"untoward\" tweet of a pornographic image was retweeted from their official account in what is proving to be a social media disaster for the force. The original tweet by @KSanders0902 showed full-frontal nudity with the hashtag #ThonglessThursday. On Wednesday afternoon, ACT police thanked Twitter users for bringing the \"untoward\" tweet to its attention, saying it was \"not sure how it got on our page\". The force deleted previously favourited tweets from @KSanders0902, whose account no longer exists. The mistake caused a flurry of reaction on Twitter. A representative of the force said the matter was now closed but it would put out a statement at a later time if need be. He said the on-call media representative for the agency was out of the office on Wednesday afternoon.",
