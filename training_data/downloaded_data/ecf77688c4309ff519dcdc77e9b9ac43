  "content": "Human rights commissioner Tim Wilson has described comments by immigration minister Scott Morrison, which identified the name, location and date of a document containing the personal information of almost 10,000 people in immigration detention, as \"undesirable\". On Wednesday Guardian Australia revealed that the personal information of almost 10,000 people in detention \u2013 including names, nationalities, dates of birth and ID numbers \u2013 had been publicly accessible on the department's website. The minister subsequently revealed the location of the file in releases and interviews, potentially alerting people who had not realised they had downloaded the data to its existence. \"It would seem to be undesirable that the immigration minister has made that information public, which may confirm to people what the \u2026 information [was] that was publically available,\" Wilson told Guardian Australia. In a response to multiple questions about the breach, including why the minister had disclosed more details on the file, a spokeswoman for Morrison said: \"The department is currently examining the impact of this incident. Further decisions will be made in due course.\" The newly appointed commissioner described the initial data breach as \"very serious\" and welcomed the privacy commissioner's investigation into the incident. \"It's concerning that it wasn't identified earlier, particularly when we're dealing with such sensitive information,\" Wilson said. \"There are two parts to it,\" he said. \"What it does to the application for asylum and those seeking it, but there's also a much bigger issue around privacy within the department of immigration, that's why I'll be waiting to see what the privacy commissioner conclusion comes up with. \"Surely we'd all hope that the information hasn't been accessed by many people and that we wouldn't want to see a situation where any person that is seeking an asylum application is put at risk as a consequence of this leak.\" Wilson's comment's follow those of prime minister Tony Abbott, who said the breach \"was an error. It was wrong. It shouldn't have happened\" and Morrison who described it as an \"unacceptable incident\". On Thursday the Australian Privacy Foundation described Morrison's comments revealing the name, location and date of the document as a \"horrible mistake\". The data breach raises serious questions about whether those asylum seekers named in the document could have their case for asylum affected. Katie Wrigley, a principal solicitor at the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, said the minister could use his powers to grant visas to the asylum seekers identified in the release. \"The minister could exercise his discretion to grant a visa. That could include people who have been to the Refugee Review Tribunal or people in detention, and he could exercise his powers to grant them visas.\" Wrigley also said she was concerned that the department had not provided any information about whether their client's information had been released in the breach. \"We've received no information from the department about any breaches or any disclosure of information, which I find surprising given we have a large number of asylum seeker clients. \"We're concerned that we haven't been told about the potential disclosures, because it may affect their cases. Ordinarily a person would be told if their information had been accidentally disclosed to any third party.\" The immigration department has not responded to questions about whether asylum seekers would be notified if their personal information was released.",
