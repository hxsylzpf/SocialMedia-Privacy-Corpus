  "content": "More on the formalisation of the web as a backchannel for TV - this time from ITV's footie coverage. ITV.com will be running a Twitterfall app during the FA Cup final between Everton and Chelsea from 1pm tomorrow (with moderation of the tweets that appear, I should add) as well as a widget made by thruSITES which will show which players are attracting the most discussion. Thirdly, hype-tastic iPhone audio tool AudioBoo will be integrated, so any relevant commentary from fans can be submitted to the ITV site. ITV has already run experiments with Twitter, notably during Primeval where writer James Moran posted during an episode. Tapping the conversation during a major football match is a canny move commercially if only in terms of bring traffic to the site, though what kind of appetite fans have for these tools during the match (when they may well be in the pub) remains to be seen. Remember - don't drink and tweet. Perhaps more interestingly, ITV is using one of AudioBoo's first paid-for features. Though the initial AudioBoo tool is free, the 'magic tags' allow premium, paying users to tag up all the relevant AudioBoo posts they want to create a bespoke RSS feed. That's how ITV is selecting FA Cup-related AudioBoos.",
