  "content": "Naomi Campbell waived her right to keep her medical details private by \"relentlessly invading her own privacy\", the editor of the Mirror, Piers Morgan, claimed today. Under cross-examination today by Campbell's lawyer, Andrew Caldecott, Morgan defended the Mirror against claims that an article it had published had intruded on Campbell's privacy. \"If you voluntarily enter Hannibal Lecter's cave, sooner or later you're going to get nibbled on the back of the neck,\" said Morgan. \"Celebrities who regularly breach their own privacy in the way Naomi Campbell has done, I'm afraid abrogate the right to privacy in the way someone who has not chosen that path has done.\" Morgan said Campbell had discussed at length the break up of her relationship with U2 bassist Adam Clayton, including allegations that he had been involved with prostitutes. Morgan described it as \"surely one of the most intimate accounts of a relationship you could ever hope to read. \"Celebrities who talk publicly and often for commercial gain cannot turn round and bleat privacy,\" he said. Morgan drew a distinction between photos of Campbell emerging from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting and snatched photos of Lady Victoria Spencer in a clinic published by the News of the World while he was editor. This story earned him a very public rebuke from the press complaints commission. Moreover it also earned him a public stripping down by Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the paper. Morgan admitted that these photographs had been a \"mistake\" He added: \"After the track record I've had in this area it would be ridiculous if I didn't take extreme care.\"",
