We also vet and recommend hotels that we feel are safe, stylish and comfortable for female business travelers.\" \u2022 How does that work? \"Ladies register and set up a fully secure profile- and are telephone vetted to make sure no opportunistic men slip in.\" \u2022 How do you make money? \"Advertising and affiliate marketing deals.\" \u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months? \"Maiden-voyage.com is still in soft launch with over 500 visitors per month but a target of 5000 per month and 200 per month actively networking in the first year.\" \u2022 What's your background? \"Technology and web across all kinds of industries including travel and media. I've worked in the UK, across Europe and in Australia.\" \u2022 How are personalisation and recommendation part of your business? \"The safety of our users and networking opportunities are at the core of business, so if other women enjoy using the service they will recommend it.\" \u2022 Name your closest competitors \"Ladiesaway.com operate in a similar fashion, and the big hotel aggregators are the biggest threat but they haven't thought of it yet.\" \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? \"Clinching a sponsor.\" \u2022 How will you survive the second dot com crash? \"Minimise risk and avoid debt.\" \u2022 And how do you plan to survive the financial crisis? \"Trade favours, and not paying others to do what I can learn to do myself.\" \u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch? \"Marc Holmes at Microsoft - I've not taken to stalking him yet.\" \u2022 Who's your mentor? \"I'm in the market for one... Mark?\" \u2022 What's the most important piece of software or web tool that you use each day? \"Adobe Contribute for quick fast site updates.\" \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? \"For maiden-voyage.com to be an on and offline brand, hotels working towards our accreditation and learning how to cater fully for female business traveler.
