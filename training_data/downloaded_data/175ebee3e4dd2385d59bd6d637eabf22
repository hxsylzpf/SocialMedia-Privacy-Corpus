  "content": "Age: Began with the first online browser \u2013 Tim Berners-Lee's WorldWideWeb \u2013 in 1991. Appearance: The internet. What's browsing? That's the technical term for visiting websites. OK. So what's your \"browsing history\"? That's a list of every website you have ever visited. Including the naughty ones. You mean the gossip sites? Yep. Red-hot gossip sites. Teenage gossip sites. Japanese animated gossip sites. That sort of thing. You know me so well. Those were just hypotheticals. Right. Duh. Good thing I delete my history. Clearly. Unfortunately, deleting your history only hides it from the people on your end. There are people on the other end? Yep. Millions of them, actually. But right now the ones you should be worrying about are Google. As of 1 March, the company will be gathering data on you from every one of its services \u2013 including e-mail and YouTube \u2013 and collecting them in a big digital box with your name on it. Is that bad? Well, let's say you search the term \"elf gossip\" a few times and that goes into the Google database. You delete your history, so no one at home will find out, but Google still knows. A few days later, a friend visits YouTube on your computer and an ad pops up for \"loose-lipped elves\". Get the picture? I surely do. Although that elf thing was just the one time. Can I opt out? Well, they have pledged to give users a \"do-not-track\" button, but that'll only work when you're not logged into a Google account. Is that all? If you're quick, there's also still time to disable your web history in your account settings. OK done. Phew. So now they can't track me at all? Actually that won't stop them tracking you either, but they will have to make your data anonymous in 18 months' time. That's not very reassuring. Is there nothing else I can do? You could always not use Google. Ha! Good one. Thanks. Do say: \"I'm just browsing.\" Don't say: \"No idea what these ads for lederhosen are about.\"",
