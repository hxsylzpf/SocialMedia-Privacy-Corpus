The majority of youngsters do not realise that the information they place on websites such as MySpace and Bebo could be traceable to them in the future, according to the Information Commissioner's Office, which regulates the use of personal data in the UK. In a survey conducted by the ICO, almost 60% of 14-21 year olds said they did not realise that the information they were putting online could be permanently linked to them. \"Many young people are posting content online without thinking about the electronic footprint they leave behind,\" said David Smith, deputy commissioner at the ICO. \"The cost to a person's future can be very high if something undesirable is found by the increasing number of education institutions and employers using the internet as a tool to vet potential students or employees.\" Despite their lack of awareness about how long information would remain online, the majority of youngsters said they were keen to retain their privacy. Seven out of 10 surveyed said they did not want their future employers to look at their profiles on social networking sites. However, the popularity of websites such as Facebook and MySpace has resulted in millions of new pieces of information being added to the internet every day. Many of them are intensely personal, but are often available for the entire world to look at through search engines such as Google. As a result of the findings, the Information Commissioner has launched official guidance for networking sites and their users. Advice includes protecting your passwords and keeping information such as your location secret, as well as steering away from writing personal statements on blogs and other personal websites. Owen Van Natta, a senior executive at Facebook, told the Guardian that his company viewed privacy as a major issue \u2013 but said that not everyone would be able to keep up with the pace of change. \"We've learned some really valuable lessons,\" he said. \"We take security very seriously. We participate in the industry and try to make sure users are educated. But we're a technology company: this socialisation of the web is happening at such a rapid pace.\" The growth in social networking has been exponential. A survey published last week by the European Interactive Advertising Association found that 42% of all internet users in Europe regularly use social networking services \u2013 with numbers doubling over the previous year. Some internet companies say they are concerned about the marked shift in attitudes to privacy among younger people. \"The technology industry has done a pretty good job of building privacy settings into social networking sites, but I'm much less sanguine about whether users are aware of those settings and using them,\" said Peter Fleischer, the privacy counsel for internet giant Google. \"It's not just children \u2013 there is a generational shift in how people think about privacy. Teens and 20-somethings think in a different way to people in their 40s. I struggle with that.\" Experts are also concerned that the range of information available online could play into the hands of criminals. \"When young people are made aware that their details could be being passed between parties they are worried,\" said David Smith. \"It may be fun, but unfortunately it is not the safe space many think it is.\" The survey comes as data protection dominates the agenda in Westminster. The Information Commissioner is investigating the loss of two CDs containing the personal records and bank details of up to 25 million people, as well as running a review into the sharing of private data between different government departments.",
