  "content": "In a press conference (live-blogged by Venture Beat) and a blog post by founder Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook has announced a more Twitter-like information stream, plus new public profile pages suitable for use by \"public figures and organizations\". He says: The new home page will let you see everything that's shared by your friends and connections as it happens. It will also provide you more control by letting you choose exactly who you see among the people and things you are connected to. You can decide you no longer want to get updates from your old friend from high school who you rarely talk to, or you can filter the stream to only see updates about your family members. And now, if you want, you can read what President Obama is saying on the same page as your best friend. Public profile pages are an obvious idea, but very welcome. They'll let someone like Stephen Fry connect to 250,000 fans while keeping the friends part of his profile separate. Of course, that doesn't mean Fry will bother, because he's already reaching the same fans via Twitter. However, most of the digerati are already on Facebook, and they are not on Twitter. Meanwhile what started as Facebook's news feed will become much more Twitter-like, because you'll be able to pick up feeds from people you want to follow -- and this can extend onto the web via Facebook Connect. Obviously you will be able to follow people without friending them -- which is how Twitter works. Although Twitter has been the most obvious comparison and must have helped motivate these Facebook developments -- it did, after all, try to buy Twitter -- it's also a reflection of the way social networking is developing. Facebook is doing what Microsoft has just done with Live Wave 3, which has \"Facebook like\" features, and it could also be considered a response to FriendFeed. I don't think Facebook is going to wipe out Twitter any more than Facebook adding photo albums wiped out Flickr. Different people and different groups always have different needs. It will be interesting to see how Facebook develops. I assume there will be the usual outcry that you get when any comfortable and familiar old thing changes, even if the change is for the better. Many people hate having to learn anything new. But web-based companies have more useful measures than feedback, because they can track how many users come, how many pages they view, and how long they spend on the site.",
