  "content": "In summer 2014, 16-year-old Jada was sexually assaulted at a Houston party. Someone took a photograph of her lying naked and unconscious on the floor. The photo was posted on social media, where others shared it. Then, in a particularly callous act, strangers started to post their own re-enactments of the photo, sharing it via the hashtag #Jadapose. Online violence is often an act in two parts: the original violence, followed by the participation of large numbers of bystanders \u2013 social media users who share harassing content, non-consensually re-distribute private photos, re-post threats to someone's life, post comments that support \u2013 even revel in \u2013 public humiliation and hatred, and participate in doxxing (the posting of an individual's personal information with the malicious intention of subjecting them to crowd-sourced harassment). Responsibility for violence online and off must be placed where it belongs: on the perpetrators, rather than the victims, survivors and community members targeted by it. But bystanders should also be held accountable. Many of us witness violence online. According to a 2014 Pew Center study, 73% of respondents had witnessed someone being harassed online. While the majority of what they witnessed was name-calling and intentional acts of humiliation (like #Jadapose), they also witnessed criminal acts: 25% of those respondents witnessed someone being physically threatened, while nearly 20% witnessed others being stalked or sexually harassed via social media, often for sustained periods of time. The numbers are even higher among those aged 18 to 29, where 92% have witnessed online violence. People of Hispanic and African-American descent in the US are far more likely to witness online violence than others (88% and 84%, respectively), suggesting just how racially targeted online violence is. Young women disproportionately experience sexual harassment and stalking online. However, while 92% of users perceive that online environments enable people to be more judgmental of one another, 68% also report that these same environments enable people to be supportive of one another. It is this opportunity for support online that creates a space for more caring bystander intervention. After Jada spoke out about her rape and social media abuse, she launched a solidarity campaign, #IAmJada, that others have used to call out the cruelty of the re-enactors. In the process they made visible a form of bystander solidarity that counteracts the hyper-visibility of online cruelties. Yet, it is rare to find stories of bystanders who provide help to the victims. When the media does focus on bystanders, it tends to focus on their failure to intervene, particularly when surveillance video evidence is available. Other footage has captured bystanders breaking up fights, only to be harmed or even killed in the process, such as the case of Hugo Yale-Tax in New York City, pointing out the threats some interveners face if they try to help. Yet, social movements are trying to tell a different story, redefining intervention as a set of minor acts people can do in their everyday lives to reduce harm online, and provide support to those who are targeted. In hashtag campaigns such as #YouOkSis? (started by social worker and black feminist tweeter Feminista Jones), women of colour provide advice and support to other women of colour who have been harassed. They suggest community-based solutions that avoid going to the police to address the over-criminalisation and police violence committed against non-white communities. Theirs is a model of feminist bystander intervention based in racial justice. A recent online comic, Paths, written by Mikki Kendall, creator of #solidarityisforwhitewomen and #fasttailedgirls, details the process through which a young man comes to understand the harm he caused by re-posting a female student's nude image \u2013 as a bystander to another person's original non-consensual act of posting of the photo. The comic teaches teenagers that distributing private images without the consent of the person who made them is itself an act of violence. We do not often see or hear online perpetrators coming to consciousness about their violence, but it is a crucial process. In an NPR radio interview with feminist author Lindy West, her former abuser described how he enacted his violence through fake email and Twitter accounts he created in her dead father's name. He talked about his feelings of deficiency and resentment as a man and why he lashed out at West's confidence and visibility. In doing so, he provided a model for other perpetrators \u2013 and bystander participants \u2013 of how they might take responsibility and make amends for the injuries they have caused. Bystanders can learn from the systems of support that survivors of online violence have developed for each other, in online resource guides that provide information on how women can collectively respond to cultures of online misogynist violence, practices that the targets of online violence can use for conducting self-care post-assault, and methods for better protecting one's own privacy and not violating others. Activists are developing app-based interfaces, Tumblrs and hashtags that provide ways of talking back to harassers and the bystanders who support them. Tools such as the mobile app Not Your Baby, created by Toronto's Metrac, and Hollaback's app for documenting street harassment, crowdsource responses to harassment that both bystanders and the targets of this violence can use. However, tech alone will not solve these problems. According to Jacque Wernimont at the Center for Solutions to Online Violence, \"There is no technological fix to online violence. The problems are social and so are the solutions.\" The real challenge is building consensual relations both online and face-to-face, with people we know and people we don't know, and demanding that everyone live up to these ideals. It also means that, as bystanders, we need to reconceive what justice looks like from a bystander perspective \u2013 particularly when the most available models suggest going to the police, when for some, including many people of colour, the police are part of the problem. To be effective, bystander intervention must be a collective effort, not only an individual act. It needs to reckon with the ways in which some bystanders are more targeted for violence and the ways in which some bystanders are criminalised for simply enacting their rights to witness, say, police action. We need more education that can interrogate and dismantle the sources of online violence; the quiet acquiescence of bystanders to online misogyny, racism, homophobia and transphobia; and the fears witnesses have of becoming targets of violence themselves. We do this by holding both the perpetrators and their cultures of support accountable.",
