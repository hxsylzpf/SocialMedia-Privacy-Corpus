  "content": "The popularity of Facebook is leading a revitalisation of the digital display advertising sector in the UK, according to a report by the Internet Advertising Bureau. The report found that UK online display advertising grew by 6.4% year on year to \u00a3381m in the first half of 2010, an impressive recovery from the 4.4% year-on-year fall in spend in 2009. Digital display advertising accounts for just over 19% of the \u00a31.97bn spent by companies on all UK internet advertising for the period. Within the online display sector the IAB singled out the increasing desire of companies to target users on social media sites such as MySpace, Facebook and LinkedIn and the boom in advertising around online programming for the recovery and growth. Paid-search advertising, the stalwart of UK internet advertising dominated by Google, remains a juggernaut with ad spend increasing by 8.9% to \u00a31.18bn year on year in the first six months. However, paid-for search's share of UK internet advertising shrunk from 61.7% to 59.5% year on year as companies start to plough marketing spend into areas such as social media and online video advertising. Paid-for search's share has tapered off in the last three IAB six-monthly reports \u2013 unheard of in the 14 years since the first report was published in 1996. Online classified advertising increased 11.4% year on year in the first half to \u00a3379m, some 19% of internet spend, with housing, automotive, recruitment and business-to-business advertising defying the economic downturn. Social media ad spend has grown rapidly \u2013 the IAB only included it as a sector in its report last year \u2013 with the medium accounting for 13%, or about \u00a350m, of all online display ad spend in the first half of 2010. The IAB did not provide year-on-year comparison figures for social media spend but said that the growth trajectory has been impressive. Earlier this year a report by Enders Analysis estimated that Facebook UK could be making as much as \u00a385m per year from display advertising. In addition online video advertising has grown impressively, by 82% year on year to \u00a320.7m, although the medium still only accounts for 5.5% of total digital spend. The IAB said that major brands such as Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble, Moneysupermarket, O2, Virgin, Orange and Microsoft were forging a trail, committing serious budgets to chasing consumers on social media and leveraging online video advertising. Overall media and entertainment was the biggest sector for spending on display advertising, followed by finance brands and then consumer goods companies. Just over 70% of all ad spend on online display advertising, \u00a3272m, goes on traditional ad formats such as banners, buttons and skyscraper slots. The total spent on UK internet advertising grew 10% year-on-year in the first half to just under \u00a32bn. \"If growth continues at this rate then internet advertising should break the \u00a34bn barrier in 2010, another milestone, with one pound in every four spent on advertising going online,\" said the IAB chief executive, Guy Phillipson. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
