  "content": "Clarence House is considering making a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission after Prince Harry was photographed on holiday on the Mozambican island of Bazaruto. But if a complaint is made, the News of the World, which on Sunday published a picture of the prince fishing on a public beach on the island, will insist it did nothing wrong. The paper and its rivals are believed to be increasingly frustrated with what they see as the royal family's intransigent attitude to the press. The News of the World confirmed yesterday that eight militia members were dispatched by government officials to ask reporter Sarah Arnold and a photographer to leave the area. Two unarmed men then boarded the boat on which they were travelling and searched them for 20 minutes. It said miles of public beaches had been sealed off during the visit of Prince Harry, who was on holiday there with his friend Chelsy Davy, and a three-mile exclusion zone was formed around his party. Despite booking into a hotel on the island, the writer and photographer say they were given just 15 minutes to leave; they did not approach Prince Harry or his party, nor attempt to take pictures of them in private areas. The paper's editor, Andy Coulson, refused to remove his staff from the region, saying they had not broken the law or the PCC code on privacy. \"Frankly, it shouldn't matter whether you're on Canvey Island or Paradise Island,\" the News of the World argued in a leader on Sunday. \"Harry's right to privacy should be no different to any holidaymaker's.\" Clarence House refused to confirm whether the palace had sought advice from the PCC before the incident but said it was still considering a formal complaint. \"We are concerned that Harry can enjoy the same right of privacy as any other citizen and we're concerned if there's intrusion on that. We continually have conversations with the PCC and editors,\" a spokesman said. Relations between the tabloid press and Clarence House have remained strained over the past two years. In October, Harry was pictured scuffling with paparazzi in the early hours of the morning outside a London club. Some newspaper commentators have argued that Prince Harry has made himself fair game for photographers with his party lifestyle. During England's rugby World Cup win in Australia last year, he was regularly pictured out on the town, and there was a similar dispute when photographers followed him to a ranch in the outback where he spent some of his gap year. The PCC director, Tim Toulmin, and its chairman, Sir Christopher Meyer, have had to deal with more complaints in recent years from those in positions of power. It received its first complaint from a member of the royal family in 1991 when the Duke of York complained about a number of articles relating to his children. The complaint was upheld and since then the royal family has turned to the body with increasing regularity, particularly regarding intrusion into the lives of younger royals. The prime minister, Tony Blair, has also made greater use of the PCC than his predecessors, using it to keep his children out of the public eye. In April, Clarence House clashed with the Sun when it published pictures of Prince William and a female friend on a skiing holiday alongside the headline \"Finally Wills gets a girl\". Paddy Harveson, Prince Charles's director of communications, temporarily banned the paper's veteran royal photographer, Arthur Edwards, from photoshoots. On that occasion there was no complaint to the PCC because the photograph was clearly taken in public. The PCC's rules state: \"It is unacceptable to photograph individuals in private places without their consent. \"Private places are public or private property where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.\"",
