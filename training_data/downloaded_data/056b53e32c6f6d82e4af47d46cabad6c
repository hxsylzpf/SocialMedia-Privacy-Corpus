  "content": "All tabloid newspapers could be \"reputationally damaged\" if journalists are allowed to submit anonymous evidence to the Leveson inquiry into press standards, the Daily Mail publisher has told the high court. In a judicial review application, Associated Newspapers told the court on Friday that \"untested\" testimony from journalists could unfairly tar its titles \"with a broad brush\". The application is also supported by the Daily Telegraph. The Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Metro publisher wants the high court to overturn a ruling by Lord Justice Leveson that journalists can submit anonymised evidence to his inquiry. Leveson ruled in November that the anonymous submissions would not name any individual or any specific newspaper. About 20 journalists have submitted anonymous evidence to the inquiry. It is due to be heard by Leveson from the week beginning Monday 25 January. Mark Warby QC, counsel for Associated Newspapers, told the court that such evidence could damage the \"rights and interests\" of all tabloids, which \"are, in a very real sense, on trial\". He argued that because the evidence would not explicitly identify specific newspapers, the public would reasonably have suspicions about all \"predominantly tabloid and midmarket titles\". Warby referred to evidence submitted on behalf of the National Union of Journalists, which he said includes \"serious allegations of illegality and unethical behaviour\". He told the court that \"any title in that group is likely to be defamed\" if allegations of impropriety are made by journalists. \"The point is, everybody [would be] under reasonable suspicion of having being involved,\" he said. \"It is incomplete and an incompletely reasoned balancing exercise which ignores reputational concerns and gives the superficial appearance of fairness.\" Robert Jay QC, counsel to the Leveson inquiry, argued that there was \"no basis\" to the complaint that all newspapers would suffer reputational damage from journalists giving anonymous evidence. He told the court that the inquiry would be \"denied the opportunity to hear and access vital evidence\" if Associated Newspapers' challenge is successful, adding that the inquiry had only made a \"gateway determination\" that anonymous testimony may be permissible and had not made a decision on individual cases. Jay referred to the witness HJK, who gave evidence to the inquiry anonymously in November. He pointed out that no journalists or newspapers had been named in HJK's evidence, and that no core participant to the inquiry had raised objections at the time. The hearing continues. Lord Justice Toulson, Mr Justice Sweeney and Mrs Justice Sharp are expected to hand down judgement on whether the Leveson inquiry acted unlawfully by permitting anonymous evidence at a later date. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
