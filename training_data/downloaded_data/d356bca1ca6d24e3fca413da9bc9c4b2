Murdoch first tweeted about Carson in late January, picking him one to watch even at that very early stage in the campaign. He'd read Carson's autobiography years before, and described him as a \"principled brave achiever\" with a \"great American story\". By March, he was recommending two books by Carson (he has written six), which had left Murdoch with no doubts about the candidate's \"wonderful character\", but some about his presidential chops: \"sadly seems political naif\". But Murdoch's Twitter commentary keeps pace with his changing opinions. In August, it was \"good to see Ben Carson still gaining\"; he has a \"wonderful story\". The next day, he praised Carson's restraint in debates: \"Being above the fray seems to be working. Class act\". Murdoch took heart in poll results at the end of August \u2013 \"so character DOES count. His life story should make every American optimistic\" \u2013 and later depicted the contest between Carson and fellow Republican candidate Donald Trump as \"America land of hope versus fear\". Murdoch first compared Ben Carson to Barack Obama \u2013 of whom he is frequently critical \u2013 in early September: \"sincere men, different values\". Days later, Murdoch was reading (or rereading \u2013 we're not to know) another book by Carson: \"[I] recommend [it] to everybody\". His praise has ramped up in enthusiasm and frequency in the past month. \"Everywhere pundits keep underestimating Ben Carson,\" he tweeted on Saturday. \"But public understand humility as admirable, listen to the multi-faceted strong message.\" Murdoch's endorsement culminated on Thursday with his suggestion that Carson would make a \"real black president who can properly address the racial divide [...] and much else\", drawing anger from Obama's supporters and incredulity from those who are simply aware of him. Hours later Murdoch's name was trending globally on Twitter. But as any one of his 631,000-odd followers there will know, it's all par for the course in his off-the-cuff, frank and seemingly unfiltered approach to that platform. Here's an insight into the world according to Rupert Murdoch, according to Rupert Murdoch on Twitter. The Great Barrier Reef looks no different to how it did in 1965 The impact of global warming is overstated, too Smartphones: they're good Speaking of which \u2013 can he get an Apple Watch? Vice: one to watch The ancient Egyptians were white Tide: it's part of the weather (he's not wrong) A good book stands rereading \u2013 even after (not quite) five years Former Australian PM Tony Abbott: the happy warrior The happy warrior, burdened by his chief of staff \u2026 though, really, what can any politician do? (@rupertmurdoch) He's as susceptible to his daughters as any father We Bought a Zoo is a great film End gun violence He reiterated the sentiment after the Newtown school shootings in Australia, warranting a sharp retort from Malcolm Turnbull, then a shadow minister but now the country's prime minister. He's ambivalent about Page 3 of the Sun And he has a love-hate relationship with Twitter",
