  "content": "As policy experts and advocates were parsing the language of the Senate intelligence committee's long-awaited report on the CIA torture program \u2013 which detailed \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" ranging from waterboarding and sleep deprivation to forced nudity and rectal rehydration \u2013 public officials released a flurry of statements and tweets, in support of, or against, the report. The White House acknowledged that \"some of the actions that were taken were contrary to our values\"; however, President Obama's statement nevertheless praised members of the CIA, noting that \"our intelligence professionals are patriots\". Senator Dianne Feinstein spearheaded the release of the report and shared the executive summary after her delivery on the Senate floor. Some, such as the outgoing Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, praised the release of the report. John McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to praise the release of the report, saying \"the American people are entitled\" to know what is done \"in their name\". Senator Susan Collins of Maine was one of three Republicans on the Senate intelligence committee who voted to declassify the report. In a statement, she noted: \"I joined the Senate intelligence committee after this report was completed, and I share concerns about the process for developing it. However, the report raises serious concerns about the CIA's management of this detention and interrogation program and the treatment of certain detainees. Torture is wrong and fundamentally contrary to American values. The report should be made public to allow the American people to reach their own conclusions and to make sure lessons are learned from the mistakes made so that they never happen again.\" Other senators reacted negatively to the report, citing national security concerns or linking to statements that expressed disagreement. Aside from lawmakers, the report also garnered support from Thomas Drake, most famously known for acting as a whistleblower on the NSA. National and international organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch, released statements condemning the results of the report.",
