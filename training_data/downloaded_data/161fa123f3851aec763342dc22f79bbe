  "content": "It has been a while since we had some eyebrow-raising acquisition rumours, and perhaps that's not surprising given the state of the financial markets. But there's a fascinating report from Kara Swisher on AllThingsD today which claims that Facebook recently ended several weeks of \"serious\" talks with Twitter about buying the firm for $500m in Facebook stock. Photograph: Robert_Scoble/Flickr/Some rights reserved Swisher says the sticking point was the money; that $500m in stock was based on that pre-credit crunch $15bn Facebook valuation that now looks far too optimistic for this climate. Facebook had worries that it would face a huge SMS bill if twitter integrated with its site, and that could be as much as $75m annually. Twitter also reportedly has concerns over costs, integration and because its board feels the micro-blogging service has yet to fulfil its potential in making - or even starting to make - money. The time to sell it would be after it has proved that it can do that. There was some flirting and gossiping going on at the recent Web 2.0 conference, which, if these reports are true, is when discussion between the two were just dying out. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said he has been impressed by what twitter has achieved and described it as \"an elegant model\"; well he might, because part of Twitter's appeal is as a status updater, something that grew out of trends on instant messenger and MySpace before Facebook was opened up. Would it be a positive move for Twitter to integrate with Facebook? As a heavy Twitterer I feel a particular interest in this, and though it would undoubtedly take Twitter to a more mainstream audience (Twitter had 6 million users as of last month - Facebook has more than 100m) it would also dilute some of the early adopter power juice of Twitter among a community that is still experimenting with how to use it, rather than pigeon holing it as a lightweight friend updating service.",
