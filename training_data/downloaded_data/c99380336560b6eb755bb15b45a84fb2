  "content": "The Foundation for Internet Policy Research (FIPR) thinktank has criticised Phorm's plans to introduce systems that will anonymise your browsing (if you're with BT or Virgin Media, or opt in from TalkTalk) and serve you targeted ads plus warn you about known phishing sites. In its letter to the Information Commissioner, FIPR says that Users are apparently to be allocated pseudonyms for some of the processing, but at various processing stages the personal data can be linked to the pseudonym, the pseudonym can be linked to the IP address used, and the IP address can be linked to the user. Although we understand that this linkage will not be standard operating practice, it can nevertheless be performed. Many users will also be identifiable from the content of the data scanned, since it will include email sent or retrieved by users of web-based email, and messages viewable by those authorised to gain access to individual pages of social networking sites. Although some web-based email systems operate using \"https:\" end-to-end encryption, which would prevent interception, this is far from ubiquitous. It might be possible for Phorm to configure the service to exclude a handful of the more high-profile web-mail and social networking systems. But there are no available methods of detecting the tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands of other, low usage, often semi-private systems which currently provide web-mail or social networking in chat rooms or similar environments. Classification by scanning in this way seems to us to be highly intrusive. We think that it should not be undertaken without explicit consent from users who have been given particularly clear information about what is liable to be scanned. Users should have to opt in to such a system, not merely be given an opportunity to opt out. We believe this is also required under European data protection law; failure to establish a clear and transparent \"opt-in\" system is likely to render the entire process illegal and open to challenge in UK and European courts. This must be annoying for Phorm. In the meantime, we have asked the company for sight of the report by 80/20, the private consultancy run by Simon Davies and Gus Hosein (which Kent Ertegrul, chief executive of Phorm, mistook for Privacy International in our interview). The company said earlier today (Monday) that it would send it over - we haven't got it yet but expect to see it on Tuesday. We'll keep you posted...",
