  "content": "Hello! magazine treated its celebrity fixer the Marquesa de Varela like a \"doormat\", the high court heard today. The marquesa claims she was pressurised by Javier Riera, the managing editor of Hello!'s Spanish sister publication Hola!, into signing a letter admitting she had acted as a go-between in the sale of the photographs. \"Unscrupulous use was made of the marquesa,\" her counsel, Helen Mulcahy, said in a written statement submitted to the court today, adding that the marquesa was treated by the magazine as a \"doormat\". \"The marquesa was made use of and then set aside according to the demands of the scheme once she had signed the letter,\" she added. Ms Mulcahy claimed the marquesa was pressurised to sign the letter by Mr Riera, with whom she had a difficult relationship. One of the central questions in the legal action brought by Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas against Hello! magazine for publishing sneaked photographs of their wedding was why the marquesa signed a letter saying that she sold the pictures to Hello!, when it is now agreed that she did not. The marquesa was well known for setting up features for the celebrity magazine through her high society contacts, but had never bought photographs from paparazzi photographers, Ms Mulcahy told Mr Justice Lindsay. The six pictures at the heart of the action were taken by a British paparazzo, Rupert Thorpe, son of the former Liberal leader, who somehow gained access to the Douglases' wedding at the New York Plaza Hotel in November 2000. However, Hello! said it was simply a mistake that the marquesa was asked to sign the letter. The magazine claimed the mistake arose when its London office was rushing to overturn an injunction preventing the distribution of the issue containing the wedding pictures. Ms Mulcahy said her client had signed the letter because of her \"economic dependency\" on Hello!. \"Faced with the crisis of the injunction the marquesa was seemingly sought out in short order in the sure knowledge that she was both susceptible to obeying instructions given by Mr Riera by reason, amongst other things, of her economic dependency on Hello! and a ready source of superficially plausible evidence to be made use of in Hello!'s defence to the proceedings. \"It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that in so acting those who perpetrated the scheme behaved dishonourably. \"The marquesa feared Mr Riera and found him hostile... the decision to leave everything to Mr Riera, the very man of whom the marquesa was so afraid and nervous, has the effect in these circumstances of bringing firmly home to the marquesa the full extent of the vulnerability of her position and the full weight of the economic consequences of a failure to comply. \"The suggestion in these circumstances that it was the marquesa who had assumed spontaneously and without prompting that she was being asked to do something improper defies common sense.\" The case continues.",
