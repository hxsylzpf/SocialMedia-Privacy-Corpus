  "content": "The average cost to advertise on Twitter fell 18% in the last three months of 2013, the company disclosed Friday. The decline in ad rates, disclosed in the company's annual report, comes as its revenues continue to grow rapidly. Advertisers are buying more ads on the social network, but at lower prices. Twitter's ad rate has been declining for the past seven quarters. Twitter gets paid when a user interacts with an the ad, by clicking on a link, retweeting it or favoriting it. These \"engagements\" increased 74% in the three months through 31 December from the previous quarter. But despite rising revenues and increased interest from advertisers the company warned that ad rates could continue to fall. \"As we continue to optimise for advertiser value and the overall user experience, the cost per ad engagement may continue to decline over time, and we expect the cost per ad engagement to decline in the near term,\" the company said. Last month Twitter's share price dropped sharply after the company released its first set of quarterly results. Investors sold off the company as it revealed its growth rate was slowing. Twitter added just 9 million new users in the last quarter of year to make a total of 241 million. The fall came after Twitter had made a number of major changes, redesigning its mobile apps and websites and adding image and video previews to Tweets. Chief executive Dick Costolo told analysts \"doubling down on accelerating growth in our core user base\" in 2014 and would be making further changes to make the service more user friendly for new users. The company warned in its annual report that growth was likely to slow. \"Our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in growing the number of users and increasing their overall level of engagement on our platform as well as the number of ad engagements. We anticipate that our user growth rate will slow over time as the size of our user base increases,\" said Twitter. \"To the extent our user growth rate slows, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement and ad engagement on Twitter... A number of consumer-oriented websites that achieved early popularity have since seen their user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our user base or engagement levels.\"",
