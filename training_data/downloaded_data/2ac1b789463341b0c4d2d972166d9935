  "content": "In the wake of last year's superior Unfriended comes another teen-frightener about social-media stalking. Many of the plot co-ordinates are the same; an online suicide, a creepy cyber-spirit, a collective inability to log off etc. Predictably, things work best when rooted in the \"real\" world; it all falls apart when we move from the spectre of the computer screen to a gothic witchy backstory. Despite an overreliance on loud bangs, director Simon Verhoeven pulls off a couple of chills, even as dialogue such as: \"Unfriend that dead bitch!\" keep things snarky rather than scary.",
