  "content": "Golfer Colin Montgomerie has become the latest sportsman to use an injunction to prevent the publication of a story about his private life, reports today's Daily Telegraph. The high court order, which has stopped the story appearing in a national tabloid newspaper, once again raises concerns that the courts are creating a privacy law through the back door. The injunction was granted by Mr Justice Eady on 8 July, but has only just come to light. It appears that the matter was resolved out of court and there is no suggestion of any truth in the allegations. Montgomerie, who is Europe's captain for the Ryder Cup in October, attended a press conference in Wisconsin yesterday about the competition. He was quoted as saying: I know a lot of you are having a lot of fun right now at my expense. I apologise for this, that you have to bring this up, but at the same time no further comments from myself on that matter. I'm here to talk about the Ryder Cup. So please, no further questions on anything regarding my private life. By definition, that is private. Montgomerie was in the news in June when he admitted to difficulties in his marriage to his second wife, Gaynor Knowles. He said he was \"very sorry for the hurt\" he had caused amid reports that he was seeing a former girlfriend. High-profile figures using the courts to prevent the publication of details about their private lives has led MPs and lawyers to question whether press freedom is being compromised. In January, footballer John Terry, tried and failed to stop the reporting of an extramarital affair when Mr Justice Tugendhat decided to lift a temporary gagging order that had prevented the story being reported. He said an injunction was \"not necessary or proportionate having regard to the level of gravity of interference with the private life of the applicant\". In 2008, Eady ruled that the News of the World breached the privacy of Max Mosley in its reporting of his sado-masochistic sex orgy with prostitutes. Mosley is currently attempting to pilot a change in the law through the European court of human rights that will require journalists to give at least two days' notice of their intention to expose the misbehaviour of a public figure so that their potential victim can obtain an injunction to stop the publication. European media groups and free speech campaigners are alarmed at the possibility of such a change to the law.",
