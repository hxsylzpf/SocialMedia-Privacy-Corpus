  "content": "Princess Caroline of Monaco today won a landmark legal victory when Europe's top human rights court ruled that the German press had violated her right to privacy by publishing photographs of her and her children. The European court of human rights condemned Germany's constitutional court for allowing publication of the pictures four and a half years ago and said there had been no \"legitimate interest\" in her private life. \"The court considered that the general public did not have a legitimate interest in knowing Caroline von Hannover's whereabouts or how she behaved generally in her private life,\" the Strasbourg-based court said in its ruling. \"Photos appearing in the tabloid press were often taken in a climate of continual harassment which induced in the person concerned a very strong sense of intrusion into their private life or even of persecution,\" it added. The princess's lawyer, Matthias Prinz, said the ruling was \"very good for my client and for all people in Europe\". \"The court is raising the standard of protection of private life to a level higher than in Germany - to the level of France,\" Mr Prinz told Reuters. In December 1999 the German court ruled that three German magazines - Bunte, Freizeit Revue and Neue Post - could publish pictures of the princess and her family - for some time favourite subjects for European paparazzi. It rejected the princess's bid for an injunction to prevent further photographs being published, arguing that as a prominent figure she had to tolerate being photographed in public places. But today that judgment was said by the European court to have been a violation of the European convention on human rights, which enshrines the right to respect for private life. Germany has three months to consider an appeal against the verdict, which will now be taken into account by German courts in future cases. Today's judgment does not technically overturn the original court decision but leaves Germany open to being fined by the Council of Europe if it does not take steps to reverse the 1999 ruling. The European court left a decision on any potential damages Caroline might receive to \"a later date\". For the 47-year old princess, the daughter of Prince Rainier of Monaco and the late American film star Grace Kelly, the result comes after years of battling against tabloid intrusion. The princess, her husband, Prince Ernst-August von Hannover, and her sister Stephanie - who has married a Portuguese circus acrobat - have all attracted media attention for many years. Germany and France both have strict laws on privacy, which nevertheless allow public figures to be photographed without their consent. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
