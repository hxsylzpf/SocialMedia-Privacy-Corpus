  "content": "Though you may think that Twitter gets, oh, far too much attention, the reality is that this is something that is growing fast. Damn fast. So fast that it has recently left not only the New York Times but also Digg - remember Digg? - and social networks Bebo and LinkedIn in its rear-view mirror. Ally that to the falloff in page views at MySpace, which has fallen behind Facebook, and you start to get the sense of the guard changing. Facebook has no problems - quite the opposite - but the screengrabs above from Alexa show how things are changing, and not for the better in the case of MySpace. First of all, what's happening with MySpace? Seems it's lost its mojo. As TechCrunch noted recently, We have also spoken with a couple of very large application developers who confirm that activity on MySpace is decreasing at a dramatic rate, as high as \"half a percent a week.\" What's more, In about a year from now MySpace will receive their last welfare payment from Google, and they'll be on their own. They'll have a social network that costs half a billion dollars a year to run. With page views decreasing and the Google money gone there is a strong likelihood that the News Corp. subsidiary will be unprofitable a year from now. Revenue of $800+ million last year could easily decrease to well below half a billion dollars, and likely will. And into all that comes Twitter. It has shot ahead of the New York Times and LinkedIn and Bebo (two other properties you might have heard of): the inflection point seems to have been in January, and simply built from there - so Oprah joining it with much noise in April was not important to its growth; that was already happening. (If, of course, we take Alexa's numbers as correct; they do seem to correlate with those of Comscore, which aren't public, but TechCrunch has used.) Bebo (see above) is showing a similar downward trend as MySpace. Alarm bells for AOL, which bought it for $850m in March 2008? However, Twitter is still a relative minnow in page views compared to the big two social networks (although it has now passed Bebo.com as well as Linkedin; and Bebo is showing a similar downward trend). However, there's a time for everything. There was a time when Digg first passed Slashdot. Perhaps the comparisons between Twitter and social networks aren't entirely fair - but then again, since it's a form of real-time messaging and linking and photo-sharing (through services such as Twitpic), it feels (no more than that) like there's something important happening. And the decline of MySpace and Bebo merits some hard questions on their own. Facebook is still on the upward swing: but given that Mark Zuckerberg has ruled out a stock market flotation, what are the options if things gravity suddenly reasserts itself. Oh, and if you're wondering how Twitter compared to Guardian.co.uk... well, anyway. What do you think? Is MySpace a busted flush? Is Bebo? And how long can Facebook keep rising? Is Twitter's rise the conquering of social networks with a social network that - by passing on links - sends you away, as Google does, thus making itself the key property online?",
