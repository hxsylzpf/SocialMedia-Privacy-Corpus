  "content": "The DNA records of innocent people should be deleted from the national database because the practice is illegal and morally wrong, the Conservative party said yesterday. The shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, writing on theguardian.com, said that allowing the government to store the DNA data of anyone questioned by the police \"represents an unacceptable extension of the power of the state at a time when this government is making the state far too intrusive in our society\". \"The DNA data of around 5 million people is stored on our national DNA database,\" Grayling says in his article published on Comment is Free today. \"Almost one in 10 of the population and a substantial proportion of those people have never been convicted of any crime ... Much of that data will be stored indefinitely - often against the wishes of those whose data it is. That is an unacceptable extension of what is increasingly becoming a surveillance society.\" Last year the European Court of Human Rights ruled that holding all DNA samples taken by police in the course of an investigation was illegal. Responding to the ruling, the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, ordered the profiles of all young children to be removed immediately and indicated that time limits would be introduced for those not convicted of any crime. But Grayling accused ministers of \"dithering\". \"It is moving tentatively towards yet another \"consultation\". But there is nothing to consult about. The situation is straightforward. It's illegal. So stop.\" Grayling added that while DNA data played an important role in many criminal investigations there was no justification for storing it indefinitely as a matter of course. The Tory proposals would see England and Wales adopt a similar system to Scotland which allows the DNA of adults charged with sexual or violent offences to be stored for three years.",
