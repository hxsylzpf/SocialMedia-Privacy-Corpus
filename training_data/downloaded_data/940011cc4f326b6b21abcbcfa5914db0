But today's flare-up \u2013 with the internet firm saying it won't accept Chinese censorship, which would mean the closure of its mainland site \u2013 goes further, and neatly encapsulates the different strands that run through the power politics of the web. To start operating its Chinese site, Google accepted the censorship rules of the People's Republic. When you punch in \"Tiananmen Square\" to its English-language images site, you get a picture of the 1989 massacre; the Chinese site shows a tourist photograph of happy folk in the square today. That, the firm explained, was the price that had to be paid to bring the benefits of Google to the world's most heavily populated nation. But it found the going somewhat harder than elsewhere, taking a 31% share of the search engine market compared with 69% for the Chinese Baidu service. That wouldn't necessarily have put it off, but a wave of hacking attacks has. We may conclude that the management in California feared that Chinese hackers would get into the system and even get hold of the code and secret algorithms. That would be a new twist on the familiar story of counterfeiting of software in China, which Microsoft has been fighting for a decade or more. Despite its huge size, with more than 300 million internet users, the mainland is a relatively small part of Google's overall business, so the price of increasing security may have been worth paying. But there is a wider story, and the fact that Google chief executive Eric Schmidt had dinner with Hillary Clinton last week along with three other major US tech bosses is probably not unconnected with the change of stance on China. In addition, Clinton is due to make a major speech next week extolling internet freedom, while Obama has pointed to internet security as a key national security concern. We don't know if the hackers were private individuals, part of a shadow government operation, or connected with the People's Liberation Army. Google and Clinton clearly believe the authorities in Beijing have the power to crack down on them. Whatever the truth, China is unlikely to play along with the Americans. As I pointed out in a posting after the execution at the end of December of the British man found with heroin in his possession, China is in no mood to do anything it does not want to. The only reason one can see for Beijing to act would be if it felt it was at risk following recent attacks on Baidu, though they are said to have originated from Iran. We saw that at Copenhagen, and over the valuation of its currency, the yuan. In this case, China is keen to develop its own next generation internet hardware and software that will retain censorship functions while using the technical facilities of the web to the full. The senior official in charge of media has talked of the country acting \"proactively\" to set up its own system to prevent the spread of moral pollution from abroad. If that catches political dissidents along with pornographers, nobody will be happier than the Politburo. This is a story that will stretch well beyond whatever Google does or does not do. It marks the start of a major new stage in the life of the internet where power politics swing into play. If it works, China's model will be very attractive for authoritarian governments elsewhere and for regimes that want to halt the spread of American information technology. Once again, Google blazes the trail, even if not in ways it might wish for.",
