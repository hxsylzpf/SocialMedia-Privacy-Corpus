  "content": "Myrl is setting out to add a bit of 'joined up thinking' to virtual worlds, building a 'social gateway' that links competing worlds with the web, and with social networks. Founder and chief executive Francesco D'Orazio, who has a PHD in new media and sociology from the University of Rome, describes the concept as 'outeroperability', and says the ultimate goal is to turn the series of different virtual environments into one integrated playground. Backed by angel funding from its launch in February 2007, Myrl employs five staff at its base on London. D'Orazio explains the bigger plans for Myrl, how it will encourage trading between different worlds and facilitate social networking. Myrl founder and chief executive Francesco D'Orazio \u2022 Explain your business to my Mum. \"We bring virtual worlds and their users together on the web. We are building a layer on top of each virtual world, with the ultimate goal of linking them up to create an integrated playground with endless possibilities and applications. One of these applications is gaming, that's why we think of Myrl as a cross-world entertainment platform. We just launched our first release, the 'social gateway' for virtual worlds. Future releases will focus on immersive-storytelling and gaming across different worlds and virtual goods trading.\" \u2022 How does that work? \"We build integrations between the various virtual worlds and the Myrl web hub so that for example when you pop into your world, your avatar profile on Myrl will show your friends that you are inworld, where you are and let other users instant message you from the web to inworld. This means that when you can't run a heavy client or can't pop in for any other reason, you can still keep up with your virtual life also via the web and the mobile. Clearly the user decides whether to make what information public or private.\" \u2022 How do you make money? \"Referrals and signups to the virtual worlds, social advertising, research, cross-world gaming and virtual goods trading.\" \u2022 What's your background? \"Technology and media studies. My PhD was a thesis on the immersive evolution of communication strategies in the context of cognitive, semiotic, social and historical perspectives.\" \u2022 How are personalisation and recommendation part of your business? \"We want to complement virtual worlds and immersive technologies with the web 2.0 tools that have changed our online experience. The personalisation of the information flow and recommendation for virtual worlds are essential to increase the adoption of this medium and are key in our strategy. One of the projects we are working on now is a recommendation engine for virtual worlds.\" \u2022 Are we in the middle of a new dot com bubble? \"Probably, but the burst will be different because the industry and the market are stronger now. It will be more diluted rather than impacting on the industry at once like the previous one did. It's definitely going to be more of a souffl\u00e9 than a bubble.\" \u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months? \"We had 2;500 beta testers at the moment of launch, and we'd like to be at 50,000 active users by September 2009.\" \u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch? \"Raph Koster, Cory Ondrejka, Opensim, MyCosm, VastPark, PMOG and 42 Entertainment.\" \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? \"Creating a gaming engine to generate and manage immersive storytelling across multiple virtual environments built on different technologies.\" \u2022 Name your closest competitors. \"Nobody is working on a cross-world entertainment platform, but there are at least three social networks for gamers - Rupture.com, Raptr.com and Avatarsunited.com - and an image sharing platform for virtual worlds users called Koinup.com. At the moment we are supporting and integrating Koinup on Myrl.\" \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? \"We want Myrl to become the premiere web destination for virtual worlds users and the leading solution for immersive storytelling.\" Myrl.com \u2022 How much demand is there for a network that connects worlds? How loyal are virtual world users to one destination? \u2022 Are you convinced by the revenue model? \u2022 Do you think this service is trying to do too much, or is it a vision of the future of virtual worlds?",
