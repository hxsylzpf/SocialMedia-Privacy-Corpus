  "content": "A range of crucial satellite systems manufactured by some of the world's biggest government contractors contain severe vulnerabilities that could be exploited to disrupt military operations and flight-safety communications, researchers have warned. Security consultancy IOActive says it has uncovered various vulnerabilities in software and ground-based satellite systems manufactured by British suppliers Cobham and Inmarsat. US firms Harris Corporation, Hughes and Iridium were also said to have produced vulnerable kit, alongside Thuraya, a UAE provider, and Japan Radio Company. The Computer Emergency Response Team based in Carnegie Mellon University, which is sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, warned about a handful of the vulnerabilities in January. But on Wednesday information on more alleged weaknesses was released, amid growing concern the contractors are ignoring the threats. The latest report from IOActive suggested there were some easily hackable systems, many of which were designed for keeping aircraft, ships and army personnel safe. 'Soldiers could be located, systems disabled' Many of the issues lie in the Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) satellite receivers that the manufacturers produce with Inmarsat, the satellite operator that provided tools vital in helping locate the Malaysian passenger plane MH370 that crashed last month. BGAN is designed to provide internet and voice connectivity for remote teams. The affected Harris BGAN satellite terminals are used by the military, including Nato, for tactical radio communications. Thanks to the vulnerabilities, a hacker could install malicious software on the devices to obtain the location of the soldiers using the kit, or even disable the systems, according to IOActive. Cobham produces most Inmarsat terminals, a handful of which were found to be vulnerable. Those used in shipping, such as the Ship Security Alert System, could be exploited to prevent vessels detecting distress messages or direct those containing sensitive cargo on a collision course, suggested Ruben Santamarta, the IOActive researcher who found the alleged weaknesses. The Cobham Aviator machines could be compromised to alter satellite communications, such as the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (Acars), used by a plane, he added. A 'safety threat for the entire aircraft' Acars, which is used to transmit vital information such as fuel levels, was initially used to track the movements of the MH370 flight soon after it disappeared, before Inmarsat stepped in to help. Attacks on the Cobham aircraft systems could \"pose a safety threat for the entire aircraft\", IOActive's advisory read. Only Iridium had confirmed it was working on fixes for the vulnerabilities. None of the other manufacturers had responded to contact from the Cert, which had been informed of the issues by IOActive, Santamarta said. Neither Cobham, Inmarsat or Hughes offered a response to repeated requests by the Guardian to comment on the claims of vulnerabilities of their products. Santamarta was disconcerted by the lack of response from the vendors. \"Usually you receive a reply or an email. We have been reporting a lot of vulnerabilities in the past. This is the first time we've seen such behaviour. Usually, you get an email or something to acknowledge the issue,\" Santamarta told the Guardian. The manufacturers were warned about the alleged vulnerabilities, some of which, it is claimed, could be exploited with little technical ability, in late 2013. The flaws are likely to have been present in the products for at least two years, added Santamarta. A cabinet office spokesperson provided this statement to the Guardian: \"Cert-UK is aware of the report and expects all vendors to work to patch security vulnerabilities they are informed of. It is important that organisations know what technologies they use and check that they are updated regularly in order to receive critical security patches.\"",
