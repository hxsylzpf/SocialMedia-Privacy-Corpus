  "content": "A mecca for creatives, media professionals and tech-geeks, FutureEverything has ballooned from modest origins into an internationally-acclaimed festival of ideas to rank alongside the likes of TEDx and SXSW. This year's conference focuses on mass experience and participatory culture, celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Mass Observation movement. The twitterati are out in force at Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry, and it's nice to be at a conference where you don't feel self-conscious tapping on your laptop, since at least half the audience is swiping away on their iPads or feverishly tweeting their thoughts. The breakfast session begins with a presentation by Rohan Gunatillake, creator of the urban meditation app Buddhify. Having first explored Buddhist practice when working in Manchester, Gunatillake is a firm believer in the idea that Buddhism is compatible with city living. This is Buddhism as filtered through modern marketing, with the jargon to boot \u2013 there's lots of talk of Buddhism as an \"industry of awakening\" and an \"innovation tradition\", as well as a desire to tackle Buddhism's \"pathological\" attitude to money. Gunatillake is an engaging performer though, casting Buddhism as \"a punk movement of spiritual practitioners\", with Buddha as a proto-scientist using \"inner technologies\" to explore the nature of human experience and the mechanics of suffering. He's particularly interesting in charting the migration of Buddhist practice, from austere and scholarly south-Asian Buddhism, moving east through China, Korea and Japan (zen), and on to Tibet. The hippies then brought Buddhism to the baby-boomers and creating a \"western meditative tradition\". He brings the timeline up-to-date with the birth of the \"hipster meditator\", a postmodern Buddhist influenced by all three Buddhist traditions, as well as the science on the neurological effect of meditation and consumerism. As Gunatillake puts it: It's not about looking to the East, to the mountaintop in India or the zen garden in Japan or a monastery in Burma, it's about making it work here. And there's plenty of evidence to show there are people doing exactly that, with groups like buddhistgeeks, an online community dedicated to modern Buddhist practitioners, and the #OMCru (that's Online Meditation Crew for the uninitiated, a group who encourage meditation through Twitter) and Gunatillake's own Buddhify app (tagline: \"Modern meditation. To go.\") It's even spreading to the corporate sector, with Google encouraging their employees to read Search Inside Yourself in a bid to improve their wellbeing and productivity. There's an interesting panel discussion on the relevance and future of Mass Observation, hosted by Fiona Courage, Special Collections Librarian &amp; Mass Observation Archive Curator at University of Sussex. There's a flurry of debate over the worth of social media as a historical archive \u2013 technology writer Bill Thompson claims Twitter and Facebook are self-aggrandising mediums, whereas the original Mass Observation came from a sense of public-spiritedness. Nevertheless, Campbell tells us that he has saved his texts of the late 1990s into a database, goading us: When the history of the text message is written, it'll be me, because you've all deleted them! Pauline McAdam, senior broadcast journalist for BBC Radio Merseyside, raises gasps of horror from the technophile audience when she describes social media as \"cave painting but digital\", lacking the magic of archives, before suggesting: \"Just shut up and have a cup of tea!\" Next up is Moritz Stefaner, a data visualisation expert with a very Keatsian focus (he styles himself as a \"Truth and beauty operator\"). Entitled Weltbilder (German for \"world views\"), Stefaner's talk looks at how data visualisation helps us live in a complex world, giving us a birds-eye perspective on all kinds of worlds: finance, knowledge, relationships. Some of his data works are stunning \u2013 beautiful tendrils sculpted from the data in Wikipedia page deletion discussions (including one on \"Biscuits and human sexuality\"). Stefaner talks of \"the tension between order and chaos\" and cites a natural correlation between the elegant solution in mathematics and beauty, quoting inventor Buckminster Fuller approvingly: When I'm working on a problem, I never think about beauty. But when I'm finished, if it's not beautiful, I know it's wrong. As well as discussing his work on the OECD Better Life Index, the Max Planck institute and a mail-order museli company, he gives us a peek of Emoto \u2013 an attempt to visualise in real-time the global emotional response as medals are lost and won at the London 2012 Olympics using all the social media data. There's a real diversity to the presentations at FutureEverything this year. There's the BBC on their staggering quantity of digital coverage planned for London 2012, and a presentation from Adrian Hon, the brains behind Zombies, Run \u2013 a zombie-themed running app which features stories penned by Orange prizewinning novelist Naomi Alderman. He also shares the irresistible fact that apparently zombies tend to become more popular during socioeconomic downturns. Elsewhere composer Andrea Molino discusses Three Mile Island, his multimedia opera based on the work of an Austrian meteorologist who analysed the wind data after a nuclear accident at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania in 1979. There's only so much innovation you can take in one day though, which perhaps explains the surprisingly small audience for Richard Ayers, Head of Digital at Manchester City FC, who's here to talk about tribalism in football. The first shock is that he's not actually a big football fan. Ayers discusses the volley of abuse he received after an ill-advised \"Bluffer's guide to being a City fan\" was posted on the official City website. I also keep particularly quiet when he mentioned receiving a savaging from the Guardian's very own Scott Murray. Ayers is persuasive in discussing modern football's need for endless expansion because the financials are so cock-eyed, with clubs spending recklessly on transfer fees and wages. I also loved his discussion of football clubs as having 'characters' \u2013 Arsenal are, apparently, a starchy gent, while City are \"a mysterious beauty who ensnared many lovers\". After last Sunday's antics at Eastlands, I think there's plenty of Mancunians in sky-blue who would agree. Tom Midlane is a freelance journalist based in the north-west.
