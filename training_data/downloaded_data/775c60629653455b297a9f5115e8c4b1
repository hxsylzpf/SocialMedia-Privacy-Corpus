  "content": "They say you can kill your enemy with kindness, but would you go so far as to give them a job reference? In a New Yorker interview, academic Mary Beard revealed that she did just that for one of the trolls who abused her on social media. The historian explained: \"He is going to find it hard to get a job, because as soon as you Google his name that is what comes up. And although he was a very silly, injudicious, and at that moment not very pleasant young guy, I don't actually think one tweet should ruin your job prospects.\" Admittedly, Oliver Rawlings, the university student in question, had apologised for his behaviour and even taken Beard out for lunch to make amends, but the academic has still gone above and beyond the call of duty in expressing her forgiveness. What have you done to rise above those who have wronged you? Did it feel better than seeking revenge?",
