  "content": "I feel sorry for Derek Simpson. He can't win this Twitter row. Having entered the digital age of instant communication, he allowed the ruthlessly shrewd Willie Walsh to cause a distraction argument in the old media. There was Walsh on the Andrew Marr Show yesterday, trying to drive a wedge between Simpson and his avowedly non-tweeting comrade Tony Woodley. And Twitter being such a luvvies' medium, that was the clip the BBC used on the broadcasts throughout Sunday \u2013 ignoring the important issues of disagreement. Yet, if it wasn't Twitter, poor Simpson and Woodley would be on the front page of the Mail on Sunday for some other heinous crime against humanity. If they're going to get whacked by the rightwing press, it might as well be for using digital tools that are modern, accessible and transparent. On balance, I like the idea of a union general secretary using social media. Having seen how these highly politicised industrial talks work from the inside, all Simpson did was cut out the middle man. It's poor Charlie Whelan who should be worried. Both sides would normally have had their team of press officers hanging around the tea urn, patiently waiting for scraps of gossip to throw at the journalistic pack. Twitter is different. It's from the horse's mouth and on the record. Armed with a BlackBerry and a Twitter account, why should a general secretary ever need to use a press officer again? I'm joking; well, half joking. They say that good union leaders campaign in poetry and negotiate in prose. I would love to see Paul Kenny, boss of the GMB, on Twitter. I have never seen a man be more creative with the English language than Kenny. He'd be a Twitter sensation. Many former ministers would agree that his 140-character observations are legendary. They should be shared with the world. For the renaissance to be complete, Walsh should tweet. Only then can the British public tweet back to both sides of this dispute in real time. I asked for Twitter views. One tweeter thought Walsh looked more like a jockey in the Grand National. That just goes to show that Twitter is a terrible medium for resolving industrial disputes. So, maybe it's not such a good idea for Simpson to tweet, after all.",
