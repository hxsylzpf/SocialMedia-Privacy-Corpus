  "content": "In addition to the astonishing news of the Iranian elections and visceral, heart-wrenching stories coming out of Tehran, the interweaving story of censorship is gathering pace thanks to the web. While the regime appears to have blocked many communications in the country, activists have launched their own retaliatory attacks to try and capsize the state information machine. Some campaigners have been encouraging web users to help launch denial of service attacks against pro-Ahmadinajad sites - an understandable reaction although, as web guru Clay Shirky wonders, such strikes do not necessarily become legitimate just because they are in the underdog's hands. Social media is also playing its part here, particularly since Iran has a vibrant online scene: people are sending information around the networks and forwarding on important data - though as events snowball, filtering out the noise is difficult. One bright spot has been Twitter, which is popular in Iran and - crucially - appears to have evaded many of the government's attempts to block online communication. According to Jonathan Zittrain, Harvard Law School professor and expert on internet censorship, this is a function of the rather unique way that Twitter has been built. Unlike Facebook, or other systems, Twitter's \"half-baked\" approach is what makes it resilient in such situations: It'd be trivial for the Iranian government to block access to Twitter as it could to any particular Web site ... But Twitter isn't just any particular Web site. It's an atom designed to be built into other molecules. More than most, Twitter allows multiple paths in and out for data ... with so many ways to get those tweets there and back without the user needing twitter.com, it's far more naturally censorship resistant than most other Web sites. Indeed, Twitter has become such an important channel for the spread of Iranian news that a brief pressure campaign got the site's owners to delay some planned downtime to try and reduce the impact on Iranian users. According to co-founder Biz Stone, Twitter and its network host, NTT America, \"recognize the role Twitter is currently playing as an important communication tool in Iran\" and have pushed the maintenance back until the middle of tomorrow night in Tehran.",
