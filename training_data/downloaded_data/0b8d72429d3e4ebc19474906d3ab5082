Having done the first five years last week, we're now into the last five years. As these things go, 2005 saw quite a lot of major changes behind the scenes at Guardian Towers. In September we relaunched the Guardian entirely, changing format and turning what had been called \"Online\" for the past 11 years into Technology Guardian. That brought in a succession of other changes, too: after 40 years of incredible service, our editor, Vic Keegan, retired (though of course, he's remained a columnist). Meanwhile, I moved from working on the weekly section to being the Guardian's technology correspondent, and we were joined by Charles Arthur, who took over running the supplement. With all that happening in the background, there were lots of exciting happenings throughout 2005. The shifts in the media landscape started to become more noticeable - blogging was becoming influential, and a series of big money acquisitions officially ended the dotcom bust. Web 2.0 - officially coined the previous year by publisher and technology magnate Tim O'Reilly - was here. 2005 \u2022 Apple continued making great strides in online music, as people started flocking en masse to the iTunes store. In January, figures confirmed that more than 200m tracks had been downloaded in the past 12 months, while various companies eyed mobile phones as a challenger to the iPod. They had good reason to think consumers might make the switch: in February, European regulators looked into the question of high pricing in Britain. \u2022 It was a year that blogging really started to have an impact on mainstream culture, not least researc suggesting that a new blog was being born every second. The idea of citizen journalism, or really new media came into its own on the grisly morning of July 7, when London was struck by a series of bombings - detailed through cameraphone pictures, blog postings. Not everyone liked the idea, but technology played its part in the rescue efforts, too. \u2022 Mergers and acquisitions began gathering pace early in the year, when Yahoo bought the hotly-tipped photo sharing website Flickr. We interviewed the site's co-founder, Stewart Butterfield, in March and then, later in the year when Yahoo also bought Delicious, we interviewed the executive who had pushed through both buyouts. His explanation: Yahoo was moving into social search. (these days, of course, Yahoo is not a search company). \u2022 In July, Rupert Murdoch surprised everyone by stumping up $580m for MySpace - which went through despite attempts to block the deal. The move followed a powwow between Murdoch and his lieutenants in February in which they thrashed out an internet strategy - with the benefit of hindsight (and given MySpace's troubles) they might rue the day. \u2022 And to make it a trifecta of major buys, eBay dipped into its pockets to fish out $4.1bn to buy the loss-making internet telephony service Skype. Early reports had put the price at between $2bn and \u00a33bn - a tag that eBay would probably have been happier with, given that two years later it wrote off $1.4bn and then earlier this year it fought a legal battle against the company's founders amid plans to spin it off.",
