  "content": "A landmark bid by a US studio to access the private details of thousands of Australians accused of illegally downloading the film Dallas Buyers Club has been dismissed by the federal court. Justice Nye Perram on Wednesday made an order to terminate the proceedings on 11 February after rejecting the latest proposed method by Voltage Pictures to deal with the more than 4,700 internet users it claimed had pirated the 2013 film. The studio can appeal the decision before then. Perram had called earlier proposals \"wholly unrealistic\" and \"so surreal as to not be taken seriously\". Voltage won the right in April to lodge a discovery order with six Australia internet service providers to reveal the names of customers who had allegedly downloaded the Hollywood blockbuster over file-sharing networks. But Perram said at the time the privacy of the 4,726 alleged pirates had to be maintained, and any proposed contact with the users by the studio had to be approved by the court. Voltage was also ordered to pay a $600,000 bond. The conditions were viewed as an attempt to stymie \"speculative invoicing\" \u2014 where studios send alleged copyright infringers letters demanding large sums of money under threat of legal action, which some users may pay to avoid protracted conflict. In August Perram rejected Voltage's first proposed method, including a letter and phone call asking for personal information about alleged pirates, including their salaries. The studio also proposed to seek damages for the cost of a single, legitimate download of the film; the cost of obtaining the customer's details; the number of people who had accessed the uploaded film; and how many non-Voltage films had been downloaded from torrent sites. It amended its proposal last week, suggesting instead to only seek damages for the cost of an individual licence fee and its court costs, and to charge customers a single penalty, rather than one based on their individual circumstances. Voltage also proposed to pay an initial $60,000 bond to access just 472 names. But Perram said the proposal remained unrealistic and \"some finality must now be brought to these proceedings\".",
