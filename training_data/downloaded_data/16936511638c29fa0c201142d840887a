No wonder privacy watchdogs are now considering whether Scotland Yard was guilty of breaching data protection laws following the revelation that officers examined journalists' mobile phone records that the force had been sent in error. According to a report in today's Times, the police scrutinised the phone records of more than 1,700 News UK staff after the data was mistakenly sent to them by the telecoms company Vodafone. It involved phones belonging to journalists, lawyers and other staff working for the Times, Sunday Times and the Sun. The Times's crime editor, Sean O'Neill, reports: \"Despite knowing that the data had been passed to it improperly, Metropolitan police conducted a data analysis of the material, built a spreadsheet listing outgoing calls from 1,757 phones, and held on to the material for seven months despite requests to return it.\" Once Vodafone realised that the data had been sent - as a result of \"human error\" - it demanded its return. O'Neill quotes a Vodafone spokesman as saying: \"After seeking an opinion from a leading human rights QC, we wrote to the Met to express our grave concern that the police continued to retain the data released to them in error.\" Now the Information Commissioner and the Interception of Communications Commissioner's Office (IOCCO) are, quite rightly, looking into the matter. This is yet another disturbing example of the increasingly bitter conflict between the police and media companies. It follows the revelation that police have used surveillance powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to discover journalists' sources. O'Neill has traced how Vodafone's mistake occurred. In October last year, officers working on Operation Elveden - the investigation into alleged payments by journalists to public officials - requested call data from the phone of one arrested reporter. By accident, Vodafone handed over not just that reporter's call details but a dataset covering outgoing calls from 1,757 phones covering three years from 2005-07. But it was months before the Met, having reviewed the data to the extent of making a spreadsheet of the material, contacted the IOCCO to lodge \"a formal error report\". Even so, it is said to have made use of what it called the \"excess data\" to extract information about phone contacts between five more people \u2014 including journalists, their sources and lawyers \u2014 who, writes O'Neill, \"were under suspicion in police investigations into journalistic activity.\" The very use of the phrase \"excess data\" suggests that the police were aware that they had had no authority to retain it and examine it. Therefore, how could they justify a spreadsheet analysis? So, if the Times's story is correct, I'm with Mike Darcey, News UK's chief executive, when he says he is appalled by both Vodafone's error and the subsequent police action. It is another worrying development following the Ripa affair. However, with the greatest respect to Darcey, there is an irony about the episode that will hardly escape the notice of the many Sun journalists arrested in Operation Elvedon. Rupert Murdoch's organisation, through its management and standards committee, handed internal data to the police that compromised their sources. And that didn't happen by accident.",
