  "content": "Google's acquisition of Nest, a learning thermostat and fire alarm company, prompted excitement in some quarters and concerns about privacy in others. Here's how Twitter reacted to the news with characteristic humour and scepticism - much of it to do with the much maligned Google Plus. But soon came the realisation that, Google's acquisition of something installed in your home that monitors your house while you're both there and not, might be slightly undesirable for a company all about data. Resulting in the classic comparison... Eventually the possible privacy implications started to hit home. Eventually resulting in downright paranoia, with some people taking drastic action. Its unknown precisely what Google plans to do with Nest, yet another robotics and intelligent machine-related acquisition, but one thing is for sure \u2013 Google's backdoor invasion of the home is not welcomed by all.",
