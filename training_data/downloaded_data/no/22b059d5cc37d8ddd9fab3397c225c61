  "content": "After more than 40 years in stand-up comedy, music and acting, Billy Connolly has turned his hand to contemporary art. The comedian on Wednesday unveiled to the world a series of pen and ink drawings called Born on a Rainy Day, the result of two years of sketching. It was an interest that came to him late in life, he said. \"Art, for me, bears no relation to comedy or music. My art is pure and 'unjudged'. I am creating it for myself \u2013 it is personal and private whereas with a film, comedy show or music you expect people to be critiquing, watching, assessing. Art is different; it liberates you.\" Prints of Connolly's drawings will go on sale via Castle Galleries.",
