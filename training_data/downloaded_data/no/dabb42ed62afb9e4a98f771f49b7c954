  "content": "Christmas parties are in full flow and we're just 96 hours away from the big day. It's a lovely time of the year, isn't it? Unless, of course, you're my poor, unloved hands. I looked down at them earlier and thought: \"Are these really my Christmas nails? Are these the nails I want to ring in 2015 with?\" The answer was a resounding no. A gaudy, sparkly nail at this time of year is hard to resist, but you can keep things classy with Bobbi Brown's Bordeaux and Scotch (\u00a311 each, bobbibrown.co.uk) \u2013 a deep wine and a separate fine-gold glitter polish. I did four digits in the red and then saved the gold for my pinkies. If shimmer and glitz is not for you, nothing beats the brightest tomato red you can get your paws on. Nails Inc has collaborated with Victoria Beckham to come up with the perfect shade, Judo Red (\u00a325, nailsinc.com), which is both festive and chic.
