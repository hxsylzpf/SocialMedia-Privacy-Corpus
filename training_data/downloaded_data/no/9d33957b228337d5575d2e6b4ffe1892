  "content": "CBS-owned Last.fm has reported a \u00a34.4m pre-tax loss for 2011, as ad revenues stagnated and growth in the US market went into reverse. The UK-founded online music service, which was acquired by CBS for $280m in May 2007, reported a slim increase of 1.7% in total revenues in 2011 from \u00a37.99m to \u00a38.1m. Between 2009 and 2010 total revenue growth was almost 10%. Advertising sales, which account for 70% of total revenues, fell slightly year on year in 2011 to \u00a35.66m. The music streaming and recommendations service managed to slightly increase revenue from subscriptions, up 4.5% year on year, to \u00a31.77m. Last.fm made just more than \u00a34m from the UK market, which accounts for just over 50% of global revenues, up 4.88%. Worryingly in the US, the world's largest music market, Last.fm's revenues fell 4.3% to \u00a32.98m. Revenue from the rest of the world totalled just less than \u00a31m. The company maintains that its aim is to \"become the destination music site for artists and their fans\", according to the latest financial filing at Companies House. Total staff costs climbed slightly to \u00a33.4m, even as numbers dropped from 55 to 51. Administrative expenses decreased very slightly to \u00a38.1m. The company said music licensing fees are its largest expense, the royalties paid to the copyright owners of based on the number of streams played. Average monthly global unique users for the three months ending 31 December were 24.6 million, according to comScore. In 2008 Last.fm made a \u00a317m loss, in 2009 this dropped to \u00a32.8m.
