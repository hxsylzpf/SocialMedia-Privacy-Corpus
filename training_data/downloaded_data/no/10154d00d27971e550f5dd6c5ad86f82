Westerwelle stepped down as leader of the Free Democrats after regional election defeats in May and was replaced by Philipp R\u00f6sler (Indifference rules, 26 June, page 22). \u2022\u2008A leader column remarked that a handshake between the Queen and the former IRA commander Martin McGuinness \"cannot be underestimated in its symbolism and significance\". The opposite was meant: that the significance of the handshake could not be overestimated (When a handshake speaks volumes, 23 June, page 40). \u2022\u2008A calculation went awry in a weather column that drew a parallel with this summer's dismal weather and the storms of June 1944 which affected planning for the D-day invasion of Normandy \"nearly 80 years ago\". That was nearly 70 years ago (Weatherwatch, 25 June, page 33). \u2022\u2008Homophone corner: England's manager \"has performed with a discrete \u00e9lan in his six weeks in the job\" (Supporting role: England fans rejoice, 20 June, page 4).",
