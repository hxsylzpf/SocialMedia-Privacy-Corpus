  "content": "Google has launched a game designed to help researchers and businesses find a much-abused vulnerability common across the web. The game, announced on Wednesday by Google engineer Ilya Grigorik, hopes to encourage better security practices amongst web developers. The vulnerability Google wants to help eradicate is known as a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw. There are various types of XSS, one of the most prevalent of which occurs when a web application accepts input from a user and reflects information back to them without validating the code properly. If an attacker can convince their target to click on a link with the code (usually JavaScript) that exploits this vulnerability, they could do various nasty things to the victim, such as using the code to create fake login boxes for the affected web app or redirecting the user to their own fake site, which could contain further attacks. Or the hacker could have the \"session cookie\", which the site deploys to identify the user, sent to their own machine, meaning they could take control of the account to which the malicious link was originally sent. Then there's so-called \"stored XSS\". An attack targeting this vulnerability would typically have the hacker post their malicious script on an online discussion forum. Once clicked, the script would then be able to steal the same data as the reflective attack, but from all visitors to that forum. In both cases, the user is unlikely to have any idea what has happened. Even though the problems should be simple to fix, XSS remains one of the top three threats in the world, according to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). Google is hoping to fix this with its game, aimed at developers who don't have much security knowledge. \"At Google, we know very well how important these bugs are. In fact, Google is so serious about finding and fixing XSS issues that we are paying mercenaries up to $7,500 for dangerous XSS bugs discovered in our most sensitive products,\" read Google's introductory notes to the game. \"In this training program, you will learn to find and exploit XSS bugs. You'll use this knowledge to confuse and infuriate your adversaries by preventing such bugs from happening in your applications. There will be cake at the end of the test.\" Some very basic JavaScript knowledge is required to play the game and, for those finding the tasks too tricky, there are three hints per level. There are six levels to progress through. Each level effectively walks the player through how an attacker would exploit an XSS flaw on a website, by having them enter code into forms or forum sections of a website.",
