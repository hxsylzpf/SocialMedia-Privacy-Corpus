Ethan Beard, Facebook's director of platform partnerships, told the Dublin Web Summit that 350 million of its 800 million worldwide users are accessing the network through their smartphone. \"The world is moving faster to mobile than any of us expected,\" he said. \"We are seeing users on mobile significantly more engaged.\" Typically mobile phone owners check their accounts far more frequently than computer users but all of Facebook's users are heading in one direction \u2013 consumption of media through curation, or peer recommendation on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. \"There is a fundamental shift in the web from an [experience] based around the internet to a web based around people, where every single page is personalised and content comes to you rather than you going to the content,\" said Beard. Beard said one million people are now using the Guardian application which was launched a month ago and this \"social discovery\" of content would become the norm across all media, even TV. \"When I look at the future and I see this EPG [electronic programme guide] we have now, it's a big grid with 1,000 channels and I can't find what I want. For me the dream system is a DVR, you push one button and it just records all the shows my friends watch.\" Beard defended Facebook's new Timeline and Open Graph features, which enable users to create a birth-to-death profile and to share experiences such as listening to music or reading a newspaper in real time. He said users have the choice of opting in or out of what is being dubbed \"frictionless sharing\" and the company's entire ethos to put the user in control. \"The thing we try to enable in Facebook is to give users a high amount of control of what they share and who they share it with,\" said Beard.",
