  "content": "The last words of Eric Garner, the 43-year-old man who died after being placed in an chokehold by New York police officers in Staten Island in July, have found a new audience on social media, thanks to a teenage poet from Minnesota. Jason Fotso, 17, from Maple Grove near Minneapolis and now a freshman at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, constructed a poem, Last Words, out of the letters that make up the words said by Garner as he struggled with police in an arrest that was filmed by a passerby. Fotso's poem begins: I \u2013 I \u2013 I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't be. You see me. You see thug. You see sin. I see the letters of \"hate\" alive in your \"heart\". Can't I breathe? Can't I breathe? Can't I be? Fotso told the Guardian he had been writing poetry that \"aims to speak out against injustices\" since high school. But he has only been tweeting his poems, as @voice, for a little over a month \u2013 a period that has seen widespread protest and unrest over the deaths of a number of unarmed black men at the hands of (often) white police officers. By Saturday afternoon more than 8,500 people were following Fotso on Twitter. His original tweet containing the poem Last Words had been retweeted more than 19,000 times and favourited nearly 20,000 times. Grand jury decisions not to indict police officers involved in the deaths of Garner and Michael Brown, another unarmed black man who was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri in August, have contributed \u2013 with a number of similar cases \u2013 to protests across the US that have often featured the use of slogans based on the dead men's last words. Protests over Brown's death have used the phrase \"Hands up, don't shoot\", based on witness statements which said he was in the act of surrendering to officer Darren Wilson when he was shot. The death of Garner, which was captured on video, has prompted protesters to make use of the phrase \"I can't breathe\". \"I originally re-posted my 'Ferguson' poem as my response to the no indictment decision in the Eric Garner case, stating that it was simply a 'different day, new name, same story,'\" Fotso told the Guardian by email. \"Upon coming across pictures of Eric Garner's tragic last words, I was moved to write the 'Last Words' poem by rearranging the exact same letters in the entirety of his painful words.\" The full poem appeared on Twitter. \"I participated in a vigil for Michael Brown,\" Fotso added, \"which was hosted by Duke students at the university's monumental chapel, where I read my Ferguson poem. \"I have been writing poems that aim to speak out against injustices since my junior year of high school, but it was not until my former classmates at Maple Grove Senior High, a community which I am genuinely thankful for, were supportive of my Ferguson poem when I tweeted it out on a personal account, that I conceived the idea of starting @voice and sharing my poems there. \"I would like my poetry to capture and captivate the voice of young America, as well as inspire others my age to share their written and artistic work.\" Fotso said he would describe the thematic spread of his poetry as \"nightmare, nostalgia. Nightmare, referring to any injustices that I wish to speak out against in my writing, and nostalgia, referring to my poems that cover topics such as love, loss, memories, and ultimately, youth.\" His favorite poem, he said, is We Real Cool by the Pulitzer Prize winner Gwendolyn Brooks.",
