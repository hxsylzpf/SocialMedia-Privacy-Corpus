  "content": "An alliance of US technology companies \u2013 including the \"big five\" named in the NSA's Prism project \u2013 and civil liberties groups have written to President Barack Obama and the leaders of the US Senate and House of Representatives demanding to be allowed to publish data about secret demands for user data. AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo are among 46 signatories to the letter asking to publish \"specific numbers\" of requests under the US Patriot Act and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). All six were named as among those participating in the Prism project. In all, 22 companies have signed the letter and 24 pressure groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which have both been vocal in their criticism of NSA acquisition of data revealed by the Guardian over the past two months. Yet US phone groups such as AT&amp;T and Verizon did not join the signatories. A document detailing how Verizon is obliged to make phone call metadata \u2013 such as numbers, times and duration \u2013 available to the NSA triggered off the row about data and privacy when the Guardian made its existence public in June. The demand for publication comes as pressure on the US government grows in the face of the widening revelations about the extent and ease of the National Security Agency (NSA) access to personal data. On Wednesday a sometimes heated hearing of the House Judiciary Committee saw both Republican and Democrat politicians claim that the administration had overstepped its authority in the breadth of its data collection. Some indicated that they might seek to revoke or not renew the NSA's powers to collect data such as phone call \"metadata\" in bulk. The signatories to the letter also demand that the government issue its own annual \"transparency report\" providing the same information: \"the total number of requests under specific [national security] authorities for specific types of data, and the number of individuals affected by each\". They also call on the Senate and House of Representatives to pass laws requiring that transparency from the government, and allowing companies to publish data about the number of FISA and Patriot requests without seeking permission from the secret FISA court. The move follows similar calls to be allowed to publish FISA statistics by individual companies including Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. But now it has the force of a concerted effort, as some have grown concerned at the commercial impact of the revelations that the NSA can access data stored on the cloud servers of Google or Microsoft. Facebook, Yahoo and Apple have also been concerned at the potential harm to user trust in their privacy.",
