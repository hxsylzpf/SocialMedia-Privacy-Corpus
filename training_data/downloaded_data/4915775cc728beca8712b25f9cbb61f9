  "content": "Surrey police has provided more details of its dealings with the News of the World during its investigation into the disappearance of teenager Milly Dowler in 2002, in a letter published online on Monday by the Commons culture, media and sport select committee. Dowler went missing on 21 March 2002 and her body was discovered in September that year. Levi Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and murdering the 13-year-old schoolgirl in June 2011. In the letter to culture select committee chairman John Whittingdale, Surrey police stress that this is its \"present understanding\" and that the internal investigation into allegations that Dowler's mobile phone voicemail was accessed by the News of the World \"is not yet complete\". The chronology is based on \"contemporaneous police records and a log of contacts with the media kept by the Surrey police press officer\". 26 March 2002 Surrey police downloads one message from Dowler's voicemail \u2013 details of this have been passed to the Leveson inquiry. Saturday 13 April 2002 12.10pm: The co-owner of a recruitment agency phoned Surrey police to say: \"We have a New of the World reporter, [name redacted] harassing us today.\" The caller went on to say that the reporter was saying the agency had recruited Milly Dowler as an employee, \"demanding to know what we know and saying he is working in full cooperation with the police\". In its letter to the culture committee, Surrey police said: \"It should be noted that the NoW reporter's assertion that he was working with the police was untrue.\" 12.15pm: Surrey police's press officer called someone at the NoW (name redacted), who said he was not aware of any developments in the Dowler investigation in the area where the recruitment agency was located. 4.40pm: An individual from the NoW (name redacted) called the Surrey police press officer saying they wanted to speak to a senior officer working on the Dowler case. 5.20pm: After calling back several times but finding the number engaged, a Surrey police officer finally got through to the NoW journalist, who told him about what the paper thought was an approach for work to the recruitment agency by a woman purporting to be Milly Dowler on 27 March, based on a voicemail message. The journalist said that the NoW \"was in possession of a recording of the voicemail\" and had confirmed with Dowler's school friends \"that this was her mobile phone number\". After consulting the press officer, the Surrey officer told the NoW journalist the investigation had been \"dogged by a professional hoaxer purporting to be Milly\". Later on 13 April: The same police officer received a call from an NoW journalist (name redacted) saying the paper was confident of its sources and was intending to print the information it had relayed to Surrey police as a story the following day (Sunday 14 April). An NoW journalist also recounted a message from Milly Dowler's voicemail on 27 March 2002: \"Hello Mandy. This is [redacted] from [redacted] Recruitment Agency. We are ringing because we are starting interviewing today at [redacted]. Call back on [redacted]. Thanks, bye bye.\" The officer was also told by someone from the NoW that there were other voicemail messages from a tearful relative, a young boy and someone saying \"It's America, take it or leave it\"; and an undercover reporter purporting to be a friend of Milly Dowler had spoken to someone at the recruitment agency, who had confirmed that \"Amanda Dowler\" was registered with them but declined to confirm whether she had received any employment offer. In its letter to the culture committee, Surrey police said there is \"no evidence that the recruitment agency confirmed that 'Amanda Dowler' was on the agency's books, the contrary is the case\". The Surrey police officer reiterated his view that the NoW was being subjected to a hoax, but agreed to provide an official response within the hour. Later on 13 April: The Surrey police press officer spoke to an NoW journalist (name redacted) and asked him why he was so convinced that the message on Milly's voicemail was not a hoax. They replied that the paper \"had got Milly's mobile phone number and pin from schoolchildren\"; said they had taped messages from her phone; and repeated almost word for word the 27 March message about the recruitment agency and interviews. The NoW journalist added that they had spoken to a member of the recruitment agency's staff on 12 April who had confirmed that a \"Mandy D\" had registered with the agency but could not confirm whether they had got a job as it would contravene data protection \u2013 and said the paper had five reporters working on the story. 7.30pm: The Surrey police press officer spoke again to an unnamed NoW journalist who said the paper had two versions of the recruitment agency voicemail message story ready to go for the following day, one saying police were treating it as a hoax and other that they were treating it as a new line of inquiry. The press officer said she would need to time to provide an official response. 8.10pm: An NoW journalist (name redacted) called the Surrey police press officer again and said the paper was going to run a story the following day with the following quote from the force: \"We are intrigued, but believe the message may have been left by a deranged woman hoaxer thought to have hampered other police inquiries.\" The press officer said this wording was too strong and asked for a couple of minutes to provide an alternative, but was told it was too late for first edition. After agreeing it with a police officer, the press officer called the NoW journalist back with the line: \"We are evaluating the claim that Amanda may have registered with a recruitment agency. At this stage there is the possibility that a hoaxer may be involved in generating this story.\" She was told it would be used in all five NoW editions except the first, circulated in the north of the UK. Sunday 14 April In the morning, the senior investigating officer of Surrey police's Milly Dowler investigation, Operation Ruby, approved the following line for media inquiries about the NoW story: \"We are evaluating a claim by the News of the World that Amanda may have registered with a recruitment agency. At this stage there is a possibility that a hoaxer may be involved in generating the story.\" The following off the record guidance was also approved: \"At this stage we are confident that this woman attending the recruitment agency is a hoaxer and not Milly. This woman is older than Milly and hence would be able to register at a recruitment agency (would question how a 13-year-old would be able to register for a job).\" Monday 15 April West Mercia police, which covers Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire, contacted Surrey police with result of investigations they had been asked to undertake with the recruitment agency. A member of the agency's staff stated that they had no one called Amanda Dowler (or anyone with the name of hoaxer) on their books. Nor had she ever, to her knowledge, spoken to a reporter from the NoW. Wednesday 17 April Surrey police performed a second download of voicemail messages from Milly's mobile phone, one of which was the 27 March message played to an officer and the press officer by an NoW journalist over the phone on 13 April. Thursday 18 April The Surrey police press officer was talking to an NoW journalist (name redacted) about another matter in relation to the Milly investigation and stated she would get back to him to clarify the situation regarding the \"hoax woman\". The journalist said he was \"convinced that Milly had run away to the north of England and was seeking a job there\". Friday 19 April A Surrey police officer listened to the 27 March voicemail message from Milly's voicemail and formed the view that the name of the person for whom the message was being left sounded like \"Nana\" rather than \"Mandy\". The officer called the agency and was told that they had a lot of ladies from Ghana on their books and \"Nana\" was a popular Ghanaian name. Later someone from the agency called the police officer and told her that a Ghanaian lady called Nana, who had been registered with them approximately 12 months previously, had called on 26 March to give them her new mobile number. This mobile number was recorded in the agency's files as the same as Milly's number. There was an entry on Nana's file stating that the agency had contacted her on 27 March and left a message on her mobile voicemail about job interviews. The recruitment agency member of staff did not know if the phone number was written down incorrectly or whether Nana had given the wrong number. In its letter to the select committee, Surrey police stated: \"Contrary to Surrey police's initial suspicions, the message left on Milly's mobile phone voicemail on 27 March 2002 by the recruitment agency was not the work of a hoaxer but a pure coincidence. It was in any event of no evidential value in the investigation into Milly's disappearance.\" Saturday 20 April 9.46am: An NoW journalist (name redacted) emailed the Surrey police press officer, recounting what the paper had done with its Milly story the previous weekend and asking for clarification and further information about a number of matters as \"a matter of urgency\". 3.15pm: The Surrey police press officer called the NoW journalist back and gave him the official line about the \"hoaxer\": \"Surrey police, Crimewatch, Missing Persons Helpline and other police forces have received calls for [sic] a hoaxer pretending to be Amanda. These calls are not helpful to the investigation of missing schoolgirl Amanda Dowler. We are liasing with other police forces to consider what action to take.\" Using a prepared script approved by a police officer, the press officer also gave the NoW journalist guidance about the recruitment agency voicemail story: \"We believe the agency incorrectly wrote down the mobile phone number of Amanda's or the woman seeking employment accidently gave her mobile number as that of Amanda's. We have listened to a recording of [the] message and it does not actually say 'Mandy'. We do not believe that the hoax woman was involved in this incident. No one has enrolled with the agency using the name Amanda Dowler.\" The NoW journalist responded by saying that what the press officer was telling him was \"not true and inconceivable\". They referred to other messages on Milly's phone \u2013 \"It is America, take it or leave it\" \u2013 said the paper was moving its investigation to the north of England, and that Milly had been there and had applied for a job in a factory. He said the NoW \"Know this 110%. We are absolutely certain\", but was not going to run it as a story.",
