  "content": "It's a sad irony of modern living that the moment you're up close and personal with someone, your head in their armpit, their breath on your neck, is the moment at which you're most likely to be distracted by a multitude of ads for dating websites and apps promising to hook up you up with whatever creed, caste or predilection you'd care to specify. Buses and tube carriages are crammed not only with lonely hearts, but also with their promised salvation. Match.com, eHarmony, Elite Singles, Attractive Professionals, Dirty Yuppies. (Only one of those is made up.) So even when you're out and about, you're gazing intently at someone you've never met on a screen, rather than twinkling at the one in the seat opposite. I'm not against internet dating \u2013 it's the sexual revolution of our time. It's the liberation of our incomplete Platonic halves from tongue-tied chat-up lines and waiting for a call, from tearing around after good-looking people who aren't interested in us and trying to shake off bad-looking ones who are. It's a force for good. But there's something about the profusion, immediacy and ubiquity of them now that is alarming. When I was last single, Tinder (now with 10 million active daily users) wasn't on the scene. Internet dating \u2013 while thankfully totally normalised since the days when everyone thought it was weird \u2013 was an option, but it wasn't an instinct. Now it's everywhere and most busy, young, single people use one form or another. And why not? Tweeting over twinkling probably yields more romantic success in the long run. Thank goodness we're released from the creaky courtship rituals of yesteryear: no more despair at never meeting anyone; just log on and take control. No more mumbling your way over to a girl at the bar who probably already has a boyfriend. Except that with the chat-up lines and dutch courage goes a natural equilibrium between the sexes. None of us are good at saying what we mean; now dating sites mean that we don't have to. They're easily abused in a way that exaggerates ever further the imbalance of power and the Mars v Venus between men and women, reinforcing stereotypes and negative associations. I'm talking about the overwhelming use of these sites for casual sex and one-night hook-ups. There's a reason why My Single Friend became known colloquially as something else you do with an F. The GPS function of the mobile app Tinder fulfils not only the promise of finding you The One within a two-mile radius, it also means you don't have walk very far if you're lonely at 3am. I have no moral problem with one-night stands, but I'm not convinced both genders sign up with this in mind. Certainly, they don't in equal numbers. That doesn't make women naive victims but it strengthens the age-old cliche that we're looking for love and you're just looking down our tops. And that doesn't help either side get what they want. Then there's the inevitable superficiality that comes of choosing someone based on their profile picture rather than their personality. If that sounds self-righteous then, yes, the selection of a mate has always been shallow and emotionally brutal, but we don't need sites that make it even more so. Not at the point when women have gained their most equal footing, not among the first generation to have been brought up without the usual prejudices. There's something distasteful about the ritual, which many users describe, of leering at possibles with your friends and laughing at the lower leagues. And there's something unsustainable about it too, in the same way that Photoshop and pornography impair our relationships with others and with ourselves. Tinder's side-swiping pickiness reduces us to Henry VIII, poring over flattering portraits of young European princesses and then stamping his foot when the original fails to impress. It makes chattels of us all. Bring back the old days of meat market discos: a fair and square means of getting off with someone you may not even like, while honing your skills for when you meet someone you do. Dating websites and apps don't teach us anything about nurturing a relationship or the fulfilment you can expect from a good one. In this way, we're like teenage boys, playing video games at home all day and then wondering why they find women so hard to talk to.",
