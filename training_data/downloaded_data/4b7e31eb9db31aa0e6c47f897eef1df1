  "content": "A Facebook game that lets users 'shank' each other - street slang for stabbing - has been removed following complaints from anti-knife crime campaigners. The virtual \"shank\" appears as an icon within the Facebook Superpoke! application. Superpoke! allows users to send virtual actions to other users such as smile, wink, take part in the Tour de France or send a bouquet. Although the application consists of mostly humorous actions, some of the options, such as smack, slap and shank, have darker connotations. When the knife icon is sent to a Facebook friend they receive a message saying that they have been \"shanked\". The application, made by US firm Slide for Facebook users, has now been removed from the social networking website. Superpoke! and Facebook came in for criticism in today's Sun. The uncle of Rob Knox, the Harry Potter actor who died after being stabbed in May, told the paper that the application \"incited violence\". Anti-knife campaign group Urban Concepts condemned the shank application, branding it \"appalling\". \"The story refers to an application called Superpoke! made by Slide,\" said a spokeswoman for Facebook. \"Slide have actually removed the 'shank' option from Superpoke!.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
