The deal appears to be an attempt to confound Google by making Facebook the largest space on the web that the search engine cannot index properly. It will also gain three of Google's former star employees who played a vital role in developing its biggest money-making ideas. \"Since I first tried FriendFeed, I've admired their team for creating such a simple and elegant service for people to share information,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and chief executive of Facebook in the official announcement. It appears that he wants the team \u2013 not the site itself. Facebook is reckoned to have spent around $50m ($15m in cash and the rest in its own stock) acquiring FriendFeed, a social networking site that employs a team of 12 people, of whom eight are former Google staff. Although FriendFeed's users number about 250,000 \u2013 a minnow compared with Facebook's 250 million \u2013 some had thought it offered a path through the perplexing proliferation of such sites: integrating on a single page whatever you did or posted on Facebook, Twitter or dozens of other sites, and creating a \"feed\" like Facebook's personal \"wall\" for each user. But the real key was the team behind it: Paul Buchheit, Bret Taylor, Sanjeev Singh and Jim Norris left Google in mid-2007, set up FriendFeed in October and made it public in February 2008. They raised $15m venture capital, making Monday, when the deal was done, a fairly successful payday for investors. The founders' track record at Google is impressive and explains why Zuckerberg was keen to get their expertise on board. Buchheit, the 23rd employee at Google, came up with its \"Don't be evil\" motto. He also developed the prototype of its lucrative AdSense program while developing the Gmail webmail service. Singh worked on Gmail and the Google Search Appliance for companies while Taylor was group product manager for development of Google Maps. The challenge for Facebook is to stay ahead of Google. To do that, its founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg knows that he has both to limit Google's access to Facebook's content \u2013 because letting it index all of Facebook's millions of pages would simply give up advertising revenue to the search giant \u2013 while making Facebook easier to navigate and search than it is now. And he needs to find ways to serve more relevant adverts, so that he can keep bringing in the money to keep expanding the site. The FriendFeed team will in effect become Facebook's research team, trying to find ways to implement that improved search and pull people who would otherwise be using external networks \u2013 particularly Twitter \u2013 on to Facebook. Zuckerberg wants Facebook to be more than a place to talk to your friends: ultimately, he wants it to be an internet in itself where his company knows what is going on all the time. Searching questions For Google, that ambition poses a real problem. Its difficulty is that when trying to index sites such as Facebook and Twitter, its traditional method of determining what is important in a search fails. Google gained its ascendancy through its \"reputation\" system: if, for a given search phrase, more sites link to web page A than web page B, then A will come higher in the search results. But on Facebook or Twitter, that \"inbound links\" method breaks down, because a user's number of friends or \"followers\" is not necessarily a measure of accuracy or knowledge; it's purely personal, or sometimes fortuitous. And the links on those networks are fleeting: a Facebook posting may be popular for a day and then effectively vanish to be replaced in popularity by something similar but different. With better internal searching, Facebook will know what's hot from hour to hour. Google, unable to index all that content, and unable \u2013 using its previously successful algorithm \u2013 to work out what's really important, will struggle to keep up. Perhaps it's no accident that this morning it announced a \"caffeinated\" version of its search engine, offering \"the first step in a process that will let us push the envelope on size, indexing speed, accuracy, comprehensiveness and other dimensions\". And Twitter? It is substantially bigger than FriendFeed, but still tiny compared to Facebook. The question will be whether it chooses to side with Google or with Facebook. If enough people start posting to Twitter from a FriendFeed that is incorporated into Facebook, the gravitational attraction of the larger network may become irresistible \u2013 unless Google leaps in first.",
