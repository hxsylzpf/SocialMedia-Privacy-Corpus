  "content": "New South Wales' move to criminalise the phenomenon known as \"revenge porn\" has highlighted the piecemeal approach being taken to what some have said should be a federal issue. The unauthorised sharing of intimate or explicit images is not against Australian federal law, despite the recommendations of a Senate committee earlier this year that it be criminalised. The Senate legal and constitutional affairs references committee said in a report in February that federal offences should be legislated for recording and sharing intimate photographs or footage \u2013 as well as threatening to do so \u2013 without consent. It also advised that state and territories \"enact legislation with offences the same or substantially similar\". Victoria is currently the only jurisdiction in Australia where such a practice is against the law. The state passed the crimes amendment (sexual offences and other matters) bill in August 2014 to both criminalise nonconsensual sharing and to protect young people who take and share images of themselves consensually. The Age reported in late July that 174 offences had been recorded under the laws since their introduction, with around 29% involving minors aged between 10 and 17. Other states and territories have moved to follow suit since the Senate committee's findings. The South Australian attorney general, John Rau, drafted similar laws earlier this year that would carry a maximum penalty of a $20,000 fine or four years' imprisonment. A spokesman for Rau confirmed the bill was still before parliament, with the upper and lower houses yet to agree on amendments. Most recently, the NSW government is considering criminalising the practice in response to a parliamentary justice committee inquiry into privacy, which tabled its report on Monday. The state attorney general, Gabrielle Upton, said the government would begin the consultation process soon to determine the phrasing and scope of the legislation and what penalties should apply. There has also been a push for similar laws to be introduced in Western Australia. But there are no efforts under way to outlaw the practice under federal law, despite the Senate committee's recommendation of a unified approach. Tim Watts and Terri Butler, both Labor MPs, introduced a private members' bill to the House of Representatives in October last year that proposed amending the Criminal Code Act 1995 to create new offences for \"revenge porn\". The bill lapsed in mid-April when the July election was called. Guardian Australia has contacted Buttler and Watts to ask if they intend to reintroduce the bill. The charge of using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend under present commonwealth telecommunications legislation has been used for such offences in the past. It carries a maximum penalty of three years' imprisonment. In 2012, 20-year-old Ravshan \"Ronnie\" Usmanov was given a six-month suspended jail sentence for posting six intimate images of his ex-girlfriend to his Facebook page in October 2011. She had ended their relationship less than three months earlier. According to the Sydney Morning Herald's report, he told police: \"I put the photos up because she hurt me and it was the only thing [I had] to hurt her.\" Jane Mottley, the deputy chief magistrate, said in sentencing Usmanov \"incalculable damage\" could be done to a person's reputation through \"irresponsible posting\" on Facebook. \"With its popularity and potential for real harm, there is a genuine need to ensure the use of this medium to commit offences of this type is deterred.\" At the time, the court could cite just one other relevant case, in New Zealand in 2010, when a 20-year-old man had been sentenced to four months' imprisonment for posting nude photographs of his ex-girlfriend on Facebook. Several countries have taken steps against the practice in recent years, which the Senate committee assessed in presenting its findings. England and Wales introduced laws against the nonconsensual sharing of images in April last year. Two months later, an American woman commenced a landmark legal battle in England against her former boyfriend for posting a video online of the two of them having sex. A US federal law on disseminating a nude or sexually explicit image without consent has been drafted but not yet introduced. The penalty would carry a maximum prison term of five years.",
