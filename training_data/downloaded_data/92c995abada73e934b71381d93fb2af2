  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission today rejected a privacy complaint on behalf of a serving police officer against a newspaper that published his Facebook status update commenting on the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests. In its ruling the PCC said the police officer's privacy had not been invaded because the reporting of this comment was in the public interest. After the death of Tomlinson during the London G20 protests in April, the officer posted an update stating: \"I see my lot have murdered someone again. Oh well, shit happens.\" The People ran a story about the Facebook comment and another comment the officer made on Friends Reunited. Trinity Mirror's Sunday title told the PCC it found out about the comments from someone who had access to the officer's Facebook profile \u2013\u2013 one of the newspaper's journalists whom the complainant had briefly accepted as a friend. \"The commission has recently made clear that it can be acceptable in some circumstances for the press to publish information taken from social networking websites, even when the material is originally intended for a small group of acquaintances and not publicly accessible. However, this will generally be only in cases where the public interest overrides the individual's right to privacy,\" the PCC said. \"The commission was persuaded that this was such a case. The individual in question was a serving police officer, commenting on a matter that was the subject of considerable media and public scrutiny. He had done so in a way that made light of a person's death and the role apparently played by the police. There was a clear public interest in knowing about police attitudes, whether publicly or privately expressed, towards the incident.\" A picture of the officer on his private driveway and a picture taken from his sister's Friends Reunited profile showing him in uniform were published by the People, but the PCC rejected complaints that the images were an invasion of privacy. The PCC also rejected a complaint that the story had been obtained via subterfuge and that it was inaccurate because it gave a misleading impression of his character because it had been solely taken from his remarks on social networking sites and not comments made in his home. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
