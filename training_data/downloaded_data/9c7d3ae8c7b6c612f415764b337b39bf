  "content": "\"We don't have a choice on whether we do social media. The question is how well we do it.\" These profound words from US web guru Erik Qualman have been front of mind this week as I've been casting a critical eye over my use of social media, Twitter in particular. I still have a paltry number of followers, few of whom appear to have an appetite for executive coaching. After using Derek's swinging metaphor to describe LIONs [a LinkedIn Open Networker] on LinkedIn, I got a \"follow\" from an \"online social community for couples in the swinger lifestyle \u2013 your first year free!\" This was a connection of a sort I hadn't planned. Naturally, I followed back but I'm not sure Sandra would approve. \"Imagine what might have happened if you'd used a hashtag,\" said Phil, my shaven-headed social media guru. Phil insists this is part of building my social audience. \"It's all about the conversation,\" he says. So he was delighted to hear that I planned this week to go to an HR Tweetup that I'd heard about on Twitter. \"Tweetups are great,\" he said. In case you're new to the concept, Tweetups are face-to-face meet-ups for people who only know one-another on Twitter. The HR Tweetup was organized by Maria, a London-based consultant and something of a \"maven\" in the HR social media world. In a cordoned-off area of a Soho bar, the event was a heady mixture of people from in and around London who have a passion for both HR and social media. We were all encouraged to write our Twitter handles on sticky labels and put them on our lapels (mine is @gwadhurst by the way \u2013 follow me!). This was a great idea but it was not obvious at first glance who was a consultant and who was a corporate HR person \u2013 with budget and potential coaching requirements. Inevitably I found myself talking to a succession of people very much in my own mould. Towards the end of the evening, I was at the bar with a young lady playing with her iPhone. I introduced myself and asked what she did. @Lucy (I'll spare you her full handle) turned out to be part of the HR team at a large construction firm. She was there with a colleague who was mingling. I was already into an accelerated version of my coaching pitch when Lucy's colleague, Jan, appeared clutching an iPhone of her own. \"Sorry to interrupt,\" she said to Lucy, giggling, \"but have you seen Paula's tweet?\" Paula, it turned out, was another member of the HR team sadly unable to join us. Lucy looked at her phone and gasped in wide-eyed amazement. \"OMG!\" she said. \"That's outrageous!\" She began tapping at her screen. \"I'm so going to retweet that.\" \"Me too,\" said Jan. By the time they both lifted their lit-up faces from their phones, my efforts to initiate a coaching conversation were thwarted by their need to dash for a train. \"Let's stay in touch,\" I suggested to Lucy, offering a card. \"Follow me on Twitter,\" she said as she headed for the door, \"I'll follow you back.\"",
