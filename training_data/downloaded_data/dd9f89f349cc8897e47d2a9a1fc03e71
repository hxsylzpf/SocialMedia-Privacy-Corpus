  "content": "Lord Browne could now face a perjury trial, after the Mail on Sunday promised to hand over its evidence against the former BP chief executive to the attorney general. The Mail on Sunday made a pointed reference to Jeffrey Archer and Jonathan Aitken in a statement released after Lord Browne resigned yesterday over lying to a court about his relationship with another man. Both Lord Archer and Mr Aitken went to jail for perjury after legal battles with the media. Lord Archer was jailed in 2001 for perjury and perverting the course of justice over his successful 1987 libel trial against the Daily Star. Mr Aitken was found guilty of perjury in 1999 and jailed for 18 months for perjury and perverting the course of justice in a doomed libel case against the Guardian and Granada Television. \"Jeffrey Archer and Jonathan Aitken went to prison for lying to the courts. The Mail on Sunday will be making its evidence in this case available to the attorney general,\" the Mail on Sunday said. In a strongly worded statement, the paper claimed Lord Browne had lied \"deliberately and repeatedly\" under oath in court. The Mail on Sunday said this raised \"deeply worrying questions about the system of secret court hearing which is increasingly being used by the rich and powerful to prevent the public knowing the truth about their activities\". \"It is also a matter of great concern that such hearings are being used to create a privacy law, made by judges sitting alone and in secret, without reference to parliament,\" the paper added. \"The Mail on Sunday deplores the fact that, despite lying to the court, Lord Browne was granted an injunction suppressing information of great importance both to the millions of Britons who, through their pensions, are shareholders in BP, and to the tens of thousands who work for the company. \"It was in seeking an injunction to suppress this story that Lord Browne lied about his private life, thereby making it central to the case.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
