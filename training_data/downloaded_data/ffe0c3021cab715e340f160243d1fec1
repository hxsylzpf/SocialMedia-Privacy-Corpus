  "content": "When Betty Ford, who died last week, first publicly described her addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs in the 1980s, she provided comfort to many. By revealing that even the First Lady of the US could suffer from addiction, she must have made thousands of similar conversations easier for men and women who'd been unable to confess to and confront their own addictions. We still tend to think that alcoholics or problem drug users will be easy to spot, but Ford highlighted the problem of \"functional\" addicts, the type who can deceive others and themselves that there's no problem. \"My makeup wasn't smeared,\" she commented, \"I wasn't dishevelled, I behaved politely, and I never finished off a bottle, so how could I be alcoholic?\" People cared about her and were inspired by her struggle. And the Betty Ford Centre has helped thousands of people through rehabilitation. Of course, what was once a courageous revelation sometimes seems now to have become almost compulsory. So many famous people have passed through the Betty Ford Centre's doors. I greet news of another celebrity's addiction with a dull sadness, wishing them a full recovery, hoping they won't relapse, that, like Robert Downey Jr \u2013 who felt like he had \"a loaded gun in [his] mouth and [liked] the taste of metal\"\u2013 they'll find a way to heal themselves. But it's not a surprise. It sometimes seems that everyone is addicted to something. And it's not just drugs and alcohol. We suffer these days from the various neuroses of abundance \u2013 not exactly addictions but compulsive behaviours in which many of us constantly return to some source of distraction. There seem to be so many things for which \u2013 like dogs with food \u2013 many of us apparently have no natural \"off\" switch. Because I write about video games, I'm often asked \u2013 typically by worried parents \u2013 whether I believe in video game \"addiction\". I don't \u2013 addiction is too strong a word, and should be reserved for substances that produce a withdrawal reaction in the body \u2013 but I certainly believe in video game compulsion. Games are a way to turn off the real world for a while. But they're not the only thing people use in this way. Easy access to credit has allowed the non-wealthy to become compulsive shoppers. The flood of images on the internet has provided the opportunity for porn-compulsion. The relative cheapness of mass-produced products \u2013 which were unknown 200 years ago \u2013 leads some to hoard compulsively. And the internet itself \u2013 a source of unlimited information \u2013 can become compulsive. I've been unable to drag myself away from the Murdoch scandal this week. It's a fascinating story, of course, and an important one, but I sometimes notice that my internet faffing is just a way of distracting myself from some unpleasant thought or feeling. I should really tackle that difficult piece of work, I think, then distract myself online for half an hour. One of the hardest challenges posed by the modern world is how to deal with abundance. It's even harder to confront because admitting that it's a problem seems spoiled. \"Oh, you have too many different forms of entertainment? Are your diamond shoes pinching you, too? Is your champagne fountain too loud for you to hear your string quartet?\" I often think of my maternal grandmother's life: she never had a passport, never left the country, never owned a television, made her own clothes, and her greatest pleasure was reading books borrowed from the library. It makes me feel spoiled to admit that I spend money on things I neither need nor particularly want just because I'm bored, that I have trouble turning off the internet to concentrate on work. Perhaps I could take inspiration from Betty Ford. If something is a problem, it's all right to admit it. So I admit it. And is there a solution to these low-grade compulsions? The Betty Ford Centre doesn't treat the compulsion to check Facebook, or to turn on the TV instead of facing your emotions. I'm on the faculty of The School of Life, a social enterprise in London that aims to use the history of philosophy and thought to help with modern living. In an evening class I teach on \"How to Be Calm\" we talk about how to deal with difficult emotions. Expressing rage or anxiety explosively can be damaging. But as the philosopher Julian Baggini has said: \"When you try to cool down hot emotions \u2026 you end up either repressing them or losing them altogether. Neither is desirable.\" So what are we to do with these troublesome emotions? Not flick to Twitter. Not buy something we don't need. Not turn on the TV. Just feel them.",
