Police were called to the arts centre on St Kilda Road at 3.30am and attempted to negotiate with the two women, according to Fairfax Media. The pair eventually unfurled a #LetThemStay banner, in reference to the 267 asylum seekers facing deportation to Nauru after the high court found Australia's offshore detention regime was legal. Last week, Whistleblowers Activists &amp; Citizens Alliance (Waca) activists Katherine Woskett, 25, and Hannah Patchett, 22, suspended themselves from a Melbourne bridge as part of a Let Them Stay protest against the possible deportation of 267 asylum seekers to Nauru. The #LetThemStay slogan has become the rallying cry to keep the asylum seekers in Australia, with protests across Australia. Most of the group of 267 have been brought to Australia from Nauru for their own, or a family member's, medical treatment. The group includes 37 babies born in Australia, as well as 54 children, more than 30 of whom are now attending Australian schools. On Friday morning, Waca posted a tweet asking their followers to \"stay tuned\" for direct action. Waca then confirmed on Twitter that \"Kat &amp; Hannah\" were the pair unfurling the banner.",
