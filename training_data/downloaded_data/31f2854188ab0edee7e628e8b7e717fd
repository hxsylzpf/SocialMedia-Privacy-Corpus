  "content": "It was at 7:50am on Thursday July 10 when it all started to go really wrong for the News of the World. It was then, on the fourth day of Max Mosley's privacy action, that the paper's barrister, Mark Warby QC, received the devastating news from his clients. Woman E, the dominatrix paid \u00a312,000 to secretly film Mosley in a sadomasochistic orgy, wasn't coming to court that morning to appear as the paper's star witness after all. \"Her emotional and mental state is such that it would not be fair or reasonable to call her to give evidence,\" Warby told the judge, Mr Justice Eady. With this humiliating climbdown, the already precarious case looked set to topple. But it didn't. Woman E's no-show forced the Sunday paper to drop one of its central claims - that Mosley, the 68-year-old president of Formula One's governing body, the FIA, and son of the 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, had pre-ordered a Nazi-themed orgy from the five dominatrices he each paid \u00a3500 for the five-hour session. But it didn't stop the paper continuing to insist that what it filmed was, as it declared on its front page on March 30, a \"sick Nazi orgy\". Yesterday, the paper lost, on most, but not all, counts. Ordering the News of the World to pay Mosley \u00a360,000 damages, the highest for a privacy action in recent legal history, plus an as-yet-undecided proportion of Mosley's estimated \u00a3450,000 legal costs, the judge ruled there was no Nazi flavour to what Mosley had always maintained was simply a private \"party\". \"I decided that the claimant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to sexual activities (albeit unconventional) carried on between consenting adults on private property,\" said Mr Justice Eady in his ruling. \"I found that there was no evidence that the gathering on 28 March 2008 was intended to be an enactment of Nazi behaviour or adoption of any of its attitudes. Nor was it in fact. I see no genuine basis at all for the suggestion that the participants mocked the victims of the Holocaust.\" Because of this, he said, he was \"unable to identify any legitimate public interest to justify either the intrusion of secret filming or the subsequent publication\". Tackling one of the most curious aspects of Mosley's case - why one of the dominatrices, Woman A, called out \"We are the Aryan race - blondes!\" in a particularly charged moment during one spanking session - the judge ruled that \"there is no reason to suppose that it was other than a spontaneous squeal by Woman A in medias res (in the middle of things)\". Giving evidence, Woman A had claimed not only that she didn't know there were Nazi connotations to the word \"Aryan\", but that she didn't know what it meant full-stop. However, Mr Justice Eady acknowledged that the paper held an honest belief that there were indeed Nazi elements to this \"gathering\". That is why he rejected Mosley's claim for exemplary damages, which are intended not just to compensate the wronged party, but to punish the wrongdoer. Mr Justice Eady also said that Mosley was, to a degree, the architect of his own misfortune. \"Many would think that if a prominent man puts himself, year after year, into the hands (literally and metaphorically) of prostitutes (or even professional dominatrices) he is gambling in placing so much trust in them. There is a risk of exposure or blackmail inherent in such a course of conduct,\" he said. Self-destructive Mr Justice Eady added: \"To the casual observer therefore, and especially with the benefit of hindsight, it might seem that the claimant's behaviour was reckless and almost self-destructive. This does not excuse the intrusion into his privacy but it might be a relevant factor to take into account when assessing causal responsibility for what happened. \"It is part and parcel of human dignity that one must take at least some responsibility for one's own actions.\" The judge also criticised the conduct of Neville Thurlbeck, the News of the World's chief reporter, who broke the story. It emerged that Thurlbeck had sent emails to Women A and B, after his story appeared on March 30, threatening to reveal their identities in the following Sunday's paper if they didn't agree to speak to him. \"It is elementary that blackmail can be committed by the threat to do something which would not, in itself be unlawful,\" said Eady in his ruling. He also accused Thurlbeck of giving \"disingenuous\" evidence containing \"inconsistencies, which make it very difficult to decide how much can be relied on\". The oddest strand of the News of the World's defence was that by submitting himself to a spanking marathon which ended up with him needing a sticking plaster on his buttocks, Mosley was somehow engaging in a criminal act. Yesterday, the judge said this was \"perhaps the most artificial argument, verging on desperation\". He added: \"It would hardly be appropriate to clutter up the courts with cases of spanking between consenting adults taking place in private property and without disturbing the neighbours.\" Eady said the paper made insufficient attempts to verify their Nazi claims, for example by not bothering to get the German on the tape translated into English. \"That is hardly satisfactory having regard to the devastating impact the publication would have on those involved,\" he said. In a statement read outside the high court yesterday, the News of the World's editor Colin Myler said his paper maintained that Mosley was a public figure who should be held accountable for his actions. \"Taking part in depraved and brutal S&amp;M orgies does not in our opinion, constitute the fit and proper behaviour to be expected of someone in [Mosley's] hugely influential position,\" said Myler. The paper was \"pleased\", he said, that the judge did not award Mosley exemplary damages. Intrusion Mosley said in a statement: \"This judgment has nailed the Nazi lie upon which the News of the World sought to justify their disgraceful intrusion into my private life. By law we are all entitled to have our privacy respected. The News of the World invaded my privacy, dreamt up the most offensive headline possible, and decided I should not be contacted before publication to prevent me asking the court for the injunction I would have been entitled to. \"They and their lawyers have then conducted this case so as to cause maximum embarrassment in the hope that I would be discouraged from continuing. \"I needed a strong judgment to make it absolutely clear that what the News of the World did was wrong ... I am delighted that we have achieved what we set out to do. \"I hope my case will help deter newspapers in the UK from pursuing this type of invasive and salacious journalism.\"",
