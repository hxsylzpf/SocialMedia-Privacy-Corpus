  "content": "Until recently, it was considered impressive to have more than 50,000 followers on Twitter, and that's still far beyond most of us. With the influx of new users, however, the numbers following celebrities and some news outlets have exploded, and two of the leaders -- Ashton Kutcher and CNN -- are now in a race to become the first with a million followers. Since the event has turned into a spectator sport, The Huffington Post has provided a constantly updated ChartBeat graphic to show the race. Ashton Kutcher -- Mr Demi Moore, if you like -- will be live on Oprah's TV show tomorrow, when Oprah will also make her first tweet, says The Oprah blog. Oprah is new to Twitter and has picked up more than 32,000 followers without making a single update. It's also not clear whether Oprah will tweet on her own behalf after that. It may be something her people do on her behalf. Britney Spears also has more than 900,000 followers, while Stephen Fry is in 33rd place with 417,540. As Bobbie Johnson has reported below, CNN has only just taken over the @CNNbrk account, which was started by London-based web developer James Cox. Update: Ashton Kutcher won, but it was a close-run thing.",
