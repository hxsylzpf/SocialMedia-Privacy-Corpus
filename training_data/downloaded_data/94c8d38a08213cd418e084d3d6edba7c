  "content": "There was a time when New Labour's great failing was crass populism. That time has passed. After being bloodied by Joanna Lumley for being too hard on a much-admired group of would-be immigrants, the Gurkhas, the government took another knock with a vindictive refusal to allow Ronnie Biggs to die out of jail. The latest example of hardline un-populism is the looming extradition of the computer hacker Gary McKinnon, which moved a step closer yesterday after the high court refused to grant his latest bid to be tried in the UK. The \"Free Gary\" campaign encompasses, among others, Sting, Terry Waite and the Daily Mail. With the court citing evidence that incarcerating Mr McKinnon \u2013 who suffers from Asperger's syndrome \u2013 in the US would carry \"a risk of suicide\", there are good compassionate grounds for the campaign. At first blush, though, its reach right across the political spectrum is hard to fathom. After all, Mr McKinnon admits to improperly tampering with the Pentagon's systems, an activity which surely raises genuine security concerns. Health problems are not always seen as a good reason for refusing extradition \u2013 they plague the radical Islamist Abu Hamza, but there is no public resistance to the prospect of his being expelled to face harsh American treatment. And it is also true, as yesterday's ruling made plain, that the extradition of Mr McKinnon is a straightforward case of the law taking its course. The point, however, is that the law in question is a bad one, cooked up in the heyday of the frenzied alliance between Tony Blair and George Bush. As with much that flowed from that partnership, the new extradition arrangements seem to work asymmetrically \u2013 with a Liberal Democrat analysis suggesting that US courts are more than twice as likely to refuse extradition to Britain as British courts are to refuse to expel people to the US. The broad brush applied takes insufficient account of the ethical difference between a disruptive but non-violent UFO obsessive such as Mr McKinnon and those with the ambition to kill. The case riles the public because it is part of a wider pattern \u2013 a pattern of British justice being compromised through a mix of cavalier disregard for civil liberties and slavish loyalty to the US. Two entirely separate court cases this week underlined both aspects of this. In one, a draconian control order imposed on a man given no explanation was revoked; in another, it was heard that Hillary Clinton had personally intervened to stop evidence of CIA collusion in torture seeing daylight in a British courtroom. One of the few positive legacies of the Bush-Blair alliance has been to render rightwing populism profoundly unpopular.",
