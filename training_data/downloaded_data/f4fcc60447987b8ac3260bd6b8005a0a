  "content": "Children's charity the NSPCC is putting fictional profiles on social networking websites Bebo and Piczo featuring child actors talking about abuse to encourage young people to speak out and seek help. The online campaign is linked to conventional TV ads breaking tonight during ITV1's Emmerdale that aim to raise awareness among adults about the need to fund the NSPCC's ChildLine support service. Popular social networking websites Piczo and Bebo are being used by the NSPCC in an attempt engage more directly with young people in an environment where they feel safe. The fictional profiles will feature five characters - Danielle, Charmaine, Darryl, Paul and Tanya - talking about different types of abuse. Each profile will include video clips, each of which is around 90 seconds long, with young actors taking the roles of the children. \"We found that young people prefer to engage with the subject of abuse in what they consider is their 'private space', such as online, rather than through TV, or newspaper ads,\" said John Grounds, the director of communications at the NSPCC. The TV campaign, comprising two ads by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, aims to encourage support for ChildLine by remind adults how frightening it can be for abused children with no one to talk to. The NSPCC is also working with Hip Hop Connection magazine to target young people, and specifically males, to ensure they know what child abuse is and how to get help. A CD and advertorial has been created to go out with the magazine. The advertorial focuses on the power of music as a medium through which artists can speak out. Rap artist \"Plan B\" is interviewed on the CD discussing how he uses his music to talk about very personal experiences of violence and family conflict. The CD also includes hip hop tracks focusing on a wide range of issues including sexual abuse and domestic violence. The new NSPCC campaign builds on last year's \"Don't Hide It\" campaign. Web agency DNA has created an updated website donthideit.com as well as the actor's video clips for Bebo and Piczo and a supporting digital campaign. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
