  "content": "Colin Myler The News of the World editor is no stranger to controversy. He had to resign from his last British editorship at the Sunday Mirror in 2001 after the paper published an interview that caused the collapse of a trial against Leeds footballers Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate. And during the Mosley hearings, the 56-year-old was reminded of the \"furore\" he caused while editing the Sunday Mirror in 1993, when his newspaper hid a camera in Princess Diana's gym. Max Mosley Given his surname, it was particularly painful for 68-year-old Mosley to be accused of Nazi roleplay - his father was the wartime fascist leader Oswald Mosley and Hitler was a guest at his parents' wedding, which took place at Joseph Goebbels' home. Neville Thurlbeck The News of the World's chief reporter is a Fleet Street veteran who has had a hand in some of the paper's biggest scoops. He broke news of David Beckham's alleged infidelities and of FA secretary Faria Alam's dalliances with Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. In 1999 Thurlbeck was charged with corruption - paying a police officer to supply information from confidential police computer records. He was acquitted in 2000. Woman E The woman who agreed to film Mosley for a fee of \u00a325,000 (later reduced to \u00a312,000), but then failed to testify on behalf of the News of the World against him, is a professional dominatrix who owns a house in Milton Keynes with a \"dungeon\" which she uses for her S&amp;M activities. The court heard it was Woman E's husband who first approached Thurlbeck with a story about Mosley's secret sex life. It later transpired that the husband was an MI5 officer. He was forced to resign over his association with the Mosley scandal.",
