  "content": "Catherine Zeta Jones today branded the paparazzi \"game-hunters\" who think of her and husband Michael Douglas as \"prey\" in evidence at the high court in London. And she said the \"unflattering\" photographs of her wedding reception snatched by Hello! magazine damaged her reputation because in Hollywood figures matter. But she said the notion that she or her husband, who had a clutch of awards between them, would use their wedding to boost their careers was \"patently ludicrous and, frankly, offensive\". She says that when she first saw the Hello! edition with the snatched pictures, it increased her \"distress and anger\". \"They were poor quality, sleazy, unflattering and looked like they had been stolen, as indeed they had.\" The main cover picture made it look like she was about to stab the groom with a cake knife, she says. She says another photograph of her dancing made her look large and she would never allow it to be published. \"It was extremely important for my career that I regain my figure after giving birth to Dylan. I had put a lot of work in at the gym (which I loathe going to). \"It is all too easy for the film industry to conclude that an actress is past her best.\" She says of Hello!'s claims that they had used the wedding to boost their professional careers: \"Without wishing to seem immodest, the suggestion that two well-known actors with various professional awards between them would use their wedding day to boost their professional careers is patently ludicrous and, frankly, offensive.\" She added: \"Michael and I tend to think of the paparazzi as game hunters who view us as their game which they have to stalk and hunt down. The photographs they take of us are their trophies,\" she said, giving evidence for the first time in the couple's case against Hello! magazine. Ms Zeta-Jones pointed to photographs published in Britain of her lying semi-naked on top of her husband on a boat off Majorca that were sold for \u00a3250,000. \"Not only do I resent the fact that our family privacy is being invaded in this way and that we are forced to take ever more sophisticated and expensive steps to protect our private lives, but I also object to the fact that someone is making that amount of money from this despicable behaviour,\" she said. The couple are suing Hello! for \u00a3500,000 damages, alleging that their privacy and confidence were breached at the wedding, for which they had sold exclusive coverage rights to a rival celebrity magazine, OK!. \"The unauthorised use of my image for commercial gain infuriates and upsets me and not just when, as does happen, it appears on pornography websites. I feel exploited. I view it as theft: people steal my image to make money for themselves,\" said Ms Zeta-Jones, who had earlier said she was \"devastated, shocked and appalled\" when her wedding was invaded by paparazzi. Ms Zeta Jones, who is heavily pregnant, said she felt it was up to her, especially as a woman, to protect her image for her career's sake. \"It is not, however, just a business issue. I see it as my personal right as an individual to choose how my image may be used,\" she added. She said after she became engaged Mr Douglas asked what kind of wedding she wanted and both were \"fearful\" of how media interest could ruin their big day. Ms Zeta Jones revealed she had suggested to her fiancee that they get married at a register office to avoid publicity. \"He said that, as he had been married once before, that would be fine for him but that he wanted me to have the wedding of my dreams as it was my first, and hopefully my only, wedding. \"I had always wanted my wedding to be a very special day and it was extremely important to me that my family (in particular) should be there to share such an important day with me,\" she said.",
