  "content": "The publisher Random House is exploiting the trend for vampire romance through an interactive story project in partnership with Stardoll, the social gaming site for teenage girls. Mortal Kiss has been created by writers at Random House and Stardoll designers, and is based around a story serialised over eight weeks from today until Halloween. As well as reading the story, web users are invited to discuss the characters and vote on the outcome of the story, explore an interactive map of the setting at Winter Mill in New England and enter writing competitions. Stardoll, which lets teens dress up animated characters on screen, will also sell virtual items from the project in its online store. The project is available globally and will be translated in 17 languages. Fiona MacMillan, colour and licensing publisher of Random House Children's Books, said paranormal romance is hugely popular among older children and teens. \"We know from our relationship with our readers that they are passionate about the engagement with those characters and wanting to be part of that world,\" she added, saying that this was a trail of the serialisation of an 80,000-word book online. Random House has been exploring a number of digital spin-off projects, and launched a voice-controlled Nigella Lawson cookery app for iPhone this year. \"From the most senior executives down, Mortal Kiss is seen as one of the most significant projects we are working on, and it is incumbent on us to find new and innovative ways of retaining and growing our readership,\" MacMillan said. Mortal Kiss is free for users to read but Random House and Stardoll will eventually explore advertising and sponsorship, ebook formats and subscriptions, said Chris Seth, executive vice-president at Stardoll. \"Anything that drives engagement and usage on Stardoll will ultimately deliver monetisation as well, and there are multiple routes to realising that,\" he added. \"We're a social media business but in some ways we are also an old-fashioned content business, and we have been surprised by the popularity of books in the lives of teens and tweens.\" Stardoll recorded 13.8 million active monthly unique users during the past month, and already had partnerships with retailers including Miss Sixty, Herve Leger and Fallen Angel to sell virtual goods on the site. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
