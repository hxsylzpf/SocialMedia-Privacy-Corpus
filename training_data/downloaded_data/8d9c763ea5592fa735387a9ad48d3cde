  "content": "A wedding is a \"public occasion\" and it would have been absurd to think a photographer could not sneak in to record such an event, the judge hearing Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas's privacy case against Hello! said today. He made his comments as the celebrity magazine argued the Hollywood couple had forfeited any right to privacy because they had sold the rights to pictures of their wedding to rival OK! as part of a \u00a31m deal. \"Right to privacy concerns such matters as long-lens photography... of course a wedding is an intimate occasion but when one's looking at an event of privacy... there are cameras recording the event for 23 magazines around the world,\" said James Price QC for Hello!. Zeta Jones and Douglas are suing Hello! for \u00a3500,000 after it published a set of six grainy photographs of the wedding and reception as part of a classic \"spoiler\" operation against OK!. Mr Justice Lindsay, presiding over the law suit, said the public nature of a wedding ceremony was integral to the act of marriage. \"According to the Book of Common Prayer, a wedding is in essence a public occasion. It is an affirmation of a new relationship. It is a public sign of a private arrangement,\" he said. The judge said part of the ceremony involved allowing any member of the public to bring up reasons why the marriage should not go ahead. \"It would be absurd to make the wedding so secure as to exclude any possible objectors. It is by its very nature a public occasion.\" However, he noted the six unauthorised photographs that appeared in Hello! were of the reception and not the ceremony. Mr Price said what the stars claimed was a private event was publicised by their own actions in 21 countries across the world. The Douglases' assertion that the events at the wedding were private and confidential made no sense after their photographs were published, he said. Following the judge's comments, Mr Price said: \"Any right to privacy concerns such matters as the use of long lens photography of someone engaged in a private act on private premises, such as their own home. \"A wedding is an intimate occasion but when they have 350 guests, with cameras recording the event, one cannot possibly characterise that as private.\" Hello!'s lawyers also claim that, under the American First Amendment law, there is no right in New York, where the wedding took place, to privacy where publication is newsworthy. \"Marriage is a newsworthy publication,\" the magazine claimed. Michael Tugendhat QC, the Douglases' counsel, called on the judge to strike out Hello!'s defence that New York law was relevant in this case. He argued an expert witness on New York law, called in by Hello!, had ignored the fact the photographs in question were not published in New York. \"What she [the expert witness] doesn't note is that the complaint made relates to a publication outside New York,\" said Mr Tugendhat. However, Mr Price maintained New York law was relevant. \"It's been suggested the photographer was in breach of an implied contract on the theory that if you go into an area where you know photography is forbidden, and you have a camera, you're guilty of deceit,\" Mr Price said. \"The claimants' case is that any person present at the ceremony owes a duty to them to preserve confidentiality. \"The obligation of confidence must be judged by New York law. There is no right of privacy in English law. As yet English law has not recognised a right to privacy at all.\"",
