Facebook's partners in the project include Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr and its parent company Yahoo, Dropbox and Bitly. According to the social network, the roots of the project lie in a \"malware-based spam attack\" targeting several of the companies just over a year ago. \"We quickly learned that sharing with one another was key to beating the botnet because parts of it were hosted on our respective services and none of us had the complete picture,\" explained Facebook's Mark Hammell in a blog post. \"During our discussions, it became clear that what we needed was a better model for threat sharing. Expanding on those conversations, Facebook offered to build what has now become ThreatExchange, an API-based platform for security threat information.\" ThreatExchange is based on Facebook's existing infrastructure, with its partners able to access its information on new threats, and selectively share their own data with all or some of the companies involved. \"Threat data is typically freely available information like domain names and malware samples, but for situations where a company might only want to share certain indicators with companies known to be experiencing the same issues, built-in controls make limited sharing easy and help avoid errors by using a pre-defined set of data fields,\" wrote Hammell. While some of the companies involved in ThreatExchange are keen rivals, the benefits of sharing information about the botnets and malware targeting their networks clearly trump any competitive concerns. Facebook clearly hopes more companies will take advantage of the platform beyond its initial crop of partners. \"Our goal is that organisations anywhere will be able to use ThreatExchange to share threat information more easily, learn from each other's discoveries, and make their own systems safer.\"",
