Ahead of our evening with Terry Gilliam on 23 January, in which the director is interviewed by Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian offices, before a screening of his film and a Q&amp;A session, we're asking you to tweet your favourite Gilliam scenes. And, if you feel really enthused by them, you can recreate the scene, send us the results and be in the running for a couple of tickets to the event. Don't do the Twitter? Just pitch in on the comments thread. Remember, you can stream The Wholly Family from 23 January on this site.",
