  "content": "By 2018 there will be 1.1 billion new users on mobile messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger and Snapchat, according to new data from Activate. That means there will be 3.6 billion users in this category, 400 million shy of the total number of internet users predicted by the same year. Mobile messaging is a fast-evolving category that mystifies brands for a few reasons, but it is also one that has huge potential. Why aren't brands happier? The one-to-one nature of these services often leaves brands out in the cold. Many platforms make it hard for brands to be involved during growth phases, for fear of scaring users away. Mobile messaging is also different to social networks because of the personally identifiable information they use (phone number, geo-location data). While this is attractive to brands, it is also a concern for many users, as the traditional direct-blast mentality does not work in this world. So what does the landscape actually look like? Looking at the mobile messaging landscape \u2013 see the chart we created for a client here \u2013 the services are all somewhat similar, but some have unique features. What terrifies brands is that this list is not exhaustive; we picked well-known and up-and-coming apps to compare, but many others exist. The numbers and the attention spent on these platforms can be baffling, but really the future of such apps \u2013 if not all platforms \u2013 is marketing and commerce-based. A prime example of this is the upcoming M service from Facebook for Facebook Messenger \u2013 an artificial intelligence-enabled tool that will buy tickets and help organise aspects of your life for you, all with a line of text (and some human oversight ... for now). Not all companies will have a clear \u2013 or easy \u2013 path in this space Beyond commerce, though, brands do have options when it comes to these tools. The usual suspects (TV, movies, e-tailers, retail and snack companies) will all be fine, however, larger ticket items, such as cars, will require different mechanics and strategies with messaging tools because of their short-burst activities and the fluid nature of the decision process. Many of the brands out there will need to be invited in by users rather than paying economically (or with big buys) to be seen, and that is a costly and long-winded customer journey many simply won't take. However the reward could be worth it. Snapchat recently announced it will work with brands to create Snaps (short videos and images that appear in a user's feed), charging them $750,000 (\u00a3493,000) for guaranteed views in the millions. What is the future of these apps? Brands are at different stages when it comes to these platforms (there is a lot of experimentation with the likes of Snapchat) but most are still figuring out where to invest marketing budgets. They must go through a clear process with each platform to determine the right approach for their business. Keep the following in mind when you are evaluating the platforms: Looking at Facebook's movement in the space it's clear that messengers won't be for simple texting for long. The potential for a greater arena is being set. Examples such as Fooji, where users use emoji to order food via chat, show how much can be done in these interfaces. Customer service and even therapy (via Talkspace) are all about to be disrupted as consumer needs are adapted into text and messenger options. It's difficult to deny that many platforms are starting to feel reminiscent of the old portal days \u2013 one-stop shops either directly, or indirectly, through additional features or areas. Snapchat is a great example of a content ecosystem with a strong messaging backbone that recently introduced the ability to send cash between users (called Snapcash). Look out for similar innovations by other platforms. Look out for the \"apps within an app\" trend as services become bundled and mobile deep-linking is further explored by brands. The best thing about the messenger apps that are available right now is their geographic biases. One of the largest, WeChat, for example, is originally Chinese, and while it does have a global audience it is still predominantly local. This is also the case with options for Korea, Japan and India. There is no getting away from it: many of the services are aimed at millennials (roughly those born between 1982 and the early 2000s). This is both a risk and an opportunity for brands that enter the space right now if they do not serve this demographic well. Brands must be clear who they are targeting and avoid simply entertaining (or ignoring) the younger demographics. Most of the mobile messengers we featured in the PDF allow some form of group messaging. Smart brands will focus on the right mix of demographics and functionality and build mini-armies that can be activated at a moment's notice with breaking news, offers, and product launches.
