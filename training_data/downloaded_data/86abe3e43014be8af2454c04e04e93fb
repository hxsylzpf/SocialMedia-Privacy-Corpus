  "content": "It's often claimed that nobody really wins an internet argument, but Rizzle Kicks and Wiley tested that this week during one of the most inept mini-beefs the UK rap scene has ever encountered. The lively exchange came after Jordan from Rizzle Kicks \u2013 the duo's rapper, seemingly most in control of their Twitter account \u2013 uploaded a photo that implied a Wiley hit had prompted thousands of fish to die. Then Wiley decided the Rizzles were a \"fake Kris Kross\" and that their jokes \u2013 the faint of heart may wish to look away \u2013 \"are stupid\". The Rizzles' death blow came a few minutes after the argument died down, when Jordan fired off a cheery tweet: \"I love arguing!\" Three words, there, that could diffuse the majority of silly online spats. Three words that say, yes, you're annoyed, but don't tell me you didn't feel an adrenaline rush. Three words that admit something most keyboard warriors barely admit to themselves: it's not the winning of an internet argument that counts, it's the taking part. (Although Rizzle Kicks did win this one.)",
