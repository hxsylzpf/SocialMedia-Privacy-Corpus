More friendly than Friendster but with less street cred than MySpace, its focus is on communication between college students - and if academia isn't where you're at, then you are unlikely to get a look in. \"It was initially a small project that we imagined Harvard students would enjoy,\" is the introduction from a spokesperson. But after just three weeks, 6,000 communication-hungry students had joined up, and the Facebook team knew they were on to something big. Every university and high school in the US now has a presence on Facebook, and in February this year, its close-knit clique was joined by the bastions of British higher education, Cambridge and Oxford universities. It now counts 30 UK universities as members, from St Andrews in Scotland to the London School of Economics, with 70,000 users, including alumni. Its success is down to \"the versatility of the site and its connection to day-to-day reality,\" says the spokesperson. \"Facebook really works as an information directory and not just a site you go to when you're bored or need entertainment.\" This is because - uniquely - you can only see the profiles of students at your own university, unless you make a direct friendship with someone from another establishment. This gives \"another degree of immediacy\" that other social networking sites lack, and means topics posted by your friends really are relevant to your life: where tonight's party is, for example, and what mixer you have to bring for the vodka. The churn factor at most social networking sites, on the other hand, is often blamed on the fact that after six months, you are likely to end up with a collection of 500 \"friends\" - none of whom you really know, like or live near. Facebook is so popular, says Oxford student Roger Waites, that \"it has replaced email or a college message board as the way to communicate\". About 60% of students have created a Facebook profile in the past eight months. \"It's a much more intimate and amusing way of communicating,\" Waites says. He cites the photo capability - which lets you upload photos and tag them to the profile of the person in the snap - and the group system - which links friends involved in similar hobbies - as some of the best features. The website has expanded to Ireland, Switzerland, France, Canada and Mexico (only at English-speaking universities) with plans for more features and countries. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com",
