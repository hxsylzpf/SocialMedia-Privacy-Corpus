  "content": "It started with a patch of waste ground near my childhood home and a pair of rusty shears. One corner of Worthing's Maybridge estate had been forgotten by the council and was overgrown. Some old, broken fence panels had been dumped there and the overgrown bushes had collected litter blown by the wind. My local councillor said it couldn't be touched for legal reasons, but I went out one morning with shears and binbags and made a start anyway. The older neighbours leaned over the fence and told me my shears were too blunt and went to get theirs. Within a couple of hours, half a dozen of us had cut back the bushes, mowed the grass and taken the rubbish away. Nobody had needed to work very hard, Mrs Short had brought out cups of tea, and everybody had enjoyed themselves. It wasn't anything big, but that day, 15 years ago, started something. It made me realise we had to look after the places where we live. And, more importantly, that if you step outside your front door and commit to actually doing something, other people will soon join you. And that's what my latest project #WeWillGather is about. It's based around Twitter, and, as well as being influenced by the Maybridge estate, it is inspired by my experience of starting #RiotCleanup a year ago. It was solid affirmation that you don't need an organisation to organise people. You just need an idea and the tools to get people together. Clay Shirky predicted this in his book Here Comes Everybody, but I've never read it; my understanding comes just from doing it. Last August, #RiotCleanup saw a mass of people on the streets, and this August the Olympics and Paralympics were fuelled by thousands of volunteers Games makers and city ambassadors. It is clear that people want to get stuck in, and that, given the right tools, they will. #WeWillGather is a tool that makes it a little easier to get people together. It has been funded by Nesta, as part of a programme looking for innovative ways to help people give time to community projects. To use, tweet with the hashtag #WeWillGather, the word \"help\" and a postcode, and the website swings into action. It creates a page for you, and allows people to use their Facebook or Twitter accounts to sign up to help with the thing you have started. So far, it has been used for small things such as clearing overgrown steps outside a derelict building, a litterpick in a park and getting people together to plan community-led regeneration. But that small scale is important. It makes volunteering less formal and easier for busy people to do. Do enough of those small actions and every untidy corner of a council estate can be cleaned up. And volunteering won't be something we save for big national events, but something we all do every day.",
