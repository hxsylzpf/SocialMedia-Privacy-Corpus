  "content": "You might have written off the fuss about Facebook over the past few months as essentially technical: nerds fighting nerds, arguing over the default settings on a website. If only it were that trivial. Technology is certainly part of it, but fundamentally the Facebook story is about how people present themselves to different audiences, and what societies should do about companies that dominate their markets. As anyone who hasn't just relocated from Mars knows, Facebook is the biggest social-network website in the world, used by more than 400 million people to share gossip, party invitations and drunken photos with their friends. And it was for friends' eyes only, according to the service's early, solemn promise. That changed down the years so that by the start of last week Facebook members had to go through a fiddly procedure to keep their details from being seen by strangers and businesses. Why is this a big deal? Well, forget the internet for a second and imagine a 25-year-old graduate. Roy (as we'll call him) puts on a suit to the office, where he wants to impress his boss. With friends, though, he wears jeans and can get a bit rowdy. Then there's the girlfriend's parents: for them Roy puts on a jacket and his best manners. Different contexts, different behaviours. Facebook is where Roy hangs out with pals online. But with the erosion of control over his own information and with the website's surging and widening membership, Roy's page is now being looked up by his boss and even by his potential mother-in-law. Cue the inevitable strife. Under pressure from real-life Roys, Facebook backed down last week. Users now have slightly more control over who sees their online biographies. Yet company CEO Mark Zuckerberg has done so only under duress; in essence, he thinks privacy is over: \"The days of you having a different image for your \u2026 co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly \u2026 Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.\" Customers who disagree can always quit. Except that Mr Zuckerberg's attitude is common among free web services \u2013 which rely for revenue on advertisers, who want data about customers. But there is another problem. The world's No 1 social-networking site so dominates its market that it is a utility. True, the Great Server Farm in the Sky is full of firms once thought insuperable (hello, Lycos). Yet if we think of the internet as essential, and pay a tax for the installation of a broadband connection to every home, then it is time that we thought about regulating its gatekeepers like we would water and electricity suppliers.",
