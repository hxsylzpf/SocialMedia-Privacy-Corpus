  "content": "Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan has dismissed as \"laughable\" any suggestion that sacked TV presenters Angus Deayton and John Leslie have been subjected to trial by media. \"I find this thing about trial by media exasperating,\" said Morgan. He added: \"You must remember that it wasn't the newspapers that made the original allegation. It was Ulrika Jonsson who made an allegation against a television presenter and the newspapers only picked up on it when another television presenter blurted out Leslie's name on air.\" The Daily Mirror and other newspapers couldn't be blamed for investigating the story or for getting Leslie the sack, said Morgan. The Mirror has led its front page on the Leslie or Deayton stories five days out of the last seven. Leslie, who this afternoon was sacked by Granada from his role as a presenter on This Morning, had made things worse for himself by going to ground, said Morgan. \"When you don't even defend yourself to your employers, then it's inevitable that you've got to go,\" he told Sky News. Morgan said he was \"exasperated\" by suggestions that Leslie had been tried by the media but added that he believed Deayton could bounce back - but that Leslie's career was over. \"Angus Deayton was extremely foolhardy, he couldn't go on presenting Have I Got News for You when someone like Christine Hamilton was taking the moral high ground,\" he said. Friends of Leslie have strenuously denied he was the unidentified man referred to in Jonsson's book and there is no evidence to suggest he is.",
