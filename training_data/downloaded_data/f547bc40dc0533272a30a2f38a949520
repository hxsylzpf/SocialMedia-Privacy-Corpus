  "content": "Seconds after meeting Mark Horvath, founder of pioneering US video blog Invisible People, he disappears into the crowd outside London's Charing Cross station: \"Hold on a minute.\" He's spotted three men sitting by the entrance, and wastes no time in getting acquainted. \"You guys sleeping rough? Want some socks?\" he asks cheerfully, before kneeling down to chat while commuters stream by. Horvath seems to have a radar for homeless people, which is unsurprising given he has dedicated his life to trying to help them. One of the men agrees to be filmed, and as he recounts his experiences passersby look over curiously. With a camera on him, he's no longer invisible. Horvath set up invisiblepeople.tv in 2008 to make homeless people visible. Around 17 years ago he too had been homeless, living on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, and knew what it was to be ignored. He managed to rebuild his life, have a successful career in television, and settle into a three-bedroom house. Then the economy crashed. Facing homelessness for a second time, he set up Invisible People and went on the road. Today, Invisible People has 3m views on YouTube and 18,000 followers on Twitter. Its success is the subject of an upcoming documentary @home, which follows Horvath meeting homeless people from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. This month, Horvath visited the UK to film homeless people, such as Natasha, 22, who has been living on the streets of London for four years. He visited organisations including the Simon Community and the Doorway Project. What struck him about homelessness on this side of the Atlantic was the number of women sleeping rough. \"It was a crisis,\" he says. \"Probably the most drastic difference between UK and US homelessness is access to healthcare. In the US we don't have free healthcare, so the people on the street are more vulnerable \" Horvath is a big believer in the transformative and supportive power of social media. \"We've seen in the Middle East and other areas where social media has really led to some change,\" he says. By voicing their views, he believes, homeless people can help homeless services \"fix\" provision. \"No homeless person I've ever met said, 'Put me in a room with 100 men, have me sleep on cots, give me one bathroom with two stalls and kick me out in the morning \u2013 and that's going to cure my mental health and drug addiction.' But that's what we do. \"I was talking to homeless service providers [in London] who were saying, 'The system is broken, we got to change it, it's just change is slow and it's a lot of work.'\" Horvath is optimistic change can come. He says: \"We live in a visual world. Where homeless services are missing the mark is [not] giving our homeless friends video cameras. If you're going to give them a smartphone make sure it has video and have them upload what their day is like. That's where you're going to see change.\" \u2022 Read a longer interview with Mark Horvath by the Pavement magazine for homeless people at thepavement.org.uk or watch videos of the people he met in the UK at invisiblepeople.tv/blog",
