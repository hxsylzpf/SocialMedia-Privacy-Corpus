  "content": "Facebook vanished from the internet for lots of people on Thursday evening - and while it wasn't quite as bad as the internet imploding, it did mean that Like buttons disappeared from websites all over the web. The problem wasn't clear at first; it seems to have been problems with the network; while a DNS lookup worked, the connection failed (in my case anyway) just short of the site itself, at tfbnw.net - Facebook's outlying network. Trying to reach it via its own IP address (for my search, to http://69.63.189.11) also failed, which also puts the flaw at the outlying network. In case you're wondering, Facebook's domain registration is all tickety-boo, safe until 2020. Facebook put out a statement saying that \"We're currently experiencing some site issues causing Facebook to be slow or unavailable for some users. We are working to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.\" The downtime happened at the end of the working day in New York, and just after lunch in California. Productivity in those areas was not believed to be affected negatively. The jokes of course came thick and fast: \"Can Facebook stay down? Too much to ask?\" queried Mo McRoberts on Twitter. Also that Mark Zuckerberg was going to keep it down until everyone promises not to go and see The Social Network, the fictionalised film about how Facebook got started. My own contribution is that Status Quo can rewrite their famous song and say it's about Facebook: \"Down down, DNS down... down down, DNS down..\" I thank you. Here all week. Try the chicken.",
