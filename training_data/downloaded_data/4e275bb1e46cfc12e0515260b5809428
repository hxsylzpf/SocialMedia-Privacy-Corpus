  "content": "If you're on Twitter, you may have been surprised to receive a direct message (like an email, in that it's not in the public domain) from someone who follows you, saying something like \"Hey, I just added you to my Mafia family. You should accept my invitation! :) Click here:\" And then there's a link to playmobsterworld.com, where the \"Mafia family\" game seems to be hosted. If you happen to follow the link, you'll be presented with a big, mostly black screen and a big red button in the middle saying \"Click here to play more\". Look, here's a picture. But what you rapidly find is that you're taken by the scruff of the internet over to Twitter where you're, um, encouraged to authorise the game to access your Twitter feed. (It uses the OAuth system, which means that the people behind playmobsterworld don't get your username or password. The owners have chosen to hide their identities by using Domainsbyproxy, and haven't left an email address on their website, so we don't know who they are, and couldn't contact them.) Once you've done that, the \"game\" will then spew that invitation in the form of a direct message to everyone it can. (The people who receive it are the ones who follow you, and who you also follow. They're the only group you can direct message on Twitter.) And so those DMs turn up in peoples' feeds, and they click them.. and so on. You'd think that by now Mobster World would be played by everyone. Not so. Instead many people - the non-players - get annoyed by it. It's easy to see how the spewing of invitations happens: it's so easy to miss the tiny text at the bottom of the main page that tells you about the Terms of Service (such as they are: basically, it's a website and takes no responsibility for anything) and the one that says \"Click here if you don't wish to invite your contacts automatically\". See - there it is. Oh, so that's how you do it. Except that if you click that second link (the tiny bit of yellow text on the left), you get directed to a page that looks exactly the same as the first with a link to the same Twitter OAuth link, and no indication that your friends won't get spammed just the same way again as if you had never managed to find that well-hidden link. Although it must be said that the front page does say in a prominent position, \"please read the note below for our terms of service\". Prominent position, but unfortunately not prominent in any other sense; it's tiny dark grey text on a dark background, and to say that it doesn't stand out is an understatement at best. See? OK, now try it with some highlighting of the text: So is there actually a game in Mobster World? Rik Ferguson, of the security company Trend Micro, has been looking at it for a while. His view? \"In essence it is very similar to the previous Twitter \"game\" Spymaster\" which got very amusingly subverted. \"Mobster World is not a new game to social networking, it has been around on Facebook for some time already with over 1000 active users and in fact was one of the apps that was being linked to via advertising in the series of rogue apps we saw on Facebook recently. \"There is a game behind Mobster World, but in the loosest possible sense of the word. You also have to question the motives of the people behind it when the text \"(please read the note below for our terms of service.)\" and the terms of service themselves are greyed out almost to the point of invisibility on their front page.\" However, here's the kicker: it doesn't let go of your account even if you tell if to, according to Ferguson. \"The game itself consists of doing \"jobs\" to earn cash and respect, using the cash to go on and buy further equipment to do yet more jobs and recruiting other to your mob through direct messaging on Twitter. Having granted read &amp; write access to your Twitter account through OAuth though, the game can send DMs without your knowledge. [emphasis added - CA] \"The default settings on the game account definitely lead to a barrage of Update Tweets. The \"Cancel Account\" option, despite warning you that it is an irrevocable step, does not work - the account remains active and can be reused at any time. The OAuth permissions granted on your Twitter account are also not revoked. [emphasis added - CA]\" So it grabs hold of your Twitter account and won't let go. That's not good, in the scheme of things. What if the owners decided to start using their access to tweet links to malware links, or adverts? It would seem to come from you to your friends. So is it dangerous, in Ferguson's view? \"It's not overtly malicious, but it is definitely configured to fool the unwary into generating publicity through social worm techniques.\" Our opinion: probably best avoided. You can deny it any further access to your Twitter account on Twitter's system itself, at Twitter's Settings -&gt; Connections page, which will show you what programs and sites are allowed to access your account. If you don't want Mobster World to have that access, deny it there. But is this a new trend in games, or just an aberration? What's your view?",
