  "content": "Damian Collins MP has clashed with the men running football, athletics and cycling; yet his dealings with the media industry have been unusually civil since becoming chair of the influential parliamentary committee tasked with scrutinising the field. The press, and the BBC in particular, have been at the centre of some bitter public rows in recent years. They often involved Collins's predecessor, John Whittingdale, who became culture secretary after 10 years as the committee's chair, and talking to his replacement now is like watching La La Land after the horrors of Hacksaw Ridge. In just three months in the job, Collins has endeared himself to the newspaper industry by not just opposing the loathed section 40, which would impact newspapers' legal costs in libel cases, but also by speaking out against fake news. On Monday, his committee is to launch an inquiry into the issue that is worrying both news organisations and politicians alike. When asked what is on the agenda for 2017, Collins says he has to \"finish off some important work on sport\" \u2013 tackling Lord Coe over his knowledge of the Russian doping scandal, for one \u2013 and finalise a report on the impact of Brexit on the creative industries before launching the fake news inquiry. He links the three key issues he is involved in by saying that investigative journalism exposed the corruption in sport he is so keen to stamp out, whether at the FA or in other sports, while the proliferation of fake news, by muddying the media ecosystem and helping to drain it of resources, is a direct threat to news organisations. Collins wants to know why social media platforms cannot monitor news providers and alert users to potentially fake news. \"If platforms like Facebook are the prime distribution tool for fake news, then what can Facebook do to combat that, to identify and flag up stories that are fake? \"They're not just platforms, they have a social responsibility, too. I think it's important for democracy to understand how this works.\" In a recent newspaper article, Collins called fake news, an issue that exploded during the US presidential election, the \"greatest threat to the credibility of the media\". \"If fake news has the first word on a story, by the time truth has caught up people have moved on,\" said Collins. With the stocky frame and ruddy complexion of a rugby player, Collins compares the issue with that of piracy, with search engines such as Google long accused of failing to stamp out the practice, more recently acting to downgrade the most notorious pirates. \"Search engines have accepted a social responsibility to combat piracy online and I think the distribution of news online should be looked at in that way,\" he said. Options include the platforms adjusting their algorithms or introducing verification tags such as the blue tick adopted by Twitter. \"How is an article from the Guardian identified as different from a blog posted in Macedonia?\" he asks. Given the criticism of Facebook's impact on news organisations, his views will be interesting on Tuesday when Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook's leading executive in Europe and chair of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's creative industries council, appears in front of the committee to talk about the impact of Brexit. A former advertising executive elected in 2010, Collins is a moderate who appears to have survived a tumultuous few years in Westminster with cross-party support. Paul Farrelly, a Labour member of the committee, said he is \"consensual, thoughtful and certainly knows his stuff\". A newspaper executive, who declined to be named, said: \"I really like him. He's ambitious, but too nice to make it into this government.\" It is not as if the topics he has spoken out on are uncontroversial. Later this week the committee is also set to meet to discuss a joint submission to the government's consultation on another newspaper industry bete noire, section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013. While Collins has made his views on the issue clear in an article for the Telegraph, he may face more of a battle getting his cross-party committee to agree. Rejected by the newspaper industry, section 40, a consequence of the Leveson inquiry in response to the phone-hacking scandal, means newspapers not signed up to an officially recognised regulator may have to pay the costs of libel and privacy claimants regardless of whether they win or lose. The issue is part of a judicial review into the government consultation, with its supporters insisting on commencement. But Collins thinks it should be scrapped, saying: \"I don't think section 40 should just hang there like the sword of Damocles over the press.\" He believes Ipso, the press regulator whose members include nearly all newspaper groups, has room for improvement, however, as it is not yet \"credible to the public\". For a start it should roll out a system of low-cost arbitration, something he describes as \"clearly a major area where more work needs to be done\". \"The key thing is, how easy is it for a member of the public who doesn't have the sort of deep pockets required to take a newspaper to court, someone who is a genuine victim of misreporting or press intrusion, what redress do they have?\" Another problem is the due prominence of corrections. Ipso has been criticised for allowing newspapers to print tiny corrections on inside pages after huge front-page originals. Collins disagrees with like-for-like corrections but believes they should be on the front page. Born in Northampton in 1974 and educated at a small and now-closed Roman Catholic boarding school in Herefordshire, Collins is keen not to appear too close to the newspaper industry despite his support. The closest the MP for Folkestone and Hythe has got to scandal in the past six years was a \u00a34,440 claim in rent for a house in London that belonged to his wife and which he said was too small for his family of four. A member of the committee during the phone hacking scandal, he says the only time he has met Rupert Murdoch was when the News Corp boss gave evidence in 2011. Like many of his fellow Tory MPs, he is still unlikely to raise too many objections to the bid by Murdoch's 21st Century Fox for the whole of Sky. \"My personal view would be to take advice on its impact on media plurality and Fox's investment intentions. Would this be a good deal for UK consumers would be my interest.\" On the promised inquiry into the relations between the press and the police, the so-called \"Leveson 2\", also subject to a consultation, Collins believes that the grounds for further investigation should be looked at after the spate of criminal cases. \"I do feel that the police have got off quite lightly,\" he adds. Until now, his committee's one big media moment \u2013 grilling the incoming BBC chairman, David Clementi, earlier this month \u2013 was remarkable for an almost complete lack of rancour. \"I think he did really well,\" said Collins. \"I've been on that panel when Chris Patten and Rona Fairhead appeared and I thought his knowledge of the BBC was really impressive.\" He particularly liked Clementi's emphasis on impartiality. With the government still considering the future of Channel 4, Collins again offers a middle way between those who believe the state-owned, publicly funded broadcaster should be moved outside London and those who believe it should stay as it is. He argues that the broadcaster's remit could be changed so that it is forced to increase its investment outside London rather than move lock, stock and barrel. \"Given Channel 4 News and the commercial operations, there would be a need for some presence in London but there is clearly a benefit in Channel 4 doing more and investing more outside London.\" He also urged the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, to hurry up and decide on Channel 4: \"This has been going on for quite a long time. Now, the best thing would be for a decision to be made.\" Towards the end of a wide-ranging interview in his Westminster office, something has obviously been preying on the MP's mind. \"I might have gone to a Sky summer party a while ago,\" he begins. \"And the Murdochs were there, but I didn't meet them.\" This article was amended on 31 January 2017 to clarify details about section 40 and the Leveson inquiry.",
