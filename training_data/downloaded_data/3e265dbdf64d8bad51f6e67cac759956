  "content": "Earlier today there was concern that a quick session with Google (and specifically Google) would reveal the contents of peoples' Twitter feeds - even if those feeds were protected (which means that they have to let you \"follow\" them). The Los Angeles Times gave an ever-so-slightly-famous case: Bill Clinton - you know, the husband of the US secretary of state - whose tweets seemed to be showing up in searches. But now Twitter has said that the hole isn't there. Danny Sullivan at Search Engine Land has been in touch with them, and been told: It seems that the LA Times piece references tweets that were public but later the user protected the account, thus all subsequent tweets are private along with the profile. The tweets prior to that time cannot be un-cached. Google has not been given a key to the castle\u2026so to speak. The problem though is that if you start out being public, and at date A decide to protect your tweets, everything you tweeted before date A will be accessible through the search. They won't be cloaked. Sullivan explains it: Well, if Google can't get in to tweets after an account has been protected, why does it show some? And why does Twitter say this will happen? Google seems to rely on the last information for a tweet that it could see. So you tweeted something in March. Google sees the tweet and records it. If in August, you protect your account. Google tries to revisit your tweets as it does with any web page, to make sure it has fresh information. It can't get to any of your tweets now. The ones from August, it never saw them, since they were never public \u2014 so it doesn't list them. That tweet in March? It keeps showing the information from the last time it saw it. And apparently, it will keep doing this for weeks or months. He also points out something quite important if you do protect your tweets: you're on a social network, and unless you've created a closed network within it, you'll probably see them retweeted into the public sphere: If you have a protected account, also keep in mind that those who follow you might retweet what you tweet to the world. If you're that worried, make sure you pick your followers carefully and regularly keep them informed that you don't want things retweeted. Otherwise, be prepared for your private tweets to leak out.",
