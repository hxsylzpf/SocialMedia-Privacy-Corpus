  "content": "Michael Gove is being urged to launch an inquiry into an \"extraordinary attack\" on the former Tory education minister Tim Loughton on a Twitter feed that is widely believed to be run by close allies of the education secretary. Labour called on Gove to act after @toryeducation, which tweets news about the education secretary, accused Loughton of telling \"lies\" about child protection. In its tweet @toryeducation wrote: \".@timloughton Your lies on this subject are by far the worst of anything you've done in politics &amp; we hope nobody believes a word you say.\" Loughton has been in conflict with Gove and his allies since he was sacked as children's minister in the government reshuffle last September. The former minister told the Commons education select committee in January that children's issues were a \"declining priority within the department\". Gove's allies hit back the following day by briefing the Spectator that Loughton was a \"lazy incompetent narcissist obsessed only with self-promotion\". The row erupted again on Tuesday after Loughton reacted to a government announcement on child abuse in Doncaster by saying that tougher action could have been taken two years ago. In a tweet, after the education department issued a response to a report by Lord Carlile into the Edlington case in Doncaster, Loughton wrote: \"Tougher intervention in Doncaster children services \u2026 should have happened in 2011 when I wanted to publish SCR [serious case review] in full.\" Loughton hit back at the accusation that he had lied by claiming that he had originally been in favour of publishing the Edlington serious case review. He tweeted: \"@toryeducation time 4 a senior DfE source to come out from cloak of anonymity and face scrutiny rather than rewriting history shamelessly?\" Loughton then added in another tweet: \"@toryeducation now we know there were only 5 people in room privy to me being blocked from publishing SCR so shall I name them?\" This tweet is understood to be highly significant. Gove's allies are maintaining that Loughton was keen to prevent the publication of serious case reviews because he wanted, in the words of an education department source to the Spectator in January, to \"maintain a culture of secrecy\". It is believed, however, that Loughton sent a personal memo to Gove a year ago while still a minister expressing unease over the delay in publishing the Edlington serious case review. It is understood that Loughton thought that the serious case review in one other area should not be published for highly sensitive reasons. The existence of a personal memo from Loughton to Gove could prove problematic for the authors of the @toryeducation twitter feed and the education department sources. It appears to contradict directly the key allegations made by the author or authors of the Twitter feed. Dominic Cummings and Henry de Zoete, Gove's two special advisers, have denied any involvement on @toryeducation. De Zoete told the Observer: \"Nope. Don't know who it is.\" Cummings told the newspaper: \"Of course I'm not this Twitter account and never have been. I focus on project-managing priorities. I don't waste my time on Twitter and you should tell your staff to do the same.\" Ian Mearns, a Labour member of the Commons education select committee, said: \"This extraordinary attack [on Tim Loughton] is another example of derogatory language by the Toryeducation twitter feed. Michael Gove needs to investigate if this feed is run by his advisers \u2013 if so that would be very serious. There is no place for these kind of personal attacks in public life. The education secretary needs to take action.\"",
