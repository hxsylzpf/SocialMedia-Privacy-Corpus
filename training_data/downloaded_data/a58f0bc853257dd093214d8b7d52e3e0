  "content": "The Association of Chief Police Officers criticised the organisation in charge of overseeing the Data Protection Act in documents published yesterday as part of the inquiry into how Ian Huntley got a job as a school caretaker. In its formal submission to the Bichard inquiry the association suggested that the information commissioner was causing \"confusion\" over what details forces can retain about potential offenders. Acpo claimed that the repeated intervention of the commissioner, Richard Thomas, was leading to \"inconsistent standards\" and had an impact on the \"safety of the public\". In his submission, which was released yesterday but drawn up before he knew of Acpo's comments, Mr Thomas renewed his criticism of Humberside police's apparent failure to keep records on Huntley, branding its approach to the man who went on to kill Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman \"astonishing.\" The inquiry, ordered by the home secretary, David Blunkett, and chaired by Sir Michael Bichard, begins in earnest tomorrow when its counsel, James Eadie, sets out what has been gleaned about the Huntley case from the dozens of bodies asked to contribute.",
