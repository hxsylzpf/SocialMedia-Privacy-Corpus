  "content": "A couple of weeks ago I posted a short item about SocialMeter, which gives your site a score based on the number of links it finds at Google, Delicious, Digg, Reddit, Furl, etc. Well, if you liked it, do you want to buy it? The site has just gone up on eBay with a starting price of $425. The sales pitch says: I had a lot of fun making the site, but I'm moving on to other projects now so I want to sell Socialmeter to a person or company who can expand and develop it, possibly as a complimentary service to their existing website(s). (Yes, Brian, that should be \"complementary\".)",
