The former Loaded editor has spent 90 minutes discussing football, fashion and his new online project when he begins to wax lyrical about the joys of watching birds from his cottage on the east Sussex coast. \"Great big seabirds coming into land like fighter planes,\" he enthuses. \"Who cares about magazines when you could be watching gulls on the wind?\" Brown has long had a capacity to surprise, from taking the magazine world unawares with the launch of Loaded 16 years ago to his ill-fated tenure in charge of GQ and the various consultancy roles he has had in recent years, helping everyone from the Mail on Sunday and Reader's Digest to Jamie Oliver and the Daily Sport. He says his days as a gun for hire are behind him, and shows no inclination to discuss his work on the Sport, where he worked on its relaunch two years ago. \"That was just one of 20 [jobs] that I did, a few days here and a few days there. I have stopped all of that \u2026 I was sick of it. I wanted to create something.\" So Brown has become an editor again, ploughing \u00a330,000 into his new digital venture, the Sabotage Times, with its strapline: \"We can't concentrate so why should you?\" The site, which had a soft launch in May, has a stable of around 150 writers (or \"saboteurs\") writing about football, fashion, entertainment and sex. Unusually, none of its contributors are paid upfront, receiving payment only if their work is syndicated via the site to other publications. What it offers them, argues Brown, is a shop window and the chance to be published alongside established writers such as his old pal Irvine Welsh, who also appears on the site. Unlike Brown's previous ventures, it does not have an office and has only two members of staff: Brown and his deputy Matt Weiner, formerly the number two on Haymarket's football magazine, FourFourTwo, edit the site on the hoof. \"This is my office,\" says Brown, holding up his iPhone. \"The technology allows you not to invest in bricks and mortar any more. It's a new type of business \u2013 a business of ideas and content, a business without a building.\" Celebrity weekly One of his writers has already got a job on Bauer Media's celebrity weekly Heat, he says Brown. \"I recognised there is a generation of writers who could be gathered together in one place. \"There are lots of people blogging out of passion, who have the talent and the expertise but who aren't used to being paid for it. You could put them all together in one place and mix it with some of the great writers I have had the opportunity to publish over the years. I also wanted somewhere I would feel comfortable to write myself.\" Brown says he has discovered \"four or five really good writers\" from Twitter, including David Hart, who runs the Nottingham fashion blog the Highrise, Olivia Foster and Andy Dawson, responsible for the Twitter feed DianaInHeaven. Sabotage Times \u2013 a reference to the Beastie Boys song, Sabotage \u2013 has two big-name backers but he is reluctant to disclose their identity without their permission. \"One is just launching a business in India, the other has got a worldwide business,\" is all he proffers. One was also an investor in one of his previous ventures. Brown says the site, which had around 85,000 unique visitors last month, is breaking even, perhaps not surprising given its payment structure and tiny staff. \"No-one's getting paid. I don't get paid, the writers aren't getting paid. They get paid if we sell the material.\" The aim is to carry advertising and sponsorship eventually and Brown will look to generate more revenue by creating branded content for commercial partners. He staged his first exhibition earlier this year with the cult cartoonists and animators, Modern Toss. \"I was talking to Andy Dawson, who is developing DianaInHeaven as a sitcom. I said 'what the fuck for? Let's just get an actress to do a Talking Heads like Alan Bennett and do it on a daily basis. Why would you want to wait 18 months for somebody at Channel 4 to make a decision and then give three quarters of the money to the production company? We can do it now.'\" With a design partly inspired by the Daily Beast \u2013 \"I thought what Tina Brown did there was really good\" \u2013 the site does not have a target reader in spite of its focus on men. \"We have a target writer. We are a location to go to when you want to be distracted. We will float things through that we think are eye-catching.\" An essay about a father and son brought together by their love of football, picked up from a Millwall FC fanzine, and a rant about the east London district of Dalston are two of its most popular stories to date. The site's masthead has various sub-headings, such as \"Travel\" and \"Fashion &amp; Style\", and I express mild surprise, given his background, that there is not a \"girls\" gallery featuring scantily clad women. \"That whole aspect [of Loaded's success] has been overplayed,\" he says, clearly irritated. \"That's other people's stuff. Go and ask [Zoo founding editor] Paul Merrill about that, the boys who started the weeklies.\" The pioneer of the modern lads' mag, Brown founded Loaded in 1994 after stints at Sounds and NME and a brief career as a rock band manager. Awards included the prestigious BSME editors' editor of the year prize, but he quit IPC Media in 1997 to edit Cond\u00e9 Nast's GQ. This surprise appointment also proved short-lived. Nicholas Coleridge, the managing director of Cond\u00e9 Nast, memorably blamed \"philosophical differences\" for Brown's departure after just 18 months, following the appearance of the Nazis and Field Marshal Rommel in a feature on the century's 200 most stylish men. \"I was bored there,\" says Brown, whose final GQ cover featured a naked and handcuffed Caprice baring all. \"It's a beautiful place to be bored. It wasn't the right job. I am still friends with [Cond\u00e9 Nast international chairman] Jonathan Newhouse. I don't have any bitterness or resentment.\" If Brown does have regrets, it is about his men's title Jack, which he launched in 2002 ; it was the flagship title of his publishing company, I Feel Good (IFG), which he floated on the alternative investment market and sold to Felix Dennis in 2003. Magazine failed Described as a cross between National Geographic and Loaded and aimed at a more mature, over-30s market, the A5 magazine failed to find an audience and closed in 2004. \"I made a lot of mistakes,\" he admits. \"I looked at an issue the other day, and I thought why did it have two features about the second world war? There didn't seem to be a lot of interesting people around to interview. There are again now.\" Brown was inspired to return to editing after reading the former Sunday Times editor Harold Evans's memoirs My Paper Chase while on holiday. \"He was the opposite of me, he worked so hard \u2013 I mean, I worked hard when I was young \u2013 but he was really determined and it made me feel a bit embarrassed about how little I had made of the opportunities I had created. \"When I sold I Feel Good I arrogantly announced I had retired, but then I just didn't really know what to do. I was offered a chatshow commission and newspapers to edit, I tossed a lot of opportunities away. I was just sitting around playing Scrabble on the internet, banging on about the past.\" Brown also had \"personal stuff\" going on \u2013 he got divorced from the mother of his son in 2007 \u2013 \"and that affected my financial position\". The sale of IFG was reported to have made him \u00a31.2m. He has no desire to go back to \"dead tree\" publishing. \"With a high volume, high frequency publication you end up spending a lot of your time thinking about printers, distributors, what's on the cover, and actually you don't spend much time thinking about the journalism, and that is at the heart of it.\" But he will continue his work as a consultant to Sky Sports on its subscriber magazine, and does not rule out occasional magazine ventures through Sabotage Times. \"We could do some one-offs, a couple a year.\" An hour after we meet, he messages me on Twitter. \"Enjoyed interview. Watching gulls fly more important than old mags the key thing I said IMO.\" Either he's joking or he really should start thinking about a birdwatching magazine. Online, presumably.",
