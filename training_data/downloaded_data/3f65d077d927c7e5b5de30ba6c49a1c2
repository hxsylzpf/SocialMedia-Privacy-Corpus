  "content": "A blog site based in Leeds has accused city councillors of defying government advice by rejecting its request to record a council meeting. The Leeds Citizen blogger explains that he wrote to the council leader, Keith Wakefield, formally asking for permission to record meetings that are open to the public. He reports that his request was put to a committee \"and unanimously turned down by the councillors present.\" He quotes one member as saying, \"Nobody can bring a recording device into the meeting,\" and another as observing: \"If the blogger wants a recording, we'll provide him with one.\" The councillors were told of guidance issued in June this year by local government secretary Eric Pickles which states that councils should allow the recording and filming of public meetings. In his letter, the blogger for Leeds Citizen wrote: \"Having a recording of the meeting would allow me (and others like me who don't have shorthand) to report proceedings much more fully and accurately\u2026 \"Having the facility would serve as a very useful stop-gap while we await what I hope will be the eventual webcasting of all public meetings.\" He added: \"It would also go some way to opening up the reporting of council business to a wider variety of media. Too often, if the Yorkshire Evening Post isn't at a meeting, it doesn't get reported.\" In a blogpost about the dispute, Leeds Citizen (slogan: A minor irritant on the flesh of the body politic of Leeds) comments: \"What's really dispiriting is that, for all the fine words from the council's leaders about a bright future of more 'citizen engagement', participation and transparency, today's performance is a sobering reminder of the reality of Leeds councillors' attitude to those issues. They just don't get it.\" Pickles's guide, Your council's cabinet \u2013 going to its meetings, seeing how it works: A guide for local people, underlined the right of journalists and citizens to film, record and tweet from council meetings. Pickles said: \"Councillors shouldn't be shy about the public seeing the good work they do in championing local communities and local interests.\" A spokeswoman for Leeds city council confirmed that the blogger had asked to record two committee meetings and that, in both cases, the members had refused permission. She said the government's guidelines did not amount to orders, adding: \"At the moment we have no policy in place so it's down to each individual chair. But we will be discussing the matter.\" An independent survey in May of 20 Leeds blogs described Leeds Citizen as \"excellent\" with \"well written and intelligent posts\" that provide \"a wealth of information on all things civic in Leeds.\"",
