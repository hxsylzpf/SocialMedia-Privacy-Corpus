  "content": "A cross-party committee of senior MPs and peers is to examine the law surrounding privacy and the rules for reporting parliament after David Cameron said it was \"unsustainable\" to prevent the press from reporting information posted on Twitter. Minutes before the Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming used parliamentary privilege to name Ryan Giggs, the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, said the committee would examine how to improve the \"balance between privacy and freedom of expression\". Sir Alan Beith, the longest-serving Liberal Democrat MP, who is chairman of the Commons justice committee, is expected to sit on the new body with John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture committee. Lord Inglewood, a former Conservative national heritage minister who chairs the Lords communications committee, is expected to join them. Grieve, who was summoned to the Commons to answer an urgent question tabled by Whittingdale, said: \"We take seriously the need to ensure that we have the correct balance between privacy and freedom of expression...[The] committee will examine whether the current arrangements are working and to consider whether we might make any changes that would make things work better.\" The committee will look at the report published last week by Lord Neuberger, master of the rolls, on privacy injunctions. The report said that injunctions and superinjunctions, the more restrictive orders whose existence cannot be publicised, should only be granted in limited circumstances. Neuberger also said the reporting of statements by MPs and peers may not be covered by privilege if they flout court orders. The cross-party committee of MPs and peers will examine: \u2022 Parliamentary privilege. Grieve said: \"The question of parliamentary privilege...is not a new matter. While it is fully recognised that we have complete privilege within this chamber to say what we like, \u2013 and indeed the Lord Chief Justice reiterated this in the clearest and most unequivocal terms in his comments last Friday \u2013 it is also the case that the question as to the extent to which communication between a constituent and an MP is covered by parliamentary privilege remains uncertain. \"What is quite clear is that from the judiciary's point of view \u2013 I think as much as that of the government and parliament \u2013 that is an undesirable state of affairs. \"It is undoubtedly capable both of clarification and rectification if the will is there to do it.\" \u2022 Privacy law. Grieve said: \"It is undoubtedly the case that it would be open to this house to enact a privacy law if it wished ...[Jeremy Hunt], the culture secretary, said: 'We are not minded to have a new privacy law but we are not ruling out the need for legislative changes.' It is possible to have legislative change without necessarily having a full-blown privacy law. This seems to me to be precisely the sort of issue which the committee needs to consider and to do it in a measured and sensible fashion.\" Asked by Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, whether a privacy law would make any difference, Grieve said: \"That is an interesting subject for both legal and political debate. It is precisely because it needs to take place that the suggestion has come forward that this is the best way to proceed.\" \u2022 Enforceability of court orders and injunctions. Grieve said: \"It is quite clear, and has been clear for some time in a number of different spheres, that the enforceability of court orders and injunctions when the internet exists \u2013 into which information can be rapidly posted \u2013 does present a challenge. \"But that doesn't necessarily mean that the right course of action is to abandon any attempt at preventing people from putting out information which may, in some circumstances, be enormously damaging to vulnerable people or, indeed in some cases, be the peddling of lies.\" The prime minister had earlier told ITV1's Daybreak that he knew the identity of the footballer. David Cameron said: \"It is rather unsustainable, this situation, where newspapers can't print something that clearly everybody else is talking about, but there's a difficulty here because the law is the law and the judges must interpret what the law is. \"What I've said in the past is, the danger is that judgments are effectively writing a new law which is what parliament is meant to do.\"",
