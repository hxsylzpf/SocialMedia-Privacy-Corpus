  "content": "Corin Gibbon (@thisbrutallife on Instagram) loves to document brutalist architecture around the world. Growing up in Leeds and Durham, Corin remembers being \"fascinated by these otherworldly, futuristic, concrete buildings\". \"I have a theory that the British electronic music of the early 80s was born in, and influenced by, a brutalist environment, whether it be Depeche Mode in Basildon, or the Human League in Sheffield \u2013 think Park Hill,\" Corin explains. He remembers observing the \"the sprawl of concrete that spilled out in to the South Manchester suburbs\" while attending the University of Manchester and falling in love with the Trellick Tower while working as a van courier in London, driving along the Westway. \"I think it's fair to say that Goldfinger's brutalist masterpiece is my favourite, and thinking back, the reason I first started @thisbrutallife was because I was taking too many pictures of Trellick on my personal Instagram feed!\" \"When abroad, I now insist on trips to the local brutalist buildings of interest, which is rewarding as it often means that you're visiting a part of the city that you otherwise wouldn't,\" Corin says. \"It can give you much more of a feel for the place than the usual tourist trail.\" Follow @guardiancities on Instagram and tag your best city shots with #guardiancities.",
