  "content": "Not long ago, \"spin doctors\" like Charlie Whelan would do much of their business in the traditional manner \u2013 over a few pints. Last week, however, Channel 4's debate Ask the Chancellors showed how the spin industry, Whelan included, has branched out into the twittersphere. Midway through Monday night's televised debate between Alistair Darling, George Osborne and Vince Cable, the programme was the fourth-biggest \"trending\" issue on Twitter anywhere in the world. At its height, there were about 200 tweets a minute. Over the whole hour (8-9pm) there were 15,000, and 5,000 in the hour that followed. Next morning it was still the number two trending issue in the UK. Much of the action was from party spin doctors and politicians giving highly partial views during the actual event. Henry Macrory, the Tories' head of press, tweeted at 8.56: \"Osborne sums it up: Lab inherited one of the strongest economies in the world and now we have one of the weakest.\" Douglas Alexander, Labour's election co-ordinator, tapped in: \"Osborne tries 2 hide commitment 2 tax cut for 3000 richest estates \u2013 is that what 'we're all in this together' means?\" Vince Cable's fellow Lib Dem Susan Kramer rattled out: \"Vince brilliant but amazed that George is most dull!\" The aim of all was to spin the media as the event went out live. Matthew McGregor, head of the London office of Blue State Digital, which provided the online technology for the Obama campaign, said a phenomenon was being born. \"They wanted to shape the views of journalists as it was still going on... It is expectation management live.\" With three live leader debates due during the election campaign, battles on Twitter are likely to become even bigger and more intense. But Dorothy Byrne, head of news and current affairs at C4, said the best thing about the Twitter reaction on Monday had been the number of non-politically aligned viewers who had chipped in. \"The parties should not try to use this to say how wonderful they are. If they do, people will take against them. They should let democracy thrive.\"",
