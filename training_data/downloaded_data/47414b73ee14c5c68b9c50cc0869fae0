  "content": "More contributions to the debates over libel and privacy that merit attention... On this site, there is Alistair Brett writing about his early resolution scheme - an attempt at what we might call \"conflict resolution\" to avoid legal costs and reach sensible compromises (see the website earlyresolution.co.uk). In somewhat similar vein, the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom has called for the establishment of libel tribunals with the power to require publication of corrections and apologies as a \"right of reply\" as well as, or instead of, damages. In its submission to the parliamentary committee considering libel reform, the CPBF said: \"The establishment of a process to facilitate the early resolution of defamation cases is a much-needed initiative... The high court is not the ideal place to settle such disputes.\" Then there is a piece by Mary Ann Sieghart in today's Independent, We do need to stop the muck-rakers, about the value of the human rights act's clause protecting private and family life. She writes: \"Some newspapers act as if this law had never been passed. Every day, they are full of salacious stories and photographs of so-called celebrities, some of which represent a gross and gratuitous invasion into their privacy.\" She selects Hugh Grant and Max Mosley as examples of people who have suffered from disproportionate press intrusion and \"lazy journalism.\" I agreed with her until she argued that injunctions are for the rich; the Press Complaints Commission \"is pretty toothless\" without proper sanctions; \"a proper privacy law\" might be a good idea. The rich are, in almost all cases, the ones targeted by papers. The PCC's toothlessness has to be weighed against its work behind the scenes (see this interview with its director, Stephen Abell) and, most importantly, the fact that editors hate being censured. As for a home-grown privacy law, it's a non-starter. I do agree with Sieghart that papers should have a public interest defence, in matters of both libel and privacy. But there is much to commend in the ideas of Brett and the CPBF (which also berates the PCC). To cut through this confusion, we need to understand that the judiciary dealing with libel and privacy cases have virtually \"adopted\" the editors' code of practice in order to decide on the behaviour of journalists and, by implication, therefore support the work of the PCC. This should not be read as my giving the PCC a clean bill of health. It has made mistakes. It will go on making mistakes. It will never be perfect. Why? Because the press and, yes, the people, are imperfect too. But, at the risk of echoing David Cameron, there are signs of the PCC getting better at his task. The central problem, and here I am at one with Sieghart, is that some editors desperate to retain sales refuse to obey any rules whatsoever. That's why they are railing so often against injunctions. That's why there is less public sympathy than there should be for libel reform (which is necessary to protect the freedoms of writers and academics who have little or nothing to do with journalism). Editors need to see the value of arbitration, possibly through tribunals and/or the system of self-regulation. But they will need to agree first on the guiding principle of the public interest.
