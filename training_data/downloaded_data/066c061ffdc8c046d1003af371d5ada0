  "content": "Midway through the post-show Q&amp;A I was hosting at the West Yorkshire Playhouse on Tuesday night \u2013 part of our ongoing Cat on a Hot Tin Roof project \u2013 a hand near the front shot up. What did all of us think, a gentleman near the front politely enquired, of the idea of tweeting during shows? Was it really on? It's a fine question \u2013 and one already seized on by a tweeter. On Thursday, Adam Zed, who blogs at Pikchures (he's also a rather good photographer), wrote a thoughtful post about the event, ruminating on the strange urge many Twitter users feel to post reactions as quickly as possible, to avoid being \"last second's news\". The obvious follow-on, he felt, was dangerous: theatregoers would surely start tweeting during the performance itself, thereby ruining it for everyone else. He also raised an interesting point: who are all these tweets really aimed at, if not at people who are there too? Shouldn't we just all be having, you know, a conversation in the bar? This chimed with something discussed at length by actor Jamie Parker, who was playing Brick in the production and joined us afterwards on the panel. He talked at length \u2013 and, I thought, fascinatingly \u2013 about the nature of the live experience: its addictive pull for actors, the near-primal experience of being in a room with an audience, the strange chimerical power of the theatrical event. I'm not sure I totally bought his story about the first ever Hamlet, Richard Burbage, whose death scene was apparently so convincing that audiences thought he'd died on stage (though Hamlet claims something curiously similar about the power of drama). But, hey \u2013 Parker cut his teeth among the groundlings at Shakespeare's Globe, so perhaps he has access to other forces. And it's hard to imagine the live experience being anything like as immersive with half the audience bathed in the ghostly glow of their phones, tweeting or messaging away in the murk rather than following what's happening on stage. As the LA Times reported earlier this year, some US theatres have attempted to take matters into their own hands by setting up so-called \"tweet seats\", specifically created to let their occupants tweet as they go, while keeping them safely away from people wanting to watch the show undisturbed. Part of me wonders if it's an attempt to dragoon in younger audiences; all of me wonders how many people bother to tweet if they're actually engaging with the show. What's certainly true is that theatre, if it's to work, requires a kind of complicity between performers and audiences: call it willing suspension of disbelief, call it simply willingness to pay attention. But the moment you check out and start concentrating on something else \u2013 your rumbling stomach, the train journey home, what you're going to put in 140 characters \u2013 you're lost. Personally I can't imagine wanting to tweet during a live performance, for all that I might feel the urge afterwards, and want to carry on the conversation online. As a playwright once wrote, attention must be paid. He could have added: save those tweets for later.",
