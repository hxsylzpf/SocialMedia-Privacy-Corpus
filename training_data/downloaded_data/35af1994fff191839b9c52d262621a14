  "content": "There was a glowing report on Browzar in Information Week, a browser that's supposed to help protect your privacy, plus stories in The Register, Silicon.com, BBC News and other sites that really ought to know better. But Browzar is no panacea, and not worth even the small download. First, Browzar is not a browser, it's just a small (256KB) front end for Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5.5 or later. Second, it doesn't work as claimed: see Computer Zen and Web3.0log's New secure browser Browzar is fake and full of adware.. What it does do, however, is take you to its own home page and serve you advertisements for money, via Yahoo's Overture. Great, but you can download lots of spyware toolbars that do the same thing, without the hype. The Browzar press release makes amusing reading. I particularly like this bit, from the guy who founded Freeserve in the UK: Ajaz Ahmed, founder of Browzar, said: \"Browzar will do for surfing and searching the web with privacy what eBay did for auctions and My Space did for social networking. It is the first in a range of products that we'll be rolling out this year. If that doesn't send your bullshitometer off the scale, I've got a bridge you might like to buy. Update: BBC News wrote about Browzar in Net browser promises private surf. It has now followed up the backlash with more quotes from Ajaz Ahmed in 'Adware' attack on privacy tool.",
