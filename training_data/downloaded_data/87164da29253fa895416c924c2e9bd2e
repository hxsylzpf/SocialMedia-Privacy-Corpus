If she'd tweeted her line in Bangkok, she might well have been jailed by the beyond-paranoid apparatchiks who work tirelessly to punish any public utterance that might be deemed offensive to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, his family, or the monarchy itself. Sullivan's Twitter snark went to her then-tiny group of followers following a school field trip to hear Kansas Governor Sam Brownback. It was, indeed, a bit juvenile: \"Just made mean comments at gov. brownback and told him he sucked, in person #heblowsalot.\" Actually, she hadn't done any such thing in person; it was just a joke with friends. But she was expressing a thought that lots of young people \u2013 and many of their parents and grandparents \u2013 feel about politicians of all ilks these days. But if her tweet was juvenile, the response was downright childish. An aide to the governor whose job apparently includes monitoring social networks to learn what people are saying about the boss, got in touch with the event's organizers, who got in touch with the school principal, who called in Sullivan and, she told reporters, told her she was way out of line and insisted she apologise. She declined. Naturally, the affair went viral on the internet, earning the governor, his super-sensitive aide and the principal an assortment of derision. I was one of many who thought the governor, not Sullivan, was the one who most needed to apologise, because his aide's actions had demonstrated a fairly thin understanding of free speech. To his credit, Brownback did just that. He called his staff's response an \"over-reaction\" and called free speech \"among our most treasured freedoms\". He also made a reference to the \"values of civility and decorum\" \u2013 plainly aimed at Sullivan, whose tweet could have had considerably more of both. But the story demonstrated a number of internet realities, not least of which were: the internet's ability to shame foolish official behavior; and the ability of thin-skinned officials in repressive regimes to exact revenge. The teenager (who now has more than 15,000 followers) would be wise, for example, to weigh her luck in not living in Thailand, where free speech about the monarchy can lead to much worse than a lecture from supercilious adults. In that southeast Asian nation, it can led straight to jail, and the government has vigorously enforced its l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law. In the age of the internet, enforcement of the law has taken on downright absurd qualities. A 61-year-old man was sentenced to 20 years in prison for texting a message that might have been insulting to the queen, and now the government has said it would look unfavorably on any Facebook users who would dare even to \"like\" a statement that was considered to be violating the law. I have no opinion one way or the other about Thailand's royal family. Perhaps, they are as good, or strange, or comical, as any other monarchy's royals, constitutional or otherwise. But I would wager that they would be able to tolerate insults more readily than their nation's political class seems to think. The rulers of Thailand plainly believe that the internal political benefits of enforcing their l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law outweigh the damage it causes to the country's image. Maybe they are right in this calculation, but they are wrong in the sweep of history. Criticism of the ruling class is fundamental to any notion of free speech, and a nation that can't tolerate such speech is telling the world that it is insecure in a deep way. Thailand's politicians might take a lesson from Governor Brownback. Until then, should they need to beef up their social media police force, they'll know where to look: in his office.",
