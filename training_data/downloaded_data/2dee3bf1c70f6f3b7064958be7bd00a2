  "content": "HTC says it is working on a fix for a major security vulnerability in its Android smartphones which could let apps access a user's personal information. The data exposed includes their email account names, last known network and GPS locations, SMS data including phone numbers, phone log details and system logs. HTC, which sold 11m smartphones worldwide in the second quarter of this year, did not give a timescale for the fix. The flaw, discovered by Android Police, is limited to HTC handsets rather than any Android device. But with HTC offering some of the most popular Android handsets, the revelation may mean a race against time to patch the flaws before they are exploited by criminals. According to Android Police's checks, the list of known affected phones is: \u2022 some of the HTC Sensation models \u2022 EVO 4G \u2022 EVO 3D \u2022 Thunderbolt \u2022 EVO Shift 4G \u2022 (possibly) MyTouch 4G Slide \u2022 (possibly) Vigor \u2022 (possibly) View 4G \u2022 (possibly) the upcoming Kingdom. According to Justin Case, Trevor Eckhart and Artem Russakovski at Android Police, who discovered and confirmed the flaw, they notified HTC on 24 September of their findings but after receiving no response decided to go public. In a statement, the company subsequently said that \"HTC is working very diligently to quickly release a security update that will resolve the issue on affected devices\u2026 Following a short testing period by our carrier partners, the patch will be sent over-the-air to customers, who will be notified to download and install it. We urge all users to install the update promptly. During this time, as always, we strongly urge customers to use caution when downloading, using, installing and updating applications from untrusted sources.\" The flaw was actually introduced by HTC itself, Case, Eckhart and Russakovski say that a suite of logging tools added by the company to collect user information is not secure. \"Any app on affected devices that requests [internet access], which is normal for any app that connects to the web or shows ads, can get its hands on the data,\" they wrote. \"When you install a simple, innocent-looking new game from the Market that only asks for internet [access] permission (to submit scores online, for example), you don't expect it to read your phone log or list of emails.\" Russakovski said: \"I'd like to reiterate that the only reason the data is leaking left and right is because HTC set their snooping environment up this way. It's like leaving your keys under the mat and expecting nobody who finds them to unlock the door.\" The trio created a simple proof-of-concept app which was able to replicate the accesses they feared. HTC acknowledged the flaw but said it was not aware of any exploits: \"In our ongoing investigation into this recent claim, we have concluded that while this HTC software itself does no harm to customers' data, there is a vulnerability that could potentially be exploited by a malicious third-party application\u2026 A third party malware app exploiting this or any other vulnerability would potentially be acting in violation of civil and criminal laws. So far, we have not learned of any customers being affected in this way and would like to prevent it by making sure all customers are aware of this potential vulnerability.\" Russakovski however was unsure how effective it would be. \"While I applaud HTC's desire to fix the situation quickly, I do have to wonder whether the patch will simply apply some sort of an authentication scheme to the service while letting it continue collecting the same kind of sensitive data to be potentially reported back to HTC or carriers. \"Furthermore, I'd like a clarification on what the Android VNC server, which allows remote access, is doing on affected devices.\"",
