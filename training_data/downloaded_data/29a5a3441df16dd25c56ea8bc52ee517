Tired of living your life so that you have something to tweet about? Then get reality back, and commit social media suicide with Web2.0 Suicide Machine. The Dutch website created by your unfriendly neighbourhood medialab moddr_ is designed to end users' social lives on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and LinkedIn in a spectacular way. No, users don't just delete their account. The website makes a feast out of the decision as it shows you how it unfriends person after person on Facebook, or removes bit by bit the people you follow on Twitter. We all know that social media were never meant to replace social life, but their purpose was to make it richer. However, now that the initial euphoria about social media is over, people are starting to use them more effectively or are stopping using them at all. To commit social media suicide you only need to select the social network on the website, enter the user name and your password. You even can send out your last words, which are displayed alongside your profile picture on a memorial page that Suicide Machine maintains. The project seems to be quite successful. Since its launch in December, 56,243 friends have been unfriended, 202,386 tweets have been removed and 856 people quit their online lives, according to Suicide Machine's figures as of today. But Facebook didn't see the funny side of the site. The social network, which has just announced it has 350 million members, started to prevent its use by blocking Suicide Machine's IP address yesterday, thus making it impossible to use the website to unfriend people. In a statement the social media platform said: \"Web 2.0 Suicide Machine collects login credentials and scrapes Facebook pages, which are violations of our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. We've blocked the site's access to Facebook as is our policy for sites that violate our SRR.\" The crew behind Suicide Machine aka the WORM artist collective in Rotterdam try to find a way to work around the problem. Last week Facebook shut down Seppukoo, a service that enabled users to automate the process of deleting their profile. So while Suicide Machine works well with Twitter, LinkedIn and MySpace, the only option for Facebook is at the moment to die hard.",
