  "content": "I've been told that e2everyone.com will be the new Facebook, only better. I suspect this is phishing, a scam or a virus. Grahame Stevens It doesn't look like any of those, but it does look like a pyramid scheme. People who join get free shares, and they get more free shares for signing up their friends, for recommending improvements and other actions. Members can keep their shares or sell them to other people, so they are, in effect, a form of currency. The idea is that the site will have more than 100 million members by 2012, at which point the free shares should be worth real money. Whether they will be worth more than a few pence per million is another matter. I really don't believe the 3,000 bonus shares that your friend will get for converting you will be worth \u00a31,740 in 2012. Whether the people behind e2everyone.com have other plans for making money remains to be seen, but I wouldn't give them my main email address.",
