  "content": "Terrible goings-on both in the shop and behind the scenes in Tesco. Things are getting rather personal. One customer, fresh from a ride on her horse, was asked to leave a store in Essex for smelling, and staff from branches around the country have been posting offensive remarks about customers in a Facebook discussion forum. But who can blame them? As anyone will know who has worked with the public, day in, day out - trying to make their lives easier, cleaning their hotel rooms, making their beds, doing their laundry, giving them their dinners, cleaning their lavatories, looking after their ancient relatives - it can be a grisly experience. Far too many people have no manners and seem to feel that service personnel may be bossed around and treated as subhuman slaves. I noticed it myself while waitressing decades ago. I started off cheerily, smiling at customers and being polite, but noticed that all other staff were surly, sneering and rude. One inoffensive customer approached the counter. \"I am alone,\" he said, in halting English, probably wanting a table for one. \"We all have our problems,\" snapped a waitress. I wondered why. Soon I knew. Over the years the customers had worn her down. No \"pleases\" or \"thank-yous\", orders and commands rather than requests, outrageous complaints and demands, fusspots, drunks, measly tips, or no tips at all, wasted food, staggering greed. She had seen it all, and grown bitter. Soon my little smile faded too. But there are better and braver responses than Facebook. There I was, serving customers with my friend Josephine, a history teacher, when along came the nth offensive fellow of the day. \"What's that?\" he said, glaring and pointing at a salad on the counter. Josephine had had enough. She responded strictly, using her classroom skills. \"There are three ingredients in the bowl,\" she said. \"Now see if you can tell me what they are.\" Customer obeyed like an infant. \"Celery?\" \"Well done,\" said Josephine. \"You've got one right. Now the next?\" \"Apple?\" \"Correct. One more?\" \"Dates?\" \"Excellent. Three out of three. Now what are they all mixed up in?\" \"Mayonnaise?\" \"Well done.\" \"How much?\" \"You've done very well so far. The price is on the board. Have a look and see if you can tell me.\" Customer did as he was told. He almost curtsied before the dominatrix. I think he even said thank you. The whole episode was much more rewarding than secret poison on Facebook. But we weren't so worried about getting the sack in those days, and I suppose methods, technologies and circumstances change. Unfortunately, customers don't. \u2022 A bumper crop of bad science plopped out of our universities and hospitals this week. Three lots at once, and all about relationships. The first gang, from UCL, LSE and Warwick Medical School, have \"developed a mathematical model of the mating game to help explain why courtship is often protracted\". Or as every girl's mother has probably told her, \"Don't do it on the first date. If he can't wait, he's not worth it.\" Next comes Newcastle University psychologist Dr Thomas Pollet, declaring that \"women's orgasm frequency increases with the income of their partner\". And, doziest of all, Dr Malcolm Brynin, \"leading\" sociologist at the University of Essex, advises us to avoid an intense and passionate first relationship, or at least forget about it, or it will make future partners seem \"boring and a disappointment\". I would like to tear my hair out. I ought to be used to professors churning out this sort of old-hat, inapplicable drek, time after time, but for me the shock never fades. How do they get away with it? Has Professor Robert Seymour, of UCL, been shut away in the groves of academe since birth, and does he really think that we don't know that \"longer courtship is a way for the female to acquire information about the male\". Has he ever met a female person? Or a male from the outside world? Did he not know already that we know that you can't get to know someone all that well in the course of a quick bang? Out here in the real world, when one is in the thick of it, things are even more complicated than Seymour suspects. Fielding had a fearfully difficult time in his youth trying to work out what girls wanted. He knew they didn't want too much too soon (well, not with him anyway), but couldn't quite work out why. \"She knew what I wanted, and she knew that I knew that she mustn't want to do it too soon, and that even if she did, she shouldn't, because I might think she was a bit of a loose woman, which I would have done, although I was secretly hoping she was. It was a bit of a bind, really. I'm glad it's all over.\" How do they do this research? \"Is the professor in the bed?\" asks Fielding. No, Pollet from Newcastle glued himself to the Chinese Health and Family Life Survey, counted up orgasms, studied the influencing factors and found that size of wallet did matter. And Brynin spoke from another planet, failing to explain how we might avoid first passions and ideally \"wake up already in [our] second relationship\". Are they mad? Or are they trying to drive us mad? Because some of their conclusions are rather dispiriting. \"From a female's point of view, males are not all equal,\" says Dr Peter Sozou wisely, from his cocoon at Warwick. \"She cannot eliminate this risk [of ending up with a bad male] completely unless she decides never to mate.\" And we used to think media studies was a waste of time. \u2022 This week Michele read: From the Holocaust to the Highlands by Walter Kress: \"One long, unedited, Pooterish chat, with an upbeat, adventurous, Jewish, Scottish mechanic, who escaped Vienna as a child and was treated with great kindness in Aberdeen.\" She watched The Secret Life of Elephants on BBC1: \"Upsetting. What happened to the baby with the bad leg? I daren't find out.\"",
