  "content": "The Australian Bureau of Statistics inadvertently released contact names linked to more than 5,000 Queensland businesses in what was described as a \"human error\". The breach is one of 14 the ABS has reported to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner since 2013, and was released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws. The ABS has come under scrutiny over its handling of the 2016 census, initially for the extended retention of names and addresses for a period of four years. It then faced further criticism after the census website crashed, which it attributed to a series of foreign attacks. While none of the breaches reported to the OAIC relates to the handling of any census data, some do highlight errors in the handling of other surveys as well as failures to correctly de-identify data, which is one of the criticisms raised by privacy advocates about the increased retention of census data. But they also demonstrate the ABS has taken a proactive approach to reporting data breaches \u2013 including relatively minor incidents where the recipients of emails are accidentally not BCCed \u2013 which is not mandatory under existing privacy laws. No details about two of the 14 data breaches have been disclosed by the ABS, which said that would have a \"substantial adverse effect\" on its operations. A statement the ABS issued as it simultaneously released the documents on Friday afternoon said it believed that 12 of the cases \"did not warrant reporting\" according to the privacy commissioner's own guidelines, but that it had taken a \"precautionary or 'pro-disclosure' approach\" to reporting potential breaches. In one of the breaches in January 2016, contact names linked to more than 5,000 businesses were disclosed to two officers in the Queensland government statistician's office, in breach of privacy laws and the ABS's own regulations. The list was destroyed, and the staff members who compiled it were counselled. The individuals identified were not notified of the breach because the ABS considered it to be \"minor\", and the matter was attributed by the ABS to human error. \"The team that compiled the list was provided with specifications which did not include personal information. Unfortunately, the list that was produced was not consistent with the specifications, and personal information was included. \"Normally this oversight would have been detected during the clearance process, however, the presentation of the list made it unclear personal information had been included.\" Other breaches reported by the ABS to the privacy commissioner include: An interviewer who lost a folder containing summary details from a participant in the household income and expenditure survey in October 2015. The loss was described as a \"one-off event that has been contained\", and the interviewer was counselled. Two instances in October 2015 in the engineering and construction survey where participants received envelopes relating to their companies' participation that also contained letters to other companies. The breach was attributed to an \"error in the machinery used to insert letters into envelopes in preparation for mail-out\". The sending out of 42 building activity survey forms that had been incorrectly pre-filled with information about other building jobs in November 2014. The ABS said the error was caused by a \"mail-merging error\" that was a one-off issue. The inadvertent release in 2013 of the name, date of birth, country of birth and year of arrival in Australia of a person to an incorrect household as part of a household survey. It was caused by a \"pre-filling\" error of an ABS survey form. The name and addresses of previous vehicle owners were disclosed in August 2014 to new owners in the course of a survey into motor vehicle use. The error was caused by a \"manual error\" in the entry of online forms by ABS staff. The ABS statement said the privacy commissioner was not making any ongoing inquiries in relation to the notifications. \"There have been no notifications related to the census,\" it said. \"The census processes for collection, storage and analysis are very well tested, secure, and operate in isolation from other ABS collections. \"The ABS is confident that all 14 notifications could have been prevented by improved infrastructure; removing the need for manual processing and intervention that is currently undertaken.\" The ABS is still gathering responses from the 2016 census, which some Australians have said they will boycott owing to the privacy concerns raised.",
