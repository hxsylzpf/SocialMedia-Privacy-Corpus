  "content": "Jude Law has agreed terms with ex-wife Sadie Frost after issuing legal proceedings to prevent images of their children appearing in her upcoming memoir in order to protect their privacy. Justice Tugendhat granted a permanent injunction by consent at the high court in London today after Law and Frost reached an agreement that will see certain passages relating to their turbulent marriage cut and all photographs of the children removed. It emerged last week that Law was seeking an injunction against Frost and Blake Publishing, which intends to publish the memoir Crazy Days later this year, because of concerns for the privacy and welfare of their three children. \"My client Jude Law issued proceedings against Blake Publishing and Sadie Frost, as he was concerned about certain passages in Ms Frost's forthcoming autobiography as well as the proposed publication of photographs of his children,\" said Mark Thomson, partner at law firm Atkins Thomson, which represents Law. \"Mr Law is pleased that the parties have been able to resolve this speedily; he has been able to protect his and his children's privacy and Ms Frost is able to proceed with her latest project.\" In recent months Law has taken an aggressive stance against the media when it comes to the privacy of his children. In April he won \u00a39,500 damages in a breach of privacy action with Hello! magazine which included undertakings not to publish any pictures of the actor in places \"in which he has a reasonable expectation of privacy\", or any photos of Law with his children before they are 18. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
