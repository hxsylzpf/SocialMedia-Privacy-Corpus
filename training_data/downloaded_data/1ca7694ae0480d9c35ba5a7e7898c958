At least that's what one sewing blogger's followers decided after an internet troll came out of nowhere to tell her she should \"eat less cake\". Jenny Rushmore, who blogs under Cashmerette, regularly shares her sewing plans and projects on her Instagram page \u2013 including her plans to make a swimsuit. In a now-deleted comment, the man commented on her Instagram post, telling her she should \"eat less cake\". \"It was on a picture of my curvy sketchbook where I'd drawn a pic of a swimsuit I was going to make and hashtagged it \"#beachbodyready,\" she told the Guardian. \"He said something along the lines of 'ugh, you don't have a beach body. You should eat less cake'.\" In response, Rushmore posted another picture with a defiant message for the troll. \"To the random jerk who fat-shamed me this morning in a comment and suggested I eat less cake: as you can see form this pic my life is just a sad mess, so I'm glad you've helped steer my dietary choices, cheers! #effyourbeautystandards #CakeWithCashmerette\" In response, other sewing bloggers and Cashmerette readers began sharing photos of them eating cake on Instagram, using the hashtag #CakewithCashmerette. Rushmore said she was \"overwhelmed\" by the response. \"I think body-shaming hits a nerve with a lot of women, and increasingly people want to fight back,\" she added. \"And what better and tastier way to fight back than with cake?\" Writing on her blog about the reaction, Rushmore said: Even if you *could* tell someone's health and eating habits from looking at them, so what? My health is mine. It doesn't affect anyone else. I'm not obliged to disclose my medical records to any random person who expressed fake concern about my health based on my appearance. And nor do I exist to be sexually appealing to you. Rushmore founded the Curvy Sewing Collective, a plus-size sewing community, and has also created a line of diversified and personalised fashion sketchbooks aimed at curvy women. She said: \"I'm pretty lucky that I only get comments like this occasionally but I have many curvy blogger friends who have this happen all the time, either publicly or by email, so I hear about it very frequently.\" And she says the sewing blogger community is generally very body positive. \"When you sew you learn that you can be stylish at any size, and that you don't have to change your body to fit clothes, you simply have to make clothes that fit. Sewing has changed my body image in profound ways, and I hope that more curvy women can have the same experience.\" More and more women have been fighting back against fat-shaming online. Tess Holliday, the world's first size 26 model, started the hashtag #EffYourBeautyStandards on Instagram to challenge traditional views of beauty in the media.",
