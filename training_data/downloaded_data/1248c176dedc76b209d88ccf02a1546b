  "content": "Though Jan Moir may have been disappointed, hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers breathed a sigh of relief as Stephen Fry changed his mind about quitting Twitter this week. But they're not the only ones. The indie band Patch William have recently reaped the benefits of the power Fry wields as a tastemaker. Producer Steve Levine, who has worked with Culture Club, Gary Moore and the Beach Boys \u2013 is, like many other producers these days, nurturing artists and releasing their work through his own label, and one of the acts is Patch Williams. When Levine was recording the Radio 2 programme Third Reich'n'Roll in January he requested that Fry provide the voiceover. His wishes came true and, during the recording, Fry expressed interest in what Levine was up to. The producer recommended a band he was working with, so Fry checked out their website, liked what he heard and posted a message on Twitter, saying: \"Might Patch William be the next big thing? They seem rather wonderful to me.\" Levine, who had been trying to come up with a way marketing the band, was surprised when that same day he received 4,000 messages asking about them. Patch William finished recording their album last month and posted a video (made pretty much for free by BBC trainee camera operators) on YouTube a couple of weeks ago. When Fry received a copy of the album he posted a link to the video on Twitter. That same day, it was viewed 15,000 times. Levine tells me he was just sitting there watching how the viewing figures increased by the minute. YouTube tells you which countries your video is being viewed in, and it appeared to be English-speaking countries all around the world. Fry's tweet also appears to have helped the band sell their album on iTunes, according to their producer. Fry's patronage has come as a relief to Levine, who gives The X Factor, the UK's most potent way of selling music, short shrift. \"Simon Cowell has no taste! He's sitting on one of the most powerful marketing tools in this country and he's throwing it away on mediocrity. Compare him with Berry Gordy [the founder of Motown Records],\" he says. \"Gordy had taste. He knew good songwriting and encouraged it, as he was a songwriter himself. Cowell, on the other hand has a marketing background. I'm not blaming the songwriters \u2013 they're just writing what they're told to by Cowell \u2013 it's a waste of their talent.\" Levine says he misses Top of the Pops, as it provided \"a wider spread of genres while reaching a big audience\". \"No good artists would ever go on The X Factor as it would kill any credibility, so where can they perform these days to reach a big audience?\" Fry may not be able to compete with Cowell when it comes to audience reach (Fry has around one million followers on Twitter, compared with nine million people who watch The X Factor every week), but maybe he reaches an audience that doesn't buy albums by Cheryl Cole. It appears, however, that the Twitter audience is not easily lead, and you still have to deliver the goods. After all, Ashton Kutcher has 3.7 million followers on Twitter, but his latest movie grossed $250,000 in US cinemas and his new TV series was cancelled.",
