  "content": "This morning, Radio 4's John Humphrys called Twitter \"too daft to try\", as he tried it, with a tweet. It took 140 characters for him to realise it wasn't his thing: \"Stop counting letters. Get a life instead.\" (But JH, it counts them for you!) Music types, however, are professional show-offs, so they're not nearly as reluctant to embrace the future. So welcome to the first weekly roundup of the witty, inane and Diddys of the musical Twitterverse. (Did I just write \"Twitterverse\"? Save me, John Humphrys! Save me from myself!) Twitter, of course, is not just a tool for self-promotion. It has politics and stuff. Preston from Big Brother/the Ordinary Boys/rubbish vampirism posted a link to David Grann's excellent piece in the New Yorker about the death penalty in Texas, shortly followed by: \"i got my hair cut and i look like a stupid onion head... i hate it x\". It's a window to the soul. Disappointingly, top scrapper Calvin Harris failed to start any fights lately, perhaps because regular sparring partner Conor McNicholas no longer edits NME. In fact, his mood appears to be particularly chipper and he's happily retweeting one of Diddy's many motivational missives: \"RT @iamdiddy Let's make love today people!!!\" With only three exclamation marks, that is one relaxed Diddy. But earlier today he got overexcited as his friend, producer Clinton Sparks, did a cheeky hack and tweeted as Diddy. Diddy responded: \"Mother f'n @clintonsparks broke into my twitter while I was in the vocal booth &amp; typed a very gay tweet Pls forgive me people 4 slipping lol\" I challenge you to go to Diddy's profile and try to spot the \"gay\" tweet. It's like looking for synths in a La Roux song. Some other more pleasant Twitterings this week: Mike Skinner challenges his \"own politics\" and engages with followers in a debate on public v private healthcare. The #chrisbrownsbowtie hashtag is humiliating the shamed R&amp;B star in an amusingly silly way. Solange Knowles, my favourite tweeter by far, is the xx's surprise new biggest fan. Miley Cyrus has realised she's in the wrong job: \"I've decided that I reallllllly don't like getting my picture taken.\" Katy Perry talks to herself about air conditioning. The Futureheads had a bad curry. And Skream doesn't find We Are Klang funny. Since this is going to be a regular blog, let us know who you think we should be following. Who do you rate? Who do you hate? And have you ever understood a full Courtney Love tweet?",
