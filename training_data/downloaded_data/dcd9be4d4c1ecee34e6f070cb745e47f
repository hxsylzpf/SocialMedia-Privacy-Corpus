We hope you all enjoyed it, and thank you to everyone who sent in pictures, articles, tweets, quotes and comments. Don't forget to sign up for free membership to the Culture Professionals Network \u2013 you'll not only receive discounts, newsletters, exclusive downloads and a free ebook, but you can also get early updates on future projects like this one. Data scientists at Twitter analytics platform SocialBro have crunched the numbers and found that London was the most active city during #MuseumWeek. Top locations (as of Friday 28 March): \u2022 London: 35.2% \u2022 Madrid: 13.1% \u2022 Paris: 11.8% \u2022 Rome: 9.6% \u2022 Amsterdam: 9.1% In terms of mentions, the Natural History Museum (@NHM_London) received the most mentions, with Italian museum project @svegliamuseo in second place. Update: Twitter UK has also shared a couple of stats from the past week, with this one in particular catching the eye: \u2022 There have been more than 215,000 mentions of #MuseumWeek-related terms since the initiative launched on March 11th Here's a different take on museums: a mix/soundscape by UK electronica artist and PhD geneticist Max Cooper, inspired by the British Museum. Here's what he says about the project: The brief for this mix was to make something inspired by an architectural space. When I was doing my post-doc at University College London, I used to go the British Museum to relax and work in the beautiful library there, so I chose the space for the mix. It features a 12th century Tibetan monks song, one of the first ever recordings of music, made by Thomas Edison on a wax cylinder in 1888, poetic spoken word, a 9th century Gregorian Chant and more\u2026 A few pieces from the Culture Pros archive that tie in nicely with today's museums curator/creator theme: What happened to the expert curator? In a world where we can 'curate' our Whole Foods basket, what cultural currency does curation now hold? Interview with Kate Farrell, special exhibitions curator, the Lowry A former dancer on curating exhibitions around performance and the value of an arts education versus venue experience A spotlight on the exhibition designer We light, frame and stage, says Dinah Casson about the anarchic, sensorial and invisible world of exhibition design Digital engagement specialist Abhay Adhikari has written a great piece for us about data in arts and culture organisations. The sector must think about data, he writes \u2013 but differently. Museums have a significant amount of reusable data about their collections, and this information can be combined with other sources to encourage discovery and learning. It's an approach best illustrated by V&amp;A's Digital Map, launched in September 2013. The map, which is based on insight into visitor behaviour, combines collection data with real time information about events in the physical spaces of the museum, as well as information about essential facilities. This clever use of data from multiple sources is a great way to tell new stories about collections; it's also an opportunity for both virtual and physical audiences to discover objects on their own terms. The map is a great example of how museums can embrace emerging digital trends in a multi-channel, multi-device world. Today is #AskTheCurator day, your opportunity to connect directly with those creating and curating the exhibitions you love so much. Here's an example of the kind of back-and-forth you can expect: All this week we're digging out old museum-focused pieces from the Culture Pros archive \u2013 put on the kettle, sit yourself down and have a read the following: Volcanoes and earthquakes: what can museums learn from rolling news? Can exhibitions adapt to news, future knowledge and events? The Natural History Museum wants to stay current, permanently The future of museums in China With sky-high running costs, low attendance figures and issues with access, Chinese museums are facing uncertain times Tumblr tips for arts and museums From social strategy to post types, we roundup all the best tips and insights from our last live chat on Tumblr for the arts Kensington Palace: a happy marriage of arts and heritage ambition When Historic Royal Palaces invited theatre company Coney to play at Kensington Palace, neither party predicted the outcome A fantastic shot of Tate's Turbine Hall before it became what it is today: It was a year ago this week that a fire gutted Walworth Town Hall and put the library next door out of action. The good news is that approval has now been given to rebuild the London town hall and create a temporary library on Elephant Road. From wellbeing to the magic of discovery, five museum pros from across the world revealed yesterday why they love doing what they do. Here's just a sample of what they had to say: A pair of tweets summing up the spirit of today's #BehindTheArt theme: Kathryn White, museums and galleries development manager at Kirklees Council, has sent in a lovely quote to follow on from yesterday's article about what it is that makes museums so special: Museums are fabulous portals to adventures in time and space, rather like the Tardis in Doctor Who. Fancy a trip to Ancient Egypt or want to meet Henry VIII? Off you go. Museums have the Wow factor, and the capacity to change lives. The combined power of the real thing and its interpretation reaches people in a way that nothing else can. Museums make cultural heritage accessible to all, putting our humanity in context and helping us to understand ourselves and others. They also provide cool places to hang out or keep the kids dry on a wet bank holiday! Without the past there is no future and we must ensure that we continue to find new and innovative ways to make the past relevant, to capture the present and to shape the future. #MuseumWeek on Twitter is reaching a huge, diverse audience and doing exactly that. What about you? What makes your local museum special to you? Let us know in the comments section below\u2026 Today is a all about the structure, architecture and history behind museums. It's a day of knowledge and discovery \u2013 for example, finding out the V&amp;A was once called the South Kensington Museum. As per the tweet below, it was renamed in 1899\u2026 Another excellent submission for today's #MuseumMemories theme. London's Handel House Museum tweeted this video, which just goes to show some of the fantastic work being done by museums around audience accessibility, inclusion and engagement. Photographer Sara Porter has submitted her museum memory: her picture of moth specimens at the Leeds City Museum: Highlights for me have to be being commissioned to photograph the natural history collection in storage at Leeds the City Museum. Most difficult part of the job? Trying to choose which of the thousands of specimens to include. It's a question we put to five museum pros from across the world, each of whom revealed why they love doing what they do\u2026 Museums matter: what makes our cultural institutions so special? \"The magic of working in our museum is that your job is about creating a brighter world,\" said Anna Hansen, head of research at the Jamtli museum in \u00d6stersund, Sweden. For Miriam Bader, education director at New York's Tenement Museum, it's about the magic of discovery: They are treasure troves of interesting stuff that make us think and see the world and our place within it differently. They have the power to make us stop and wonder and be curious, to challenge our views, and ask new questions. Why are museums special to you? Let us know in the comments section below Like Judi Dench? Like Vikings? Then you'll love this picture of Dame Judi welcoming visitor number 13 million to York's Jorvik Viking Centre. #MuseumMemories (or is that M-ories?) indeed! Museum Memories day is a bit like when your mum shows off those embarrassing baby bath pics of you to room full of strangers. \u2026 just me? Check out these two historical shots from the Elgar Birthplace Museum and Cardiff's Library of Amgueddfa Cymru: We're delighted to reveal that a handful of UK museums have been nominated for the MW2014 conference's Best of the Web awards.

Today is a day for museum pros and audiences to share their favourite museum stories and memorable visits. What are yours? Join in with the conversation online via the Twitter hashtag #MuseumMemories. #MuseumMastermind Ben Templeton has written some fascinating articles around museum apps. One piece in particular on how he and his team made the Who do you think you were? web app has some great insights for any museum pros thinking about digital. You want to build an app. To reach a digital audience. And promote your exhibition. So far so normal. 'Gimme an app' has been a common reaction to the memo-from-on-high demanding digital innovation. But the marketplace is crowded \u2013 it's noisy and I find myself asking: has the app had its day? Some other great museum-related app stories for your perusal: How we made the Dickens Papers, Night Walks app If Dickens were alive today, would he publish on iPad? Probably, say the team whose app follows in the author's footsteps How we made the Romans app for iPad, iPhone and Android Driving footfall is a challenge for the Corinium Museum; its Romans app aims to counter that by reaching a global audience How we made the London: A City Through Time app How do you convert a 900-page encyclopaedia into an iPad app as useful to real tourists as it is engaging for armchair ones? How we made the Magic in Modern London app The Wellcome Collection's app is a London treasure hunt for the amulet collection of Edwardian folklorist Edward Lovett We're also planning to launch a few #MuseumWeek set pieces of our own, so if you work in museums, galleries or any other cultural institution, why not let us know what makes your job so special\u2026 Who says museums aren't fashionable places? The Fashion Museum in Bath has posted a few teasers to tie in with today's quiz and knowledge theme \u2013 are you an Yves Saint Laurent kind of #MuseumMastermind, or more like David Beckham in a sarong? In the spirit of today's Museum Week theme, here are some of the #MuseumMasterminds we've featured in Arts head, our weekly interview series that asks the top pros what they think about the big issues facing the sector. \u2022 Camilla Hampshire, museums manager, RAMM Exeter We're home to more than a million artefacts, but the real magic happens when a human mind encounters an engaging object \u2022 Amit Sood, director, Google Cultural Institute You can never replicate the experience of seeing a work of art online; I still prefer seeing van Gogh's The Starry Night in person \u2022 Jo Quinton-Tulloch, head of museum, National Media Museum In order to remain successful and sustainable, every museum needs to constantly change and adapt to its economic, social and cultural environment \u2022 Graham Boxer, director, IWM North There will always be a place and a demand for museums \u2013 this is because museums hold the real artefacts from our past; we should never forget their power A ribbiting good Instagram shot from London's Horniman Museum and Gardens to illustrate yesterday's behind-the-scenes theme. \"We've plenty of frogs on display, but our staff are working with many more species,\" revealed the team. Some examples of the kind of thing you might see in today's quiz-themed conversations. Cambridge University's Fitzwilliam Museum is getting people to name a flower every hour \u2013 have a guess as to what flower this work from Pierre-Joseph Redout\u00e9 depicts: Elsewhere, the V&amp;A has been rather clever in asking what came first: the chicken or the egg? Welcome to our slow-live blog of Museum Week, a Twitter event and conversation designed to highlight the great work being done behind the scenes at UK museums, and of those across the world. With each day of the week comes a new theme \u2013 today's is #MuseumMastermind, and it's all about the fun and games: museums will ask questions, pose riddles and create quizzes to test the general public's knowledge. Your starters for ten coming up\u2026 It's worth mentioning that #MuseumWeek isn't a UK-exclusive event; museums and cultural institutions from all over the world are also taking part, and to great effect \u2013 check out the following tweet from the Sierra Leone National Railway Museum. Two words for you: Coconut. Break. A couple of truly fascinating #DayInTheLife tweets for you. Ever wondered how you go about repairing a tricky tear in a work of fine art? Laura, painting conservator at the National Portrait Gallery, uses a special mix of gelatine, chalk and linseed oil to fill a tear in the museum's portrait of judge Sir William Lee. Max Barclay, one of the collections managers at the Natural History Museum, also shows us the tools you need to curate specimen drawers \u2013 in this case, he has to put away a loan of 14 beetles. Another piece from the vault In June last year, Leigh-Anne Stradeski, chief exec of The National Children's Museum, posed the question: How can today's kids' museums keep up with today's kids? It was all about chewing and \u2013 er \u2013 pooing. There's both an art and a science to creating and sustaining an inspirational children's museum, but the fundamental, indisputable and pervasive principle which underpins any success involves placing the child at the centre of the experience. And if there's one thing children the world over love to do, it's play. Over at the Historic Royal Palaces Twitter feed, Henry VIII (yes, him!) is taking over for the day. \"You can relax,\" he says. \"We promise there will be no beheadings.\" What does his day consist of? He's had a haircut \u2013 shorter crops are very in this century \u2013 lunch of Barnacle Goose, a spot of tennis and later, from 8pm, His Royal Highness will be answering your questions via the #AskHentryVIII hashtag. Another image update, this time from the Dulwich Picture Gallery team, who show just how many museum pros it takes to change a lightblub hang a work of art. Measure once and all that\u2026 The big reveal Today's #MysteryObject from the British Museum was a gunner's level. \"The gilt brass instrument consists of a graduated quadrant with a plummet and an upright hollow cylinder, both fixed to a slightly curved rectangular base,\" reads the collection inscription. It would have sat on a gun barrel to help firing Throughout the week, we'll also be sharing some of the museums content we've published over the years. First up is a recent one from professor of museum studies Richard Sandell and comedian Mat Fraser, who wrote about how museums have a vital role to play in changing society's attitude to disability. Our archives don't just speak about it, wrote Mat; they shout about it. Outside the box: rethinking how museums present disability Some other museums worth a mention are those who made the final five in this year's Museums + Heritage Awards 2014 Culture Pros Pick. Late last year we launched a search for the UK's most inspiring museum or heritage visitor attraction of the past year. We've sifted through over 350 nominations for the award, and the following five institutions received the most nominations to go through to the public vote: \u2022 The Haslemere Educational Museum, Surrey \u2022 Barts Pathology Museum, London \u2022 Powell-Cotton Museum, Quex House and Gardens, Kent \u2022 Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, Bournemouth \u2022 Kelmscott Manor, Gloucestershire Who should win this year? Vote directly or by using the form below. At the British Museum, Mondays are all about #MysteryObject; the museum team tweets a picture of one of its arefacts, and users try to guess what it is. Simples. Guesses for this week's offering (below) include: a measuring instrument, metronome, sextant, sundial and a \"posh cafetiere\" Today's theme \u2013 #DayInTheLife \u2013 is all about what goes on behind the scenes on an average museum day. A striking shot below from the British Film Institute with a touch of the Matrix about it: production manager Scott Starck takes a moment while accessing the BFI National Archive's film print collection. When you're having a conversation with hundreds of thousands of other people, it makes sense to lay some ground rules. So, in an attempt to bring some order to events, Twitter has proposed that each day of Museum Week represents a specific aspect of museum life: Monday 24th #DayInTheLife: an insider view of what goes on behind the scenes on a typical day at the museum Tuesday 25th #MuseumMastermind: museums will ask questions, pose riddles and create quizzes to test the general public's knowledge Wednesday 26th #MuseumMemories: a day for museum pros and audiences to share their favourite museum stories and memorable visits Thursday 27th #BehindTheArt: a day focusing on the structure, architecture and history behind the institutions involved Friday 28th #AskTheCurator: an opportunity for arts fans to connect directly with those creating and curating the exhibitions you see every week The weekend will also see the return of #MuseumSelfie, a day where visitors, curators, managers and mascots are encouraged to snap a shot inside the walls of their local museum. The week finally comes to and end on Sunday, when it's the turn of the audience to #GetCreative, tweeting new titles for historic works and summarising collection in under 140 characters. Today marks the beginning of Museum Week on Twitter. In a effort to highlight the great work being done behind the scenes at UK museums, and to make the work of these cultural institutions more open and transparent to the general public, Twitter has launched the #MuseumWeek hashtag. Starting on Monday 24 March, more than 300 museums, galleries and cultural institutions from across the country will come together for the event, tweeting throughout the week. Organisations taking part in the UK range from leading cultural organisations to smaller and more specialist collections. Ed Vaizey, minister for culture, communications and the creative industries, has already commented on the initiative. \"Our museums are fascinating places of knowledge and discovery,\" he remarked. \"The first ever #MuseumWeek will allow millions of followers to get a unique glimpse behind the scenes.\" Stay tuned for updates, articles and information on how you can get involved\u2026",
