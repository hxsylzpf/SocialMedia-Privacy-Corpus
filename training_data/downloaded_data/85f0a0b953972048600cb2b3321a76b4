  "content": "One of the oddest aspects of the Twitter joke trial was that no one who read Paul Chambers's ironic tirade felt it constituted a credible threat. Staff at Doncaster's Robin Hood airport who first spotted his message of frustration, police officers and prosecutors, it emerged, all passed on their concerns to superiors out of a reluctant sense of duty. Chambers, 27 and a trainee accountant, had arrived at the snow-bound airport on 6 January 2010 hoping to fly to Belfast to meet Sarah Tonner, whom he had met on Twitter where she was known as @CrazyColours. Eager to see his girlfriend, he sent out a tweet on the publicly accessible site declaring: \"Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!!\" A week later he was arrested by four officers from South Yorkshire police who visited his office at a car distribution firm in Doncaster. Chambers subsequently lost his job as a financial supervisor. He was prosecuted under section 127(1) of the Communications Act 2003, which prohibits sending \"by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character\". In May 2010, Chambers was convicted by the district judge Jonathan Bennett sitting at Doncaster magistrates court and fined \u00a31,000. The judge accepted that, although it was an unusual case, the message was nonetheless of a \"menacing nature in the context of the times we live in\". Chambers's battle to have his conviction overturned rapidly escalated into a public confrontation with the judicial establishment, highlighting the law's difficulties in discriminating between the differing tones of voice deployed in emails, tweets and text messaging. As Chambers's lawyers pointed out, he was not attempting to close down a public transport hub but urging it to resume normal working operations. His supporters \u2013 including the MP and Twitter enthusiast Louise Mensch, freedom of speech campaigners and comedians such as Stephen Fry, Al Murray and Graham Linehan \u2013 have complained that Chambers in effect was prosecuted for telling a bad joke. Defining what constitutes merely a jest and what is of a \"menacing character\" has not been easy for the judges. At Chambers's first appeal, his counsel, Stephen Ferguson, insisted the message was not menacing and that there was no intent to menace. The tweet was \"obviously facetious\" and \"a parody\", he added. A senior airport official, Steve Armson, told the court he had \"determined it was a non-credible threat\" and the airport duty manager, Sean Duffield, said the impact after he found Chambers's message was \"operationally nothing. It had no impact.\" But Judge Jacqueline Davies, sitting with two magistrates, dismissed the appeal. The message was clearly menacing, she explained. \"Any ordinary person reading this would see it in that way and be alarmed.\" With his legal fees being paid by the proceeds of benefit sessions staged by a cast of comedians, Chambers, and a new solicitor, David Allen Green of Preiskel &amp; Co, took the case to the divisional court. Ben Emmerson QC told Lord Justice Gross and Mr Justice Irwin that \"the preponderance of evidence was that this was a joke\". The prosecution, he said, was \"a steamroller to crack a nut\". Emmerson also relied on article 10 of the European convention of human rights, arguing the case was a curtailment of freedom of expression. Robert Smith QC, for the director of public prosecutions, disputed that, stating: \"The message was posted at a time when the potential threat to airport security was high. It was capable of being read by members of the airport staff and members of the public as a threat to airport safety and public safety.\" Unusually, the divisional court failed to reach a decision \u2013 an outcome suggesting the two judges were divided in their opinions. A new appeal was ordered before a more senior bench consisting of the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, Mr Justice Owens and Mr Justice Griffith William. At that hearing last month, Chambers was represented by John Cooper QC. Four grounds of appeal were advanced: that the tweet was no longer a \"message\" when it was eventually discovered, having by then become part of a website; that, decorated with exclamation marks, the tweet was self-evidently a joke not a menacing communication; that there was no intention to menace; and that prosecution was a restriction of freedom of expression. After the initial magistrates court verdict, Chambers had remarked that his tweet was \"like having a bad day at work and stating that you could murder your boss. I didn't even think about whether it would be taken seriously.\"",
