But most people don't get even 15 minutes of fame. If you want to know what happened to your former school friends, without hiring a private detective, there is no simple way of finding out. However, websites such as Friends Reunited can sometimes help. Friends Reunited is a powerfully simple idea. You join the site and register which schools you went to, with dates. Ideally, you should also fill out a profile giving a brief rundown of your life, and upload a few photos. All the other members of the site will now be able to look you up, either by searching for your name and age or, more likely, scanning a list of people who went to the same school. The site was launched in the UK in 2000 by Steve and Julie Pankhurst. Like most of us, Julie wondered what had happened to her old school friends, and Steve was looking for a good idea for a website. It started to take off in 2001, which is when I joined, and had about 15 million members by the end of 2005. It was bought by ITV for \u00a3120m. Friends Reunited has extended its scope over the years. As well as schools and colleges, it now covers workplaces, teams, clubs and even streets. As well as the UK, coverage extends to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia. (The US has Classmates.com.) It has also spawned companion sites such as Genes Reunited, for people tracing their family tree, Friends Reunited Connections (message boards), Friends Reunited Dating, and Friends Reunited Jobs. But the success of Friends Reunited has proved somewhat limited. It would be brilliant if everybody joined and participated to the full. But most people can't be bothered. My old secondary school, for example, seems to have about a quarter of the names I'd hope for, and includes a lot of girls. This is odd, because I went to a boys' school. You may have better luck, of course. It's even harder to find people from university because they are not tagged by department. And if you do find someone that you remember fondly, you run into the site's major drawback: money. Friends Reunited will let you write them a message, but won't deliver it unless you upgrade your membership for \u00a37.50. The site makes money from subscriptions, but I suspect that many potential contacts are never sought or rapidly abandoned. Charging might not matter much if the site had no competition. However, it now has to compete with MySpace and Facebook, and both have generated much more buzz than Friends Reunited over the past couple of years. Not everybody uses MySpace or Facebook either, but they clearly have plenty of enthusiastic users. And they let you find and get in touch with old friends for free.",
