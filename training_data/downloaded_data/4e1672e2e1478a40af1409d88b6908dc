  "content": "Muxlim, the social networking site for a Muslim audience, was set up in December 2006 and now employs 20 staff at its base in Helsinki, Finland. The UK office opened in October 2008 and the whole operation is backed by Swedish venture capital firm Rite Internet. Founder and chief executive Mohamed El-Fatatry - fresh from a trip to the White House and with a few US deals on the pipeline - explains what he wants the site to achieve. \u2022 Explain your business to my Mum \"We bring a lot of Muslims together online to share content related to their lifestyle. \"Users can create profiles for themselves as well as share videos, pictures, opinion polls, etc. The site is content-centric and is designed to enhance the Muslim lifestyle through active use of technology and social media.\" \u2022 How do you make money? \"We sell people stuff (virtual items, content and subscriptions), and show them ads. We also use our brand to push existing products/services such as calling cards, credit/debit cards, merchandise and so on to this huge untapped market.\" \u2022 What's your background? \"My father was the chief editor at the largest newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, and back in the mid-nineties when the internet was not available to individuals yet, I used to go to his workplace and use it. It was very empowering to tell my friends at school the wrestling match results of the next season - it was always aired one season later on local TV. From that point onwards, it became very apparent that technology can empower individuals and allow them to do things that no one thought possible. \"I also created a personal website, and allowed my friends to share their pictures there with the ability to comment on them, long before the existence of sites like Flickr and Youtube. Then at the age of 16, I was the youngest higher education instructor in the history of the UAE when I taught the web development course at the Emirates Institute of Technology. After that I moved on to study computer science at the American University, and from there was offered a job at a subsidiary of the world's largest satellite imagery company. I worked there until I left to study media technology in Finland five years ago.\" \u2022 How are personalisation and recommendation part of your business? \"Personalisation and recommendation are very important for any social media business as we expect users to share their lives with others, and as a side effect bring more people to our site. We are currently working on an easy share tool to allow users to publish their content to any other social media website with one click.\" \u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months? \"We now have 1.5 million visitors, 180,000 registered users and our target is 250,000 within 12 months.\" \u2022 Name your closest competitors \"Mecca.com and Naseeb.com.\" \u2022 How do you plan to survive the downturn? \"We are a very efficient well-oiled machine that has very low burn rate, and solid organic growth. \"From an advertiser perspective, non-measurable advertising channels will significantly suffer, but we are lucky to be in a channel that is very well measurable and cost-effective.\" \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? \"Expanding internationally with minimum overheads and avoiding spreading ourselves too thin across all our products.\" \u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch? \"Blyk and Spotify.\" \u2022 Who's your mentor? \"Taneli Tikka has been very influential in my development as a tech entrepreneur.\" \u2022 How's you work/life balance? \"Not ideal - way too much work, but that's how it usually is if you really want it to work out. It's a tough game, so get real or go home.\" \u2022 What's the most important piece of software or web tool that you use each day? \"Spotify.\" \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? \"The strongest and most recognised Muslim lifestyle brand in the world that spans online and offline products.\" Muxlim.com So what do you think? \u2022 How much room is there for niche social networks, or will the big players like Facebook continue to dominate? \u2022 How can niche sites like Muxlim use the larger networks to build their profile? \u2022 Would the site benefit from a partnership with a mobile social net specialist?",
