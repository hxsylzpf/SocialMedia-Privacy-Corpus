  "content": "David Beckham has been granted compassionate leave by his club, Real Madrid, to allow him to join his wife and family after allegations that he had an affair with his former personal assistant. The England captain was given permission to miss the club's Champions League game in Monaco tomorrow night, and is thought to have travelled to Switzerland where his wife, Victoria, and children Romeo and Brooklyn are on a skiing holiday. Beckham was not eligible to play in the game after being booked in the first leg a fortnight ago. His absence from the stadium was ensured by allegations in the News of the World that he had had a three-month affair with Rebecca Loos, a one-time employee of his former management company SFX. It is unclear whether Beckham will rejoin his team-mates when they return to training in Spain on Thursday. In a statement issued on Sunday, Beckham described the claims as \"ludicrous\", but stopped short of a denial of the paper's central allegations. Speculation has surrounded the state of his marriage since the midfielder joined Real Madrid from Manchester United in a \u00a325m move in the summer. Victoria Beckham's failure to move to Madrid and the couple's decision not to enrol their children in a school in Madrid has further fuelled speculation.",
