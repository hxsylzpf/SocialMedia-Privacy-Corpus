Many are struggling to deal with the loss of control brought by supporters using Facebook, blogging, Flickr and other new media to promote their favourite charity brands. \"Large charities are finding people taking ownership of their brand without them even knowing about it,\" said Tom Mansel-Pleydel, head of client servics at JustGiving. \"But it can bring a lot of advantages,\" he told the Institute of Fundraising's national convention in central London. \"It used to be a charity's relationship with people started when they became donors but now it can start before they even know about it.\" He gave the example of a boy whose YouTube video supporting the BBC's Children in Need had generated 160,000 page views. CharlieIsSoCoolLike has raised \u00a3300-\u00a3400 but is worth far more in publicity terms, Mansel-Pleydel added. Facebook now accounts for around 20% of JustGiving's own revenue, he said. Despite the potential, some big name charities were worried about what is dubbed Web 2.0 - interactive new media tools. One has banned them throughout its headquarters. \"Instead they should be encouraging staff to look at things like Facebook to see how they could help them. It's not going to go away,\" he added. Many charities have embraced social media, he said. The MS Society, for example, has an active forum where people discuss issues that concern them. \"That has saved them a lot of expensive research,\" he said. A voluntary adoption agency, Coram, said it was worried a video had been posted on YouTube accusing it of stealing children. Mansel-Peyedel advised the charity to post its own video rebuttal. \"If you try to get it banned the allegation is just going to resurface elsewhere. You need to fight fire with fire,\" he said.",
