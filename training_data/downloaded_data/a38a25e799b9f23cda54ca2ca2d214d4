We might take money - but it doesn't mean we need to.\" Sheryl Sandberg. Photograph: TechCrunch50-2008/Flickr/Some rights reserved Facebook raised $100m last year, mostly for new servers; its user base has doubled to over 200 million members since then, and the consensus has been that it needs more cash to support its next phase of growth. Of course, no one expects Sandberg to admit that the social net is in need of cash - even if the team was feverishly trying to raise money behind the scenes. But she did acknowledge that it was time to show its existing investors some tangible results: \"This was a year where we were really, I think, going to have to execute,\" Sandberg told Bloomberg. Just what does that mean? It means running more effective ad campaigns, using more precise targeting, and capitalising on Facebook's maturing audience. Sandberg said that the ads coming down the pike would boost sales by 70% this year. It also means eking out a profit, and she said the network was on a \"clear path to be cash-flow positive next year.\" From paidContent: \u2022 From boardroom to courtroom: A retrospective of the Motorola/Paul Liska affair \u2022 Justice Department scrutinises Google Books settlement for possible antitrust violations \u2022 Associated Content raises $6m in third round \u2022 Twitter still having problems holding onto new users \u2022 NBC.com rolls out some new video-ad option From paidContent:UK: \u2022 Russian software developer 1C seeks $100m private equity placement \u2022 Fremantle, ITV sign global Britain's Got Talent deal; still no official UK vids \u2022 Print Roundup: Independent for sale?; Channel M cuts; the French Post launches \u2022 Android-based G1 is T-Mobile's bestselling device \u2022 Broadband Content Bits: People's Music Store-Universal; BSkyB's green button; platform-A \u2022 Smeared by privacy pirates: Phorm goes on offensive with site launch \u2022 Earnings: WPP revenue falls faster than expected; recovery still due next year \u2022 FT.com looks to readers for leader column inspiration",
