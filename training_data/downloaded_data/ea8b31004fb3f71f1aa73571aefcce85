  "content": "Fresh attempts to postpone the eagerly anticipated courtroom appearance of Hollywood superstars Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones will be made tomorrow, lawyers at the high court claimed today. The golden couple's battle with a magazine they accuse of sneaking pictures of their New York wedding in November 2000 was originally scheduled to begin in London today. This date was postponed until February 3 to allow various preliminary legal applications, but lawyers for Hello! magazine, which the couple are suing for millions of pounds, said they would be opposing fresh attempts to further delay the trial tomorrow. The couple today failed to strike out Hello!'s defence following allegations that the magazine had submitted false information to the high court. The vice-chancellor, Sir Andrew Morritt, ruled after a preliminary hearing that the conduct attributed to the Hello! defendants \"leaves a very great deal to be desired with regard to the veracity of their evidence\". But he said he was not persuaded that a fair trial was no longer possible or the deficiencies on the part of Hello! justified an order striking out their defence. The couple had signed a \u00a31m deal with Hello!'s rival magazine, OK!, for exclusive pictures of their \u00a31.2m wedding. But Hello! hit the streets three days earlier than OK! with its own snatched \"exclusive\" photographs of the stars at their wedding in the Plaza Hotel. It was claimed at earlier hearings that Hello! boss Eduardo Sanchez Junco had had his own \u00a31.3m offer for exclusive rights turned down. The couple, who will appear at the high court when the proceedings eventually make it to the courtroom, claim their private lives have been violated, causing them stress and loss of income from syndication rights. They will say their professional careers have been damaged because the photographs published by Hello! were of poor quality.",
