  "content": "He used to call it his \"hobby\". Many of us might read, play football or fish, but for Justin Timberlake, Grammy-winning, multi-platinum pop star, his hobby was acting in Hollywood movies. He couldn't just stick to golf (though he's good at that, too). The self-deprecating description was probably sensible, taking the pressure of expectation off his appearances in films as varied as indie sizzler Black Snake Moan to animated cash cow Shrek The Third. After all, the one-time Disney kid could have expected to see his screen ambitions dismissed as a Mickey Mouse endeavour, although you wouldn't want to mention this to his face. Not because \u2013 as with previous singer-actors, from Frank Sinatra to Mark Wahlberg \u2013 you'd be worried about getting a smack but because, well, he's just so damn nice. \"Hey, how's it going? I'm Justin.\" He strolls over and shakes hands, on location for his latest movie, The Social Network. He doesn't know a journalist is on set, just spots an unfamiliar face, talking with the crew, and decides to say hello. Diva, he ain't. Segueing from the teenybopper frenzy of boyband 'NSync to fully fledged solo stardom \u2013 17m records sold and counting, plus a successful producing career \u2013 he has never lost the aura of being wholesome. Even ripping off Janet Jackson's top at the Superbowl in 2004 \u2013 the so-called \"wardrobe malfunction\" \u2013 didn't tarnish this. He's polite, well-dressed, and he's nice to his mom, Lynn Harless, whose management company plays on his name: Just-In Time Entertainment. His past squeezes include Cameron Diaz and fellow Mickey Mouse Club alumnus Britney Spears, but Mom recently gushed publicly about his currently girlfriend, A-Team star Jessica Biel, who pops along during shooting to watch Timberlake act under direction from David Fincher. Working with cinema's Prince Of Darkness (Seven, Zodiac) is definitely a step up for the Prince of Pop. \"David is without doubt one of my film-making heroes,\" says Timberlake. \"I think Fight Club is a perfect movie, a perfect movie. I've taken this very seriously, getting to work with such a great talent, you know?\" The result is his best performance, by a distance, in a film Rolling Stone praised as, \"The movie of the year that also brilliantly defines the decade.\" With a script by The West Wing's Aaron Sorkin, based on the story of the creation of Facebook, The Social Network is a zeitgeist-nailing, heavyweight Oscar-favourite. And it cements a suspicion that has been growing for some time: Justin Timberlake really is, like, a proper actor. There's a delicious irony in his casting, too: he's playing Sean Parker, the man whose co-creation of free, peer-to-peer download site Napster shook the music industry in 1999. The movie has proved controversial, with arguments over how true it is in showing Parker befriending Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and driving a wedge between him and his best friend and chief investor Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). The truth, though, is slippery. Take Parker's story, recounted to Vanity Fair, of meeting Timberlake at a club: \"He said he wanted to get to know me, but I said, 'That isn't going to help you play the part Sorkin has written. That character really isn't me.'\" 'I ran into him in New York and spoke to him for probably no longer than three minutes, but he was really nice' Timberlake on meeting the man he plays, Napster co-founder Sean Parker In contrast, Timberlake says he hadn't even been cast at that point. \"It had sort of gotten blasted out across the internet that the movie was being made,\" he says. \"And it had been speculated that I was being cast, but it wasn't official. It was an interesting time. I ran into him in New York and spoke to him for probably no longer than three minutes, but he was really nice. I kind of wished that I would have met him later, because I would have had more to talk about, but it was sort of a serendipitous thing. We just said hello and he wished us all the best of luck, though I couldn't actually accept it because I wasn't officially cast yet!\" He repeats his positive point (naturally): \"He seemed like a really nice guy.\" Timberlake snared Fincher's attention through his supporting part in Alpha Dog and guest stints on Saturday Night Live, which showed him to be \"fearless\". The director also saw a quality in Timberlake that stemmed from his musical day job. \"You know, the script describes Parker as sort of Sinatra-like,\" says Fincher, \"and we had a lot of really talented actors come in to read for this, because it's a fun part, and a lot of people had the chops. But Sean Parker, for our movie \u2013 I don't know what he's like in real life \u2013 has to be one of those guys who knows, 'If I take you and I introduce you to this person, what comes of it is this thing where I can take credit.' You know what I mean? So Justin's experiences as a record producer \u2013 how he perceives talent, where it can go, what it can do for him \u2013 he just innately understood that.\" Timberlake still had to go through a rigorous auditioning process before he was cast, a contrast, perhaps, to his dominant position in pop. \"To be honest as a musician I've fought for everything I've ever gotten as well, so they're actually very similar,\" he says, with just a trace of defensiveness. \"I find that there is always someone who is sort of around to tell you that you should be doing something a different way, but the difference here is it's David Fincher and I trust every instinct he has. So the process of making this film, versus having the responsibility of putting together a project like a record or a tour, was actually less weighty. It was a lot easier to give up and submit. \"You put yourself in his hands,\" the 29-year-old continues, drifting into an American football metaphor. \"We're not quarterbacks, you know, we're not forwards, we're linebackers and it's like, 'Do the play this way, now do the play this way, now do the play this way!' That's sort of the quick \u2013 actually, really shitty \u2013 analogy, that I could give. But it really is like that. I think we all respect David so much that, you know, you sort of just want to please him.\" Late at night, his on screen scene completed, Timberlake remains to read off-camera lines to Eisenberg. In a baseball cap, blue jeans, Technics T-shirt and thick-rimmed glasses, he's stylishly understated \u2013 keeping his head down, working hard. There's something reassuringly retro about him. Though there are various adoring tributes on Facebook, Timberlake is not on the site; his tastes in communication run a little more old-school. \"Postcards are good,\" he smiles. \"Postcards are like the original text messages.\" He's having plenty of chance to send them, with a state-hopping shooting schedule. Comedy Bad Teacher, co-starring Cameron Diaz, is in the can, romcom Friends With Benefits is shooting now, and upcoming he has an untitled sci-fi drama from Andrew Niccol, writer of The Truman Show. Timberlake isn't abandoning his other career, but it seems the demands of movie studios could keep him out of the music one for a while. He knows, though, that questions about his next album, his next tour, will always be there, whatever he's working on. \"On this, I taught some of the grips how to dance a little bit!\" he laughs. He's not serious. Except about the acting.",
