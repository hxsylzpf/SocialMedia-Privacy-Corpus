BT and Phorm sparked a privacy backlash in 2006 and 2007 when it emerged that the companies were covertly trialling software that tracked peoples' internet behaviour in order to deliver targeted advertising. BT, the UK's largest broadband provider, ditched the controversial system in 2009. The CPS ruled on Friday that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute BT and Phorm under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), which makes it an offence to intercept internet traffic without either the user's explicit consent or a judicial warrant. Simon Davies, director of the campaign group Privacy International, said his organisation would appeal for a judicial review of the CPS ruling but feared that it would \"fall flat on its face\" into a \"legal black hole\". \"Going to appeal against BT or Phorm \u2013 or even Google \u2013 in the UK is simply going to fall flat on its face,\" Davies told the Guardian. \"There's a real risk that big corporations are escaping scot-free whenever they violate the rights of people in the UK. There doesn't appear to be any legal infrastructure to tackle these companies.\" Davies said he felt that budget cuts were forcing law enforcement agencies to be more selective with investigations. \"It's fundamentally a problem with the budget freeze,\" he said. \"The police can't find any legal powers or aren't prepared to because of the cost \u2013 so our complaints fall into a legal blackhole. That's got to be dealt with.\" The CPS on Friday said that a prosecution against BT and Phorm \"would not be in the public interest\". It said that any offending was \"the result of an honest mistake or genuine misunderstanding of the law\" and that there was no evidence that anyone \"suffered any loss or harm\" as a result of the trial. Jim Killock, the executive director of the internet advocacy organisation Open Rights Group, accused the government of \"perpetuating a muddle\" over which body investigates potential internet privacy breaches. \"The CPS isn't equipped to make legal judgments in this area, which involves complex industrial regulation,\" he said. \"It requires proper regulation with a proper regulator.\" Daniel Hamilton, the campaign director at privacy pressure group Big Brother Watch, said he was \"not at all surprised\" by the ruling. He added: \"Whether it's a CPS investigation or an information commissioner investigation, [these bodies have] consistently shown themselves to be unwilling to take action.\" BT said it was pleased that the CPS had decided not to prosecute. Phorm had not returned a request for comment at time of publication. BT stopped using Phorm tracking technology in 2009, after a second, public, series of trials. The setback accelerated a downward spiral for the AIM-listed technology firm, which once promised to boost the value of advertising for most of the UK's leading internet service providers, including Virgin Media and TalkTalk. Phorm left the UK market towards the end of 2009, as popular websites like Amazon and the once-dominant MySpace publicly expressed their concern over its behavioural advertising technology. The US-based firm last year announced an attempt to woo Brazil and China. Phorm recorded a pre-tax loss of $29.35m (\u00a317.95m) in 2009, the last full year for which information is available, with no recorded turnover. Even during the US-based firm's heyday, in 2006, Phorm reported a pre-tax loss of $11.54m, on revenues of $1.27m.",
