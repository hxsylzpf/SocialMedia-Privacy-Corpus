  "content": "Britain won't be quite the same again now that the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill (RIP) has competed its passage through parliament. Although a number of welcome amendments and safeguards have been forced through by the Lords, the essentials of the bill still stand. It will leave Britain as the only Western industrialised country with a law enabling the government to demand encryption keys from individuals and corporations. It remains to be seen whether this becomes a major turn-off for companies deciding where to locate their activities or whether the principle of opposite effect operates - and the bad effects of the bill are offset by the creation of innovative ways of getting around it which make life even harder for the snoops. Defenders of civil liberties owe a big debt to Caspar Bowden's Foundation for Information Policy Research which relentlessly stalked the government. It won major revisions to key parts of the bill, including the assumption that people claiming to have lost their encryption codes are innocent until proved guilty, and in the clauses that would have enabled local authorities to browse through our emails without a warrant. But it still remains a draconian bill. It will authorise the installation of \"black boxes\" to snoop on internet service providers (admittedly needing a warrant before MI5 can demand access) and will also enable government to monitor the pattern of our emails (where they are going to and who they are from) without it knowing what is inside them and without warrants. For the first time, GCHQ, Cheltenham, which hitherto has needed a ministerial warrant to intercept domestic communications only if there was suspicion of terrorist activity, will be able to trawl much more easily through domestic mail. It is expected the bill will spawn a whole new industry selling to companies ways of avoiding surveillance that could actually make it more difficult for the governmental bodies to snoop than beforehand. Some of the ways people and companies can protect themselves are discussed on the FIPR's site here.",
