  "content": "Senior lawyers hit back yesterday at the editor of the Daily Mail, Paul Dacre, after he railed against the \"wretched\" Human Rights Act and a high court judge whose judgments he described as \"arrogant and amoral\". In a speech on Sunday night, also published in yesterday's Guardian, Dacre said that, \"inexorably and insidiously\", the British press was having a privacy law imposed upon it. He blamed in particular the successive rulings of Mr Justice Eady, a high court judge who frequently presides over privacy disputes. But Lord Lester, a senior Liberal Democrat peer and eminent human rights lawyer, said Dacre's criticism was \"completely misconceived\". He said: \"This issue was fully debated when the human rights bill was before parliament. Some sections of the media lobbied for a complete immunity from article 8 of the European human rights convention, which guarantees the right of respect for personal privacy. Instead, the government and parliament included section 12, emphasising the paramount importance of free expression. \"I personally have acted for the media using the European convention in favour of freedom of the press, and it is completely misconceived for Paul Dacre and his colleagues to attack [an act] which protects them and their readers.\" His comments came as lawyers for the actor Sienna Miller revealed that the Sun and the News of the World had agreed to pay her \u00a335,000 in damages and costs for breaches of privacy in a series of articles and photographs. At a preliminary hearing last month, the high court heard that Miller's life had been made \"intolerable\" by paparazzi who had chased her while driving and pursued her as she walked her dogs in the park. She is still pursuing a legal case against the photographic agency Big Pictures (UK) Ltd, which she says is guilty of harassment. The agency disputes the claims and the case is set to proceed next year, presided over by Eady. Dacre, who has edited the Daily Mail since 1992 and currently chairs the Press Complaints Commission's editors' code of practice committee, made his comments at a meeting of the Society of Editors, in which he argued that Eady had a virtual monopoly over case law in the area of privacy, meaning that the common law was being shaped by his own \"amorality\". In July the judge found that the News of the World had invaded the privacy of the formula one boss Max Mosley by publishing photographs of him engaged in a sado-masochistic orgy. Dacre said this illustrated \"the desiccated values of a single judge who clearly has an animus against the popular press\". Graham Dudman, managing editor of the Sun, agreed. \"The issue here is that Justice Eady is unelected and unaccountable. Parliament has not made these decisions, one man has,\" he said. But Lester said it was \"completely wrong\" to attack Eady personally. \"The Max Mosley judgment was a sensitive and sensible judgment. It is completely in line with the case law of the European court of human rights and it strikes a fair balance between free speech, personal privacy and reputation.\" Lord Falconer, the former lord chancellor, told the BBC that \"society now puts a value on privacy ...There are certain things in life that should be private. Of course, if I'm acting hypocritically or I'm accountable, or there's something that may affect what I do in my public life which emerges from my private life, that should be published. But there are things which are private and just as we don't want the state to know everything about us, do we want things that are legitimately private to be made public? I don't think we do.\" He argued the act had been introduced by MPs, and that newspapers unhappy with legal judgments were entitled to appeal. The leading human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson said: \"The Human Rights Act was passed 10 years ago but did not come into operation for 18 months, whilst training courses were held for those who would be involved in its implementation. Unfortunately, there were no courses for tabloid newspaper editors, who ever since have misunderstood it.\" He said that two separate free speech rights most cherished by newspaper editors - to protect their sources and to advance a public interest defence - had come about as a result of the Human Rights Act. Gordon Brown viewed Dacre's speech as \"an interesting and useful contribution to the debate\", his spokesman said. The ruling had been made by an independent judge, he pointed out. \"But there is a balance that needs to be struck between on the one hand the right to privacy and on the other the right to expression.\" The Labour MP Gerald Kaufman said Dacre was \"totally justified\" in his criticism, but argued in favour of a tightening of privacy legislation. \"I warned the government that their plan to exclude the press, so they weren't liable, from the Human Rights Act was so bad that I would not vote for the bill,\" he said. \"If you had just had a privacy law then you would have had proper safeguards. I wanted a privacy law that included the press, not to protect the famous but to protect the families of servicemen who had died who were hounded by a huge press pack.\" \u00b7 This article was amended on Wednesday November 12 2008. Lord Falconer, whom we described as a former lord chief justice in the article above, held a different post - that of lord chancellor. This has been corrected.",
