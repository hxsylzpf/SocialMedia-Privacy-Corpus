  "content": "The press complaints commission has defended itself against accusations that it is a \"pussy cat\", saying it still protects \"reams\" of invasion of privacy cases appearing in the newspapers. Tim Toulmin, the PCC's deputy director, said there were \"a large number of intrusive stories which would have been published which now don't get anywhere near the newspapers.\" And he added that the judge had rejected \"every one\" of Ms Ford's complaints. \"No one at the PCC was saying it was a savoury or desirable situation,\" he said. \"But the judge's job was to rule on whether we were correct in applying the code, and he ruled that we were.\" Lord Wakeham welcomed the court's decision, saying: \"This is an extremely good judgment on self-regulation and the work of the commission. \"I am delighted that the court has recognised and underlined the importance of the PCC in dealing with privacy matters where conflicting rights need to be balanced.\" The judge said he had not ruled on whether the Daily Mail, OK! or those who used long-lens photography to take the photographs of Ms Ford while she was on holiday had infringed her right of privacy. But he ruled that none of the criticisms of the PCC's determination had any merit whether considered individually or cumulatively In any event, he decided that she had delayed too long in bringing her application. Geoffrey Robertson QC, for Ms Ford, had accused the PCC of misinterpreting its own code of practice, which states that \"the use of long lens photography to take pictures of people in private places without their consent is unacceptable.\" David Pannick QC, for the PCC, said the commission also took account of the fact that the pictures were \"innocuous\" and of the sort taken regularly of well-known people in public places, adding that they did not \"intrude into intimacy or open the complainant to ridicule\".",
