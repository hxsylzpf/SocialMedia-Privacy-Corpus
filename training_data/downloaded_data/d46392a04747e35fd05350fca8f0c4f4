  "content": "A further four companies have withdrawn their advertising from Facebook after ads were randomly served up alongside pages promoting the British National Party. Virgin Media, Halifax, the Prudential and the AA have now joined Vodafone and First Direct in pulling their advertising, stating there are not enough controls over where their campaigns appear on Facebook. Trade magazine New Media Age first alerted the brands to the issue yesterday, though Facebook itself has so far refused to comment. The BNP has said \"there is nothing wrong with the BNP\" and that the party is being unfairly vilified, but a Vodafone spokesperson said the company had quite clear policies on not supporting political organisations. A spokesman for Virgin Media said the company had withdrawn its advertising from all social networking sites. \"Virgin Media has today taken the decision to temporarily suspend advertising on Facebook and other social networking sites. We have an obvious desire, and a duty to consumers, to ensure we advertise in a responsible way,\" the spokesman added. \"We are taking a more cautious approach until we have had further talks with our advertising agency and the IASH [Internet Advertising Sales House].\" IASH operates a scheme that monitors pages of social networking sites to ensure they are suitable for advertising sales houses. It was also revealed by a Silicon Valley blog this week that some of Facebook's advertising rates have doubled since February this year to $300,000 (\u00a3147,000) for a three-month placement, though the group pages set up by the BNP are free and not part of the site's advertising platform. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
