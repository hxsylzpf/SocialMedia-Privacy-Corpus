  "content": "An ad that ran on Facebook promoting the online game Mafia Wars, which featured a photo of a sinister, hooded man holding a large knife, has been banned by the advertising watchdog. The ad was by Zynga, the company behind hugely popular games such as Farmville, which account for as much as 20% of Facebook's revenue, and ran with the line \"From street thug to capo. Earn your street cred and be respected.\" In its ruling today, the Advertising Standards Authority said it was banning the Mafia Wars ad for implying that carrying a weapon was a way to earn respect and achieve success. Zynga blamed Facebook, claiming that the social networking website approved the ad. The company also said that it was targeted at an adult audience \"deemed capable of understanding its context\". The advertiser also said that the man holding the knife in the ad \"reflected the content and theme of the game, as did the text, but did not show any actual violence\". Facebook said that it removed the ad because it breached internal advertising guidelines that prohibited images of weapons. The ASA said that the ad was \"aggressive and threatening\" and implied that \"carrying or using a knife was a way to earn respect from a peer group and a means to achieve success in life\". \"We concluded that the ad glamorised and condoned violence and was irresponsible,\" said the watchdog, which banned the ad for breaking the advertising code. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
