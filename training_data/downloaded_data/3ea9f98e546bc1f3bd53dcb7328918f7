  "content": "The People newspaper and two celebrity magazines today issued formal apologies and paid \"substantial\" libel damages to the pop singer Robbie Williams over untrue stories that he was a secret homosexual. The star, who sued over allegations printed last year in the People, Star and Hot Stars, will also have his legal costs paid by the publishers. Williams' lawyer, Tom Shields, told the high court today the People had written a story in August 2004 headlined \"Robbie's secret gay lover\", which suggested his client was \"about to deceive the public\" over his sexuality in a forthcoming biography. He said the paper alleged that, in his book, Feel, the former Take That singer was \"pretending\" he had had sex only with women, \"in reality he was a homosexual who had engaged in casual and sordid homosexual encounters with strangers\". Mr Shields continued: \"It claimed that he had enticed a stranger into a toilet at a club in Manchester where the two men performed a sex act on each other and where Mr Williams requested that stranger to engage in a further sex act. \"It was also alleged that a year later Mr Williams had tried to persuade the same man and then that man's friend to engage in similar conduct at another Manchester club and that, when rebuffed, he had gone on to engage in a sexual encounter with another stranger in the streets behind the club.\" Mr Shields said similar allegations were printed the following month by Star and Hot Stars, which are both owned by the Daily Express proprietor, Richard Desmond. The magazine articles suggested that while Williams had \"told all\" about his female conquests in the book, he was \"keeping secret his homosexual encounters\", Mr Shields said. \"Mr Williams is not and never has been homosexual,\" he added. \"Accordingly, he did not attempt to conceal his true sexuality in the book, Feel.\" He said that the publishers had both agreed to pay \"substantial damages\" and publish prominent apologies. Zoe Norden, representing the publishers, Trinity Mirror and Northern &amp; Shell, said: \"I accept that the allegations were untrue. The defendants apologise to the claimant and expresses [their] regret for the injury and distress caused.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
