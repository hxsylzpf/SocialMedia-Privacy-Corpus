Alton is one of seven national and regional newspaper editors who sit on the press regulator alongside eight lay members, including acting chairman Professor Robert Pinker. \"I am very pleased to have this opportunity to join the commission. It has a vitally important role to play in setting standards of reporting and in protecting the public - and it is essential that it does so in a robust, independent and authoritative manner. I much look forward to playing my full part in that,\" said Alton. Professor Pinker highlighted the importance of maintaining a balance of editorial views on the press watchdog, which is responsible for investigating and adjudicating on complaints from members of the public about newspaper articles. \"The secret of the PCC's strength when adjudicating on complaints from members of the public is the synthesis of the views of editors, who are in a minority on the commission, and independent lay members,\" Professor Pinker said. \"It is essential we keep a good balance of editorial views - from broadsheet as well as tabloid papers, from the regional press, from the industry in Scotland and from periodicals. Roger fits the bill perfectly - and will bring a robust common sense to our work.\" The acting PCC chairman thanked Lawson for the \"wisdom and insight he has brought to our deliberations\". Alton, who has edited the Observer since 1998, started his career on the Liverpool Post, before joining the Guardian in 1974, where he held a number of posts including features editor, arts editor, editor of the Weekend Guardian and assistant editor. An independent commission chaired by Professor Pinker is responsible for making appointments to the PCC. It will have its work cut out in coming months as one lay vacancy already exists on the commission and two editorial vacancies are imminent. Neil Wallis, who resigned as editor of the People earlier this month to become Andy Coulson's deputy on the News of the World, will at some point have to step down from the PCC as only full editors can sit on the commission. Meanwhile, former Hello! editor Phil Hall, who recently joined Trinity Mirror in a senior management role, is leaving the commission this week. Sir Christopher Meyer, a former British ambassador to the US, will take over as chairman of the PCC this spring, replacing Lord Wakeham, who was forced to step down over the Enron scandal.",
