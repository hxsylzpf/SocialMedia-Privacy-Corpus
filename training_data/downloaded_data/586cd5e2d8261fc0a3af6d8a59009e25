  "content": "Paul McCartney has picked sides in the battle between X factor winner Joe McElderry and Rage Against the Machine, calling the latter's battle for the Christmas No 1 spot \"funny.\" Despite appearing on the X Factor final last Sunday (12 December), McCartney said that Rage Against the Machine taking the charts by storm would \"prove a point\". He told Sky News: \"If he (McElderry) goes to No 1 then good luck to him. He's just some kid with a career ahead. I've got nothing against that, but it would be kind of funny if Rage Against the Machine got it because it would prove a point.\" He's not the only celebrity to wade into the most heated battle for Christmas No 1 in years. Cheryl Cole, who mentored McElderry throughout the talent contest, described the Facebook campaign to get RATM to No 1 as \"mean\". \"I would be devastated to see Joe lose possibly the best thing that could happen to him in his life. Every aspiring pop star dreams of a No 1 record,\" Cole said to the Press Association. \"He put his heart and soul into every single week of The X Factor and I cannot bear to see him lose out to a mean campaign that has nothing to do with his efforts. If that song, or should I say campaign, by an American group is our Christmas No 1 I'll be gutted for him and our charts.\" Simon Cowell has also vented his spleen over the campaign, saying it \"feels like a little kid being bullied\". The music mogul reportedly told the Sun: \"If you take me out of the equation, you have a teenager with his first single being attacked by a huge hate mob on Facebook.\" According to HMV, Rage Against the Machine's Killing In the Name is now ahead of McElderry's The Climb by just a \"few thousand\" copies. HMV's Gennaro Costaldo said: \"The momentum now appears to be firmly with Joe, although the unexpected snowfalls could count against him if it stops Christmas shoppers from hitting the nation's high streets this weekend.\" Both parties have just two days left before the Christmas No 1 single of 2009 is decided.",
