  "content": "Business networking website LinkedIn has published a series of guidelines to help prevent users damaging their careers by mixing professional contacts and friends online. LinkedIn claimed 47% of the UK's web users are mixing their social and professional lives by accepting networking invitations from \"frolleagues\" - colleagues who send friendship requests. The social media company added that the \"frolleagues\" scenario is becoming so common that the Oxford English Dictionary is considering adding the term. LinkedIn, which claims 1 million registered users in the UK, recommends that users keep a separate account for socialising so that business contacts don't mix with friends, and should only add a colleague if they know them socially outside work. A survey conducted by the site found that 36% of workers feel an obligation to accept friend requests from colleagues, although 73% said they wanted to keep them separate. Users need to be prepared to turn down requests from colleagues, must carefully consider the personal information they post online, and should explore and utilise the privacy settings on networking sites so that only trusted friends can access their profiles, according to LinkedIn. In 2006, a number of Metropolitan police officers were disciplined after posting a series of joke videos on Facebook, including one in which a policeman said he loved his job because it allowed him to \"hit people with a stick\". Other lessons have been learned by a worker who called in sick, but then went to a stag weekend and accidentally shared the photos with his colleagues, while Oxford University is routinely trawling Facebook and fining students who publish evidence of flouting rules on antisocial behaviour. \"People need to realise that even virtual actions can have very real consequences,\" said a LinkedIn spokeswoman. \"It's becoming increasingly important that we keep our professional and social lives separate and manage our online reputation as effectively as possible,\" she added. LinkedIn recommends that users need to do more to protect sensitive information such as birth dates, contact details and discussions about work, and be selective about who they allow into their social networking inner circle. Just over a quarter of users surveyed by LinkedIn said they were concerned about their online reputations, yet many still neglect to make personal photos and conversations on social media sites private. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
