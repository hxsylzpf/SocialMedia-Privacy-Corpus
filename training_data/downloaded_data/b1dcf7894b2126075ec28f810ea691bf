The California-based startup, run by Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a and Thomas Grasty, researchers at University of Southern California, will be awarded $200,000 (\u00a3133,500) in order to continue developing the project. Launched officially in April 2010, Stroome aims to connect journalists, filmmakers, travellers and anyone else with a video camera, allowing them to upload their films to the internet and then collaborate with other users to create new video, audio, and photo mashups from every corner of the world. While the Stroome community is still small, with only 500 members based in 40 countries, the opportunity and potential for growth is substantial: think YouTube and Wikipedia rolled into one big creative melting pot. In London this week, De La Pe\u00f1a spoke about where Stroome fits in the new media landscape. Where did the idea for Stroome come from? I'm a former correspondent for Newsweek magazine and the way that Newsweek used to work is that you'd have multiple people reporting on the same story from multiple bureaus, so I already had this natural sense of how journalism could be a collaborative process. Then I was doing a masters in online communities, and from my thesis it was very clear that there was a need for this collaborative platform for journalists. We've seen many times where journalists are reporting from a scenario or a rally and their cameras get taken. But imagine if that video could be automatically streamed to Stroome where editors around the world could be cutting it any way they want to, telling the stories any way they want and spitting it out across the web. So we made the Alpha version of Stroome, got it alpha tested, raised a little money and started work on the beta version. We launched it in April. What makes Stroome different from other online editing suites? The biggest difference is that there's an ability for you and me to form a group and I can remix you and you can remix me. I can share it just with Stroome, or just my friends; I can make private groups, or I can push it across the web. That's the biggest difference from other sites; we're really sharing the video, the openness of the files is really distinct. How does Stroome fit in with what's going on with the media as a whole? I'm trying to get people to do and think about how it's so clearly a place of energy and openness and jobs and there's just so much movement. I know a lot of people have lost their jobs. It's really difficult for a lot of people, but we absolutely are at a critical point where we need a lot of innovations and are open to a lot of innovations. My drive is to innovate and innovate in journalism. But I don't go to the journalism conferences, I go to the tech conferences. The tech conferences are just alive whereas the journalism conferences are just weeping. You just want to bring them together and say, 'Guys, this is exciting! It's not your death knell, this is a wonderful opportunity.' Stroome is a lot easier than all that. People understand video, they understand audio and they understand cutting it all together. What's your financial model? We have a few ideas, number one being storage. You can only allow people to upload so much until you just can't bear it anymore. At some point we'll put in some advertising. We've talked about charging something really nominal, like 99 cents (66p), after users create a certain number of groups, so that you can keep making as many groups as you want. Financials are one of the things we get to do this summer, really take a deep breath and figure out how we're going to implement the next iteration.",
