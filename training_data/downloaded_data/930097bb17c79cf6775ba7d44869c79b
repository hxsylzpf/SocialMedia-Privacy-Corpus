Last time he wanted to be elected he seemed to be on the other side of the argument. In a speech at Imperial College London in 2009 he said: \"If we want to stop the state controlling us, we must confront this surveillance state \u2026 The internet is an amazing pollinator, spreading ideas and information all over the globe in minutes. It turns lonely fights into mass campaigns; transforms moans into movements; excites the attention of hundreds, thousands, millions of people and stirs them to action \u2026 That's foreign policy in the post-bureaucratic age \u2013 enabling the free flow of information to give people power so they can use that power to demand change.\" Or was that a different David Cameron?
