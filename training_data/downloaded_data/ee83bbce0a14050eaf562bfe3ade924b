The hackers appear to have gained access to the database with email and password details, some of which were published online last night on the Twitter accounts of some of LulzSec's members. Taking webmail and remote access offline was the only way that News International could be sure that nobody from the group who might have access to the details can log in and steal emails belonging to staff. In a note sent out to all News International staff at 11.05pm on Tuesday night, soon after LulzSec hacked a server in the company's systems to redirect people visiting the Sun's main web page to a faked story suggesting Rupert Murdoch had been found dead, the company said there has been a \"security breach\". Remote access was restored around 11am on Tuesday, a News International spokesperson told the Guardian. The note, which has been seen by the Guardian, reads: \"All staff will be prompted to reset their password on next login. Please note the password complexity required: Minimum of 8 characters; letters and numbers; upper and lower case. Staff should also be aware that Citrix remote access, Webmail and email to iPad, iPhone and Android devices is currently offline.\" News International declined to comment on suggestions that the hackers might have had access to the email accounts of senior executives including former chief executive Rebekah Brooks under her old login from when she edited the Sun as Rebekah Wade.",
