  "content": "The battle between celebrities and the paparazzi who pursue them took a new turn yesterday when US Weekly, one of the most popular celeb magazines on the American newsstands, announced that it would not accept any pictures taken through reckless means. This follows a decision by the Los Angeles district attorney's office to start a criminal investigation into the actions of photographers who break the law in their pursuit of celebrities. Investigators said they would look not only at reported crimes committed by individual photographers, but were also studying whether teams of paparazzi could be prosecuted on felony conspiracy charges. The investigation stems from an incident two weeks ago when actor Lindsay Lohan was involved in a car chase which ended with a celebrity photographer allegedly crashing his van into the driver's side door of Lohan's Mercedes. The actor escaped with minor injuries. North Hollywood photographer Galo Cesar Ramirez was arrested on suspicion of felony assault with a deadly weapon. Since then, establishment anger against celebrity photographers has stiffened, with a number of stars, including Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake and Jennifer Garner, speaking out about their experiences of increasingly aggressive paparazzi tactics. US Weekly, which has a circulation of about 1.5m and is one of the largest markets for star photographs, said in a statement that its decision formalises existing guidelines to ban pictures taken by photographers who \"violated traffic laws, trespassed on private property or invaded the privacy of children at school\".",
