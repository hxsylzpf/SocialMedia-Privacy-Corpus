  "content": "To update the list of Twitter SMS services, here's another: TwitSMS. And these guys have already launched. Photo by katielips on Flickr. Some rights reserved. It's targeted at the UK but has been picked up by users in other Twitter-abandoned countries including Australia, New Zealand and France. You sign up with your Twitter name and password, and select which of your friends you'd like to receive direct messages from on your phone. You buy a pack of SMS and pay upwards of 7p per message. That's a little more than ZygoTweet say they will charge, but we'll have to wait and see if they manage to nail a better wholesale deal than TwitSMS. Meanwhile, would you feel comfortable entrusting your precious Twitter password details to any of these services? And if Twitter went down one of the unlikely but you-never-know messaging payment system routes (that was what PayPal started as), what implications would there be for security and all those third-party tools? Another problem for someone to fix. In fact someone must already be working on a system to turn twitter onto a payment tool, surely? We worked out yesterday how to do that informally, tipping other Twitterer's work by PayPalling them the value of a coffee or a beer. I'd like to hear from anyone who has tried any of the Twitter SMS alternatives though. Recommendations?",
