  "content": "About 20 years ago, a woman named Rose Wong moved to a small town in the heart of Silicon Valley and purchased her first computer. \"I had no idea how to use it. I taught myself,\" she recalled this week. She was 82 years old. Mrs Wong, who happens to be my grandmother, is now 102. She still lives in a retirement community in northern California, and she is still learning how to use new forms of technology. It's hard to find much tech reporting that focuses on the centenarian market. Certainly there is a large industry developing assistive technologies for the ageing baby boomer generation, but you're unlikely to read a review of the new iPhone 7 that queries how 102-year-old women with hearing aids and arthritic fingers will handle the slim new design and wireless AirPods. Amid the breathless coverage of the latest marginal improvement to existing technologies, it's also hard to keep perspective on what's actually likely to change the world and what's just self-indulgent marketing. So I decided to interview my grandmother to get a century's worth of perspective on the latest innovations. The stuff she already uses My grandmother might be the most tech-savvy centenarian in the world (please don't fact-check me on this). She taught herself to use that first computer by reading a book (she did attend a few classes for seniors but found the teaching ineffectual) and she has continued to adapt to new technologies as they emerge. This wasn't always the case. During the 1950s and 1960s, when she worked as a math teacher and guidance counselor in Los Angeles, she and my grandfather refused to purchase a television. The radio was good enough for news and entertainment, and though her children \u2013 my father and aunt \u2013 pleaded their case, she told me, \"They needed to study more than television.\" But today, her attitude toward technology is quite positive. \"If you don't have it, you're so backwards,\" she said. She credits the internet with making people more liberal and tolerant. \"They're expanding their minds,\" she said. \"Their horizons are enlarged.\" When she was growing up on a potato ranch in Lillooet, Canada (about 150 miles east of Vancouver) in the 1910s and 1920s, letters to her parents' families in China took a month to deliver by boat. Today, our family is also widely dispersed geographically (she has great-grandchildren living in Boston, Massachusetts and Durban, South Africa), but she keeps in touch by email (like any self-respecting techie, she has a Gmail address) and Skype. She does most of her shopping online, preferring to try clothes on at home rather than in a cramped dressing room. If she misses the 3pm airing of the PBS NewsHour with Gwen Ifill (\"I get very annoyed if somebody calls me at that hour,\" she said), she watches it online. She also bowed to necessity and purchased a cellphone about 10 years ago, though she almost never uses it. \"It's only for emergencies,\" she said of her flip-phone. The stuff she doesn't use A few years ago, my sister bought my grandmother an iPad, in the hopes that its intuitive design would make it easier for her to get online. But the problem with the touch screen is that it requires a steady touch. My grandmother's hands show her age in a way that her face does not. It is difficult for her to straighten her fingers enough to place her finger pad on the screen. Learning to use iOS after years of using Windows also proved challenging. \"I bought a book about it, but I wasn't too diligent about it,\" she said. The iPad mostly stays in a drawer. She is also wary of social media. In 2008, at the behest of my sister, she joined Facebook, but she's never taken to it. \"People come on Facebook and they talk about so many things that are irrelevant,\" she said. In the interests of very serious journalism, she agreed to test out Snapchat and Twitter, both of which she had heard about, but never used. The first time I showed her Snapchat (and its selfie filters), we were eating at a Chinese restaurant with my father. Her initial reaction was shocked disbelief that this had vaulted the startup to an $18bn valuation, though she laughed heartily at the silliness of it. \"That's a company?\" she scoffed. \"That's a company? Do they sell ads? I can't see the purpose of it.\" After we turned the camera around and Snapped my dad with doggie ears, she delivered her verdict: \"I think it's a waste of energy. I don't have anything positive to say.\" A few weeks later, however, we revisited Snapchat and took some more selfies. \"It's fun,\" she conceded, \"but to go and IPO on it? You can only laugh so much. People will get sick of it pretty soon.\" I also managed to convince her to try Twitter, using my account. Prior to our experiment, her familiarity with Twitter was mostly limited to news coverage of Donald Trump. \"I know you shorten words,\" she told me, though I assured her that was not always necessary. After I opened Twitter.com on her browser (Firefox), she spent a few minutes scrolling through my timeline. \"They spend all their time watching this thing?\" she asked, referring to the people on my timeline. \"Is this what they do all day at work?\" (The answer to both questions is yes, but please don't tell my grandmother.) Then, it was time to tweet. Tweet No2 read, \"I am 102 years old and Julia Carrie Wong's grandmother.\" Twitter responded in typical fashion, with warmth, cat pictures, gifs, and the odd highly inappropriate comment. She even waded into her mentions and responded to a few questions. Pretty soon, she was tired of the experience, and posted her sendoff. When we had logged off, I asked her what she thought of my favorite social media network. \"I guess if the young people think they can get to know people on it, I guess it's OK,\" she said. \"I really don't see the purpose of it.\" Later that day, I checked the continuing response to her tweets. One user had sent a question: \"What do you wish you had known when you were younger, Rose?\" It's a question I have occasionally wanted to ask my grandmother myself. After all, my grandmother has lived an extraordinary life. She went from the potato ranch to the Universities of British Columbia and Michigan; survived the Great Depression and a sojourn in Texas as a Chinese-Canadian immigrant under Jim Crow, raised a family while teaching in public schools, and, since retirement, has traveled around the world. I relayed the question. My grandmother laughed. \"Not Twitter.\"",
