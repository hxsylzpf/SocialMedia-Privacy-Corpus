  "content": "Campaigning journalism is at the heart of this year's local newspaper week, which starts on Monday (12 May) under the slogan \"Making a difference.\" It will highlight how campaigns in local newspapers make a real difference to the lives of ordinary people in local communities - and with something of a digital twist. Editors and their journalists are finding that mounting campaigns and mobilising readers is amplified by the use of Twitter and other social media sites. Results are achieved faster than ever before, often in days rather than the weeks or months when newsprint was the only platform. Take a look at the 30 powerful local newspaper campaigns shown here on the local newspaper week website. They include the Yorkshire Post (the hidden epidemic of loneliness); Manchester Evening News (save our science museum); Eastern Daily Press (help for flood victims); Southern Daily Echo (save a children's heart unit from closure); Northern Echo (save our jobs); and Glenrothes Gazette (secure home care for an MS sufferer). People can take part in an online vote to select their favourite campaign from midnight Sunday until Wednesday (14 May). Two days' later, the \"people's choice\" winner will be announced by the Newspaper Society president, Adrian Jeakings, at the Society of Editors regional press awards in London. As Peter Barron, editor of the Darlington-based Northern Echo, says: \"Campaigning remains the most important part of the function of a local newspaper... Whatever the format for news delivery in the future, journalists from the grass roots up must never stop seeking to change the world. It sounds pompous - but it's right.\" Ian Murray, editor-in-chief of Southern Daily Echo in Southampton, agrees. He argues that local papers \"almost alone\" act as a check on \"the strong and powerful\". He says: \"When the people need their voice to be heard, it is to their local newspaper they almost always turn.\" And Allan Crow of the Fife Free Press group, in pointing to the success of the Glenrothes Gazette in obtaining a care package for a woman trapped in the dementia ward of a hospital, says: \"The family came to us because they knew us, and trusted us with their story. Local newspapers achieve results like that every single week by speaking up for people and their communities.\" Several high-profile figures have sent messages of support for local newspaper week. Dame Helen Mirren: spoke of local and regional papers playing an important part in promoting and sustaining the arts while also exposing wrongdoing and corruption. Former Olympic champion Jonathan Edwards said: \"Only the local paper can fully reflect the pride and passion of a community when one of their own achieves something remarkable on the world stage.\" Sochi gold medalist Lizzy Yarnold spoke of local media's \"incredibly important role in making a difference to the lives of individuals in local communities... whether it is raising funds for a life-saving operation, campaigning to stop a sports centre from closing, raising awareness of a local charity or cleaning up a local park.\" A similar message came from TV presenter Richard Madeley: \"Readers who keep the faith with their local paper help keep the heart of their communities beating strongly. Support your local sheriff? Sure. But support your local paper, too. Because you'll miss it when it's gone.\" Journalists and their readers can help boost the week, and the contest, by registering their support here at Thunderclap, the crowd-speaking platform that will blast out a timed tweet on Monday.",
