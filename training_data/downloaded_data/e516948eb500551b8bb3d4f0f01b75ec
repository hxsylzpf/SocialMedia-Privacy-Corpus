  "content": "Social media users in Japan shared their experiences of the typhoon \u2013 downgraded from its original super-typhoon status \u2013 as it swept through the southern islands on Tuesday, with some people demonstrating the power of the storm's winds with risky stunts. With gusts of up to 110mph (180km/h) the typhoon was expected to be one of the worst storms of the year, the national weather agency said. Several typhoons a year strike Japan, but they usually develop later in the summer or in early autumn. The typhoon forced half a million people to seek shelter in Okinawa on Tuesday. Residents were warned to stay away from the coast and low-lying areas, which experienced storm surges and waves up to 14 metres (46ft) high. Okinawa was left with difficult driving conditions after the storm passed. And one Instagram user managed to capture the moment his bus flooded. The storm is moving slowly and weakening in intensity, but experts warned that its reduced speed could increase the potential for major damage to homes and infrastructure. The threat of flooding is particularly acute at this time of year, as Japan emerges from its annual rainy season. It could also create potentially dangerous landslides. In the Okinawan capital of Naha on Tuesday traffic lights went out, trees were split, signboards flew about and a restaurant was destroyed. Schools were closed, air and sea traffic ground to a halt and nearly 70,000 Okinawan households had no power. Kyushu, the southern main island next to the biggest island of Honshu where major cities including Tokyo and Osaka are located, experienced heavy rain and strong winds. Japan's meteorological agency said Neoguri would maintain its strength as it moved north, and was expected to brush Tokyo on Friday.",
