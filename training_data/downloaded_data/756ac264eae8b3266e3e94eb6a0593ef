  "content": "Defiance of court injunctions is in danger of going viral across all sorts of electronic media. YouTube is the latest website to host allegations downloaded from Twitter that breach a series of court orders. A bouncy and lewd rap version of forbidden legal material had been viewed by nearly 5,000 people within 12 hours of being launched. The release underlines the judges' difficulty in making the courts' writ run throughout cyberspace. The irreverent display of celebrities is derived from an at least partially inaccurate list of public figures circulating on the social media site Twitter which identified those who have allegedly obtained anonymised orders or injunctions. A gavel-wielding judge, transposed heads, handcuffs, a cactus plant and lace underwear all feature in the video. Adding to the legal headache has been the traditional jeering from overseas media: newspapers as far away as Peru, Italy and Spain have carried taunting references of banned material that UK papers cannot divulge. \"The bookies say [footballer] is the mystery love cheat,\" explained one Spanish journal. A prominent UK blogger has also been whipping up the spirit of playground mischief-making, testing the limits of the courts' legal restraint by posting more names supposedly party to various injunctions on Twitter. Taking out a super injunction these days appears to be a short-cut to global notoriety, with Twitter reporting one of its heaviest days for UK traffic this week as gossip-hungry readers scoured the site for illicit material. (A superinjunction, as we all know by now, is a Rolls-Royce version of secrecy where even mention of the existence of an order is prohibited.) The website Popbitch has announced that it has purchased a racehorse and called it Superinjunctions. Readers can join a subscription owners club to back the two-year-old who, it is explained, is \"a horse and not a dull legal document that we aren't allowed to mention\". Who knows whether the justice secretary or the attorney general will be drumming their fingers in time to YouTube's beat as they contemplate the difficulty of restoring international respect for British law? The time for decision-taking is fast approaching. The long-awaited report on superinjunctions produced by a committee of legal experts working with the master of the rolls will be published on 20 May. Parliament is expected to be given an opportunity to debate its findings and ministers will then be able to assess the arguments building up for a privacy bill.",
