  "content": "Poor Facebook. Just a few months ago, the social network thought that its AI experts were on the cusp of a breakthrough, making a computer that could play Go faster than any previous machine. Then Google came along and blew them out of the water, revealing first that it had built a Go computer capable of defeating a professional human player, and then going on to beat Lee Sedol, the greatest player of the last decade, 4-1 over the course of a week. Facebook has already tried to spoil Google's thunder once, with Mark Zuckerberg releasing a coincidentally timed statement on the company's Go progress just one day before Google announced its victory over the European champion Fan Hui (and one day after Google had already revealed to the press that the victory had occurred). Zuckerberg himself has been more conciliatory this time round, posting after a message of congratulations after AlphaGo's third victory in a row: \"Congrats to the Google DeepMind team on this historic milestone in AI research \u2013 a third straight victory over Go grandmaster Lee Sedol. We live in exciting times.\" But that doesn't mean everyone at Facebook has been taking Google's victory in the spirit of friendly competition. Yann LeCun, Facebook's head of AI research, has spent the last few days being rather more critical. After a message of congratulations following the first victory, LeCun's Facebook posts seemed to rapidly focus on bursting DeepMind's bubble. \"Congrats to the DeepMind AlphaGo team for this Grand Slam,\" he posted after the group won the match with the third straight victory. \"Now, can you do it purely through reinforcement learning, without pre-training the convolutional net on recorded games between humans?\" After the fourth match, and Lee's only victory, he warned \"let's not discount the power of human learning too quickly\", and joked that \"the successor of AlphaGo should be called BettaGo\". On Monday, he poured cold water on claims that AlphaGo was close to true Artificial Intelligence, linked to \"words of wisdom\" which warned that discussion around AlphaGo \"seems like giddy overstatement\", and cited an article which \"puts the AlphaGo result in perspective, away from the media hype\". With LeCun soon waking up to a world where AlphaGo has won the fifth game of five, will we be seeing more complaining and sour grapes from Facebook? Or will his own reinforcement learning kick in?",
