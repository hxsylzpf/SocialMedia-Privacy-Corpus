On Thursday, MPs voted by 206 votes to 63 against a move to block the use of Twitter. Speaking against Twitter, the Conservative MP Sir Alan Haselhurst said he appreciated his position might make him \"a leading candidate for the dinosaur of the year award\". Luciana Berger, Labour MP for Liverpool Wavertree, spoke in favour of Twitter and said only two countries in Europe currently banned MPs from tweeting during proceedings and the UK should not join them. Those MPs concerned about losing the \"decorum\" in the chamber, Berger said, should consider those of their colleagues who sometimes have \"a little snooze\" in the house. The MP for Devizes, Claire Perry, also spoke in favour of allowing the use of Twitter, making an intervention which she asserted to be 138 characters and therefore around the length of a tweet. She said: \"Tweeting helps MPs to stay informed, in touch and accountable to their constituents and to ban this would be an inexplicable step back in time.\" MPs also voted to permit themselves to use electronic devices in the chamber as long as they were set to silent and not disruptive but used with \"decorum\". The vote went through in the face of high-profile dissent from figures including the Lib Dem deputy leader, Simon Hughes, who argued members distracted by a device would appear \"disconnected\" from parliament. Hughes told the Commons: \"It looks pretty bad if people spend their time in a debate looking at papers that aren't anything to do with it. I think it looks even less connected with the debate if people spend all their time playing around with bits of electronic machinery. If we're here we should be taking part in the debate \u2026 the administration of our lives should happen outside here, not in here.\" The Commons procedure committee recommended MPs be allowed to use hand-held electronic devices in the chamber, \"provided that they are silent, and used in a way that does not impair decorum\". They will not be allowed to use laptops. MPs will now be able to read their Commons speeches from the handhelds, and when sitting in select committee meetings they should be able to use laptops.
