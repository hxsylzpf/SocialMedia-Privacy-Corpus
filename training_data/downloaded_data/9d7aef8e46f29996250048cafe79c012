  "content": "In one year \"HMU\" has gone from a handful of appearances a month on Facebook to 80,000 a day. It has spread like wildfire among American school kids and college-goers, but what does the social networking site's fastest-growing status update mean? And how come no one I know has ever heard of it? Is it a dress code: Hitler Moustaches Unsuitable? An imperative: Hide My Underwear? Or is it a call to arms for freelance detectives: Heinous Murder Unsolved? Might it be, as the website Urban Dictionary suggests, a male fashion item: Hot Man Underpants? (Citation: \"Omg! Freddie is wearing hmu!\") Could the answer lie in some of the other trending topics: Justin Bieber (His Mother's Unforgivable? His Music's Unlistenable?); the World Cup (Hitler's Myopic Umpire!); the Chilean Miners (Hola Miners Underground)? Alas, the answer is altogether duller. It stands for Hit Me Up. Which, of course, raises a second question: what on earth does Hit Me Up mean? Wake me violently? Send me popular songs from the 1980s? Beat me into a state of arousal with a cricket bat like the naughty little boy I am? We're getting sidetracked here. Once again, the answer is a lot less interesting. According to a Facebook blog, it just means \"get in touch\". Wildly popular during summer break when \"the demographic\" was \"looking to hang out most nights\", once term time started again it became a less used \"weekend-oriented request\". So now we know. But if you do fancy a bit of S&amp;M, HMU.",
