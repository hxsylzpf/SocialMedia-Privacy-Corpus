As soon as this weekend the BBC could add social media applications to its Strictly Come Dancing online coverage. Anthony Rose, the BBC's controller of Vision and Online, declined to reveal specific details last night at the launch of this year's MediaGuardian Innovation Awards. But he did say that social media will play a big part in the relaunch of the BBC's family of websites. He explained that the BBC is not only working on a new homepage and the underlying hosting platform, but his team is currently researching \"what the next generation in social media will be\". He confirmed that the BBC is planning several innovations to the site: \"Among them for example, is the plan to enable users to comment on particular moments while watching and see what other users said about the same moment or simply rate moments with 'Boo!', 'Good!' or 'Gosh!'.\" He also confirmed the development of an open version of the successful iPlayer, which will allow third-party platforms to embed BBC content while it remains on the BBC site. Contrary to a Telegraph report from yesterday, however, he denied the BBC was developing an iPlayer application for Facebook. Instead the corporation is focusing on another form of exchange: Rose said there are plans for the BBC to open up and work together with third-party platforms such as MySpace to allow the user to link to recommendations and even include content from outside, delivering a personalised feed when you return to it. This additional information will need to be managed, therefore \"Follow my interest\" will enable users to keep track what other users are following. The BBC is planning radical changes in the the navigation design of its news sites. As was pointed out at a recent BBC open day, the news site \u2013 which attracts 10 million users a week \u2013 needs to underline the fact that it is breaking news. Many users don't recognise that the BBC is producing 500 stories a day as well as a lot of local content; the relaunch aims help them find this information more easily. According to a source within the BBC, there will be innovation in the choice of links on news stories, it might set a trend. While the last revamp of the BBC news sites could be described as a \"soft launch\", this time the corporation is planning a complete overhaul of its services.",
