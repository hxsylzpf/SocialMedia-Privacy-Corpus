  "content": "The trouble with hacking for glory \u2013 as LulzSec, aka Lulz Security are doing \u2013 is that you want everyone to know what you've done, but you don't want anyone to know who you actually are. And the combination of human nature, where people want their due respect, and the internet, where every action leaves some sort of trace, means there will always be tensions between carrying out acts and denying that you carried them out. The logs seen by the Guardian from within the group show how that can go astray. In one episode, they become worried after someone is discovered talking in a chatroom about some bounty given to him by \"Kayla\", one of the LulzSec members. \"Kayla will talk to him,\" says Sabu, the leader of the group, with the clear indication that shutting him up is the aim. There's an irresistible echo with the scene in Martin Scorsese's mafia film Goodfellas, when after a successful heist the gangsters are told off by their bosses for flaunting their sudden wealth with fur coats and cars. The bathetic contrast \u2013 the gangsters have just stolen a hoard of gold bullion; the hackers have some Amazon voucher codes \u2013 only goes to heighten the bubble that the hackers live in. In many ways the hackers' attitudes mirror those of street gangs, where the talk is of respect, attacks, who can be trusted, who the enemies are (usually law enforcement and rival gangs), whose ground belongs to who, and who has accomplished what. The consolation is that these are gangs whose weapons won't lead to blood being spilt, and who aren't worried about walking accidentally into the wrong postcode. But hackers have similar problems: the twin threats from rival gangs and from law enforcement. The latter move more slowly, but are more dangerous; the former are quicker and can draw in the latter. LulzSec have prompted the ire of a powerful hacker, The Jester, an American ex-military operator who works alone. The Jester is only one of a number of rival hackers threatening to blow the lid off LulzSec. Others are angry too, calling LulzSec \"suicide bombers of the internet\" for their lack of any clear agenda; the attack on the Arizona police (on the grounds that LulzSec dislikes its proposed immigration laws) will not assuage that anger. Earlier this week the Jester posted so-called \"dox\" \u2013 documentation purporting to reveal the real-life identity of each senior hacker \u2013 relating to Sabu and Topiary. Even if the dox were wide of the mark, LulzSec may feel that the net is tightening. And once their secret identities are out in the open, it's game over. The logs detail a group more willing to cripple its foes' websites (especially 2600.com, a starting place for many hackers, and still regarded affectionately by some of the older ones) with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks than professional hacking exploits. Since its formation in May, the group has revelled in the playground warfare of taking down websites belonging to global corporations such as Sony Pictures and Fox. However, that does not mean that the group is incapable of more devastating attacks. Some of its members \u2013 including Sabu and Kayla \u2013 have been linked to the huge assault on US security firm HB Gary Federal in February. Even on Friday, LulzSec claimed on its Twitter account that it is preparing a \"major leak\", presumably of information stolen during one of its more daring hacking exploits. Quite how many more they will be able to carry out before hubris \u2013 or their pursuers \u2013 catch up is open to question. The simplest thing for LulzSec to do may be just to quietly split up \u2013 and for its members to deny forever that they ever belonged to the group. But denial too may be the hardest step to take besides silence.",
