  "content": "The actor Ewan McGregor yesterday won a high court privacy action against a photo agency over snatched paparazzi photographs of his children playing while on holiday in Mauritius last December. Mr Justice Eady granted an injunction against Eliot Press SARL, banning further publication of the photos, which have appeared in English and Scottish newspapers. He ordered damages for breach of confidence and compensation under the Data Protection Act to be assessed at a later hearing. The agency did not contest the claim. The case could prove to be a signpost for the levels of damages that courts will award for straightforward invasions of privacy. In the Naomi Campbell case, the courts held that there was a public interest in revealing her drug problems, and in the Hello! case Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones had sold the rights to their wedding photos, but neither applies in the latest case. In an out-of-court settlement last June, the Radio 1 DJ Sara Cox and her husband Jon Carter accepted \u00a350,000 compensation from the People for publishing nude photos of them on honeymoon in the Seychelles. Mr McGregor, star of the film Trainspotting, had requested the media generally not to publish pictures of his two children. His solicitor, Mark Thomson of Peter Carter-Ruck and Partners, said after the hearing: \"The courts are moving more to protecting the privacy of individuals and children and using the law of confidence to do it.\" Mr Thomson added: \"I think there will be more of these cases involving paparazzi photographers.\" Last May, Mr McGregor attacked the media over its treatment of celebrities, calling Heat magazine a \"dirty, filthy piece of shit\" and urging a boycott of the magazine. In an interview on the London radio station LBC, he said: \"They [the paparazzi] shouldn't be shot, but they should be severely beaten up mainly. They don't have the right to intrude on people's lives, I really don't think they do.\" \"Especially with my children, I've always felt that as a parent, it's my right to protect my children and everyone would agree with that. \"If a guy comes up and asks me, 'Can I take a picture of your daughter?', that's one thing. \"But if he's hiding behind a bus and he takes a picture of me and my daughter, he's legally allowed to publish that photo in the press and I have no rights to stop him, and I think that's wrong,\" he said.",
