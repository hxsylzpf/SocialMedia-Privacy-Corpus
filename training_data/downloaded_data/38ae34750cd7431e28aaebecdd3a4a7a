  "content": "The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging a secret court to effectively turn its back on deciding the meaning of a broad swath of surveillance and cybersecurity laws without public disclosure. A motion the ACLU is filing on Wednesday before the controversial foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court, a panel that operates in secret, argues that the first amendment requires the release of numerous classified decisions between 2001 and 2015 that have established a legal foundation for expanding the government's surveillance activities. Among the Fisa court opinions sought is an interpretation of the seminal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 that many suspect will shed light on a reported Yahoo program to scan vast amounts of users' emails. Critics of the court, most prominently Oregon Democratic senator Ron Wyden, have said its classified rulings amount to a body of \"secret law\" that discard congressionally enacted privacy restrictions. The court and its supporters in government rejoinder that the extraordinary sensitivity around US surveillance practices for national security objectives necessitate the secrecy. While the major post-Edward Snowden surveillance reform, the USA Freedom Act of 2015, requires the Fisa court to release its \"novel\" interpretations of the law, it is less clear about mandating retroactive disclosure. The ACLU on Wednesday contended that the US cannot engage in a meaningful democratic debate about surveillance and cybersecurity without the release of many post-9/11 Fisa court decisions. \"These rulings are necessary to inform the public about the scope of the government's surveillance powers today,\" the ACLU argues in its disclosure motion. After Snowden's disclosures, the civil liberties group has had some success in compelling the Fisa court to declassify its major decisions. In September 2013, under challenge from the ACLU, the Fisa court released its interpretations that permitted the bulk collection of US phone records based on a section of the 2001 Patriot Act allowing the government to gather collect information \"relevant\" to a national security investigation. However, that acquiescence from the Fisa court came after the Guardian had already revealed the existence of that program, as well as an internal National Security Agency history of post-9/11 surveillance expansion that extensively detailed the court's decisions. Furthermore, the court considered that disclosure \"discretionary\", rather than establishing a first amendment precedent. Now the ACLU is asking for significantly broader releases of secret surveillance-law decisions. \"As the revelation of the Yahoo! order underscores, an unknown number of legal opinions and orders assessing the constitutionality of and statutory basis for the government's surveillance activities remains hidden from the public,\" the ACLU states in its motion. The Fisa court opinions sought to include the Yahoo order; a measure delivered to Microsoft that gave the government access to users' encrypted communications; a ruling addressing the government's ability to track location data from bulk cellphone interception; an order allowing the CIA and FBI to collect massive amounts of financial data under the Patriot Act; and a measure addressing a government effort to compel technology companies to hand over proprietary source code for national-security exploitation. Other Fisa court opinions sought to discuss restrictions on surveillance, including the circumstances under which the NSA cannot search through its massive troves of intercepted communications, and information sharing with private companies to guard against data breaches. As the ACLU filed its motion with the court, Yahoo's general counsel requested aid from the nominal chief of US intelligence in addressing public anxieties around the reported email scanning program. Yahoo lawyer Ron Bell said that the company is \"unable to respond in detail\" to \"broad speculation\" about the program due to US classification rules, and US director of national intelligence James Clapper was \"well positioned to clarify this matter of public interest\". Bell urged Clapper in a Wednesday letter to \"confirm whether an order, as described in these media reports, was issued\" and to \"declassify in whole or in part such an order, if it exists\".",
