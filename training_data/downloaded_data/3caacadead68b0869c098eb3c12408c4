  "content": "The transient group of online activists crippling websites in \"revenge\" for cutting off ties with WikiLeaks today attempted its most audacious attack yet \u2013 and failed. Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, was the prime target for a takedown effort coordinated by Anonymous, the increasingly fractious and vitriolic group behind this week's attacks on sites including PayPal and Mastercard. But infighting and arguments drove the group into a dramatic switch of targets just moments before Amazon was due to be hit by a \"denial of service\" attack early this evening. Instead the cabal of hackers, mostly teenagers, directed their ire at the US online payment firm Paypal. Their aim was to freeze payment system for third parties \u2013 but signs were it failed except briefly in different countries. By initially targeting Amazon, Anonymous made its greatest show of defiance in its days-old campaign in support of WikiLeaks \u2013 which does not endorse or direct its actions. Hours earlier, Facebook and Twitter had separately suspended accounts representing it. Facebook cited its encouragement of the attack, which would be illegal in many countries, including the UK. Twitter is believed to have closed an account that posted a stolen list of Mastercard credit cards with owner details. A member of Anonymous, who wishes only to be know by his online pseudonym Coldblood, told the Guardian that the group's campaign would go on \"for a while, mainly just because of how successful the attacks have been.\" The websites of Mastercard, Visa, the Swedish government and the Swedish prosecution authority have all been brought crashing offline in recent days. But the unwieldy and confrontational group of activists today showed the first signs of splintering further into dissident groups fighting on different fronts. Even attacks against Anonymous's own organising tools \u2013 and WikiLeaks itself \u2013 are being dictated and co-ordinated by splinter groups, protesting at the support shown to the whistleblowing site and its founder, Julian Assange. In a statement claiming to represent the group, Anonymous said its activists were neither \"vigilantes\" nor terrorists. \"The goal is simple: Win the right to keep the internet free of any control from any entity, corporation, or government.\" But with the group's strategy rapidly becoming as unclear as its membership, that may prove elusive.",
