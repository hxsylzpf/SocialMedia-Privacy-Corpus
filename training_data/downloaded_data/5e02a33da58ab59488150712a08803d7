  "content": "On Tuesday, our TwiTrip tour of the country reached its northernmost point - Newcastle. The mathematicians among you will realise that this entailed the longest journey in TwiTrip history, and such a journey required more than just the usual splurge of train-time trivia. This time, I wanted a soundtrack. And hence it came. First up, @danfobo recommended \"lovely local lass\" Beth Jeans Houghton, whose lilting country wisps kept me foot-tapping from London to Peterborough. Next it was the inimitable Jimmy Nail, as suggested by @mrdavidwhitley and @biglittlethings, with his smash hit (sic) Aint No Doubt. YouTube describes him as a \"man like an Easter Island statue chewing razor blades\", but my, he could sing like a wounded harp. Then things got a little emotional with Maximo Park's superb By the Monument, thanks to @rossjankin and @megpickard, before @snowyshoes and @sonnypike brought the house down. Take it away, Knopfler: We digress. I was pulling into Newcastle, swaying uncontrollably with a lighter held in the air, and I was hungry. @Hill79 had me covered, with fish finger sandwiches at The Forth. Fish finger sandwiches have come a long way, it seems - these came stacked four-high in a toasted bun, smothered in caper mayonnaise. Thoughtfully, @NewcastleNE1 and @adamclery pre-empted my sweet tooth, and directed me up the road to the Stateside Diner, where a hulk of an Oreo milkshake served as a liquid pudding. Heavier but happier, my next tip was a bit of a curve ball. @Foolsroad suggested I visit the local Revolution Vodka Bar, the spiritual home of test-tube borne coloured vodka. I did as I was told, and was gobsmacked. Easily the finest interior of any chain bar I have visited, the beautiful arched windows were trumped by soaring marble pillars and a 20ft-high turquoise and cream ceiling. This might seem a little blasphemous, but the serene interior of the Lit &amp; Phil across the road, as tipped by @thesidsmith and @drnickpearce seemed a little tame by comparison. Next, I paid some dues. Down by the entrance to the scarily infinite High Level Bridge, @davidb_ng, @dolphinhotel and @huddohudson directed me towards Castle Keep, a set of ancient fortifications built on the site of a Roman fort in the 11th century, and the source of Newcastle's name (New Castle upon Tyne). Up top, the view was magnificent: After pausing for some moody snaps of the smouldering Tyne Bridge, and popping into the Side Gallery (thanks to @RacheColeman) on a backstreet 50 metres from where I was standing, I requested some tips for my next destination, Ouseburn. The district - a once derelict urban enclave under the Byker bridge - has experienced something of a rebirth over the past decade, and, it seems, is a firm favourite among the Twitterers of Newcastle. The tips poured in. @Lee_ridley, @AlisdairC, @torijwatson, @paulblack84, @fran_face and dozens of others aimed me towards the wonderful Seven Stories, the first museum in the UK dedicated to children's book artwork, and an ideal hideaway for on-duty dads. @Nicksimosimpson, @Rosieniven, and @StereoJet moved me onwards to the Biscuit Factory, a huge commercial gallery in an old, yup, biscuit factory, where I was strangely captivated by Pierre Williams' ornate ceramic nudes. The time had come for beer. In fact, I had more pub tips in Newcastle than on any other TwiTrip. This, as I'd been informed earlier by @DavidB_NG, is a city that likes to revel - apparently Newcastle was voted the seventh best night out in the World by TripAdvisor, and the third best in Europe behind London and Berlin. Tuesday night was never going to be roaring, but half a pint of Timmermans strawberry beer in The Cluny, as suggested by scores of Tweeters, started me off nicely. This was swiftly followed by a Wylam's Bohemia ale in the Free Trade Inn, a superbly scenic pub overlooking the Tyne, thanks to @johne326, @svenadultbooks and plenty of others. Next stop: dinner. Again, the Tweets streamed in, and a clear favourite emerged: I was to make a beeline for Panis, an Italian eatery in the city centre, thanks to @Fr3d, @dougm1962, @cathymuzza and @conceptP. An excellent tip - the ravioli with aubergine and scamorza cheese was sublime. And my dessert was wonderful - Paul Gasgoine and Chris Waddle in minuscule shorts in the Strawberry Arms, in the shadow of St James' park, thanks to @huddohudson. The final stop of the day was quite possibly the best of the lot. I finished the TwiTrip in the Cumberland Arms, back in Byker, thanks to @mygaymatescom, @AdamClery, @RobertsonStu, @rosslewis, and @weaves81. Dozens of locals were drinking outside in the beer garden overlooking the Ouseburn valley. Inside, the bar was packed, and, in a side room, a man by the name of David Limmer jumped on the piano, before playing one of the finest cover sets I've ever heard. Heart-breaking, melodramatic renditions of The Smiths, Nine Inch Nails, Korn, and, finally, the Prodigy: David, you made my day. Thanks to everyone who Tweeted me on my way. Another superb TwiTrip. \u2022 The Cumberland Arms has doubles from \u00a370 pn. \u2022 East Coast runs high-speed train services between London King's Cross and Newcastle. Advance returns booked online, start from \u00a324 standard class or \u00a386 first class (eastcoast.co.uk, 08457 225225).",
