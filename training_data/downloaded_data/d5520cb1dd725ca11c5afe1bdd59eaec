  "content": "The chair of the Senate commerce committee has said revelations about how the \"anonymous\" social media app Whisper is tracking its users raise \"serious questions\" over privacy and demanded an explanation from the company. Senator Jay Rockefeller wrote to the chief executive of Whisper to ask for a detailed, in-person briefing for his committee staff. He emphasised his concern over the location tracking of supposedly anonymous users of the app and demanded documents from Whisper. Rockefeller's intervention comes a week after the Guardian revealed how Whisper is tracking the location of its users, including some who have specifically asked not to be followed by opting out of geolocation services. Privacy experts have already called for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to examine the app's business practices. In his letter to Whisper CEO Michael Heyward, Rockefeller notes that as chairman of the committee on commerce, science and transportation, he has \"jurisdiction over the Federal Trade Commission and consumer protection issues including online privacy\". Whisper initially denied the Guardian's reports, denouncing them as \"100% false\" and \"a pack of vicious lies\". However, over the weekend, Heyward, who previously claimed his app was \"the safest place on the internet\", released a statement that did not dispute the accuracy of the Guardian's reporting and added: \"We realise that we're not infallible\". Heyward later indicated he has launched some kind of investigation into the disclosures made about practices at his company, WhisperText. The Guardian, which was previously exploring the possibility of a journalistic collaboration with Whisper, witnessed the company's location-tracking practices during a three-day visit to its Los Angeles headquarters last month. Buzzfeed, the Huffington Post and Fusion have suspended their pre-existing partnerships with Whisper in the wake of the Guardian's revelations. Rockefeller wrote in his letter: \"It is questionable, at best, whether users seeking to post anonymously on the 'safest place on the internet' would expect that WhisperText has information sharing relationships with third parties such as media organisations.\" The senator noted in his letter the Guardian's report that Whisper tracked the approximate location of some of its users who opted out of geolocation services \u2013 despite a provision in its privacy policy that stated access to location-based information was \"purely voluntary\". Citing Heyward's statement, which was posted on a blog late on Saturday, Rockefeller told the CEO: \"You state that WhisperText does not \"actively\" track users, but acknowledge that the company does collect data that can be used to approximate a user's location.\" The letter, first obtained by Politico, also raises concerns about Whisper's processing of data by setting up an offshore site in the Philippines which, the Guardian revealed, was occurring while the company told its users all their information is stored and processed in the US. He also questioned an amendment to Whisper's terms and conditions that came four days after the company learned the Guardian planned to publish details about its business practices. Heyward said the changes to the terms of service were finalised in July, and were not related to the Guardian's reporting. Rockefeller asked Heyward supply his committee with current and old versions of its terms of service and privacy policy documents. Private briefings to Senate committee staff are considered a first course of action on Capitol Hill. They can sometimes lead to more expansive public hearings or inquiries. Responding to Rockefeller's letter on Thursday, Heyward said: \"We share the senator's interest in protecting consumer privacy and will respond shortly. Though we disagree with the Guardian's reporting, we welcome the discussion and opportunity to correct the record.\" A Democrat from West Virginia, Rockefeller has shown a keen interest in privacy issues. The senator has investigated allegations that staff at News Corp may have broken US law during the phone-hacking scandal. He was also in communication with Lord Justice Leveson, who led the British judicial inquiry into media ethics following the Guardian's revelations about widespread hacking at the media group. Rockefeller has also started an investigation into the practices of \"data brokers\" \u2013 companies that collect and sell personal information gathered online. More recently he has requested committee staff briefings from the chairman and chief executive of Home Depot, Francis Blake, over a series breach of credit card security, and the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook, after the pictures of celebrities were hacked from iCloud accounts and leaked on the internet. Rockefeller's letter to Heyward concluded: \"While Whisper may provide its users an unique social experience, the allegations in recent media accounts are serious, and users are entitled to privacy policies that are transparent, disclosed, and followed by the company.\"",
