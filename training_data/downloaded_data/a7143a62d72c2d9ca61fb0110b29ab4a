  "content": "It was either a brilliant bid for attention (and readers) or one of the worst editorial decisions in recent memory. Either way, the reaction was scathing. Below a headline proclaiming MUSLIM RAGE, Newsweek's latest cover features a photograph of a mob of wild-eyed men yelling, presumably taken during one of the recent anti-US protests in the Muslim world. Calculatedly controversial Newsweek covers are hardly news these days, but this one provoked genuine outrage. Marc Lych, the director of the Institute for Middle East Studies at George Washington University and the Guardian's own Glenn Greenwald denounced the magazine for stirring up Islamophobia. But then Newsweek made another editorial miscalculation when it invited readers to debate the cover by using the hashtag #MuslimRage. What followed was a storm of tweets, some hilarious, some satirical, some borderline offensive, as #MuslimRage was quickly hijacked into a full-fledged meme. Buzzfeed's Andrew Kaczynski pulled together a collection of netizens' creations, while the Atlantic's Megan Garber charted the meme's rapid adoption and evolution as it spun further out of Newsweek's control. But Max Read on Gawker took first prize for the most devastatingly gentle satire on the theme with his 13 powerful images of Muslim rage post. Here are a few of the many #muslimrage tweets which caught our eye: This isn't the first time Newsweek has been accused of bad taste. Recent controversial covers include an issue where President Obama was dubbed \"the first gay president\" and an August 2012 cover of a woman eating asparagus that some readers thought was too sexy. Most recently the publication received a barrage of criticism for the factual errors in Niall Ferguson's anti-Obama story.",
