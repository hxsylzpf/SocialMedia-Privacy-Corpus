  "content": "Twitter users in London woke up to trending terms of a sexual nature on Friday morning as spammers took advantage of Twitter's automatically generated trending topics list. SEO consultant @SEOTipsandTricks tweeted: Some users complained of the problems caused by the social network's decision not to edit the hashtags from the trending list with others left baffled by the trends: Twitter's CEO Dick Costolo has previously admitted that offensive topics such as #reasons...beat...girlfriend are edited from the trending list. But it looks like tweets relating to sexual services and content are allowed. Twitter's algorithm generates the trending list based on what people are talking about more now than previously. Total number of tweets as well as the number of people tweeting are crucial in sending a topic to its all important list. Spammers took advantage of this algorithm by having new accounts tweet the hashtags in close succession. At the time of writing #escort #adultprofile #massages were still trending after at least four hours on the top ten list. The algorithm will see them fall off eventually as they lose their \"breaking news\" status.  Do you think Twitter should have edited the terms #adultprofile #escorts #massages? Have the trends caused you any problems or embarrassment? Share your thoughts in the thread and we'll add a selection above the line.",
