  "content": "Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, may be called to give evidence before the Leveson inquiry into ethics and standards in press. Robert Jay, the counsel for the inquiry, dropped a large hint on Tuesday that Murdoch will be asked to appear before the inquiry early next year. Jay was quizzing Piers Morgan, the former editor of the Daily Mirror, about an incident back in 1995 when he was editor of the now defunct News of the World. The tabloid had just run photos of Victoria Spencer, the former wife of Earl Spencer, in a clinic where she was receiving treatment for anorexia. That was against the editor's code of conduct and it prompted Rupert Murdoch to issue a rare public rebuke. At the inquiry Morgan was offering his recollection and \"impression\" of a conversation that subsequently took place with Murdoch, when Jay cut across him to say: \"I can ask him for his impression when we get there.\" The Leveson inquiry said it could not comment about future witnesses. The inquiry was established under the 2005 Inquiries Act and has the power to summon witnesses including newspaper reporters, management and proprietors to give evidence under oath and in public. News International said it could not comment. A source familiar with the matter said that Murdoch had not been approached by the inquiry at this stage. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
