  "content": "Many of us live in a constant stream of information, inundated with links to web pages, audio and video via email, Facebook and Twitter. Often, I save these links for later reading on my mobile phone on the way home. One service I've used for this is Shifd. It started out as a project created in 22 hours by the New York Times R&amp;D team at a developer competition, the 2007 Yahoo Hack Day in London. Shifd allows you to save notes, links and locations easily on your mobile phone or your desktop computer for later. If you would like to save online articles for later reading on your iPhone, Kindle or other e-readers and mobile phones, Instapaper is excellent and easy to use. After signing up for the free service, you'll be prompted to drag a Read Later button to the bookmark bar of your browser. Simply click this button to add a blog post, article or website to your reading list. An ad-supported Instapaper iPhone app is free, while the developer, Marco Arment, sells a pro version with added features for \u00a32.99 to pay for the service. Instapaper Pro adds folders, the ability to mark articles you like, background updates and the facility to save your place in an article. If you don't own an iPhone, you can access your saved articles on any phone by going to the site on your mobile web browser. As the web becomes more mobile, we'll see more of these services while we shift between devices and move through our day. Is there another service that you use to save stories to read later on the go?",
