  "content": "In spite of bleak predictions of just 3,000 views for the first month, the site actually performed much better than we'd expected when it came to my first four-weekly audit of the figures. Throw away the record books, they'll be no use to you any more, hold your breath: we topped 3,700. It appears social media (something that both Enter4entertainment.com's founders were sceptical about) has a purpose beyond relaying pithy one liners to the world and cyber-perving on ex-girlfriends and family friends \u2013 it is a nifty marketing tool. Since we hit Twitter and Facebook, the traffic had positively boomed. I confidently predict that at least \u00a35 of our \u00a317.73 first month revenues can be directly linked to social networking. The only problem with tweeting is knowing when to stop (as I'm sure Jason Manford would tell you). But it's not just the temptation to digi-flirt with anonymous girls that can adversely affect one's personal relationships; the rather compulsive nature of my micro-blogging \u2013 however well-intended \u2013 really gets Mrs TV's goat. \"What are you doing?\" she'll ask as I attempt to tweet some breaking news to the world. \"I'm working,\" I'll answer. With a grunt of indignation, she'll continue to watch her rerun of Downton Abbey, but I know she's still got one eye on me. If I don't stop within a minute, she'll ask again, and again. This continues until I put my phone in my pocket. Sam has told me to ignore her, but that's easier said than done. If there's one thing Mrs TV holds sacred, it's prime-time. Up until now she's remained supportive of this whole venture, but I fear her sympathies may wane fast if she has to pause Silent Witness again next week to chastise me. Luckily, Sam had found another way to rake in traffic: \"Look at the stats!\" he squealed down the phone after calling me at 11.15pm (is that an acceptable time to phone)? iPhone in one hand and my other arm trapped under a sleeping Mrs TV, I struggled to pull up the back end of the website. \"Have you seen 'em yet?!\" crowed Sam. I could hear him shuffling about with excitement. The stats page refreshed. If I'd been standing up, I might have fallen down. Luckily I was in bed, a practical and comfortable place to receive news, both good and bad. \"The Miriam O'Reilly story! Look at the O'Reilly story!\" Sam barked. \"What have you \u2026 how? I mean ...\" \"Five-bloody-hundred,\" Sam went on. \"Five hundred views in one day.\" \"Digital Spy forums!\" he shouted. Mrs TV stirred under my arm, I went for the \"tablecloth\" manoeuvre. I was free and sprang out of bed and on to the landing naked, stubbing my toe as I went. But this moment was magical \u2013 I could feel no pain. \"Look at the incoming links,\" Sam continued. \"I've cracked it. We've cracked it. It's all about the forums.\" We would talk about that moment always (well for a week or so), the night we discovered the power of the geeks, the nerds and the obsessives \u2026 the previously unthinkable traffic-pulling properties of the humble forum. Over the next week, Sam and I (complete with shiny new Digital Spy forum memberships) began relentlessly starting discussion threads and posting our stories on the site. The numbers spoke for themselves, this was the future. It wasn't until day 10 of our forum onslaught that the first ban happened: \"You have been banned from the forums for three days for a violation of the terms and conditions,\" the message read. Sam insisted that such \"warning shots across the bows\" were nothing more than automated chaff; we should continue with our strategy \u2013 it was working. Looking at the inflated stats, I found it hard to disagree. The next week, I received another email: \"You have been banned from the forums. Date to be lifted: never.\" I rang Sam to relay the gloomy news. \"Houston, we have a problem,\" I began. \"Yeah, me too,\" he said solemnly. \"It was fun while it lasted, eh?\" Traffic plummeting at an alarming rate, we decided to move to plan B. \"What is plan B?\" I asked Sam. \"If you need to ask, then we have a real problem,\" Sam riddled. \"You don't know either, do you?\" I replied.
