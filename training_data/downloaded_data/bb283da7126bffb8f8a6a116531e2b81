In a week in which TV presenters John Leslie and Angus Deayton were both sacked from their jobs following a welter of tabloid allegations about their sex lives, Smith said no TV personality deserved a trial by media. \"There is a reason why politicians who've been up to no good are asked to leave their jobs. We vote for them. They make laws that affect our lives. Television presenters don't,\" Smith wrote in today's Daily Telegraph. \"Unfortunately when their passions are revealed to be peccadilloes, it's like learning that your neighbour three doors down does something unmentionable with stoats. You're horrified and excited in equal measure.\" Smith said she was amazed that people no longer go to the police to report crimes, choosing instead to reveal all to tabloid newspapers. The women claiming to be victims of Leslie, and who have sold their stories to tabloid newspapers rather than going to the police, have been widely criticised. \"If it involves a 'celebrity', it's column inches and cash that matter, not judges and jurisprudence,\" Smith complained. The GMTV presenter joked that she \"lives in fear\" of her past catching up with her, saying she had recently left her local supermarket carrying an empty wire basket she had forgotten to replace. \"It's difficult to defend ourselves against a welter of accusations, even when we know them to be completely untrue,\" she wrote. \"Though I will fess up to the momentary theft of a Europa wire basket. It was returned. Honest.\"",
