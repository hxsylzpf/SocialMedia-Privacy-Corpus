  "content": "A sports journalist who works for BBC Scotland is being subjected to abuse and threats following a broadcast that upset Rangers football fans. Jim Spence called the police after he was threatened by a man who approached him while he was out walking with his wife near his home outside Dundee. It followed a Twitter storm, abusive emails and 400 complaints to the BBC about a radio report in which Spence, who presents a programme called Sportsround, referred to Rangers as \"the old club that died\". There is a continuing controversy over the status of the current club that uses the name of Rangers. The former club became insolvent, entered administration and was then liquidated last year. Its business and assets, including the name Rangers FC, were supposedly bought by a new company. But the situation remains unclear. And the problem is exacerbated by the fact that the new company is riven by internal turmoil. The Herald referred to it this week as \"a boardroom civil war.\" Many Rangers fans object to any references - such as Spence's - which suggest that the reconstituted Rangers is somehow different from the former entity. But Spence \"was merely stating what many people in Scottish football consider to be true,\" noted blogger Phil Mac Giolla Bhain, author of the book Downfall: how Rangers FC self-destructed. Spence was accompanied by the National Union of Journalists' Scottish organiser, Paul Holleran, at a meeting with BBC Scotland management earlier this week. Holleran said afterwards: \"The BBC has offered its total support to Jim. We do not condone the vile and disgusting emails and texts that he has received and find it totally unacceptable that a journalist has been treated in this way.\" BBC Scotland faces a problem in dealing with the complaints, however, due to a BBC Trust ruling in June this year. It upheld two complaints that various BBC reports were wrong to use the terms \"new\" and \"old\" in relation to the club. BBC Scotland had argued that their reporters were correct and merely \"noted\" the Trust's ruling. Sources: Dundee Courier/The Herald (1) (2)/The Scotsman/BBC/BBC Trust/Phil Mac Giolla Bhain",
