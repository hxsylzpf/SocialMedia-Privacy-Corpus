Last year around 25,000 people did just that over an article by the Daily Mail's Jan Moir. You know, the Stephen Gately one. Newspaper columnists were aghast: \"Ohmigod, where did this mob come from, that could be me one day!?!\". And so the phrase \"Twitter mob\" was born and poor Stephen Fry got it in the neck several times for daring to be angry about Moir's article. Since then \"the mob\" has shamed Trafigura and forced the BBC to revise inflammatory discussions among others. Can nothing stop them? This weekend Catherine Bennett castigated me, along with others, for being part of a mob that had taken exception to the prospect of Rod Liddle being appointed editor of the Independent. She's right \u2013 I refuse to buy the Indy ever again (or link to it) if Liddle is appointed editor. More than 4,000 people share my concern, and with good reason. In all these cases the so-called \"mob\" has been accused of suppressing free speech. But what you can hear screaming isn't the Twitter or Facebook mob, it's newspaper columnists terrified at the idea that their critics could organise themselves and do damage to their reputations. Critics of Moir's article for example didn't just complain to the Press Complaints Commission (which itself needs reform), they also complained to advertisers that appeared alongside her article. After all, why not hit the Daily Mail where it really hurts? There are real concerns: principally that in our tightly networked world a lie can sometimes travel across the world and destroy a reputation before the truth manages to get out. But Bennett's piss-poor defence of her old pal Liddle misses the fundamental point: that criticism is not the same as censorship. As Sarah Ditum writes: It's the same measly logic used by Nick Cohen: freedom of speech, if it means anything, means journalists never having to be told they're wrong. It's astonishing that people with such an infantile idea of civil liberties can offer themselves seriously as defenders of democracy, but there you are. Indeed. If columnists and newspapers are allowed to express opinions and campaign for or against issues: why not ordinary people? Isn't it the democratic right of Indy readers to register their protest against Liddle? What the likes of Bennett, Cohen and others protesting about the \"mob\" don't seem to understand is that these are real people, their own readers, trying to do something about the world around them. They join Facebook groups, retweet about court injunctions or state #welovetheNHS because, occasionally, they have the opportunity to be part of an spontaneous movement that can have a big impact. Not all lead somewhere, of course, but some do. And the more people realise the power of the collective the more they'll join in. If the mob ever called for the law to impose more censorship or jail people then I wouldn't be part of it. But the idea that columnists, who are paid to engage readers, should be allowed to evade criticism or activism is absurd. I'll leave the last word to Anton Vowl: You can either ridicule the entirety of Twitter, and imagine that you're the big clever people who've got the keys to the world, by dint of being slightly better at writing than other people, but the truth is that isn't the case. It's not mob rule. The mob are your readers. The mob are real people, who think for themselves. And if lots of them are saying you stink, it might not be because someone else has told them you stink; it could just be because you stink. Amen. I'm part of the mob and I'm proud of it.",
