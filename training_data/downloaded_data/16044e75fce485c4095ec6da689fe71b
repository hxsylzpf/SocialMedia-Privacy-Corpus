  "content": "Twandbags #2: Monkey's occasional series on Twitter dust-ups returns, although with an example where only one side of the argument is taking place on Twitter. @GuidoFawkes, possibly emboldened his elevation from Daily Star Sunday columnist to the giddy heights of the Sun's Sunday edition, has moved on from trash-talking about the perceived shortcomings of rival political bloggers, turning his guns on @PrivateEyeNews instead. The opening salvo \"Private Eye: News Two Weeks Past Its Sell-By-Date\", highlighted what Guido claimed to be the Eye's \"shameless pilfering of stories that had previously appeared on this blog\" \u2013 including the fact that Trinity Mirror boss Simon Fox used to run HMV (a geniune scoop, that \u2013 the Pulitzer's in the post). The Eye responded in print by congratulating Paul Staines, aka Guido, on his Sun column \u2013 but wondered why, if he's got such a downer on the \"dead tree press\", he gave the story on the Damian McBride/Derek Draper emails to the Sunday Times and News of the World? Guido was straight back on the case with \"Private Eye: Now Two Months Past Its Sell-By-Date\". But hang on a mo \u2013 could the explanation be that rather than ripping stories off Guido, the Eye has its own independent sources? After all, when Times journalist @billykenber on Monday accused Guido of failing to credit him for a Eastleigh byelection story, he replied (after the usual warm Guido welcome for anyone contradicting him: \"Who the fuck are you?\"): \"Well we got it from LibDem source.\" So there you have it.",
