Previously from Facebook: two clones of Snapchat Stories, two attempted acquisitions (one of Snapchat, one of a Chinese company making Snapchat-style camera apps), four standalone apps, two ephemeral messaging implementations, and five new cameras with AR lenses. (See also 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) Now, for its sixteenth attempt to finally destroy Snapchat for good, Facebook is testing a Snapchat Stories-style feature in the main Facebook app. The test, which is currently only active in Ireland, is the third time Facebook has released a feature essentially identical to Snapchat's. Instagram copied Stories in August, with Instagram's head of product Kevin Weil explicitly acknowledging the inspiration to Recode, saying the company \"built on a format that Snapchat invented\". And in November, WhatsApp also began testing a version of the Snapchat format, which it called \"Status\". That feature hasn't rolled out to the bulk of users yet, and WhatsApp has not indicated whether or not it ever will. A Facebook spokesperson told Recode that \"We're hoping to bring Stories ... to the rest of the world in the coming months\", suggesting that Facebook Stories may not be limited to Ireland for long.",
