The study will seek responses from more than 100 people who have complained to the press complaints commission about their treatment at the hands of newspapers and will assess how well they felt the PCC dealt with their grievances. It will also look at complaints procedures in other organisations, ranging from public bodies such as the police to other media watchdogs. Around 20 complainants will then be interviewed in person about their differing experiences. Mike Jempson, the director of PressWise, said it had decided to conduct the study \"because we have got reform likely at the PCC and [the new media watchdog] Ofcom still working out how it's going to conduct its complaints procedures\". \"We're trying to get an idea of is what complainants think is an effective complaints procedure - looking at the detail of how complaints are handled and what that means for the complainant. \"We're not out to nail anything in particular,\" Mr Jempson said. PressWise has hired freelance journalists to carry out the study, which is a journalistic rather than an academic exercise, although it will be overseen by an advisory panel to ensure it is conducted properly. Mr Jempson also hopes to interview national, regional and local newspaper editors about the problems they perceive with the current complaints system. \"There are clearly problems with the PCC approach,\" he said. \"In my experience a lot of those people whose complaints are 'resolved' or are not regarded as worthy of being followed up are not at all happy. \"The PCC is a very opaque body. Nobody knows exactly how the recommendation system works - what's written down and presented to the adjudication committee. The one person not in the room is the complainant,\" he added. The survey comes months after the PCC published its own customer satisfaction survey, which formed part of its submission to the recent parliamentary inquiry into how well the system of press self regulation works to prevent invasions of privacy. In the PCC survey, conducted in 2002, 59% of complainants said their complaints had been dealt with \"very satisfactorily\" or \"satisfactorily\" by the PCC. The culture and media select committee, which reported last month, came up with a number of detailed recommendations for the reform of the PCC, including a system of modest compensation, giving greater prominence to adjudications, and bringing greater transparency to the way in which commissioners are appointed. A PCC spokesman said the commission had no comment to make about the PressWise study. PressWise, which this month celebrates its 10th anniversary, is currently seeking funding to take forward a proposal to change its name to MediaWise as part of a plan to create a \"space\" within which citizens and journalists can discuss ethical issues. Since its submission to the select committee, the PCC has conducted a new survey into customer satisfaction for the first quarter of 2003, showing that 67% of complainants felt their complaint had been dealt with \"satisfactorily\" or \"very satisfactorily\". \u00b7 To give MediaGuardian a story email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857",
