  "content": "Sienna Miller has launched a legal battle against News International and photo agency Big Pictures at the High Court. Law firm Carter-Ruck has served a writ for breach of privacy against the News of the World, the Sun, and the Big Pictures agency relating to a series of articles about the star. It is believed that the writ relates to two articles that appeared in the Sun where Big Pictures contributed photos. The stories and pictures reported on Miller's holiday in Italy and also referred to her friendship with Balthazar Getty, heir to the Getty oil fortune. Miller is taking action over a further two articles that appeared in the News of The World. She has previously taken legal action against the two titles after the papers used photos of her filming a nude scene for a movie. In December, the Sun and the News of the World contributed to a \u00a337,500 payout to the film star for publishing \"intrusive\" photos of her. Miller's legal representative, Mark Thomson, a partner at London law firm Carter-Ruck, confirmed that he had issued fresh proceedings. \"Neither I nor my client will be commenting further,\" he told MediaGuardian.co.uk. A spokesman for Big Pictures said he was unable to comment. At the time of publication, News Group Newspapers, the division of News International that publishes the Sun and News of the World, had not responded to requests for comment from MediaGuardian.co.uk about the legal action. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
