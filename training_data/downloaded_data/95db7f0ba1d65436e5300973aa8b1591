In a highly unusual move, the Queen was granted an injunction that puts a halt to the revelations collected by Ryan Parry, published by the Mirror and disseminated through the world over the past two days. David Pannick QC, instructed by the attorney general, argued on behalf of the Queen that much of the material - including details of how her breakfast was served in Tupperware boxes - was \"highly intrusive\" and that Mr Parry was in \"flagrant breach\" of a strict confidentiality clause in his contract. In a \"cynical exercise\", Mr Parry never had any intention of complying with the gagging clause during his two months in royal employment: \"He was not so much a footman, as a foot-in-the-door-man,\" Mr Pannick told the high court in London. The judge, Mr Justice Lewison, rejected the Daily Mirror's claim that a public interest defence overrode the terms of Mr Parry's contract with the palace, signed on August 26. He said that while freedom of the press was an important pillar of a democratic society, and was buttressed by the Human Rights Act, it did not override the contract. Yesterday's action was only the second time that the attorney general, who represents the monarch's personal interests in court, has taken legal action on behalf of the Queen. Mr Pannick told the court that the Mirror had printed details of how the Queen's cornflakes and porridge oats were laid out in Tupperware boxes on her breakfast table, how Prince Philip's Roberts radio was placed in the same position each morning, how the Queen's toast was spread lightly with marmalade, and how she ended up feeding most of it to her corgis. Mr Pannick pointed to a headline which said: \"I could have poisoned the Queen.\" \"On any view, there has been a cynical exercise by the journalist concerned, who never had any intention of complying with his contractual obligations,\" Mr Pannick said, suggesting Mr Parry should instead have handed his findings to the police. Richard Spearman QC, for the Daily Mirror, said a court order would be a \"major incursion on the freedom of the press\". He said permission had been given in previous cases for much more intrusive information to be published where the public interest was deemed important, such as the Daily Mirror's expos\u00e9 of the model Naomi Campbell's drug addiction, and the People's revelation of footballer Garry Flitcroft's extra-marital affairs. Mr Spearman said it was \"idle and fanciful\" to gag Mr Parry from disclosing material similar to that revealed by other former royal employees. But the judge rejected the arguments, granting a temporary injunction under \"well established contract law\", to last until Monday, when both sides will return to court. Piers Morgan, editor of the Mirror, said last night: \"At the risk of being sent to the Tower, might I suggest that the 11-strong phalanx of palace lawyers who fought so hard to gag us today might be better deployed checking that everyone who currently works in close proximity to the royals is who they say they are? \"The fact is that the Daily Mirror, by common consent, has exposed the most serious security breach ever involving the royal family. We have acted at all times in the public interest and have been completely open about the subterfuge we deployed, and why we deployed it. I hope that over time the royal household will realise that Ryan Parry has done them a massive favour.\"",
