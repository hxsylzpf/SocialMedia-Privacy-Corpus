The internet giant has stopped using its Street View mapping cars to collect information about Wi-Fi networks after sparking criminal and privacy investigations in a number of countries. On Tuesday, Canada's privacy commissioner ruled that the company had committed a \"serious violation\" of the country's laws when it accidentally intercepted and stored \"highly sensitive\" personal information gathered through Wi-Fi networks. Now the broader issue of individual privacy and the internet will be debated in Westminster Hall, as parliamentarians believe there is a \"significant problem\" to address. The backbench business committee debate on the internet and privacy will take place on Thursday, 28 October. Rob Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, who put forward an early day motion requesting the debate, said the UK is \"potentially sleepwalking into a privatised surveillance society\" and that tackling the issue in parliament is an important first stage. \"This is historical \u2013 there's not yet been one discussion on this in parliament, apart from when I bring it up. [MPs] realise there is a significant problem otherwise it wouldn't have been granted three hours in a debate \u2013 think of how many debates are put forward by other MPs,\" Halfon added. Halfon said he became more determined to seek a parliamentary debate when the UK information commissioner [ICO] ruled that Google was unlikely to have collected \"significant amounts\" of personal data or data likely to \"cause any individual detriment\". \"I'm going to go through all the problems and address the lily-livered, limp-wristed response by the ICO which basically decided to do nothing. Google will take this seriously because it's a parliamentary debate, not just a lone backbencher,\" he added. \"I feel very strongly about this, I've been campaigning on it in the Commons for months \u2013 I believe we're potentially sleepwalking into a privatised surveillance society. Individuals have no protection against big companies using the internet \u2013 it is infringements against people's liberties that they have no protection against.\" Alex Deane, director of Big Brother Watch, said the \"abject failure\" of the ICO to take action against Google means \"parliamentary scrutiny is needed in this area more than ever.\" \"The fact that the House of Commons has allotted time for this historic debate shows just how significant online privacy is,\" he added. \"Whilst Google is hardly the only offender, of all the organisations working online only Google has roamed the streets snatching people's data from the airwaves. That puts Google in a lamentable category of one. I'm therefore sure that they will come in for criticism at the heart of the forthcoming debate \u2013 rightly so.\" Google admitted to \"mistakenly\" collecting samples of payload data via Wi-Fi connections in May, saying: \"we have decided that it's best to stop our Street View cars collecting Wi-Fi network data entirely.\" Experts from the Canadian privacy commissioner's office examined the offending data at Google's Mountain View headquarters, and established that the incident \"was the result of a careless error\" of one engineer who developed this particular section of code in 2006. The engineer identified \"superficial privacy implications\" with the code, the commissioner found, but the implications were never assessed by other Google officials and the company was unaware of the presence of the code when its Street View cars were rolled into action. Just under 3% of some 8.4m households set to be photographed on Google Street View's rollout to 20 German cities have opted-out of being pictured on the service, the company said today. More than 244,000 requests were made to opt-out of the panoramic imaging service, Google said. Germany is the only country in which citizens were able to request their image was not used on Street View ahead of the rollout, owing to vociferous public debate about the internet and privacy in the country.",
