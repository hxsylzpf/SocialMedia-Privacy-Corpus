Twitter has complied with a legal order in California sought by Northcliffe Media, DMGT's regional newspaper division, against a spoof account of the Northcliffe chief executive, Steve Auckland. The person behind the anonymous account, @UnSteveDorkland, is now preparing legal representation in the US, MediaGuardian has learned. They confirmed to MediaGuardian: \"I am speaking to a Californian lawyer tonight who has expressed an interest in representing me pro bono.\" The person behind @UnSteveDorkland added: \"It was a parody, pure and simple. Made a few people laugh, I hope. Pointed out some of the absurdities of corporate life. \"It is Steve Auckland who has elevated this beyond all that by hunting me down via a US court. He must now face the consequences of his actions, as we all must. I am supremely confident I have done nothing illegal or immoral.\" Twitter told the account holder earlier this week that it will hand over their personal details \u2013 including email address, IP address and any other identifying information \u2013 to Northcliffe on 1 August, according to this person. The San Francisco-based company is complying with US law in disclosing the anonymous person's private details. On Wednesday evening Twitter's legal department told the person behind the account that they should consider contacting the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and American Civil Liberties Union (UCLU). In the email, which has been seen by MediaGuardian, Twitter suggested contacting the advocacy groups \"if you need assistance seeking counsel in the United States\". Northcliffe insiders said there was no plan to drop the legal action, despite an apparent end to what they claimed are the most offensive tweets. They said the want to find out who is behind the account so they can understand their grievances with the company. Auckland described the person's tweets as \"obsessive and offensive\" and said the company took the action \"to protect our staff from harassment\". He added in a statement: \"We made no request for, nor had any input in, a decision to stop tweeting. Our first priority is a duty of care to all of our employees. \"Some of the recent anonymous activity on Twitter has been both obsessive and offensive. We will not tolerate such behaviour and for these reasons we sought legal advice. \"Anyone who knows me realises I am a supporter of open communication. I am very happy to engage and directly answer any questions relating to the business. I will not tolerate any form of harassment of Northcliffe Media's employees, especially from anonymous sources. At this stage I cannot say anything further due to the legal situation.\" Twitter's move to hand over the details was first revealed by the Guido Fawkes political blog. Paul Staines, the blogger behind the site, told MediaGuardian on Thursday that he was organising legal support for the Twitter user. He said: \"We have had an offer from a Californian attorney to assist pro bono.\" Northcliffe insiders said the company and its lawyers received no response from Twitter when they attempted to contact the San Francisco-based company directly about the parody account. They said the newspaper group has not had any response from Twitter to date. Twitter declined to comment. The case follows other high-profile subpoenas against the company to unmask anonymous users. In May 2011, Twitter handed over the personal details of the South Tyneside councillor, Ahmed Khan, who was accused of being the author of a pseudonymous account critical of the council. Khan is attempting to appeal his case to the supreme court of California, the US state where Twitter is based and where South Tyneside council launched the legal action. \"I have no problem with an individual taking action but they should use their own money, not public money or that of a newspaper group,\" Khan told MediaGuardian on Thursday. He said that Twitter handed over an 82-page document containing \"strings of numbers\", IP addresses, and dates and times in his own case. In some cases, Twitter will attempt to quash the subpoena. Last week, the company opposed a high-profile bid to unmask the Occupy Wall Street protester, Malcolm Harris. Harris hired a lawyer to help challenge his case. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
