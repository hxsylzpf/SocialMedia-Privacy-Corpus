  "content": "A US newspaper published an apology for running a front page story and picture depicting Muslims celebrating the end of Ramadan on September 11, the ninth anniversary of the World Trade Centre attacks. Within a day of the Portland Press Herald publishing the picture of people praying at the end of the Muslim holy month, the paper's editor felt compelled to respond to complaints from people who said they were offended. Richard Connor told readers that the paper should have shown greater sensitivity in the light of \"the painful memories stirred by the anniversary of 9/11.\" The story, A show of faith and forgiveness, described the gathering of US-based Muslims praying and explained the significance of the Islamic festival, Eid al-Fitr, that marks the end of the month-long fast. In his open letter, Connor wrote: \"We have acknowledged that we erred by at least not offering balance to the story and its prominent position on the front page... In hindsight, it is clear that we should have handled this differently.\" On the morning of publication many readers complained to the paper's website, through its Facebook page and in a series of tweets. But the apology also generated complaints. One blogger, Justin Ellis, wrote: \"Unfortunately what Connor's done is created a self-inflicted wound to his newspaper. \"By apologising for a factual story portraying part of the community it covers, the Press Herald has damaged its ability to educate, betrayed the journalists who work there, alienated a part of their audience and shown that editorial control can be won by the power of the mob.\" Sources: Daily Mail/Portland Press Herald/Meat Raffle",
