  "content": "The News of the World undertook a review of its system of paying informants during the period that Clive Goodman was breaking the law by hacking into mobile phone messages, MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal. The paper brought in a new regime at the start of 2006 to cover the procedure that reporters should follow when paying for information. It is not suggested that the review was prompted by Clive Goodman's activities. Goodman was sentenced last week to four months' imprisonment for tapping the voicemail of three aides to the royal family, while his accomplice, the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, received a six-month term. During the sentencing hearing, it emerged that Goodman paid Mulcaire \u00a312,300 in cash between November 9 2005 and August 7 2006, which the journalist then claimed under expenses using the codename Alexander to hide the identity of his source. The payment file included references to \"Harry and Chelsy\" and \"Wills\", according to prosecution evidence presented at the Old Bailey on Friday. These payments were on top of a \u00a32,019-per-week contract that the News of the World had with Mulcaire. On December 29 2005, the News of the World's managing editor, Stuart Kuttner, sent staff an email announcing that the paper's rules about paying informants cash were being tightened up. The email, entitled \"Cash Payment Review\", told staff in a five-point plan to keep cash payments \"to a minimum\" and that they should be \"the exception\". \"Request for cash payments must be accompanied by compelling written justification,\" Mr Kuttner wrote. Information supplied on an invoice should be accurate and comprehensive, he added. In the \"exceptional\" event of a request for a cash payment to a protected and confidential source, staff requesting such a payment would need to demonstrate an \"overwhelming justification\" for keeping an informant's identity secret. The memo detailing the reasons for making such a payment to a confidential source would have to be provided to Mr Kuttner's office. Every cash payment request must be accompanied by \"appropriate supporting documentation\", the email concluded. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
