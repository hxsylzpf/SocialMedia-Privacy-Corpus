Now the company is reportedly planning another crack at social music, as part of its plans to relaunch its Beats Music streaming service in the summer. According to 9 to 5 Mac, the new service will be called Apple Music, and will have social features at its heart \u2013 albeit more strongly focused on the relationship between musicians and fans this time round. \"The service will allow artists to have their own pages within the streaming music service that they can use to post track samples, photos, videos and concert updates,\" reported journalist Mark Gurman, who has a good track record of ferreting information out of his Apple sources. Artists will also be able to share the content of other artists in an effort of cross-promotion. For example, all-gold Apple Watch wearer Kanye West could promote a new album from Taylor Swift on his Apple Music artist page, if he so chooses. Using iTunes accounts, all users of the streaming music service will be able to comment on and like these posts from big name artists, but users won't have their own social network profiles like with Ping.\" Existing streaming services have been exploring similar features, albeit not yet at this level of detail. On Spotify, for example, artists have profiles that their fans can follow to get updates when new music is added, as well as subscribe to playlists published through those accounts. If 9 to 5 Mac's report is correct, though, Apple's plans are as much a challenge to Facebook. Musicians can post similar updates and content on that social network from their official pages, but the \"organic\" reach of these posts \u2013 the percentage of people who have liked the page who will actually see its posts \u2013 has been steadily declining over time, as Facebook nudges labels towards boosting their reach by paying to promote posts. Apple Music will offer an alternative route to fans, just as Spotify and other streaming services are expanding the features through which musicians can communicate with their listeners. Success is far from guaranteed though, with the memory of Ping still regularly cited as evidence that Apple has historically struggled to get to grips with social media. The likely scale of Apple Music \u2013 its app is expected to be preloaded on every iOS device when it launches later this year \u2013 should ensure that musicians at least give its social features a try, to figure out how they compare with the likes of Facebook, Twitter and rival streaming services. Apple is expected to unveil its streaming plans on 8 June at its WWDC event in San Francisco, having bought Beats Music as part of its $3bn acquisition of Beats Electronics in 2014. More recently, it poached radio DJ Zane Lowe for a role within the new service.",
