  "content": "A former colleague, Emily Bell, was quick to pick up on two of the most contentious passages in the Leveson report: \"The internet does not claim to operate by any particular ethical standards, still less high ones. Some have called it a 'wild west' but I would prefer to use the term 'ethical vacuum'. This is not to say for one moment that everything on the internet is therefore unethical. That would be a gross mischaracterisation of the work of very many bloggers and websites, which should rightly and fairly be characterised as valuable and professional. The point I am making is a more modest one, namely that the internet does not claim to operate by express ethical standards, so that bloggers and others may, if they choose, act with impunity. And then came this: \"People will not assume that what they read on the internet is trustworthy or that it carries any particular assurance or accuracy; it need be no more than one person's view.\" I saw Emily rightly scoffing at such remarks in a TV interview. Now I note that a Christian Science Monitor editorial has described Leveson's comments as \"strangely pessimistic\". It argues: \"History would argue against the view that 'new media' \u2013 bloggers, tweeters, citizen journalists, or news aggregators like Google \u2013 may not ever adopt principles such as truthfulness and fairness. After all, digital media already generally conform to laws on copyright, defamation, and contempt of court. Is it really a big leap to expect them to conform someday to ethical codes like those of traditional journalism?\" After pointing out that most British and US newspapers do stick to ethical codes and agreeing with Leveson's view that \"most of what the press does is good journalism\", the Monitor says: \"Journalists do keep an eye on each other\u2026 the best guardians of the old and new media are the people who practise it as well as readers who can choose to ignore any website or publication that operates unethically. And no new law need target journalists that doesn't also apply to all citizens. Libel is libel, for example, as is illegal invasion of privacy.\" The editorial concedes that digital media offer new challenges because everyone can practise journalism \"with little oversight or professional vetting.\" It continues: \"The 'democratisation' of media will require an effort to form a consensus on ethical standards for online media. The internet itself is a powerful feedback loop for correcting 'entrepreneurial' journalists who, say, have a conflict of interest or hide behind anonymity\u2026 The Fourth Estate, whether in print or online, is the news consumer's best way to keep a check on government. And it is news consumers, as well as journalists, who must hold any media to account with ethical codes.\" I'm with the Monitor. People will go (are going) to sites they trust. Gradually, just as newspapers did originally, the most trustworthy will edge aside the less trustworthy. Blogs that don't seek to be anything other than partisan have a place in the digital firmament. Raging against them because you disagree with them is just plain silly (as long as they do not break the law, as the Monitor says). We cannot hope to impose ethical standards on conversations between people in a pub, even if we overhear something we don't like. What we have to accept is that those conversations are now taking place in a digital pub. If we don't like it, we don't need to read it.
