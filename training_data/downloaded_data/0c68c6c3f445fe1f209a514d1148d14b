  "content": "Almost everyone on the internet agrees that most memes are born on 4Chan. How they propagate thereafter is a little fuzzy, but there is little doubt that a big chunk of that credit must go to Tumblr. Only last week, the microblogging platform announced that it is one of the top 10 most-trafficked sites in the US, hosting some 77m blogs with a worldwide reach of 168 million unique visitors every month. That's a hell of a lot of gifs. And as if to cement its popularity, Tumblr was yesterday the victim of its very own hack. The culprits? Trolling group GNAA, a rep of which told Gawker they had warned Tumblr of system vulnerabilities weeks ago. Yesterday's worm threw up a fake pop-up which then displayed a pertinent message for users (caps emphasis is GNAA's): \"This is in response to the seemingly pandemic growth and worldwide propagation of the most FUCKING WORTHLESS, CONTRIVED, BOURGEOISIE, SELF-CONGRATULATING AND DECADENT BULLSHIT THE INTERNET EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF FACILITATING.\" and \"REPEAT AFTER ME: I WISH I WAS PROFOUND, BUT I'M NOT! I WISH I WAS ORIGINAL, BUT I'M NOT!\" Ouch. Is it really that bad? Let's have a look at the stats. Tumblr is incredibly popular with pop culture junkies, it's true. You only need to look through some of the tags to realise this. It's also a social network for young people; again, just take a glance at the tags. UK Tumblr demographics reveal that 38% of users are aged 18 to 24, and 54% are female; 80% of users are child-free. In the US, 65% of Tumblr users are white, and 53% are university-educated (this drops to 36% in the UK). Across both locations, one thing is clear: the majority of Tumblr users don't earn a lot of money. You start to see GNAA's point, when you stick around some corners of Tumblr for any length of time: it is the domain of the incredibly staged self-shot photo, a land where \"inspirational\" quotes hover in mid-air over a background of shooting stars. Very quickly, it can inspire a existential rage you didn't even know was within you. I should say that after lurking for a while, I got myself a Tumblr a couple of years ago \u2013 and I love it. I'm not very active on it (about 25-30 posts a month on average), and most of my posts are reblogs (a cross-post of someone else's entry). A good amount of what I post features a shower of gifs (recently these have come from this summer's Avengers movie, or Magic Mike and its many delights) and more often than not I am posting about visual popular culture \u2013 television, comic books and graphic novels, YouTube videos and films. If you fill your dashboard with like-minded souls, Tumblr rewards you every day, far more than you thought possible. It is also a hideous timesuck. Like any internet community, it is not without its flaws. Here, the hackers' comments came uncomfortably close to a lot of Tumblr users' excesses. It is sometimes a deeply silly place, keen on self-congratulation. It is also largely decadent, and because it is made of millions of fallible human beings, it's not always terribly original or profound. But that does not mean it does not have the capacity to be those things, and it often is. Tumblr is where I go to laugh, but it also a fantastic place to learn: this is where I first read about Trayvon Martin, for example. It often hosts some of the most eloquent and nuanced conversations about society, from gender to race to equality and social justice. It is a community that gives and shares and supports its own \u2013 only last night, I witnessed people organise a whip-round for a fellow Tumblr user who needed to get out of an abusive situation fast. It can be a brilliant place, because it is a lot more than the sum of is parts: you get out of it what you put in. Not many sites can give you all of that and a gif of Chris Evans punching a bag in slo-mo. And for that reason, I'll remain onboard. No contest.",
