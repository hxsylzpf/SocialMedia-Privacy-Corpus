For the first time in Britain leading digital media companies will host a series of high-profile events showcasing upcoming content, organised by the Internet Advertising Bureau UK under the umbrella brand UK Digital Upfronts. The week-long event takes a leaf from the US TV industry's long-established annual TV industry \"upfronts\" presentations in New York every May, when the networks give advertisers a preview of their programming for the coming year. In total 11 companies including Mashable, Microsoft, Millennial Media and Publicis Groupe-owned agency DigitasLBi will be giving presentations in venues across the capital. Launching such an event in London is considered a necessity to help advertisers and agencies keep up with the explosion in digital advertising and content. In the UK, digital display advertising is growing 30% annually and by the end of this year the internet ad market will be worth \u00a37bn, more than twice as large as TV ad spend at \u00a33.9bn. \"The industry is now moving so fast and there are so many new opportunities \u2013 in mobile, branded content, native advertising and video \u2013 that have only been around for maybe a year or so that we can introduce agencies and advertisers to,\" says Guy Phillipson, chief executive of the Internet Advertising Bureau UK. \"Digital upfronts have occurred in the US for the last three years, this is the first one here for the internet and mobile advertising industry.\" Mark Melling, AOL's director of video for Europe, confirmed the company will be reinforcing its position in the converged world between TV and the internet. \"We are focussing on using the upfronts as a platform to go through what our strategy is,\" said Melling. \"We don't think of ourselves as a pure digital player, we are between TV and digital, almost a third medium where lines are blurred. TV is not disappearing, it is transforming, and we want to be part of that.\" AOL's session on Thursday will be used to unveil a slate of digital series featuring well-known UK stars, following on from the success of its first commissions. The event will showcase the success of its first digital showcase that featured stars Sarah Jessica Parker, James Franco, Steve Buscemi and Nicole Richie. Melling is keeping the names of the British stars \"close to his chest\" but said the celebrities featuring in the next wave of AOL Originals all have \"large social media followings\". Twitter's session on Tuesday is similarly heavily focused on the possibilities of video and its Twitter Amplify product. \"Video on Twitter is relatively new and this is a brilliant opportunity to showcase the evolution of video on our platform,\" said Theo Luke, senior manager for Twitter Amplify Europe, Middle East and Africa. \"It is a great opportunity to inform and educate.\" For Yahoo it is a chance to explain what opportunities there are to tap into Tumblr, the blogging platform it acquired for $1.1bn last May, and the company's new ad platform Yahoo Ad Manager Plus. \"This is a chance for digital companies to reveal big themes and products important to us,\" says Jason Talley, Yahoo UK's commercial director, who will present on Tuesday. \"Tumblr is a big thing and there is a lot of excitement about how brands and advertisers can work with Tumblr.\" The week-long event will end on Friday evening with Vice Media founder Shane Smith giving what promises to be a lively presentation. The company is not giving away much, beyond \"new channels in news, food and sport\", but it is promising to end the first UK digital upfronts with a bang. \"Located in an 18th century church, the Vice UK digital upfront will be a Ride of the Valkyries attack on the senses with the best video content, the loudest music, the strongest cocktails and a VIP after party at the Vice pub, The Old Blue Last,\" a Vice Media spokesman said.",
