  "content": "The House of Lords this morning ended footballer Garry Flitcroft's attempt to overturn a ruling allowing the Sunday People to name him in a \"kiss and tell\" story, bringing to a close a case that is being hailed as a landmark for newspapers. In March a court of appeal decided the newspaper could name the married Premiership footballer, who had been trying to block the publication of embarrassing stories about his extramarital affairs. The decision overturned an earlier high court ruling, which barred the Sunday People from reporting the testimony of two women who had had relationships with the footballer. The appeal judges, headed by lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, laid down guidelines for judges faced with a spate of applications by celebrities, who invoked privacy rights under the Human Rights Act, which came into force in October 2000. Flitcroft had then been given the opportunity to persuade the House of Lords to hear his case, even after the People had been allowed to name him and publish its story. Marcus Partington, head of the editorial legal department at MGN Ltd, confirmed the company had today been notified by the House of Lords that it had rejected Flitcroft's request. \"It is very good news and once again MGN has basically fought a battle for the good of the media as a whole,\" said Mr Partington. He said that if the judgment had gone against the newspaper, it would have been disaster for the freedom of the media. \"This case has laid down important future guidelines for judges considering pre-publication injunctions. Lord Woolf's judgment is now law in this area,\" Mr Partington added. The Blackburn Rovers captain has been ordered to pay two thirds of MGN's costs in the legal action. It is likely the court adventure could cost the footballer \u00a3250,000.",
