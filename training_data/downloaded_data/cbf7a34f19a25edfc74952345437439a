  "content": "More proof of the Press Complaints Commission's new-found determination to publicise its work, following its brokering of an apology by The Sun for a false Coronation Street story. Now comes the above tweet, pointing to the PCC having negotiated the following apology to Simon Cowell by Heat magazine. On 16 November 2010, we suggested that Simon Cowell knows after each show which X Factor contestants get the most votes each week. We now accept that this statement was untrue and apologise to Mr Cowell and Syco Entertainment, the company responsible for the show, for any offence that may have been caused by any suggestion that the competition may be unfair. We accept Mr Cowell's assurance that he did not know the number of votes cast for each act until after the final. The PCC has 1,376 Twitter followers at present, and I'm sure its judicious use of the site will lead to that number increasing several times over in the coming year. Surely every journalist should be a follower?",
