Tara If you have been hit by the latest CryptoWall 3 then your presumption is probably correct \u2013 unless you pay the criminals who are holding your files hostage. Ransomware is getting more and more sophisticated, and making it harder to recover files. However, it doesn't always work properly, so it is still worth trying. What is ransomware? Ransomware is malware that (usually) encrypts your files using an encryption system that is so strong there is no practical means of cracking it. Then it gives you a limited time to pay for your files to be decrypted. This may include the offer to decrypt one file free to show that it works. The first ransomware programs appeared at the end of the 1980s. Sometimes they just locked your PC's screen rather than encrypting files. Some claimed they were the FBI, Metropolitan Police or whatever and pretended to \"fine\" you for looking at \"illegal\" content. Ransomware programs are becoming more common now because of the availability of the anonymous Tor network, and anonymous payment systems such as bitcoin. Obviously, if police forces could track payments back to the criminal operators, it might be possible to arrest them. (CryptoWall does not infect computers in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan, so I'd guess they are based in one or more of those countries.) CryptoLocker, the best known ransomware program, appeared in 2013, and CryptoWall -- which seems to be based on CryptoDefense -- early in 2014. These and several others target Microsoft Windows. Less sophisticated ransomware programs have also targeted Google Android and Apple's iOS and Mac OS X. Recovering files Ideally, you should be able to recover all your files from backups. Unfortunately, advanced ransomware not only encrypts files on your PC, it also encrypt files on external hard drives. If you're backing up your PC to a USB drive \u2013 which might be the E: drive on your PC \u2013 then that will get encrypted as well. Your back-up drives should be disconnected from your PC when not in use. Alternatively, make backups on optical discs (Blu-ray, DVD or CD-Rom) or online. Ransomware programs may create an encrypted version of a file then delete the original. If so, you may be able to undelete the original file with a utility such as MiniTool Power Data Recovery (free up to 1GB), R-Studio or Photorec. Note that the more you use your PC after the infection, the less chance there is of recovering files. Windows may also have kept some copies of your files. To check, right-click one of your files in Windows Explorer and look for the menu item, \"Restore previous versions\". You can also right-click on a file, select \"Properties\", and then select the tab marked \"Previous Versions\". These may not be bang up to date, but are better than nothing. It would be tedious to try to recover a lot of files this way, so download Shadow Explorer instead. This can export whole folders of shadow copies at once. Note that CryptoWall includes a command to delete all shadow copies, but if any have survived, it's worth a go. Finally, there's the option to pay the $300-$1,000 ransom. This depends on the value of your files and how you feel about giving money to criminals. The drawback with paying is that it will just attract more criminals to the ransomware market. For a fuller account of the recovery processes, see the FAQs on CryptoLocker and CryptoWall at Bleeping Computer. Better than cure CryptoWall may be distributed as a spam email attachment that looks like a pdf document (ie it's a trojan), which most users will think is safe. However, it's actually an executable (.exe) program, and \"opening\" it runs the programs that encrypt your files. Of course, it should still be blocked by a good anti-virus program. Either way, don't click on unexpected attachments, If you suspect an incoming file, upload it to the free VirusTotal website, which will check it with a large number of anti-virus programs. Ransomware programs are also being distributed in exploit kits that target security holes in web browsers and programs such as the Java Runtime and Adobe Flash. This makes it all the more important to run anti-virus software, and to keep installing the patches that keep Windows and other programs up to date. Keep Windows Update turned on and consider using Secunia's Personal Software Inspector to check other programs. CryptoLocker and CryptoWall both run from an AppData folder, and it's possible to use Windows' software restriction policies to stop executable files from running from those folders. The simplest way to do this is to use FoolishIT's CryptoPrevent utility, which is available in both free and paid-for versions. If any IT managers are reading this, Webroot's Roy Tobin has an excellent guide to securing company PCs: Best practices for securing your environment against CryptoLocker and ransomware Rather than detecting or blocking ransomware programs, which can change overnight, you can block what they try to do. Hitman Pro.Alert's CryptoGuard takes this approach. You can download a 30-day trial version, but after that it costs from \u20ac19.95 (one PC for one year) to \u20ac59.90 (three PCs for three years). BitDefender's free CryptoWall Vaccine appears to be another example. Windows 8.x users should also turn on File History, which is an improved version of Windows 7's Previous Versions. And if nothing else stops ransomware, there's always RollBack Rx, which enables you to restore your PC to an earlier condition, ie before the malware struck. The free version allows home users to keep seven snapshots, while the pro version (\u00a357.08) has many more features and unlimited snapshots. Ransomware is not a huge threat at the moment: Symantec rates CryptoWall as \"Risk Level 1: Very Low\". But it's a very nasty threat, and could get worse. It certainly highlights the importance of making regular backups, and in particular, of having at least one backup that isn't permanently attached to your PC, where it is still vulnerable.
