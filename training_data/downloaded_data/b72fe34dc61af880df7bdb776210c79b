  "content": "Here's an upcoming event that may possibly throw some light on phone-hackery and related matters of digital intrusions into privacy. It's the Westminster media forum seminar: Social media, online privacy and the 'right to be forgotten'. Speakers include Press Complaints Commission chairman Baroness (Peta) Buscombe, information commissioner Christopher Graham and John Naughton, columnist with The Observer and professor of the public understanding of technology at the Open University. The seminar will consider questions of what should be private or public, and whether it might be time for new data protection legislation. It's being held on 22 March - from 9am until 1pm - at a central London venue, yet to be agreed.",
