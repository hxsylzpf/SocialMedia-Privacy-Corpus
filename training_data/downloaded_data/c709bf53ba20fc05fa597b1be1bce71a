But while they boast short-term interactivity and bring in more followers, they will not necessarily be effective in the long run. You might be building up your analytics and enjoying the illusion of popularity, but will your newly acquired fans be interested in what you have to say? Will they remain fans and, more importantly, be engaged with your messages? The number that matters is not followers or likes but the percentage of engagement, the people who click through, who reply, who talk to you and ultimately, who buy from you. So here are my top tips on interaction over attraction: Be interesting Say something when you have something to say. It can be funny, it can be informative, it can improve your followers' lives in some way or show who you are. Make it the status people remember. It's not quantity, it's quality It's about attracting fans/followers that are your target market and so you need to make sure you're speaking to real fans \u2013 rather than looking popular but not being seen by the people who matter most. You don't have to update a certain number of times every day or be on a certain number of platforms. Be on the platforms that work for you. Some days you will update once and some days 10 times. The only real criteria is that it adds value so don't worry about sticking to the shoulds when it comes to update frequency and follower figures. Don't just talk about yourself People don't want to just hear about you. Think about who your customer is and what they are interested in. If you are a home improvement company, rather than tell people about your collection of vases, tell them tips on flower arranging \u2013 something people can take away with them that shows your expertise and not just your product. Talk to rather than at people This is about genuinely connecting and reading about what your fans and followers have to say and conversing with them on topics they are interested in. If you're selling lawnmowers, speak to garden enthusiasts and garden publications, photograph a garden of the week, or upload best lawns on Pinterest. Be careful with automation Don't get me wrong, I love pre-scheduling; you can't be everywhere at once and this helps manage multiple platforms. However, it can be a double-edged sword as often updates sound wooden and it's easy to upload and forget. But the whole point of social media is that it is social, it may be quick and easy but you have to maintain a genuine presence. Use automation as an aid in your social strategy but don't lean on it too heavily, it will strip out the \"in the moment\" presence social media offers. Check your stats Find out what your audience liked or disliked, what they clicked on or spent extra time reading. Use this information to inform your content moving forwards. Be authentic Finally, it's important to remember that people who buy from you and follow you on social media buy from you for a reason. Bring your brand and your voice to every social platform you use and every interaction. Interaction is about making a real connection. This means not just replying to people who speak to you directly and answering customer inquiries but actively following your feed and responding to people and situations, starting conversations and being more active and interesting, rather than simply responding. This is the secret to a good social strategy \u2013 not how many platforms you're on, how many followers you have, how often you update or any other magic number. The secret to success is always adding value to the customer. Follow this and you're on to a winner. Jess Collins is creative director at Type Communications.
