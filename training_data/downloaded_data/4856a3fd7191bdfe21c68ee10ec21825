  "content": "Snapchat is facing widespread backlash for a filter that promotes racist stereotypes of Asians, just months after the social media company released a Bob Marley filter that many said was the equivalent of \"digital blackface\". The app introduced and has since taken down a filter that allowed users to turn their selfies into Asian caricatures, prompting accusations that the feature was a clear example of \"yellowface\". The filter, which users began criticizing on Tuesday, featured squinty eyes in what appears to be a cartoonish and insensitive portrayal of Asians, with one critic on Twitter calling it \"the most overly racist filter ever\". Snapchat on Wednesday said the filter was an \"anime-inspired Lens\" that has \"expired\" and \"won't be put back into circulation\". \"Lenses are meant to be playful and never to offend,\" a statement said. The reaction comes on the heels of a major Snapchat controversy earlier this year when the company promoted a Bob Marley concept on 20 April, the marijuana holiday known as 4/20. The Marley lens allowed Snapchat users to combine their faces with an image of the late singer. The feature included cartoon dreadlocks. As that filter spread, many said it constituted \"blackface\" and \"cultural appropriation\", and others argued that it was also offensive to Marley by emphasizing the artist's connection to weed without honoring his musical legacy. Like other technology companies, Snapchat, which is headquartered in Venice, California, has faced scrutiny over the diversity of its staff. Some companies have released statistics on the diversity of their employees, revealing that women and people of color are sorely underrepresented. Snapchat, however, has repeatedly declined to offer specific data on the demographics of its workforce. A spokesperson declined to provide statistics on Wednesday. The filter snafu comes at a time when Asian Americans have increasingly spoken up about \"yellowface\" and \"whitewashing\" in the US media. Most recently, actor Matt Damon faced a heated backlash for landing a lead role in a movie called The Great Wall, a fantasy adventure set in China. Hollywood has faced growing opposition for casting white actors in Asian roles or characters that were originally Asian, including Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Emma Stone and Rooney Mara.",
