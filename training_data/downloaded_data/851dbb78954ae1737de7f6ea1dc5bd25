Honestly, I'm surprised it's taken so long. Over the past five years, social media has become my generation's main source of information, from the insignificant goings\u2013on at a house party to breaking global news stories. A recent Business Wire survey revealed that 60% of US millennials depend on social media to keep up\u2013to\u2013date with current affairs, so it was only a matter of time before a company such as Snapchat cemented its place in the news industry. While social media increasingly becomes a trusted news source, traditional journalism has struggled to engage young people. Sky News recently revealed that only 18% of 16\u2013 to 24-year-olds in the UK said they trust mainstream media to provide them with relevant information. The fact that only 8% of them say they're fully politically engaged is surely related to this. There is an urgent need for a news source that appeals directly to millenials. I was therefore excited to learn that Snapchat was adapting its platform to suit the news demands of a younger audience, but is this form of social media\u2013centric news the future of journalism? Snapchat Discover pays homage to the fact that more than half of smartphone users consume news predominantly through their mobile (this number rises among younger audiences). They've created a news site that is built specifically for mobile consumption, and content partners such as Vice, Yahoo News and the Daily Mail are required to adapt their content to suit Snapchat's smartphone\u2013friendly format. The company has realised that the traditional structure of news needs to change if it's going to be consumed readily by young people. Snapchat boasts that Discover will feature \"full screen photos and videos\" and \"gorgeous advertising\" \u2013 all the things missing in mobile news content's current state. A page full of tiny text and buffering videos is enough to put anybody off. Interestingly, the messaging service has gone beyond simply changing the format of news; it's also setting out to shake up the style of its delivery. Snapchat has emphasised that Discover provides \"a storytelling format that puts the narrative first\". This highlights that engaging the smartphone generation with news requires not only a new format, but also a new way of telling stories. Does Discover's content live up to its promises? It certainly looks good \u2013 the seamless UX is addictive and the design visually stimulating. However, the stories themselves fall short. When I clicked on a Daily Mail piece about Michelle Obama, I was faced with the same text I'd find on Mail Online. Admittedly the headline and images looked better, but the copy was nothing new. On Yahoo! News I was greeted by a series of short videos summarising the stories available that were visually excellent, but when I clicked to read more, the same old chunks of algorithmically\u2013produced text I'd read on their other news platforms appeared. Neither of these screamed creative storytelling. Snapchat is famous for its bite-size and ephemeral content sharing, so you'd expect its news to be both of these things. It's certainly ephemeral, each story is deleted after 24 hours, which is a genius way to keep elusive younger audiences coming back, but I'm not so convinced about bite-size. The fact that the Mail's content was directly lifted from its site meant that it took me at least 10 scrolls to get to the bottom of the story, and at least three of the Vice videos I clicked on were about 20 minutes long. There's no way I'd be able to engage with these stories on my phone while on the move. Young people need three things from a news source: content must be mobile\u2013friendly, social (ie sharable, peer\u2013to\u2013peer, user\u2013generated), and presented in an engaging, accessible manner. Snapchat has begun to address these points, adapting the existing structures of journalism to suit its users' needs but it needs to demand more from its content partners if it is going to capture the attention of Generation Y. But does the future of news even lie in the adaptation of existing media? It's possible that the very existence of journalism is threatened by the rise of social media. Twitter recently stepped into the news game by allowing users to publish videos up to 30 seconds long, rather than six. The fact that anyone, anywhere can now upload footage of a live event or breaking news story means the site will become a 24/7 rolling news channel to rival the likes of Sky and CNN. Will the rapid growth of crowd\u2013sourced, user\u2013generated story telling soon make traditional media redundant? Or is the adaptation of existing journalism by social media companies such as Snapchat enough to engage future generations with the news? Only time will tell.
