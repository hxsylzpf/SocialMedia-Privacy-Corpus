It arrived predictably enough, in an electronic missive of well under 140 characters that appeared just before 5pm. \"Library to acquire ENTIRE Twitter archive \u2013 ALL public tweets, ever, since March 2006! Details to follow,\" it squawked. The tweet would have had little significance were it not for the fact that the library in question is the US Library of Congress, guardian of such cultural treasures as the rough draft of the Declaration of Independence, a Gutenberg Bible, and some very pricey violins. The Library of Congress's decision to archive everything that has ever appeared on the site is a brave one. Although it is used to filing and storing millions of newspapers, government documents and sound recordings, Twitter could prove a little more challenging. The site announced yesterday that it had 150 million users, and is picking up another 300,000 each day. Lest the Sisyphean nature of the archiving job was lost on anyone, the library posted a helpful explainer on its Facebook page. \"That's a LOT of tweets, by the way; Twitter processes more than 50m tweets every day, with the total numbering in the billions,\" it said. Still, it mused, a little proudly, it had pushed one or two awkward rocks up the mountain of history before. \"If you think the Library of Congress is 'just books' think of this: the library has been collecting materials from the web since it began harvesting congressional and presidential campaign websites in 2000. \"Today we hold more than 167 terabytes of web-based information, including legal blogs, websites of candidates for national office, and websites of members of Congress.\" What the archive will communicate to future generations is anyone's guess, but those who use Twitter to wrestle with the really big questions in life \u2013 \"Can socks with heels ever be a fashion 'do'?\"; \"What about orange ginger marmalade?\" \u2013 will find themselves preserved for ever in the same virtual vault as Barack Obama, who used the site to say thank you to America in November, 2008. \"We just made history,\" he tweeted. \"All of this happened because you gave your time, talent and passion. All of this happened because of you. Thanks.\"",
