  "content": "Mitt Romney and Tiger Woods have become the latest victims of suspected Russian hackers who allegedly stole and posted online sensitive financial information about political figures and celebrities. A website using the suffix of the former Soviet Union, .su, has reportedly paralysed the management agencies of about a dozen Hollywood stars since posting the information on Monday. Fans and the curious have swamped published phone numbers hoping to speak to celebrities only to jam the lines of their lawyers, accountants and business managers, TMZ reported. The FBI, the Los Angeles police department and credit agencies are investigating the security breach which has leaked social security numbers, credit reports, addresses and personal banking details. Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, senior law enforcers and stars such as Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9, Britney Spears, Kim Kardashian, Mel Gibson, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger have been targeted. Romney, the Republican former presidential candidate, joined the list on Wednesday when the site posted what purported to be his credit cards and a card for Barneys, the New York fashion citadel for men and women favoured by Sarah Jessica Parker. The page was illustrated with a photo of President Barack Obama, who vanquished Romney last year, and a caption: \"Hey Mitt, you mad bro?\" Credit reports for Woods, accompanied with a picture in which the golfer looked upset, were dated to Tuesday, suggesting the hackers were obtaining up to the minute information. Such a mass dump of sensitive information is known as being \"doxxed\". Those targeted have not responded to media requests seeking confirmation the information was real, leaving open the possibility the site was a hoax, or partial hoax. Titled \"the secret files\", the site features a girl with heavy black eye makeup and a warning: \"If you believe that God makes miracles, you have to wonder if Satan has a few up his sleeve.\" FBI director Robert Mueller and LAPD chief Charlie Beck were among those targeted. \"We'll take steps to find out who did this, and if they're within the boundaries of the United States, we'll prosecute them,\" said Beck. Al Gore and Stacia Hylton, director of the US Marshal's Service, were among those added to the site on Wednesday. Other victims included Hulk Hogan and Donald Trump. Victims' representatives did not immediately respond to media requests seeking confirmation the information was real, leaving open the possibility the site was a hoax, or partial hoax. The celebrity news site TMZ, which broke the story on Monday, cited law enforcement officers saying that in addition to posting the information the hackers had been \"using\" it, suggesting theft or fraud. The FBI has urged victims to apply additional safeguards on their bank accounts. The site posted the first lady's purported credit report, social security number, phone number, banking details and store cards. \"Blame your husband. We still love you, Michelle,\" it taunted. Some of Biden's information was also hacked, but when ABC phoned a telephone number for him, it turned out to be a business in Delaware. Other political figures who were targeted included Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, Eric Holder, the attorney general and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state. Beck speculated he was included because of his force's involvement in last month's hunt for Christopher Dorner, a rogue, former LAPD officer who murdered four people before being killed in a dramatic shootout. \"You can't corner the Dorner,\" said the site. Last month the hacker group Anonymous had threatened cyber retaliation for Dorner's death. The site linked to a Twitter account that since Monday has posted two tweets in Russian. \"Hello world, we are revealed. Our aim is to show you all that this is just one of a few tricks up our sleeves,\" said one.",
