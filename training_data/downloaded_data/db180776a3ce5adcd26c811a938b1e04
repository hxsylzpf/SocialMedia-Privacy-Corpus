  "content": "From style blogging to fashion magazines and tracking down lusted-after items, there really is an app for that. LIKEtoKNOW.it Launched by the founders of Reward Style \u2013 a tool that allows bloggers to earn commission from brands on products featured on their site \u2013 LIKEtoKNOW.it aims to make it easier than ever for fashion followers to find out what their favourite bloggers are wearing and, more importantly, where to buy it. One signup with LIKEtoKNOW.it syncs the service with your Instagram account, allowing you to start accessing information instantly. If the users \"likes\" an Instagram picture of a blogger, details of the outfit the blogger is wearing are sent via email newsletter, complete with links to buy each item. Co-founder Amber Venz is a fan of a clean and uncluttered aesthetic which makes the emails and site a dream to navigate. The downside? Not all fashion bloggers \u2013 or indeed influential Instagram users \u2013 are signed up with the invitation-only service. But LIKEtoKNOW has an impressive number of bloggers using a service that only launched in December 2013 \u2013 not to mention the consumer following which is growing rapidly. The Netbook Natalie Massenet's Net-a-Porter empire continues to grow and grow with new fashion magazine, Porter the most recent offering. But last year the company turned their attention to their own invitation-only social network. For those influential enough in fashion to be invited into the hallowed halls of The Netbook, an Instagram-meets-Pinterest-style social network is unveiled with the customary chic aesthetic of Net-a-Porter's online site. Clothes and accessories are beautifully laid out allowing members to \"like\" images, which will then appear in the user's profile and, the hope is, inspire them to buy certain items. The fun element comes from being able to seek out favourite celebrities, stylists, fashion editors and sneak a peek at what they're liking, loving and buying right now. Snap Fashion Built by British computer science graduate Jenny Griffiths, Snap Fashion allows users to snap a picture of something they like and search for similar products from over 300,000 items available on the UK high-street and online. Snap Fashion is available on mobile phone or on the web where users can paste a link to an image of the item they are after. With a mixture of high street brands such as Topshop, New Look and French Connection alongside department stores such as House of Fraser and John Lewis and online retailers including boohoo and The Outnet, the results provide products with a range of prices whatever the budget. The Hunt Shopping for many is a social event and if you're wanting to share, socialise and kindly help others find what they're looking for then the Hunt may be the app for you. Snap and upload the picture of the piece you're after and the Hunt community will endeavor to track down that item. Brownie points for helping others in return.",
