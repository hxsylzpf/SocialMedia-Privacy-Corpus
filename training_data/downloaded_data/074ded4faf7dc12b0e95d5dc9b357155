  "content": "Another \"right to be forgotten\" own goal. Google informed the Bolton News that it was deleting a 2010 court report from its search listings to comply with the European court of justice ruling in favour of protecting privacy. The result: the newspaper has made a nonsense of the ruling by republishing the de-listed article, which told of three men being jailed for attacking three soldiers, alongside a report about the original story being removed by Google. The paper's editor-in-chief, Ian Savage, is quoted in the report as saying: \"I believe passionately in the freedom of the press and I will fight any attempts to remove legitimate content... \"People who aren't happy that stories which we have legitimately published should not have the right to have them removed from a Google search.\" He argues that it is \"a completely pointless exercise\" because \"those who ask for these articles to be removed simply invite more publicity on themselves.\" Source: Bolton News Hat tip: HoldTheFrontPage",
