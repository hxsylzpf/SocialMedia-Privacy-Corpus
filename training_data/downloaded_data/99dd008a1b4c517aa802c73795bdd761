Speaking after Madonna sought \u00a35m in damages from the Mail on Sunday after it published private photos of her wedding, Desmond Browne QC, the chair of Bar Council, said there was a compelling case that newspapers would not be able to continue \"riding roughshod over privacy rights\". \"If newspapers are going to intrude on privacy without giving notice, they ought only to do so at peril of being milked for exemplary damages,\" Browne said. Browne also hit back at an attack by the Daily Mail editor-in-chief, Paul Dacre, who last month accused one judge, Mr Justice Eady, of being singlehandedly responsible for crafting a new law on privacy. Defending Eady, Browne said: \"It's nonsense to say that the creation of the law of privacy is the judges, let alone one judge, effectively legislating. \"Parliament did the legislating in the Human Rights Act, and the judges then have to balance [the relevant rights] in accordance with the Strasbourg case law, which they are obliged to follow.\" Eady became the subject of intense debate after awarding \u00a360,000, the highest amount ever awarded for breach of privacy, to formula one boss Max Mosley after the News of the World published details of his sex life. Eady has been at the centre of recent privacy cases as the high court's specialist judge. Browne added that the law on privacy should continue to protect acts which might not be regarded as conventional behaviour, dismissing Dacre's claims that acts he regarded as \"unimaginable sexual depravity\" should not be protected by the courts. \"That protection is negated if it only applies to matrimonial sexual intercourse on Saturday nights in the missionary position,\" said Browne. Eady will also preside over Madonna's claim, one of several high-profile privacy cases that will come before the high court next year. Others include footballer Ashley Cole, who is suing the Daily Mirror and the Sun over allegations about his sex life. A hearing in a case brought by Sienna Miller against the Sun and Daily Mail and photo agency Big Pictures was dropped recently after being settled out of court. Claimants are increasingly arguing that the press should be forced to notify them of private material being published so that they can seek an injunction. Mosley will take his claim for a law requiring advance notification to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. \"Newspapers already give notice of intended publication to those who are likely to be the subject of defamatory articles,\" he said. \"But they do not give notice, for fear of being injuncted, to those whose privacy they are going to intrude upon. It seems to me this a very important issue that has not been properly explored.\" Lawyers also say that requirements for dealing with photographs \"fairly\" under the Data Protection Act could place further pressure on the media to inform people before publication. \"The concept of fairness in relation to the publication of images hasn't been fully tested by the courts,\" said media barrister Mark Warby. \"The implications for the media in terms of how they operate could be significant\". However, the effects of the Mosley judgment are already being felt, according to media lawyer Mark Stephens. \"The tabloids have altered their stance on what we see as their standard Sunday fare quite radically,\" he said. \"We are seeing much more focus on stories relating to immigration and wrongdoing in the Sunday papers - the tarts, vicars and sex-life stories are beginning to evaporate.\"",
