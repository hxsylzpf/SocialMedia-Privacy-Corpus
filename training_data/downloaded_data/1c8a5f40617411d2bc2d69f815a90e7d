  "content": "Karl Marx once observed that religion was the opium of the people. Freddie Mercury sang that too much love will kill you. John Belushi proved that too much heroin and cocaine can do the same. But no one, as yet, has come up with an elegant formulation that warns of the dangers posed by hitting F5 too often on a computer keyboard. That, however, is the problem facing an ever growing number of people across the world (though it could be a shrinking number depending on how the recession pans out) with ready access to the internet. What once seemed simply an innocent playground for paedophiles and fraudsters is now a snake pit of what users call \"social media\" - Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Tesco.com and the like - that might, on first look, appear harmless, but have the potential to drag individuals into a life of addiction. I am Paul MacInnes and I am a refreshaholic. Currently, and rather lamely considering recent media reports that suggest every man and his cyberdog are doing the same, I am mostly using that F5 refresh key to update Twitter. Twitter is the online social tool that allows you to communicate with friends, acquaintances and complete strangers in messages of no more than 140 characters in length. I know, it sells itself. However, after 18 months of leaving my Twitter account dormant, I now spend an exorbitant amount of time (outside of work, obviously) posting short thoughts on love, life and what I would like for tea to my numerous contacts (45 at time of writing). I then spend much more time refreshing the web page to see if anyone has replied. There are other places I like to spend time refreshing: Facebook, which has a status function that's pretty much the same thing as Twitter and also allows me to check whether any of my friends have posted embarrassing or badly composed photographs; and then there are the two email accounts I monitor for unexpected correspondence from long lost friends or, preferably, lovers; or my bank account, in case I'm suddenly rich. I also follow blog threads or monitor RSS feeds - online beachcombing - that keep me up to date on world news, political commentary and whether Norwich City might buy anyone in the football transfer window. I sometimes ask myself why I pass precious hours in the act of refreshment when I could be doing something worthwhile, like watching the latest Gavin and Stacey box set, or reading an adult edition of Harry Potter. (It's at this point that I console myself with the recent statistic that 28% of British adults spent the majority of their leisure time online. They cannot all be watching porn.) It must be partly to do with curiosity. Why wait till the next day to learn what you could know now? Furthermore, what if what you know now is actually no longer the case? There is only way to assuage any doubt - and that is to refresh. Anyone, you say, could equally ask: why know now what you could learn tomorrow? Just to ask this question shows it has had its day. Far more important, though, is that the refresh offers the tantalising hint of happiness. Part of the idea of social networking is to keep in touch with people you might not otherwise keep in touch with. The other part is to show those same people how amazing you are. Each time you press the F5 key (or click on a mouse - though for reasons of repetitive strain injury, this is discouraged) you are indulging in the hope that someone, probably that long lost lover, is going to pop up and post an acknowledgment of how interesting you are, or how beatifully composed your photos are. This rarely happens to me, but nevertheless I refresh all the same. And for those who are always being refreshed by long-lost lovers, it takes the concept of constant gratification - formerly fuelled by shopping, grooming and, if you were lucky enough, a glance at the value of your property - to a whole new micro-level. Ultimately the refresh is the dream of self-actualisation. Marx probably had something to say about that too. paul.macinnes@theguardian.com \u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 19 February 2009. We said \"Freddie Mercury wrote that too much love will kill you\". He didn't. The song was written by Brian May, Elizabeth Lamers and Frank Musker. This has been corrected.",
