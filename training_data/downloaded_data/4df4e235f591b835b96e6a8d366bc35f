However, the company has become much more famous recently for starting the firestorm of criticism aimed at Sony BMG's use of a \"rootkit\" technique to hide the copy-protection system on some of the audio CDs released in the US. (The EFF has a list of the albums affected.) SysInternals explains Rootkit Revealer in this Introduction, and you can download it using a link at the bottom of the page. I ran it this weekend just for the experience, and found I don't have any rootkits installed. Just as well, really, as the Rootkit Revealer doesn't seem to have a way of fixing them, and I wouldn't know how to do it manually.... Both Process Explorer and Rootkit Revealer are freeware.",
