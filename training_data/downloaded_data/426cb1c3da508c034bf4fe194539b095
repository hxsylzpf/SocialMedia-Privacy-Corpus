But from today, British squaddies are to be officially encouraged to use social networking sites to keep in touch with their friends and explain \u2013 up to a point \u2013 what they are up to. The move described by the Ministry of Defence as a \"liberalisation\" of its policy for forces personnel's use of sites like Twitter and Facebook comes after the US military moved earlier this week in the opposite direction, banning US marines from using them at all on military computers. The MoD said today that British personnel will no longer have to seek the permission of their chain of command before discussing their work online. Long gone are the days when troops were told not to mention in a pub even that they were in the armed forces for fear of being targeted by the IRA. Today's members of the armed forces are, \"generally-speaking, young and tech-savvy\", a Ministry of Defence spokesman said. The MoD has even agreed to sponsor individual service peronnel who volonteer for regular blogs. This week, the Guardian described how civil Whitehall departments were being encouraged to use digital media with the help of the government's Twitter template, explaining how officials could use the medium without breaking civil service rules. Armed services personnel will have their own guidelines and military staff will simply be asked to use their common sense and not give away operational secrets. \"Think about what you are saying before you describe when you are going to Helmand with x, y, or z\", a defence official said yesterday. Upbeat comments about the conflict there will no doubt will be welcomed; criticism less so. The Taliban are also \"tech savvy\" and mobiles are banned among British troops in Afghanistan, the MoD said. Digital messaging and conversations there have to be conducted through computers. And bloggers and tweeters will not have access to highly classified or sensitive information kept on special MoD IT systems. That, at any rate, is the theory. Officials concede that it is impossible to police squaddies' use of the internet, emails, and networking sites and in the end it is a matter of trust. \"The MoD's new common sense guidance allows service personnel to talk about themselves and their work online, within limits and with advice to protect their security, reputation and privacy\", a MoD spokeman said. \"We will be actively seeking their feedback on how the first edition of the guidelines can be improved\". The ministry added that it will be actively seeking feedback on how the guidelines might be improved. In Washington, the Pentagon is reviewing its policy on the use of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter following the decision by the US Marine Corps to ban accessing such sites on its computers because of security concerns. \"These internet sites in general are a proven haven for malicious actors and content \u2013 and are particularly high risk due to information exposure, user-generated content and targeting by adversaries\", the Marine Corps said. However, marines will still be free to access the sites on their own computers or at internet cafes. Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, is a regular Twitter user. Earlier this week, he was asked by other users about the ban, tweeting in response: \"Obviously we need to find the right balance between security and transparency. We are working on that. But am I still going to tweet? You bet.\" It is said he has more than 4,000 followers on his Twitter account.",
