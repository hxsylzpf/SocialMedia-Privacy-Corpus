Help may be at hand in the form of \"antisocial networking\" \u2013 a clutch of new apps and websites designed to hide you from the seemingly irresistible march of technological intrusion. Proudly billing itself as \"the antisocial network\", Cloak works by turning social media against itself, mining real-time geographical location data from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare accounts to warn you if your \"friends\" are nearby. This enables you to take a different route and avoid meeting them. While it may be of particular use to cheating spouses, its creators insist that its purpose is broad: \"Avoid exes, co-workers, that guy who likes to stop and chat, anyone you'd rather not run into,\" it says. \"I think that the age of mass social networking has reached its peak, at least for us first-worlders,\" said Cloak's co-creator Chris Baker, who also founded the hugely successful viral news platform Buzzfeed . \"Platforms like Facebook and Twitter are public arenas where we cultivate versions of ourselves that are well-manicured, mostly false, and always 'on'. I think that is what's beginning to wane. We're exhausted from it and by it. Now platforms that enable ephemeral, private and very loose moments are starting to become hugely mainstream. Antisocial stuff is on the rise. Social has had its moment in the sun. Now people are beginning to revolt.\" Similar in function to Cloak is Split. Its creator, Udi Dagan, echoed Baker's assessment. \"Social networking has got to a stage where we have all realised this is just too much. We need to regain control over our lives,\" he said. \"The virtual world and the real world \u2013 it's all a mix and it's becoming overwhelming. So we will see more and more technology that will help us reclaim our space and create the necessary separation.\" Last year the American writer Jonathan Franzen bemoaned the omnipresence of social networking which forces us to interact constantly with others, rather than spending time in our own thoughts. \"Who has time to read literature when there are so many blogs to keep up with, so many food fights to follow on Twitter?\" he asked in a book, The Kraus Project. There is evidence that Facebook and Twitter make many of us unhappy as they push us to maintain an unrealistically positive public persona. A recent University of London study explained: \"The public nature of a user's Facebook profile means that users' social lives are particularly open to scrutiny from others.\" And the network can even break up relationships: \"Site use can lead to increased jealousy and/or obsessive behaviour, as a result of the opportunities it provides users to access \u2026 information about their partner that would not otherwise be accessible.\" The fear of being judged has resulted in social networking excluding many people who lack social confidence. For them there is Anomo, a social network for people who only want to reveal little bits of themselves at a time. Once users have built up a relationship with another, they can swap photos and personal details. Around 100,000 people have signed up worldwide. James Sun, Anomo's co-founder, said the thinking behind Anomo was that social networking had become \"too much, too fast \u2026 At the click of a button people can access your whole life, but in the real world people share things over time. So I set up an app with protective layers, one where people only reveal things when they want.\" He believes the shift from the social to the antisocial is only just beginning. \"We are going to see more ephemeral networking where things do not persist and where people can conceal their identities. So I don't think this is a blip, I think it's a pendulum swing.\" For some, even Anomo can be too personal \u2013 sometimes you have something that you feel you cannot reveal even to your closest friends. If you have some gossip to spread or a sensitive subject to discuss, but you don't want it traced back to you, you can try two new services that allow you to post anonymous messages: Whisper and Secret. Last week messages posted on Whisper ranged from the astonishing to the deeply affecting, including: \u25a0 \"I recently came to the belief that my dad is a drug dealer. But I don't have enough proof to do anything.\" \u25a0 \"I pay for two Netflix accounts so my family doesn't know I watch lesbian movies. It's been five years and I still can't come out to them.\" \u25a0 \"I was deployed to Afghanistan. No one knows the thoughts running through my head, which tree is sniper prone, which car is an IED. This affects my family more than they know.\"",
