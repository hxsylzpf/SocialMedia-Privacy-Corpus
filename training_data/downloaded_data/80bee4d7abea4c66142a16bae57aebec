The 25-year-old said she had blocked thousands of people on Twitter and still regularly received abuse via the social networking site. \"It was something I never expected,\" she said. \"I have never wanted to be famous, you definitely don't get into swimming for the fame. \"I did get upset about it. I couldn't get my head around why someone would go to the effort of looking someone up, and then sending them a nasty tweet. I still can't really,\" she said. \"What's going on in those people's lives?\" Adlington said her own self-confidence took a battering as her fame grew. \"When it started I was really, really upset, I asked myself 'What have I ever done to them, what have I done wrong?' But now I understand that it's just people wanting attention \u2013 I've learnt not to take it personally and use the block button.\" Despite retiring from competitive swimming after London 2012, Adlington said still received abuse. \"People say things like I'm a whale, or I look like a dolphin \u2013 I think 'well done, that's great imagination you've got there',\" she said. \"There was one yesterday that just said: 'You are so ugly'\u2013 I thought, to be fair you are to the point, you haven't wasted any time.\" Although sportsmen and women in the public eye are often singled out for abuse, Adlington, who alongside Katherine Grainger is Great Britain's most decorated female Olympian, feels women are criticised for a wider range of supposed sins than men. \"I think women get abused for more things \u2013 how you did your hair, if you wore a dress twice, if you've got cellulite \u2013 for God's sake, we all have to wear dresses twice, we all have cellulite. It's just one of those things you have to accept.\" She believes about 80% of the abuse she receives is from men, but it is the other 20% that hurts the most. \"I find it worse when women message me,\" she said. \"I think: 'What are you doing? We girls need to stick together.' \" Adlington, , who is set to speak at a Dove debate on social media and self-esteem on Friday evening at Selfridges' department store in London, said social media allowed young people to express themselves, but it could also put added pressure on already vulnerable egos. \"I think there is this message that the only way to be beautiful is to be stick thin, or look a certain way. I was never going to be stick thin, I'm 5ft 10in [178cm], I'm never going to be petite,\" she said. \"My advice to younger girls is just be yourself. When I was at school all my friends looked flawless, and I'd turn up with hair that I'd tried to dry with the car air vents while putting mascara on in the car and trying not to poke myself in the eye. But I said 'I love swimming' \u2013 and none of them cared a bit and they completely supported me.\" She had developed a thick skin when it came to abuse, said Adlington. But unexpected solace came during her tortuous time in the jungle, when she starred in I'm a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here! \"I don't live in the celebrity world, my friends are very normal, so when I was in the jungle it actually was useful to speak to other people who had been through it too. Even just hearing that 'me too' helped so much,\" she said. She welcomes Twitter's move to introduce a report button but said more needed to be done to stop people opening multiple accounts using false identities, and called for more monitoring of abuse. But despite the insults, she does not plan to leave the site. \"People ask me why I don't leave, but nine out of 10 times people on social media are lovely,\" she said. \"So many kids message me to tell me they are competing in their first gala, I get so many messages of support, so I don't want to leave.\" Adlington has a packed summer ahead: as well as commentating on the swimming during the Commonwealth Games, she is also getting married. \"Without being big-headed, I'm proud that when I was 15 I was working so hard in the pool. I'm proud I have got two gold medals,\" she said. \"I've got so many things in my life and really, I think those people who criticise you haven't got much else going on \u2013 so I just move on.\" Other victims of social media trolls Rebecca Adlington is far from the only high-profile female to receive abuse and criticism on Twitter. Other public figures have been attacked over their appearance \u2013 and much worse. The activist and writer Caroline Criado-Perez, the academic Mary Beard and the MP Stella Creasy were among the women targeted. Following public outcry Twitter has introduced an in-tweet \"report abuse\" button on all platforms. Caroline Criado-Perez The feminist activist and writer, who ran a successful campaign to keep a woman on a British banknotes, received persistent graphic rape and death threats on the site. She later said of the abuse: \"Men get attacked because they've said or done something someone doesn't like, whereas women get attacked because they're visible\". Two people were later jailed. Mary Beard The historian Mary Beard fell victim to a torrent of abuse, which she called \"truly vile\", following an appearance on BBC1's Question Time. Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge University, said of the experience: \"[T]he misogyny here is truly gobsmacking ... It would be quite enough to put many women off appearing in public.\" Stella Creasy The Labour politician received a barrage of rape and death threats via Twitter after she offered her support to Caroline Criado-Perez. The MP said later there should be no distinction between online and offline behaviour. \"It's absolutely harassment; it's absolutely designed to intimidate, to scare, to frighten you; and it's absolutely an issue we need to see both technology companies and police understand is part of the modern world,\" she said.",
