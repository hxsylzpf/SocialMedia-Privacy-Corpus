The site was only recently set up within the Tor darknet by Isis, allegedly in response to Anonymous taking down hundreds of the terrorist group's websites on the open web. Along with an advert for an online pharmacy, the hackers posted a statement saying: \"Too Much ISIS. Enhance your calm. Too many people are into this ISIS-stuff. Please gaze upon this lovely ad so we can upgrade our infrastructure to give you ISIS content you all so desperately crave.\" The site was first taken down by GhostSec earlier this week, but Isis reinstated the site, despite security researchers finding that the terrorist group had used very poor web security to try and protect it. Anonymous \"declared war\" on Isis at the beginning of the year, taking the terrorist group's sites offline, but stepped up operations and requested crowdsourced help in the wake of the Paris attacks. While some have said that hacktivists such as Anonymous, GhostSec and Ghost Security Group hinder the investigations of security services, Home Office security minister John Hayes said on Tuesday: \"I am grateful for any of those who are engaged in the battle against this kind of wickedness.\" Anonymous 'at war' with Isis, hacktivist group confirms When all you have is a hammer, Isis looks like a nail",
