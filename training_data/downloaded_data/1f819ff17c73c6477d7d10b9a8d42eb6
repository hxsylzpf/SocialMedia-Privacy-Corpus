  "content": "News Corp has confirmed that social networking website MySpace will solicit bids from Microsoft, Google and Yahoo! for its search-based advertising business. Peter Chernin, the chief operating officer of News Corp, told a Deutsche Bank conference: \"We will auction off our search business to Google, Yahoo!, or MSN.\" Rupert Murdoch has previously said News Corp was seeking an investment in the search business, but Mr Chernin said yesterday: \"Our instincts are we can't get into the search business in the same way.\" News Corp acquired MySpace - one of the biggest draws for teenage internet users - for $580m (\u00a3315.8m) last year, with the intention of putting it at the centre of its online operations. But despite owning one of the largest customer bases on the internet, with about 85 million members, the company has not fully exploited its advertising sales opportunities, Mr Chernin said. \"We've just scratched the surface of how to monetise it.\" About 80% of MySpace sales come from \"remnant sales\", or bulk sales of unused advertising space. Twenty per cent comes from display ads, which cost about seven to eight times more, Mr Chernin said, adding that he expects the ratio to reverse over time. Despite being a tiny part of the News Corp empire - which encompasses the Fox television network, the Times and New York Post newspapers - MySpace has become the focus of investor attention due to its usefulness in testing new media opportunities. Attempts to earn revenue from social networking sites - a huge growth area on the internet - are being watched with avid interest: investors and competitors want to know how News Corp will recoup the millions it spent on MySpace. Last month rival social networking site Bebo overtook MySpace as the most popular online community destination in the UK, taking a 12.52% share of the market against MySpace's 12.28%. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
