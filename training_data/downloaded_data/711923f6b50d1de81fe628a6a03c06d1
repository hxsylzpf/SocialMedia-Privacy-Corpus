You've got a week and a bit to get your shit together, otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!\" Come back! Relax! Stop dialling the anti-terrorism squad, it's OK \u2013 they've got him! A week after the financial supervisor tweeted the above message to his 600 followers after a trip was jeopardised by heavy snow, the police arrested him under the Terrorism Act. This week he was found guilty of sending a menacing message, ordered to pay a \u00a31,000 fine and given a criminal record that will severely damage his career prospects. Which, unlike \u2013 abundantly, blindingly, dazzlingly obviously \u2013 the tweet, is no joke. Payback time Bill Clinton How do you fancy a day in New York with the good ol' boy himself? The chance can be yours for just $5 (\u00a33.40). Bill, right, is offering himself as a raffle prize as part of a drive to clear his wife's remaining campaign bills. She still owes $771,000 of the original $25.2m debt. At that price, I think I'd almost rather not have made it as a woman in a man's world. Then again, looking at our new cabinet, it doesn't seem to be something we British ladies are going to have to worry about for a while. Anyway. Bill has had to step semi-humiliatingly up because, as US secretary of state, Hillary is prohibited from raising the money herself. And also because, as we must remember, within certain marriages indebtedness \u2013 and payback \u2013 can take many forms. Give and take Ruth Ford and Liz Hiorns Hollywood actor Ruth Ford, who died last year aged 98, has left her \u00a35.6m fortune, including the art-stuffed Manhattan apartment in which she held salons attended by William Faulkner, Truman Capote, Cecil Beaton et al, to her Nepalese butler, who worked for her family since 1974. Liz Hiorns, 72, from Warwick, has been reunited with her beloved Jack Russell, Penny, after an animal rescue centre found and rehomed her with a family who initially refused to part with the dog. What international significance do these happy stories have? None whatsoever. But anything else seemed to furnish a reminder, however obliquely, that we now live in a country in which George Osborne is our chancellor. So I thought we'd concentrate on other things instead. You're very welcome. What they said \"It's all been really complicated. And to be honest, most adults don't understand what's going on.\" Newsround sums up the election for the CBBC audience and the rest of us \"Seven weeks ago, where was Andrew Stone? And all of a sudden \u2013 BANG! ... I'm basically giving birth to fame right now.\" Star of Pineapple Dance Studios and band Starman, Andrew Stone. What do you mean, you've never heard of him? \"Can you really trust the Liberal Democrats? They are behaving like every harlot in history.\" David Blunkett. Well, we shall see. What we've learned \u2022 Library borrowing rose by 1% last year to 310.8m books, the first increase in a decade \u2022 Joan Collins is to appear in Dick Whittington at the Birmingham Hippodrome this Christmas \u2022 Torbay and the Isle of Wight have topped this year's league table of places with the best beaches in Britain \u2022 More than 4,000 Australian fans queued overnight to see Justin Bieber in concert \u2026 and what we haven't \u2022 Who Justin Bieber is, quite",
