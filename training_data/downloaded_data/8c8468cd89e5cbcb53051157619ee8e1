  "content": "The Zbot or Zeus malware is a trojan \u2013 a program that comes disguised as one thing (such as an email attachment which says you need to click on it to reconfigure your email clients), but instead steals online banking details. Trojans are a serious threat to the security of users' machines: the cleverest prevent antivirus software from downloading updates that would catch it and wait silently until the user goes on to a banking, share-dealing or social networking site, at which point it will capture login details. F-Secure, a computer security company, noted that \"to gather more information, the malware author can even create additional fields, which are then injected into a targeted webpage for the unsuspecting victim to fill in\". The person in control of Zbot could capture enough information to steal unsuspecting users' identities completely. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for another security company, Sophos, called Zbot \"one of the most notorious pieces of malware to have been seen recently\" and explained: \"It's not just a single piece of malicious software \u2013 it's a family with many different members, all adopting different disguises in their attempt to infect users, and steal information that could allow hackers to break into your bank account and social networking profiles.\" It was first spotted by security researchers in February 2008. \"Once the bad guys have your bank account details they can raid your finances, if they have grabbed your Facebook or MySpace password they can use your account as a springboard for sending out more attacks to your friends and family,\" said Cluley. \"Furthermore, Zbot hijacks your computer, making it part of a criminal botnet\" \u2013 a network of computers under outside control used for attacks and spamming. The problem with catching the authors of malware is that they can inject their programs onto the net almost anywhere. It takes enormous patience to unpick the workings of the programs, find out who really owns the web locations that they send their data to, and capture the people who are stealing the data \u2013 which may have been sold on to other, organised criminals. Zbot is far from the last Trojan to target banking; the problem is with the security of the Windows operating system overall.",
