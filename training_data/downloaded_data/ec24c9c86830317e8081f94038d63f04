  "content": "The Daily Mirror has been given leave to appeal the ruling in the Naomi Campbell case, in the Court of Appeal, the paper's owners, Trinity Mirror, have announced. The paper intends to challenge all aspects of Mr Justice Morland's landmark decision, in which supermodel Campbell was awarded \u00a33,500 after the Mirror \"trashed her as a person\". \"We believe that the judge's ruling was fundamentally flawed and should be overturned. We will also be contesting his decision to award Miss Campbell her legal costs,\" said a statement from Trinity Mirror. Piers Morgan, the Mirror editor, said last week that he was keen to appeal against the ruling as there were \"important issues at stake\". \"We were very surprised a judge could say someone had lied on oath and still make us pay their costs, especially when everyone knew she had lied,\" Morgan said. Campbell took legal action after the Mirror published details in February 2001 of her attendance at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in King's Road, London. She was awarded \u00a32,500 for her claims for breach of confidentiality and breach of duty under the 1998 Data Protection Act, and an additional \u00a31,000 in damages because of a column by Sue Carroll, who described her as a \"chocolate soldier\".",
