  "content": "Cher claims her record label doesn't really care about her latest CD, allowing it to languish without serious promotion. Less than five months after the release of Closer to the Truth, the singer seems resigned to the album's current profile, tweeting, \"It's OK\". \"It's true [Warner Brothers] hasn't got a Great Deal of Interest In My CD,\" Cher wrote yesterday. \"Not ALL [the staff], THERE R HARD WORKING ADORABLE PPL. But Decision Makers Don't Seem 2Care That Much.\" Debuting at number 4, Closer to the Truth \u2013 Cher's 25th studio album \u2013 was her highest-charting UK release in more than two decades. Back in the US, it was her highest-charting solo album ever, selling 63,000 copies in its first week and peaking at No 3. But despite these billboard acrobatics, none of the record's singles have caught on outside the club charts. She was not nominated for any recent Grammys or other major prizes. Cher, who is 67, is clearly unfazed by the lack of major attention. \"YHSTLOM,\" she tweeted, a reference to her 2010 dance hit You Haven't Seen the Last of Me. She begins a 49-date North American tour on 22 March. Reading on mobile? Watch the video for Woman's World, from Closer to the Truth",
