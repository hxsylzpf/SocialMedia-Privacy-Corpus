  "content": "The latest comScore data is good news for Facebook, ranking the site as the sixth most popular website in the world with 275 million unique users each month. That exceeds the 200 million user mark that Facebook recently made public, but regardless of different metrics the trends are interesting here. Facebook now accounts for 4.1 minutes of every 100 minutes we spend online, which is a sign that we are using the site more deeply - or just getting lost because of that new design. The site accounts for more than 30% of all time spend on social networking sites, up from just over 12% a year earlier. Facebook has seen very strong growth in Europe over the past 12 months, ranked as the most popular social networking site in 11 of the 17 countries comScore monitors. The UK is the biggest of those, rising from 12.96 million unique users in February last year to 22.66 million in February 2009. Italy saw the biggest growth, up 2,721% year on year to 10.77 million users, while Spain grew 999% to 5.66 million. Facebook noticeably lags behind in Russia, where it ranks seventh among the most visited social networking sites and where clone sites including VKontakte, Moikrug and Odnoklassniki are very established. Facebook Russia launched in June last year but, as has been the experience of western companies trying to break into the Chinese market, the sector is dominated by established domestic firms.
