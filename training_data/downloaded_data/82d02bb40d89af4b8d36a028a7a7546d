  "content": "The anonymous Twitter user behind a parody account of a senior Daily Mail &amp; General Trust newspaper executive has been accused in a US court of email hacking, impersonation and defamation. Northcliffe Media, DMGT's regional newspaper division, claims that the person behind @UnSteveDorkland, a spoof account of its chief executive Steve Auckland, hacked into company computers and conducted surveillance on its employees. The publisher is seeking a jury trial and damages for alleged loss of reputation in California, where Twitter has its headquarters. Northcliffe, which publishes 113 regional newspapers in the UK, is attempting to unmask the person behind the anonymous @UnSteveDorkland Twitter account. The company has described the person's tweets as both obsessive and offensive. The anonymous Twitter user, named as \"John Doe\" in court papers, is fighting the legal bid and denies all charges against them. The allegations are laid out in Northcliffe's civil charge sheet, which was filed in a divisional court in San Francisco and has been seen by MediaGuardian. \"At least some of the information made public on Twitter by the Defendant was not known publicly, and on information and belief, the only way that such information could be obtained was by hacking into an email account at Plaintiff's [Northcliffe's] business,\" Northcliffe alleges in its charge sheet. The company claimed that the Twitter user published information apparently obtained from surveillance of Northcliffe employees and publicly disseminated detailed and highly sensitive information about those employees' personal lives. The person behind the @UnSteveDorkland account told MediaGuardian: \"I do, of course, deny all accusations of illegal conduct set out in this document.\" According to the legal papers, Northcliffe launched its action in California because that is where Twitter's servers are based. Twitter told the anonymous user it would hand over their personal information, including email and IP addresses, to Northcliffe by Wednesday. The Twitter user is understood to have instructed a lawyer in the US and is preparing to challenge the legal bid this week. The company filed its claim in the San Francisco division of the US district court in California. It was filed on 6 July on behalf of Northcliffe by the US-based intellectual property law firm Knobbe Martens Olson &amp; Bear.
