  "content": "Locating a man you've never met in an unknown apartment heaving with strangers sounds like a challenge, yet it takes me less than 10 seconds to spot Jim Haynes. As people mill around the open-plan kitchen, spilling out into the living room and the garden beyond, he is easily identifiable, perched on a stool, specs resting neatly on the end of his nose. Guests have been flooding to American-born Jim's converted artist's studio in the 14th arrondissement for more than 30 years. Every Sunday evening, he operates an open-house policy, cooking dinner for anyone who cares to drop by. All you have to do is call or send an email. You don't need to have any mutual contacts; those passing through for a night are as welcome as old friends. Most startling of all - in these credit crunched times - is that he doesn't charge but simply asks guests to leave a donation in an envelope (\u20ac25 suggested). I arrive expecting an informal dinner party, with a small group seated around a table, but instead I find the place packed with more than 70 attendees. \"I'm so glad you made it,\" says Jim, with genuine enthusiasm, after I make my way through the crowds to introduce myself. \"You needn't have brought anything,\" he adds, eyeing the bottle of wine in my hand. I discover teetotal Jim, 75, always provides not just food at his weekly gatherings, but also all the drinks - boxed wine, bottled beer and soft drinks. Profits from donations go to various artistic and social projects. Tonight's Indian theme sees mountains of chicken curry, dhal, raita and rice being dished out of huge vats, and it's surprisingly good considering the numbers they're catering for. Each week, Jim invites a guest chef, and their success has even inspired a cookbook on group catering, Throw a Great Party: Inspired by Evenings in Paris with Jim Haynes (iUniverse, \u00a39). Guests step up to the hob to be served, then find a place to perch - either on one of the chairs laid out in the garden or on a sofa underneath walls crowded with souvenirs and photos. I'm amazed by how approachable everyone is, whether they're a first-timer, like me, or one of the core of regulars. Here \"working the room\" involves no actual work, it seems to happen effortlessly. Guests' ages range from 20 to 80. I meet artists and scientists, locals and expats. Antonia, a British expat and tonight's guest chef, introduces me to a young filmmaker from Guadeloupe; an American pianist invites me to one of his recitals; and a local called Michael insists that next time I visit I attend his own open-house dinners, held every Saturday evening near Notre Dame (see meetup.com/TalkTime). Everyone here seems to have a story to tell. But could any surpass Jim's? Born in Louisiana, he spent his teens in Venezuela, followed by long stints in Edinburgh, London and Amsterdam before finally settling in Paris. I discovered he started an experimental theatre in Edinburgh, co-founded a magazine celebrating sexual freedom in 1960s Amsterdam, and has been called the \"godfather of social networking\" following his 1980s series of self-published People-to-People guides, which listed addresses of local people willing to help or host travellers. It seems Jim was setting the hospitality-tourism trend 20 years before the birth of CouchSurfing. With all this in mind, I expected some bolshie extrovert, holding court in the centre of the room. But Jim is the opposite: softly spoken and unassuming, possessing an interesting mix of unshockable worldliness and an appreciation of the simple things in life. (\"I've just had a lovely lemon tart,\" he writes in an email to me before we meet.) \"These nights began by accident,\" he tells me later, as guests begin to disperse (a typical Sunday night dinner runs from 8pm sharp until 11pm). In the mid 70s, a young American dancer knocked on his door and nervously explained that she had just arrived in the city. A friend had suggested Jim as a good person for any newcomer to know. It was quite an understatement. Jim immediately offered his spare room, and she offered to return the favour by cooking for him and his friends every week. Before long, these nights became legendary. An estimated 120,000 have dined chez Jim over the years, sparking countless friendships and even weddings. He tells me how he once introduced female twins from Suriname to two brothers from Edinburgh, and both sets ended up marrying. \"Sunday dinners: an ongoing story\" reads his website. Fancy being a part of it? Just drop him a line. Everyone's welcome. \u2022 To put your name on the list for a Sunday dinner call 0033 1 43 27 17 67 or visit jim-haynes.com. After over 40 years in his apartment,Jim plans to move in 2009 but he will remain in Paris and the Sunday dinners will continue. Details will be added to his website in due course. Eurostar (eurostar.com) runs from London St Pancras, Ebbsfleet and Ashford to Paris from \u00a359 rtn. 2binParis.com (+1 47 34 01 50) features about 120 B&amp;Bs throughout the city, with rooms from \u20ac35-\u20ac100pp pn. Come dine with me: More supperclubs Worldwide Like-a-local.com has a range of listings for places around the world where you can eat with locals, including a houseboat in Amsterdam, a roof terrace in Barcelona and a Porto apartment where the host serves wine from his own vineyard. From \u20ac36 per head. US The Ghetto Gourmet, an underground dining experience that started in Oakland, California, in 2004 has spread across the US. Meals are typically prepared by a professional chef on their day off at a non-restaurant location. Priced between $40-$100. theghet.com. US and Europe \"We're not a professional travel agency ... just a normal couple from Colorado with a big idea,\" reads the website for dinewithlocals.com. Their idea involves pairing travellers with hosts willing to invite them around to eat. It operates worldwide, but is most active in the US and Europe. Guests pay $46 for a two-hour dinner, out of which the host receives $30. London Last week Horton Jupiter served eight friends a nine-course Japanese-themed meal. So? So, the evening was dubbed The Secret Ingredient, the friends were paying (a tenner each) and he plans to make it a weekly event. The front room of his Newington Green flat is small but he's hoping to \"squeeze in an intimate table for two in the corner.\" Sounds too far up its own trendy east London backside? Maybe, but supperclubs like this are all the rage in the US, so Horton just might be on to something. Link to The Secret Ingredient's Facebook page at tinyurl.com/bqdbrw.",
