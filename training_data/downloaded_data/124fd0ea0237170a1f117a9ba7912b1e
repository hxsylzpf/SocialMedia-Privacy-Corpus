  "content": "Another reason, as if you needed one, to think twice before sending that tweet. Heat magazine has launched its first-ever Twitter awards, celebrating the \"joyful collision of celebrities and social media\". Categories include the obvious - funniest tweeter, best TV personality - and the not so obvious - coolest politician, best non-celeb and, er \u2026 best brand. There's also the \"lifetime achievement award for services to Twitter\", which is a dual-edged gong if ever we heard one. Presumably all the acceptance speeches have to be 140 characters or less.",
