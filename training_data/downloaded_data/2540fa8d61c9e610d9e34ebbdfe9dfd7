  "content": "The London Evening Standard today ran a front-page apology to the Duke of Edinburgh after publishing a story on Wednesday falsely alleging he was suffering from prostate cancer. The Associated Newspapers daily title agreed a deal with the royal family that was brokered by the Press Complaints Commission, after Buckingham Palace complained the inaccurate story had breached Prince Philip's privacy. The front page of today's early edition of the Evening Standard carries the headline \"The Evening Standard apologises to the Duke of Edinburgh\". A full apology on page 5 reads: \"In the Evening Standard of August 6 we stated that The Duke of Edinburgh had been diagnosed as suffering from cancer of the prostate. We now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition. \"We unreservedly apologise both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy.\" The Standard is also running the apology on its website. On Wednesday the palace complained to the PCC on behalf of Prince Philip after the Standard published its story, which was quickly denied by his press office. The PCC said the quick resolution of the complaint showed the press regulator could be more effective in resolving privacy complaints than if the complainant took legal action. \"This complaint reveals the clear advantages of coming to the PCC with complaints of privacy intrusion,\" the commission added. \"The process has been quick: the final settlement was negotiated less than 36 hours after the original complaint was made. In contrast with some legal actions, it has involved no further private details - which in this case would have related to Prince Philip's health - being released into the public domain. \"The apology has been prominent and proportionate. And the PCC costs nothing to use. The article under complaint has been removed from the newspaper's website and replaced with the text of the apology, which appears on the homepage and then will be archived permanently.\" On Wednesday, Buckingham Palace said it had been authorised by Prince Philip to \"confirm that the claim made by the Evening Standard that he has received a 'diagnosis of prostate cancer' is untrue\". \"We believe that the Evening Standard's front page story today titled 'Prince Philip Defies Cancer Scare' is a serious breach of Prince Philip's privacy,\" the palace added on Wednesday. Quoting unnamed medical sources, the Evening Standard claimed that Prince Philip, 87, was diagnosed with the condition while being treated in a London hospital for a chest infection in April. The palace said it was long-standing policy not to comment about the health of the royal family in response to rumours \"particularly during the quieter news months\". But the palace spoke out \"because the damaging story is now being reported widely\". Clause three of the PCC code of practice, which newspapers sign up to voluntarily, states: \"Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital communications. \"Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private life without consent.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.
