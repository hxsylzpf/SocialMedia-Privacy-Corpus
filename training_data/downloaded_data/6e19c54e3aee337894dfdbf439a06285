On Friday the Royal Opera House became the latest to blunder, finding itself at the centre of a social media frenzy after details emerged of its dealings with an independent classical music blog, Intermezzo. The blogger posted an email exchange she had with a representative of the ROH's legal department, which accused her of copyright infringement for putting up images of performances at the venue, threatening \"litigation and future exclusion\" from performances and from the venue's membership scheme. A public backlash ensued. The ROH's initial complaint is unclear, but seems to centre on press images downloaded from its website and displayed by Intermezzo without permission. Commentators have been speculating about whether there could be a possible argument for breach of contract over photographs taken by Intermezzo inside the building: this isn't explicitly alleged in the email, but it would contravene the ROH's fairly standard legal terms forbidding \"the use of cameras and recording equipment\". It could also be considered a breach of the artists' copyright, which usually gives them exclusive right to permit the recording of their work. Leaving aside the legalities behind these accusations, there's no doubt that the ROH's reaction displays a certain naivety about the mechanics of social media. The organisation is right to protect the copyrights of artists and photographers; it is the heavy-handedness with which it has done so that has caused offence on the web. After all, in an emailed response Intermezzo offered to label all such images as property of the ROH and pointed out that neither party makes financial gains or losses from their reproduction. As another blogger, Tim Rutherford-Johnson, eloquently puts it, \"the existence of a law has been misread as a compulsion to enforce it as forcefully as possible\". The ROH has since apologised to Intermezzo by issuing a \"statement of regret\", indicating that the company is aware of the potential damage a situation like this can do to its public image. The ROH is not the first arts organisation to pratfall, of course. In 2008 the then marketing manager of the Tricycle was criticised for posting a disparaging response to a review of the theatre's production of Loot by the West End Whingers. And only last month the National Theatre was accused of shirking responsibility after an expletive appeared on its Twitter feed (the theatre said its account had been hacked into but it was widely speculated online that an employee had posted the tweet, believing themselves logged in to their personal account). Whether arts organisations like it or not, social media is not going to disappear any time soon. More than ever before, audiences can and will have their say publicly. Venues cannot afford to go on the defensive or attempt to silence the chatter. Their choice is between letting it be and actively engaging with it. To engage with it is a twofold proposition, as the above examples illustrate. First, it concerns the manner in which the organisations represent themselves and, second, the manner in which they handle representations of themselves by others. On these channels we will not stomach, let alone buy, a one-way stream of constant hype, whether in the form of quotations from the press or retweeted reactions. Organisations must realise that opinions expressed on social media are not marketing nuggets in the traditional sense. Though \u2013 as the Whingers have proved \u2013 blogs can achieve authority of their own making, they are different to press reviews. They are not static judgments, but the active engagement of consumers. They are forms of participation. (One of the responses that followed Friday's incident was that Intermezzo was doing them a favour by promoting their product. That's misconstrued. The anonymous blogger behind the site was getting actively involved as a customer, and simultaneously encouraging others to do so. Such blogs are a useful resource but they do not set out to help.) Theatres must treat social media accordingly. Rather than using it purely as a promotional tool, they must become facilitators for such engagement and use it to encourage debate \u2013 not just present its edited highlights. That involves more than just inviting bloggers in, as the Lyric Hammersmith and the Arcola have started to do, or managing and appeasing negative responses. It means welcoming a culture of participation in which \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 everyone's a critic.",
