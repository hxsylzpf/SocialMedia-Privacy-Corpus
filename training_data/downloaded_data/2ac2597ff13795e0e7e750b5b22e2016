  "content": "As you will no doubt by now be aware, here at Guardian News &amp; Media in London, we're big fans of Twitter - we've written extensively about how it creates networks of interesting people, reveals fascinating and funny conversations, discoveries and coincidences, but on a personal level, we love it because it gives us something to do on boring commutes and in editorial meetings. In fact, in recent months it has become so widely used by members of the digerati, glitterati and the chattering classes, it's rapidly becoming an essential tool for journalists, celebrities and current-affairs fanatics alike. Earlier today, we announced an exciting new initiative to publish the Guardian exclusively via Twitter, which makes it easy to find and follow the quality content from our publication you're interested in, using the tools you're already familiar with. To make this possible, we've created an unprecedented partnership with Twitter to build a platform for publishing Guardian content on Twitter: We call it Gutter. This platform is a Guardian application, built using our new Open Platform and social APIs to deliver to users a clear, progressive-thinking signal amid the noise of millions of status updates about cheese sandwiches. As you might expect, the new service will feature updates (\"guts\") from all your favourite Guardian journalists and contributors such as Charlie Brooker, Jeff Jarvis, Alan Rusbridger and Emily Bell, and we hope that it will make the online social experience more challenging, well-meaning and intellectually stimulating. You'll be able to tune in to Gutter using the special tab you'll see appearing on most popular Twitter clients over the next few days, or by visiting the dedicated Gutter page on our site - keep your eyes peeled for trails in the paper and links to it online. But wait: there's more! Inspired by this unprecedented move to brevity in news reporting and features, we feel the time has come to change the way we approach commenting and opinion-sharing on guardian.co.uk We recognise that not everyone has time to read or write comments on blogs, and still others are put off by lengthy, well-reasoned comments on blog posts. Time and attention are precious, and we're keen to ensure that in these economically-tough times we encourage people to waste neither. To that end, we're pleased to announce that we've extended the initiative mentioned above and have successfully negotiated a tricky three-way relationship between the Guardian, Twitter and open-source blogging platform WordPress. Using groundbreaking technology, we've been able to craft a new highly-experimental commenting service which means we can bring the same spirit of brevity and focus to community participation as to our own journalism. Introducing GutterPress: a unique 140-character commenting system for news sites. You'll never again need to wade through paragraphs of extended argument, looking for the point, or suffer the unbearable tedium of having to read multiple protracted, well-grounded perspectives on the blogs you love. GutterPress encourages users to get right to the nub of the issue, using a maximum of 140 characters. Our motto for this new technology? If it can't be said in 140 characters or less, how can you put it on a placard? Inside Guardian will be the first blog on guardian.co.uk to use GutterPress to manage comment threads, and it'll launch in the next couple of days. Until then, please make the most of the 5000 characters which are currently available for commenting, and as ever, do let us know what you think.",
