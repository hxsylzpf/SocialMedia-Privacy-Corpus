  "content": "MySpace has launched a copyright protection tool that aims to prevent users reposting content that has been removed at the request of media owners. The launch of the free product, called Take Down Stay Down comes a week after YouTube became embroiled in its third lawsuit as the Premier League announced it was launching a class action over repeated copyright infringement. When a content owner informs MySpace that a user has improperly posted its content onto MySpace, TDSD not only removes it, but a digital \"fingerprint\" of the video content is created and added to MySpace's copyright filter. TDSD will be integrated into MySpace's content takedown tool for copyright owners, which includes audio filtering for illegal music uploads. \"We have created this new feature to solve a problem that has long frustrated copyright holders and presented technical challenges to service providers - how to prevent copyrighted content from being reposted by the same or a different user after it has been taken down by the copyright owner,\" said Michael Angus, the executive vice-president and general counsel of MySpace's parent company, Fox Interactive Media. The launch of the product will pile more pressure on YouTube and owner Google to introduce a similar product. They claim that the only responsibility they have is to remove illegal content upon request, not proactively filter it out. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
