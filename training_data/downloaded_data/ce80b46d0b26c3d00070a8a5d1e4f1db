  "content": "Internet bank Egg has alarmed some customers by telling them their personal information may be handed over to official bodies overseas - including those in countries outside Europe that have \"less stringent\" data protection rules. The bank also says it will use internet \"cookies\" to collect information. This week it emailed many of its savings customers to notify them about changes to its \"customer relationship agreement\" following the takeover of the bank by US financial services giant Citigroup earlier this year. Gina Cross, who lives in London and has an Egg mini-cash Isa, says: \"I may be over-reacting but there are some things in here that I'm not really happy about - especially that they will pass on my information to other interested parties, and also the point about cookies monitoring my use and purchases. It just seems very Big Brother. I'm thinking about closing my account.\" In the email, Egg says the changes it is making \"mean your data may be shared between Egg and other Citigroup Inc Group companies . . .\" One addition to the agreement that makes potentially worrying reading states: \"You consent to having your personal data transferred by us, or others processing on our behalf or their agents, to regulators, authorities and law enforcement agencies in other countries (including countries outside the European Economic Area having less stringent data protection requirements than those within it) if the disclosure is required by the laws or regulatory rules of those countries.\" Another change concerns the way the bank maintains an up-to-date picture of its customers and keeps them informed about products and special offers, including those from other companies. \"We may tell you about these, using a range of methods, including post, fax and electronic communications, such as SMS [text message], telephone, email,\" it says. Egg adds that the information it collects using cookies (small text files placed on your hard drive to store information) and similar tracking devices, will include details of payments into and out of accounts, including the name of an employer and shops they have bought goods from. Asked about the changes, a spokeswoman for the bank says the Data Protection Act allows it to transfer data outside the European Economic Area, as long as it ensures the data will receive the same level of protection. \"Many countries outside the EEA do not have centralised data protection laws, which means we cannot automatically assume the standards of data protection that exist in those countries meet our own,\" she adds. \"Egg therefore has a responsibility to check beforehand that any company processing data on our behalf in such a country has appropriate measures in place for handling data fairly and securely, and if not, to insist that they apply all necessary safeguards to bring their processing up to our standards.\" The spokeswoman says the bank has always used cookies, and has always informed customers of their use in the terms and conditions. She adds that Egg automatically obtains customer payments information as part of operating an account. Egg also ruffled feathers in September when Guardian Money told how it had altered its terms and conditions to allow it to halt withdrawals in the event of a run on the bank.",
