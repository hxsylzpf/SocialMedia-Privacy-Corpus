The publisher GDS International has invested $50m on Web 2.0 technology for MeetTheBoss, a high-end networking and community site targeted at financial executives. Founder Spencer Green launched the site this year and aims to register 50,000 members on the site before Christmas. MeetTheBoss has its head office in Bristol and mploys 77 staff, from sales to events and editorial. Members already include executives at Goldman Sachs, Wachovia, HSBC and Barclays. Green explains how he's funding the site through sponsorship, how video is incorporated into the site and how he plans to make the site an essential discussion platform for senior business people. MeetTheBoss founder Spencer Green \u2022 Explain your business to my Mum \"MeettheBoss is like Facebook but for company board members working in the financial sector. It is an exclusive, secure community and business tool on the internet they can use to network, share ideas and find answers to the fundamental challenges facing the financial industry - the credit crunch, for example.\" \u2022 How does that work? \"By logging on to the website, members can network instantly with their peers via video conference, email, SMS or instant messaging at the click of a button. Using its secure environment, closed to vendors and press, executives can communicate in a trusting arena, gaining instant access to thought leaders and advisory panels made up of leading analysts and chief executives in every key section.\" \u2022 How do you make money? \"Meettheboss has secured four current sponsors within the space who are gaining massive benefit due to the interactivity of the site. We have a non-partisan approach to the site to maintain open debate, so revenue streams will come from unobtrusive sponsorship and thought-leadership which will ensure the integrity of meettheboss.com.\" \u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months? \"We currently have 24,000 members. Membership is exclusive to board level executives in the financial sector and will be capped at 50,000 members which we aim to achieve by Christmas.\" \u2022 How are personalisation and recommendation part of your business? \"Our business thrives off creating niche, bespoke services to our clients. The creation of Meettheboss.com is a prime example of this. Finance executives attending our annual summits wanted a secure platform to continue to communicate post meeting. This grew as these executives recommended their internal management teams to join.\" \u2022 Name your closest competitors \"LinkedIn, Facebook and Xing.\" \u2022 What's your background? \"I founded GDS Publishing in October 1993 with the aim of specialising in industrial, government-led publications for the burgeoning Chinese market. Since then I have launched over forty business-to-business titles, events and online ventures; opened offices in Bangalore, Beijing, Cardiff, New York and Sydney. Our annual turnover is in the region of \u00a325m and we forecast growth in 2008 of 50%.\" \u2022 Any weird business experiences so far? \"I flew to China last month to meet with their Government Development Association regarding collaborations with Meettheboss.com. On arrival I was taken to the meeting in a well known sushi restaurant. I was served a traditional meal which translated to 'nine ways to eat fish', starting with cold fish porridge, then fish eyeballs and moving onto the skin. Knowing it would offend if I passed, I went for it. Watch out for the Meettheboss.com in Asia later this year...\" \u2022 Are we in the middle of a new dot com bubble? \"I would not say there was a bubble at all, the internet is more a paradigm and is still young. I read an article last week saying it is only 5,000 days old and within that time we have developed enough connections to mirror that of the human brain. We are still experiencing the early stages of the internet and are all learning its many benefits.\" \u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch? \"Kevin Kelly is a very exciting visionary - I get a lot out of his work. And Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales.\" \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? \"To provide opportunities to my staff and to keep them motivated and happy.\" \u2022 How's your work/life balance? \"Perfect. I work very hard but enjoy it. I am in the office five days a week and leave my weekends free to spend time with my young family.\" \u2022 What's the most important piece of software or web tool that you use each day? \"Google and Wikipedia.\" \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? \"We will have created an exclusive, walled online community for C-level executives in the financial sector. MeettheBoss.com will be the defacto business communications tool used by senior executives to share ideas and find answers to the most urgent questions facing the financial community.\" MeetTheBoss.com So what do you think? \u2022 Are you convinced by the sponsorship as the primary revenue stream? \u2022 Is it wise to cap membership at 50,000 to preserve exclusivity? \u2022 And is the MeetTheBoss model viable in the long term for busy executives? Hasn't the destination site had its day?",
