Are you super sure you want to import your contact information for your friends into a service that won't let you get it out? \" This is Google's new passive-aggressive front in its war against Facebook: a \"trap my contacts now\" page that you get redirected to if you try to export your Gmail contacts out, using the system that Facebook has implemented now that Google has removed the easy way of doing that (see Google halts Facebook data usage - so Facebook polevaults). In the history of passive-aggressive notes, this is quite a doozy from Google: \"Here's the not-so-fine print. You have been directed to this page from a site that doesn't allow you to re-export your data to other services [emphasis added], essentially locking up your contact data about your friends. So once you import your data there, you won't be able to get it out [emphasis added]. We think this is an important thing for you to know before you import your data there. Although we strongly disagree with this data protectionism, the choice is yours. Because, after all, you should have control over your data.\" You then get two checkbox options: \"I want to be able to export my data from Facebook. Please register a complaint on my behalf over data protectionism. (Google will not pass on your name or email address.)\" or \"I still want to proceed with exporting this data. I recognize that I won't be able to export it back out.\" We'll be interested to see how this one plays out \u2013 and whether Google gets a large number of people going with its protest.",
