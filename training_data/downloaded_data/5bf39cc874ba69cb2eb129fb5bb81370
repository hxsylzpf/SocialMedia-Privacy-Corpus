  "content": "NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden arrived on Twitter last week. Within half an hour of his @Snowden account launching, he'd beaten the 72,000 followers amassed by the only feed Snowden himself is following - that of the National Security Agency itself. He's currently on 1.2m and rising, while his first Tweet was, \"Can you hear me now?\" \u2013 a jingle used by US telecoms giant Verizon in television ads. He's right up there with our top 10 Twitter debuts\u2026 Celebrity trailblazer: @aplusk Actor Ashton Kutcher was one of the early Twitter celebs. In 2009, he opened with \"dropping my first Tweet\" and three months later, became the first to hit 1 million followers. He went on Oprah the same week to help Winfrey post her own debut: \"HI TWITTERS. THANK YOU FOR A WARM WELCOME. FEELING REALLY 21st CENTURY.\" Mum, turn your caps lock off. Shortest, sweetest greeting: @BigBird The 8ft 2in Sesame Street resident was a bird of few words, opening in February with: \"Tweet?\" Most confused debut: @snooki Jersey Shore reality numpty Nicole \"Snooki\" LaValle's first tweet back in 2009 was typically hapless: \"idk wtf im doing\". Most excited world leader: @POTUS He and the White House already had accounts but Obama wasn't given a presidential account until May and seemed chuffed: \"Hello, Twitter. It's Barack. Really! Six years in, they're finally giving me my own account.\" Earliest overshare: @robdelaney He found fame as \"the funniest comedian on Twitter\" but the Catastrophe star's first missive in 2009 was: \"I'm about to go onstage in Minneapolis. After I finish my tuna melt and go pee.\" See also @DannyDeVito \"I don't really get this site or how it works. My nuts are on fire.\" Most nail-biting start: @lordemusic The Kiwi singer-songwriter joined up in 2012 and opened with: \"i think my fingernails are too short to be a member of the twittersphere.\" Her nails now have their own spoof account, obviously. Most reluctant tweeter: @Drake The Canadian hip-hop star started in 2009 with a weary sigh of: \"Fine\u2026 you got me.\" Rivalled by comic book royalty @TheRealStanLee a few months later: \"I just signed on to Twitter today. Don't want it or need it, but don't wanna be out of the action!\" Sweariest opening salvo: @SamuelLJackson He dropped plentiful F-bombs in Pulp Fiction and life imitated art when the actor opened his account in 2011: \"Can-a muh fukkasay fuck on here?\" Fastest follower-gathering: @Caitlyn_Jenner In June, the reality star broke all records by gathering 1 million followers in a mere four hours. Her first tweet? A pic of that \"Call me Caitlyn\" Vanity Fair cover, followed by: \"I'm so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self.\" Most incomprehensible opening lines: @LilTunechi As Louisiana rapper Lil Wayne so sagely opined in 2010: \"im super new to this twitter shit but wudup tho !..follow me biot\u00a2h\u2026wudup mak\u2026happy bday LO...8 days of freedom..ym\". Riiiiight.",
