  "content": "On reflection, writing an article under the headline \"Pop's Poisonous Princess\" probably isn't the best way to elicit a cordial response. Thus, when word reached Rihanna of British journalist Liz Jones's essay in the Daily Mail about her unfitness to be a role model for young girls, Rihanna responded in kind on Instagram. Rihanna v Liz Jones? Here's how they weigh up: Character assessments Liz Jones on Rihanna: \"She promotes drug-taking, drinking and the sort of fashion sense on stage that surely invites rape at worst, disrespect at least \u2026 I wish she'd stop infecting our high streets with her gun tattoos, her false nails and fake hair, her bogus bad-ass shenanigans that try to portray her as 'real', as 'street', as her own person, as strong and single-minded \u2026 This poisonous pop princess should come with a government health warning.\" Rihanna on Liz Jones: \"If you sincerely wanna help little girls more than their own parents do, here's a toxic tip: don't be amateur with your articles, you sound bitter! What's all this about hair and nails and costumes and tattoos?? \u2026 That shit ain't clever!!! That shit ain't journalism! That's a sad sloppy menopausal mess!!!\" Real names Liz Jones: Elizabeth Ann Jones Rihanna: Robyn Rihanna Fenty Age Liz Jones: Some things are not always easy to put a number on, especially a person's age when a person has had a long career obfuscating it. 54? Rihanna: 25 Pets Liz Jones: Lizzie the nervous racehorse (no relation), dogs, cats (running into double figures at various points) and some \"high-maintenance\" sheep. Rihanna: Likes to paint her pet dog's toenails. Romantically linked with \u2026 Tricky one, this. Liz Jones: Claims to \"have only had three and a half boyfriends\", including Nirpal Dhaliwal (a relationship, marriage and divorce that were recorded in the Liz Jones Diary; Rock Star (a relationship that has been recorded in the Liz Jones Diary; Trevor (a relationship \u2026 I think you know this by now); an \"Osama bin Laden lookalike\". Hang on, that's more than three and a half. Something's not adding up. Rihanna: It's hard to be precise. Rumoured partners have included musician Travis Barker, actors Ryan Phillippe and Josh Henderson; baseball player Matt Kemp, basketball player Rashard Lewis, R&amp;B star Drake and Negus Sealy. And, of course, Chris Brown. More than three and a half, anyway. Previous spats Liz Jones: The people of Exmoor (after offending them in her column); Holly Willoughby, whom she accused of \"a betrayal of women\" after the TV presenter posted a picture of herself makeup-less on Twitter; the fashion industry (\"I've been barred from Armani, Louis Vuitton, Chlo\u00e9, Chanel, Marc Jacobs, Victoria Beckham \u2026\"). Fans of Clare Balding. Plus all her friends, whom she says she has lost by writing about them. Rihanna: Best stick to the past year or we'll be here all day. Reportedly, the US actor Amanda Bynes; Beyonc\u00e9; Ciara.",
