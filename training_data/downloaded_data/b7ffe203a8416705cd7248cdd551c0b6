  "content": "The Daily Mail's decision to publish a string of revealing images of the Duchess of Cambridge, including a pixellated image of her bare bottom, comes close to invading her privacy without ever stepping over the mark. The pictures follow the publication of images of the duchess's bare behind by German tabloid Bild and the Sydney Daily Telegraph. They accompany a column by Amanda Platell headlined \"Please learn to keep covered up, Kate!\" While acknowledging that Bild was wrong to publish the picture, Platell firmly blames the duchess for the incident. Platell writes: \"I couldn't help but think that surely Kate could have tried a little harder to keep her modesty under wraps? As a relatively seasoned member of the royal family, isn't it time she made more of an effort to cover up? \"After all, every woman \u2013 especially a public figure who is constantly photographed \u2013 knows that a light-weight fly-away dress and the merest threat of a breeze hardly marks the right occasion to wear the skimpiest knickers in your drawer.\" Platell then goes on to blame the duchess for her own naivete in being caught out on a number of occasions in revealing shots. \"Yes, it's all very well blaming the photographers but you are the future Queen. It's time you took control of this situation,\" Platell says. Meanwhile, a comment piece in the Sydney Daily Telegraph accuses the British press of honouring \"an antiquated code of etiquette\" by not publishing the image. The comment piece argues that it \"becomes difficult to argue the necessity of honouring 'do not publish' conventions when royals like Prince Harry are photographed cavorting naked in Vegas with buxom women\". While arguments will persist over the rights and wrongs of publishing, what seems certain is that the incident will inflame already tense relations between Buckingham Palace and the European media. These are already frayed after Italian gossip magazine Chi published pictures of the pregnant duchess while she was on holiday in Mustique in February last year. The royals took legal action against French magazine Closer after it published topless images of the duchess sunbathing in September 2012. But the duchess decided not to complain over long-lens photographs of Prince George published by Hello! magazine in February. With an inconsistent stance from the royals and the problems of fighting privacy breaches worldwide, the press \u2013 the Daily Mail included \u2013 seems destined to keep pushing at the boundaries of the couple's privacy.",
