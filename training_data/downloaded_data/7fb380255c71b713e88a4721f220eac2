  "content": "Radio 1 DJ Sara Cox is to sue the Sunday People and the photographer Jason Fraser under the European Human Rights Act, after rejecting an apology by the paper last week. Keith Schilling, who is to act for Ms Cox, confirmed that the TV and radio star has decided to issue proceedings against the paper, but did not wish to comment further on the decisions behind the lawsuit. But it is understood Ms Cox felt that the paper's apology, published last Sunday, did not go far enough to compensate her for the photographs, published the previous week. Ms Cox and her husband, DJ Jon Carter, were photographed at a private villa in the Seychelles by a photographer acting for Mr Fraser without their knowledge. The island, it emerged was also private, but the photographer took a room close to the honeymooning couple. The Radio 1 star was furious when she discovered that the photographers, and her agent Melanie Coupland, immediately complained to the press complaints commission about the photographs. The Sunday People acknowledged in an apology last week that Ms Cox and her husband were \"deeply upset\" by the photographs, which \"should not have been published\". Mr Schilling said a letter would be issued to the paper and separately to Mr Fraser, warning them of the intention to issue proceedings. The move raises the stakes in the war between newspapers and celebrities over snatched paparazzi shots. Celebrities have become increasingly quick to defend their privacy in the wake of the new European Human Rights Act. The actress Amanda Holden has invoked the act in an ongoing privacy lawsuit against the Daily Star. Meanwhile, model Naomi Campbell, who is also represented by Mr Schilling, has also invoked the act in a lawsuit against the Mirror, which published pictures of her leaving a narcotics anonymous meeting.",
