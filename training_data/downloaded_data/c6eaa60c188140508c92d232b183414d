The Japanese electronics giant confirmed on Thursday that it has restored access to the PlayStation Store in all markets except Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan. Sony was forced to shut down its PlayStation Network on 20 April after the attack, considered the biggest in internet history. Computer hackers broke into the PlayStation Network and stole personal data \u2013 including names, email addresses and some credit card numbers \u2013 relating to about 100 million online gamers. The network, which allows gamers to play virtually against each other, was reopened \u2013 albeit in a reduced form \u2013 on 16 May. Nick Caplin, head of communications for Sony PlayStation, wrote on the company's official blog on Thursday: \"I'm happy to confirm that PlayStation Store is open and you can now download content and redeem voucher codes. We will update you with the full lists of new content available to PlayStation Network members and PlayStation Plus subscribers here on the PlayStation.Blog in the next few hours.\" The \"Welcome Back\" gift to PlayStation gamers is in the \"final stages of testing\" and will be available \"very soon\", Caplin added. Sony has been roundly criticised for the way it responded to the hacker attack that rocked the electronics giant. The company did not notify customers of the security breach until 26 April \u2013 despite beginning an investigation into the attack on 19 April. Sir Howard Stringer, the Sony chief executive, hit back at critics of the company in May. \"This was an unprecedented situation,\" he said. \"Most of these breaches go unreported by companies. 43% [of companies] notify victims within a month. We reported in a week. You're telling me my week wasn't fast enough?\" Sony estimates recovery from the attack will cost about $173m (\u00a3105m), while its share price has plunged almost 10% since the shutdown of the PlayStation Network last month.",
