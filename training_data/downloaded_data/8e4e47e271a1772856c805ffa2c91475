  "content": "In the week we lost Richard Briers, one of the all-time TV comedy greats, confirmation of a new \u2013 and intriguing \u2013 addition to the UK's sitcom pantheon. Jessica Hynes, star of Spaced and Twenty Twelve, has written and will star in a new BBC4 comedy series about the suffragette movement. \"It's a kind of a character study,\" Hynes recently told an interviewer, \"and hopefully, on a good day, it will be a kind of female Dad's Army.\" The sitcom is set in 1910, and traces the unlikely politicisation of the Banbury Intricate Craft Circle. \"Margaret has been to London and discovered Women's Suffrage,\" runs the BBC's blurb, \"so she decides [the Craft Circle] need to set up their own movement.\" Rebecca Front and Getting On's Vicki Pepperdine will also star. From Dad's Army to some other old comedy troupers: John Cleese has got himself into hot water, by tweeting a not-very-good joke about Oscar Pistorius and the alleged murder of his partner Reeva Steenkamp. \"Oscar's defence,\" quipped Cleese, \"will be that he was absolutely legless at the time.\" Oh dear. As reported by the Mirror, the wisecrack met with well-deserved protest from Cleese's many followers, including @LevParikian, who tweeted, \"John Cleese broke a Twitter silence to make a Pistorius joke. My 11-year-old self, the one who fell in love with Fawlty Towers, is crying.\" Meanwhile, Ronnie Corbett has been telling the Daily Express that he wouldn't make it as a comedian starting out in 2013. \"There are so many standup comedians around now,\" Corbett observed. \"[And] people are on stage for a lot longer. I'd find that very wearing. The business has changed a lot.\" Alexander Armstrong, of \"and Miller\" fame, has called for new rules to govern viewers' complaints about TV comedy. \"I'd love a rule to be introduced,\" he told the Independent on Sunday, \"that you can only ring up and complain about a programme if you can prove you've watched the whole programme.\" Armstrong strongly defended a comedians' right \u2013 obligation, indeed \u2013 to offend in the pursuit of funny. \"People say outrageous jokes not because they believe them, but because there's something inherently funny about someone daring to say something that's unsayable.\" On Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross's \"Sachsgate\" affront of 2008, Armstrong added, \"appalling, over-the-line-stepping as it was, I could write a thesis on why they were doing something extremely funny.\" Elsewhere in comedy this week, Daniel Kitson announced, then almost immediately sold out, a new standup tour. Marc Lucero won the second Leicester Comedy festival silver standup of the year contest, for comedians over 55. Billy Connolly told the Scotsman that he once smoked dope with rolled-up pages from the Bible, and Sacha Baron Cohen was revealed to be Britain's highest-paid Hollywood star. Reece Shearsmith is to star as the great Patrick Troughton in his League of Gentlemen cohort Mark Gatiss's TV drama about the real-life origins of Doctor Who; and Minnie Driver will appear in a US comedy series based on Nick Hornby's novel About a Boy. And Frankie Boyle has shown his serious side, with an impassioned contribution to a campaign against plans to build flats on a green space site in the centre of his home town of Glasgow. Best of the guardian's comedy coverage \u2022 Ever Decreasing Circles, Roobarb and Custard, and Doctor Who: the career of the great Richard Briers in clips. \u2022 \"I would love to go back and have a strong word with myself\" \u2013 James Corden answers Weekend magazine's questions. \u2022 \"Could this be the point when cinema's trade winds stopped blowing west to east, and the reverse becomes possible?\" \u2013 Phil Hoad on Chinese cinema's answer to The Hangover. \u2022 \"I cannot think of any other UK comedy that is set in an ongoing conflict like this\" \u2013 the BBC's controversial new Afghanistan-set sitcom previewed. \u2022 \"You won't find a less innovative standup currently at work than Jason Manford\" \u2013 but Leo Benedictus is a fan nonetheless, according to this week's Comedy Gold review. Controversy of the week John Cleese isn't this week's only misguided Tweeter, but Ricky Gervais surely seizes the foot-in-mouth crown. The world was innocently \u2013 romantically, even \u2013 enjoying Valentine's Day last week, when Gervais took to the cyberwaves to drop his latest 140-character stinkbomb. \"Guys,\" proposed Berkshire's finest, \"show how much you love your wife tonight in the restaurant by buying a dead rose from the illegal immigrant who pops in.\" Oops. \"A tweet posted from the account of comedian Ricky Gervais Wednesday night is drawing strong and negative reaction from the Latino community,\" reported NBC in America the following day. \"The tweet comes at a time when public comments about 'illegal immigrants' are seen by many US Latinos as racist and insensitive.\" One Twitter user, Tony Hernandez, branded Gervais's joke \"ignorant and hateful\", and, within hours, Gervais had deleted the post. Now the website Latino Rebels is pushing the comedian for an explanation of the tweet and its later retraction. Gervais has yet to comment on the row, but he did later tweet the following: \"Don't let anyone tell u how u should be using Twitter. If they don't like it, they can unfollow, block, ignore. &amp; remember, u can too. Enjoy.\" Best of our readers' comments To some, he's the king of cine-comedy. To others \u2013 many of our readers among them \u2013 Judd Apatow is not funny at all. The Guide ran an interview with the man behind Knocked Up this week, and our readers queued to knock him back down again. Capoeiralover was among them: The problem with Apatow's films is I don't care about or like the characters. I'm clearly supposed to but I don't and too often he resorts to scenes which are just people screaming at each other \u2026 This is 40 was terribly self-indulgent. The husband's business was failing, as was the wife's, and their biggest worry was that they would have to downsize their palatial house. Nothing about them felt real \u2026 His films have some good jokes but they are very shallow. Rickylicious's comments were as close as we got to a robust defence: Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm low-brow. But I like his stuff. This is 40 drove me mad to start with \u2026 But I liked it all told, I think. 40 Year Old Virgin is still a favourite when I need a belly laugh \u2026 I'm in my early 40s and don't relate to wealthy people in a large house, or people who work in an electrical shop, or 20-year-old girls (I haven't watched Girls actually). But since when did I have to relate to every element of every character in every film? Apatow's characters are sweary, shouty, flawed, and regardless of their age or status in life, curiously real and generally affecting. To me, anyway. Great was the outburst of affection among our readers for one of comedy's real gents, Richard Briers, who died at the weekend. MalleusDeorum spoke for most of them when s/he wrote: The Good Life still holds up today. I meant to watch one episode last week and ended up watching an entire series, one after the other, because they are so brilliant. They were genuinely funny and the cast was superb: utterly professional. They all made it look effortless. I'm not sure there's any more to be said.",
