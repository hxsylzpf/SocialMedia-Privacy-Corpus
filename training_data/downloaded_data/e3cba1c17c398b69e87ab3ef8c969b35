  "content": "Digital technologies offer new ways of supporting those who use social services and their carers. From online personal support networks to meal sharing initiatives, technology can promote independence, diminish social isolation and address the issue of digital exclusion among disadvantaged groups. We need to think about how technology can help people to get the help they need. To do this, the care sector must gain a better shared understanding of how technological innovation has revolutionised the way services are accessed \u2013 the benefits and limitations. The use of technology in social care is not just about saving money. This approach can create strong social networks that give people a sense of belonging and support \u2013 sharing among groups their interests, aspirations and concerns. The recently published care bill prioritises people's wellbeing, needs and goals to ensure they no longer feel like they are battling against the system. This bill requires that information is available to everyone \u2013 so how can local authorities make sure this happens? Looking at the council's directories of care services it is clear that there is limited knowledge about the available online support networks and resources. Many local authorities do not have a digital engagement strategy and staff are often blocked from accessing social networking sites in the workplace. This makes it difficult to search for information about online resources. Those receiving social care, their families and carers are looking for trusted sources to advise about the products and the private and public services available to them. The information and advice councils offer needs to be much more dynamic and interactive. Rather than just providing an online directory of services local authorities must signpost the most effective resources. Here is a brief guide to some good online tools: Enabled by design: This is a community passionate about design for all: they believe that good design can support people to live as independently as possible. This is done by helping to make day-to-day tasks easier and more manageable. Innovative products and services are rated and discussed; very few local directories of care services include a link to this resource. Dementia challengers website: This site signposts carers looking after a person living with dementia to a wide range of online support services and resources. Mindings: Today's families often live apart, which can leave older members feeling socially isolated. People living with dementia are particularly vulnerable. Mindings enables families to share photos, text messages and social media content instantly from mobile phones and other platforms. Sharedwalk: Housebound individuals can explore the outside world with a friend, relative, carer or volunteer through Shared Walk, a new free internet and smartphone service. Dropby: Older people can join this friendly, caring and supportive online community which connects people over 60 with family, friends, each other and through interest and community groups. Casserole Club: This enables neighbours to share a meal and be more connected. Surely every locality should offer a food sharing network? We need digital leadership in local government that will promote collaboration and partnerships for social care to be improved. No one organisation has all the answers or resources. There needs to be different partnerships, which are likely to include care, health, housing, education, economic regeneration, charities, the private sector, social enterprises, innovators and entrepreneurs. With the right approach we can provide care more effectively supported by digital technology and allow people to live more independent and fulfilling lives.
