The supermarket decided to withdraw the bright orange adult Psycho Ward costume from its website after a flurry of consumer complaints. The costume had the word \"Committed\" printed on the back, while the accompanying description on the website exhorted people: \"Dress up as the most thrilling psycho killer character of all time in this Psycho Ward costume, consisting of a bright orange, long-sleeved boiler suit  with zip fastener to front, 'Psycho Ward' printed on the chest. The same words [are] printed on the back in larger letters with a prominent 'Committed' stamp just below.\" In a statement, Tesco said: \"We are really sorry for any offence this has caused and we are removing this product from sale.\" Asda had earlier been forced to apologise after it advertised a ghoulish fancy dress outfit, featuring a figure covered in blood and brandishing a meat cleaver, describing it as a \"mental patient fancy dress costume\". The Asda Halloween costume, which was designed to look like a ragged and blood-splattered jacket, was on sale for \u00a320 through the supermarket's clothing arm, George. Consumers and celebrities took to Twitter to express their disgust, among then the former footballer Stan Collymore, who has fought a well-documented battle with depression. He tweeted: \"Dear Asda, nice stereotype of mental patients \u2026 do you actually realise how many people are hanging themselves because of being frightened of the stigma? Wording is CLEAR. MENTAL PATIENT.\" The comedian Jack Dee tweeted: \"Just bought my Halloween costume. Going as managing director of Asda.\" Asda apologised for the incident in a series of tweets and said it would be making a \u00a325,000 donation to the Time to Change anti-stigma campaign run by Mind and Rethink Mental Illness. In a statement, the company said: \"We are deeply sorry one of our fancy dress costumes has upset people. This was an unacceptable error \u2013 the product was withdrawn immediately.\" An Asda spokesman declined to elaborate on the donation, saying only: \"This is a sincere gesture to apologise for the offence. We want to do this for the right reasons and not for publicity.\" Mental health groups condemned the retailers' decisions to stock the items in the first place, calling them insensitive and in poor taste given the scale of mental health problems in the UK. Paul Jenkins, chief executive of the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: \"I am pleased to see Asda has now removed the costume from their website, but the fact it was ever there in the first place is completely unacceptable. \"This costume is breathtakingly insensitive, and it's shocking that Asda ever felt it was an appropriate product to sell. There is already so much stigma surrounding mental illness, and 'joke' products like this only serve to make things worse.\" Sue Baker, a campaigner for the mental health charity Mind, said Asda had \"certainly crossed the line\" by tapping into such negative stereotypes. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Nine out of 10 people using mental health services in patient care report stigma and discrimination from a range of sources. \"Stigma and discrimination is unfortunately still really damaging in England today and this kind of myth of the dangerousness posed by people, that you should be scared of anyone who has used mental health services, is really damaging.\" Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said it welcomed Asda's withdrawal of a costume that could only serve \"to reinforce prejudice and misperceptions of mental illness, leaving those already struggling with mental health problems more lonely and excluded\". A number of traders on Amazon are selling a range of \"psycho\" costumes, designed for both adults and children. One, listed as a \"psycho costume\", consists of a white shirt covered in \"blood\", while another child's \"psycho surgeon\" set shows a shirt and trouser set smeared with red paint. Other examples of mental patient costumes for sale online, including one made by Smiffys, advertised online on the Jokers' Masquerade website for \u00a324.49 and described as \"Our creepy Women's Mental Patient Costume \u2026 the perfect choice for Halloween and even comes complete with a stuffed doll!\" Tony Blair's former communications chief, Alastair Campbell, who has suffered from depression, said that the costumes showed just how deeply embedded society's stereotypes about mental illness were. \"Those defending these costumes say they are a bit of fun and we should lighten up,\" Campbell writes in the Guardian. \"They are not a bit of fun. They are offensive. They commercialise prejudice and stereotype and they reinforce stigma.\" Campbell said the stigma about mental illness \u2013 at work, in the wider community or \"within the very culture of the NHS\" \u2013 had to be destroyed once and for all. \"Mental illness is just like any other illness,\" he wrote. \"Just because you cannot see it does not make it different. And stigmatising it takes us back to the dark ages.\"",
