  "content": "The junior reporter whose name appeared on the News of the World story about Kate McCann's private diaries has said he felt \"very bad\" about his involvement and apologised to the mother of the missing child. Daniel Sanderson said on Thursday that he felt uncomfortable with publishing the story but explained that he was \"a junior reporter\" who did not have the authority to make the ultimate decision on whether it should have been published. \"The whole thing caused me concern,\" he told the Leveson inquiry into press ethics and standards. Sanderson had been sent to Portugal to pick up the diaries from a freelance reporter and tasked with returning to the office to help verify they were genuine. He told Leveson he knew the diaries were \"private\" but was led to believe that the diaries would not have been published without the express consent of Kate McCann. \"A diary is clearly a private document but at the time this was being publicly circulated around Portugal. What the newspapers planned to do with the diary once we were in possession of that I didn't know that at the time,\" he said. The mother of the missing girl Madeleine McCann told the Leveson inquiry two weeks ago how she felt \"violated\" by the publication of her diary in the News of the World without her permission in 2007. Sanderson told Leveson he only heard three weeks ago when Kate McCann testified how she had felt. \"My understanding was that the news editor spoke to the McCanns' press secretary on a daily basis so in terms of getting the McCanns' consent that was a job for the news editor. The first time I spoke to the McCanns' press secretary was three weeks ago when I heard how it made Mrs McCann feel and to tell him that I intended to apologise. That's not just for this inquiry, it's because I'm genuinely sorry,\" he said. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
