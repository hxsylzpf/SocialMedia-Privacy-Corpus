  "content": "Remember the website the Treasury launched when it wanted to crowdsource (crowdslice?) spending cuts from Facebook users? Well, go there today and you get the following message: As you may have noticed, the site has been the subject to a small number of malicious attacks so we have unfortunately had to pause on the interactive features for now, but we're still keen to hear any further ideas you have, which we may publish at a later date Translation 1: We're being hit by malware and need to work on the security. Translation 2: We're canning it. Spending Challenge is effectively now a website that allows you to send an email to the Treasury. The name and its invitation for suggestions for spending cuts lives on (something Obama also tried). But the idea that this can happen openly and for all on the web to see is one that appears to be in hiatus. So let's take a moment to remember it. Spending Challenge shares/shared a design with Nick Clegg's Your Freedom website, a kind of Treasury bad cop to the deputy prime minister's good cop, who asked you which laws you wanted to see go (luckily for him, unluckily for satirists, David had already left). Both were received by the web in much the same way. On Your Freedom, contributions fit into roughly one of three categories \u2013 serious suggestions, \"colourful\" but serious suggestions (repealing \u2013 yes, repealing \u2013 the law that allows people to have more than two dogs) or ones very deliberately taking the piss. Because no government will ever repeal the second law of thermodynamics, no matter how many people on how many websites ask for it. Demands on Spending Challenge for a windfall tax on people called Steve will meet similar inaction (breathe out now if your name is Steve). But Spending Challenge, somehow, manages more offensive suggestions than Your Freedom. Clifford Sanger, the man behind MyDavidCameron.com, recorded some of them, maybe for posterity, in a blogpost last week. He introduces them as follows: Contributors to Spending Challenge give the impression that they have moved there directly from the Daily Express comments board. Many entries have little bearing on the government doing \"more for less\" and instead reflect personal hobby-horses, like the ubiquitous \"Bring back capital punishment\". Others are exercised by \"benefit scroungers\", such as the contributor who wants to sterilise young girls who \"just breed at will\". One of the most popular tags is \"immigration\". Entries here tend to fall into one of two categories: racist ranting written entirely in lower case. RACIST RANTING WRITTEN ENTIRELY IN UPPER CASE. It even made the Commons. The shadow Treasury minister, Angela Eagle, last week branded some of the suggestions \"racist and offensive\" and called on Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, to take the site down. So were the \"malicious attacks\" malware or calls to bring back the workhouses? Either way, you can see Spending Challenge was a moderation headache for the Treasury \u2013 if you don't deal with the disruptive or offensive suggestions the tone of the site deteriorates. If you do you and start selectively striking out the ones you don't like, you are going back on your stated intention to let the people have their say. In which case, I would like to add a third translation to the two above. Translation 3: There was so much crazy stuff on there that we had to stop you seeing any of it. Your Freedom, Clegg's site, struggles on but continues to suffer technical and moderation difficulties. The @HMGwebstatus Twitter account, which provides updates on when Your Freedom is and isn't working, yesterday announced it had temporarily suspended logging in \"due to a small handful of users posting offensive content\". Crowdsourcing is a difficult thing to get right.",
