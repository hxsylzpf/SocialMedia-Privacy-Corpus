The Observer can reveal that HMRC slashed the amount of 'statistical sampling' of the child benefit system, used to gauge the true picture of where some \u00a310bn of taxpayers' money goes each year, prompting concerns from the government's auditor that the department's data needed to undergo further checking. Given its fears, the NAO asked for the full list of benefit recipients, subsequently lost by the HMRC on two CDs, so it could test the figures itself. The revelation raises fresh questions about the government's command of statistics after the furore surrounding the immigration figures. It also places under scrutiny the government's decision to merge the Inland Revenue with Customs and Excise in a Treasury-led cost-cutting move that employees working in the embattled department believe has come back to haunt Gordon Brown. It emerged last night that HMRC was also looking for another lost package containing six discs. The package went missing in the post after being sent on 10 October from a tax credit office in Preston to its Whitehall HQ in London. The discs held recordings of phone conversations between an individual tax credit claimant and an HMRC helpline. And there was further embarrassment when the Scottish government admitted that a package containing the personal details of 200 people had gone missing in the post. The government said the loss of the package containing pension benefit statements was a 'serious matter'. Last week the Prime Minister was forced to make an unprecedented apology in Parliament after it emerged that personal data of almost half the population had gone missing. The name and address of one person is worth around \u00a360 on the black market, suggesting the value of the lost data runs into billions. It emerged a junior official had promised to post the two discs to the NAO in October but they had not arrived. Yesterday, in a further twist, it emerged the discs may have been dispatched by any one of three courier firms - TNT, the Royal Mail and DX - making tracing the missing data more difficult. Chancellor Alistair Darling had told Parliament that the discs were handled by TNT. Already more than 300 people whose details have been lost have contacted the civil liberties group, Privacy International, which is to sue the government for a breach of duty of care. But few have questioned why the NAO requested such a large amount of data in the first place. The Observer has established the NAO asked for the data as part of its audit of the child benefit system, so that it could be reassured the revenue's information was accurate. The Department for Work and Pensions, which oversaw child benefit payments before the revenue took on the job, sampled the details of 20,000 claimants each year to test the reliability of its data. But a letter from the National Audit Office confirms the auditor had doubts about HMRC's ability to provide a similar snapshot of the child benefits system once it took over from the DWP two years ago. 'We concluded that the existing approach ... would no longer provide us with the necessary independent evidence that we would need to support the ... audit,' the letter states. In a private briefing to members of the Public Accounts Committee last week, Sir John Bourn, chairman of the National Audit Office, and Caroline Mawhood, assistant auditor general, said that since HMRC had assumed responsibility for the child benefits system, the size of the sampling had been cut by 90 per cent. The revelation astonished MPs. 'When the DWP tested the child benefits system we were told they used to sample 20,000 cases a year,' said Edward Leigh, chairman of the committee, who was at the briefing. 'When the Inland Revenue took it over they sampled just 2,000 names. The NAO felt this wasn't good enough and the rest is history.' Leigh said the government must shoulder some responsibility for merging two organisations that had lost sight of some of their core goals. 'HMRC was not so much a merger of Customs &amp; the Inland Revenue,' Leigh said. 'Instead it created a benefit-dispensing organisation that tried more and more to cut corners.' Last week staff at the beleaguered HMRC offices in Washington, Tyne and Wear, from where the missing discs were dispatched, said they had been made scapegoats. 'We are being blamed for the incompetence of others higher up the food chain,' said one woman who has been a civil servant for 20 years. There is also disgust among staff that a junior employee, believed to be a 23-year-old administrative officer now staying at a secret hotel location, is being blamed for the fiasco. An email trail shows senior managers within HMRC were aware of the NAO's request for the data that went missing. 'We know it wasn't just a junior official who was involved,' Leigh said. 'Senior officials were copied into the emails.' Last week's fiasco has raised questions about Brown's decision to merge Customs &amp; Excise with the Inland Revenue. Since the merger the government has targeted job cuts of 12,500 from the 100,000-strong workforce in a bid to make efficiency savings. Unions say job duplication has meant many experienced people have left. 'This incident has served to highlight the pressure that people are under in Revenue and Customs,' said Alex Flynn, a spokesman for the Public &amp; Commercial Services Union which represents HMRC staff. 'It's a very target-driven culture where the emphasis in terms of dealing with inquiries is more in terms of quantity rather than quality.' On Friday evening police finished a week-long search of the HMRC offices, and yesterday 47 officers from the Specialist and Economic Crime Directorate moved their inquiry to the premises of the courier company TNT. Last week's glaring security lapse is now set to raise concerns about other key government projects involving personal data collection. The government's credentials have not been helped by the revelation that its departments have lost nearly 1,987 laptops over the past decade. 'Given the numbers of computers lost, it is almost inevitable that confidential information - including personal data - would have fallen into the wrong hands,' said David Gauke, the Conservatives' shadow Treasury Minister who unearthed the information in a parliamentary question. 'These figures suggest that there is a long-standing failure throughout government to protect confidential information.' In a sign of how nervous the government is becoming, it has announced an independent security check on a Whitehall database carrying details of every child in England. The \u00a3224m ContactPoint system was set up in response to a recommendation of the inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbie, in order to make it easier to co-ordinate the efforts of different agencies involved in child protection. But a survey released by the children's rights director for England, Roger Morgan, found widespread concern that the database could increase the likelihood of the details of vulnerable children falling into the hands of paedophiles. And not surprisingly, critics are seeking reassurances over the government's ID card system. The Information Commissioner's Office, which is already investigating HMRC over data breaches involving missing laptops and the lost records of some 15,000 Standard Life customers, has also expressed concerns about the government's desire to amass so much information on every British citizen. 'We would hope events have raised questions about the centrality of the ID card database; does all that information really need to be there?' asked David Smith, the deputy information commissioner. The government has performed a humiliating U-turn, ceding new powers to the ICO to allow it to conduct random searches of public departments that hold personal data. So far, however, the government has not agreed to grant the ICO similar powers to investigate private organisations that hold large amounts of personal data, such as healthcare providers or banks. This failure, Smith argues, means it can do only half its job. Once an interim independent review into what went wrong last week concludes in December, it seems likely the government will overhaul the Data Protection Act to introduce a new criminal offence for public officials who send data 'recklessly'. 'We are considering urgently the information commissioner's more recent request to make urgent change to the law to make security breaches of this magnitude a criminal offence,' a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said.",
