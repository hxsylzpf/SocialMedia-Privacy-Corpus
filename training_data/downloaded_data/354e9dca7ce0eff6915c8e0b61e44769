  "content": "In theory, yes. In practice, it's very unclear, and has turned into an online cause celebre ranging two security experts, David Maynor and Johnny \"Cache\" Ellch, against pretty much the whole of Mac-dom, including high-profile Apple enthusiasts and Apple Computer itself. To recap. At the start of August Brian Krebs of the Washington Post wrote a blog post (tinyurl.com/khpvg) titled Hijacking a MacBook in 60 seconds or less, about a video showing Maynor (who works for a security company called SecureWorks) and Ellch plugging a third-party Wi-Fi card into an Apple Macbook, and apparently hacking into it wirelessly from a Windows machine. Why use the third-party card rather than hacking Apple's internal Wi-Fi drivers? Because, Maynor implied, he wanted Apple to have the details of the weakness first, to patch it - a common practice in security circles. However, he added: \"We're not picking specifically on Macs here, but if you watch enough of those Get a Mac commercials, it eventually makes you want to stab one of those users in the eye with a lit cigarette or something.\" Apple users lined up to return the compliment, furiously questioning Ellch, Maynor and Krebs's integrity. Apple insisted the demonstration did not relate to any flaws in the Wi-Fi drivers on Apple's system. It said SecureWorks had previously told Apple about a flaw in the Wi-Fi drivers used in FreeBSD, the form of Unix that is a basis for its OS X operating system. That flaw \"was not exploitable\" on any Mac products. But Apple then launched its own internal investigation of its Wi-Fi drivers - and found exploitable flaws. It issued a patch for them two weeks ago. With Maynor and Ellch due to give a demonstration at another security conference on Saturday, everything seemed set for a conflagration. Then SecureWorks told Maynor to stay away. And Apple and SecureWorks declared that they were \"working together\" on \"any reported security issues\". A furious Ellch said: \"The fact that SecureWorks and Apple managed to compel [Maynor] not to [appear] means that they must have had something very compelling to stop him.\" His job, perhaps? Occam's Razor suggests the following: Maynor and Ellch found a generic flaw in the way that Wi-Fi drivers work. But they didn't demonstrate it on Apple's systems in a way that Apple accepted. Apple fixed one set of flaws; others probably remain. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com",
