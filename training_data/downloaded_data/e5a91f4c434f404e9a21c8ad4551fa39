  "content": "Almost two-thirds of Britons do not want to be bothered by big-name brands on Facebook, Twitter and other social networks, according to a survey. The survey of more than 72,000 internet users indicates that Britons are less susceptible to online marketing messages and corporate blogposts than web users in other countries. In the UK, 61% of internet users do not want to engage with brands on social networks, according to the research firm TNS, compared with 57% across other developed countries and a low of 45% in Latin America. However, the research highlighted a big digital divide in attitudes towards the cost of internet access. Almost half of people in fast-growing markets \u2013 including Egypt, Nigeria and India \u2013 said they would use the internet more if it was less expensive. In Africa, 81% of respondents in Ghana and 71% in Nigeria agreed with this. One-fifth of the 2,093 Britons in the survey agreed that social networks are a good place to buy products, compared with the global average of 40%. A further 60% did not agree that social networks were a good place to learn about brands. The Digital Life study was carried out between June and September this year by TNS. The study comes as brands including Pepsi, Burberry and Tesco, are spending millions of pounds in an attempt to drive new business by engaging people online. Facebook is expected to generate $2.8bn in advertising revenue in 2012, according to research from eMarketer, while Twitter is expecting to pull in $234m. Google, which makes most of its money from advertising against search results, is forecast to generate $16.5bn in ad revenue next year, according to eMarketer. Web users in fast-growing markets are more open to engaging with brands on social networks, according to the survey. Only a third of Columbians and 37% of Mexicans said they would prefer not to be bothered by brands \u2013 compared with 61% of Britons \u2013 and 59% of users in fast-growing markets said social networks were a good place to learn about companies and products. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
