Fellow MPs raised the issue of press intrusion at Labour's weekly parliamentary meeting yesterday morning, attended by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell. Intrusion is already the subject of an inquiry by the select committee on culture, media and sport, chaired by Gerald Kaufman, a champion of statutory controls. The Sun's front page and two inside pages cloaked the story with a \"public interest\" defence by claiming \"security issues\" were involved: Mr Betts, 53, had sought a Commons pass for Jose Gasparo, 20, who is pictured on a website offering escorts to men. The paper claimed he was a potential risk - even though passholders are vetted in a procedure overseen by the Metropolitan police. Party sources said last night that Mr Betts had dropped the application for Mr Gasparo's pass before the story broke. \"Security\" is an old excuse for what otherwise appear to be intrusive stories. In 1989 Labour MPs used claims of a security breach to discuss the affairs of a former Miss India, Pamella Bordes, who had a pass issued by one Tory MP but worked for another, while having Libyan links. Notoriously, Harold Wilson raised the Profumo affair as a matter of security because the defence minister's mistress was also mistress of the Soviet military attache. The Sun's defence, however, was widely seen as flimsy. On Tuesday, hearing evidence on the merits of a privacy law from lawyers and newspaper executives, Mr Kaufman pointed out that the New York Times had a policy of not outing a politician unless he had made anti-gay remarks in the past. Mr Betts has always supported gay rights, and many friends and colleagues knew he was gay. Many in the newspaper industry expect Mr Kaufman's committee eventually to recommend some form of statutory \"backstop\" control - although a privacy law would almost certainly be rejected by ministers. Ms Jowell has set the government against bringing the press complaints commission (PCC) under Ofcom, the broadcasting and telecommunications regulator that starts work next year. There is a feeling, however, that the PCC will have to submit to external auditing. Presenting its annual report to the press yesterday, PCC director Guy Black said he would be prepared to be questioned in public annually by the select committee, as are the BBC's governors. He pointed out that more than 90% of complaints on privacy come from the public, and 50% of all privacy complaints relate to local, regional, or Scottish newspapers. The report shows the PCC dealt with 2,630 complaints last year, down slightly on the previous year's record, but up on the average of 1998, 1999 and 2000. The code was found not breached in 711 cases; 1,052 were resolved or not pursued (for example, if a paper agreed to publish an apology); and 36 went to a full adjudication, of which 17 were upheld. Michael Tugendhat QC, appearing for Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas in their high court privacy action against Hello! magazine, warned against a privacy law at the media committee on Tuesday. \"We must never underestimate the asset we have in the free press; and one of the consequences of that is that sometimes it gets it wrong.\"",
