  "content": "The first panel at the media140 conference looked at how Twitter and micro-blogging were affecting journalism \u2013 the questions that Pat Kane raised about how real-time information services and platforms such as Twitter were providing challenges to news. Jon Gripton, online news editor at Sky News, defended appointing a Twitter correspondent. He said that Twitter had already changed how they gather news. But, he added, \"There is no mystery or mystique for us.\" For us, it is effectively another news feed. It helps us source eyewitnesses and photos and other people who are on the scene of an event. He compared it to the Press Association. Fellow panelist Mike Butcher from TechCrunch Europe challenged Gripton on that point. \"The difference to PA and Twitter is the difference to looking at a newspaper front page and the ocean,\" he said. Technology writer Bill Thompson and Butcher also took issue with the idea that Twitter was just another news wire. \"Twitter is not about journalism,\" said Thompson, comparing journalists to parasites who viewed Twitter as \"just there to serve our needs\". Thompson said that this wasn't really about Twitter but about real-time news. And Butcher said that five years ago, they would have been talking about Technorati, at the time a pioneering blog search engine. It was a reality check that in the web 2.0 world, trends and companies come and go. The panel also discussed how to maintain standards in this age of real-time news, as time pressures increase and staffing levels decrease. Butcher said that the community would quickly call him out if he reported something inaccurately, but BBC technology correspondent Darren Waters was uncomfortable with what he saw as simply turning over fact checking to the audience. He said it was the old \"don't be wrong for long\" model of rolling television news. The BBC was still struggling with how to deal with Twitter, Facebook and other forms of social media, Waters said. The BBC does have a user-generated content hub, which assesses not only comments and photos that come into the BBC but also information on Twitter and elsewhere on the web. However, Waters said that the BBC is still struggling with the editorial policy implications of social media. \"We aren't sure the audience is ready to see a BBC journalist's personal Twitter feed,\" he said. And when tweets are sent out under professional auspices, he said, they must be seen by a second pair of eyes. Thompson said that staff using Twitter personally must raise all kinds of issues for the BBC, and he asked whether social networking platforms \u2013 which blur the personal and the professional \u2013 affect audiences' sense of journalistic objectivity. It was like pulling back the curtain and seeing the wizard, he said. That raised a question as to whether journalists had to maintain distance to maintain a sense of objectivity, or whether journalists building a connection with audiences actually increases a sense of possibly not objectivity but at least authority and trust. Waters also was concerned that news organisations shouldn't be overly dependent on one platform, like Twitter, especially as Twitter was still struggling to develop a business model. The first question from the audience was about what Twitter would do to make money. Butcher pointed to reports that Twitter was planning on selling tools to businesses, and panelist Nick Halstead of Tweetmeme said that Twitter would also charge businesses for tools that allowed them to monitor how they were being discussed on the service. One of the questions that keeps bubbling up at this conference is how journalists would make a living in this future. The specific question for this panel was how journalists would be trained. Butcher said that the BBC was starting to groom rock star correspondents like its business editor Robert Peston. He said that journalists needed to move to a model that he called entrepreneurial journalism, where they actively developed their own profile and name recognition. If editors are choosing between two job candidates \u2013 one with a little experience and no blog or social media profile, and another with slightly less experience but a large following because of their blog \u2013 they will choose the blogging journalist.",
