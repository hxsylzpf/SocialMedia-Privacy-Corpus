  "content": "People are watching more television, reading more news, playing more video games, spending more time updating their social networking profiles and using more video on demand services than they were six months ago, according to a new survey published today, but their actual spending has plunged as increasingly consumers expect free access. Spending on 'traditional' media such as newspapers and magazines has dropped almost 20% in the last six months, while spending on digital media has almost halved. The most dramatic drop in spending on traditional media \u2013 rather than consumption of media \u2013 is in newspapers, according to the latest KPMG Media and Entertainment Barometer. Over the past month, the survey found that 21% of newspaper readers polled paid nothing for their title, compared with 15% six months ago. In London that figure almost doubled \u2013 to 41% from 23% \u2013 as a result of the Evening Standard going free after its acquisition by Alexander Lebedev. KPMG, which commissioned YouGov to examine the media consumption among more than 1,000 people, discovered that the situation is similar for print magazines with 19% of readers saying they had paid nothing over the past month compared with 12% six months ago. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp empire is hoping to reverse the trend towards free news with the introduction of paywalls around The Times and The Sunday Times in June, but the survey will give supporters of such subscription services few causes for celebration. More and more people are saying that they do not pay for news: 88% of consumers polled in March said they got their online news free, up from 84% in September 2009. The survey also found that only 10% of people who do not currently have a subscription \u2013 either online or offline \u2013 to a media product anticipated possibly becoming a paid subscriber over the coming 12 months. The survey did find that those aged between 16 and 24 are more likely to pay for online content than their older counterparts, but that is mainly because of the types of content that people would part with their cash to receive. People who said they would definitely or possibly become a paid subscriber over the coming 12 months were most commonly prepared to pay for music \u2013 55% \u2013 and film \u2013 45%. They were less prepared to pay for TV \u2013 30% \u2013 and online newspapers/magazines \u2013 31%. Consumers are giving more of their time to media \u2013 both online and offline \u2013 but expecting to receive more and more of it for free. As a result, media companies increasingly need to develop business models that take advantage of the fact that their product grabs valuable time from people, and monetise that time more effectively. In its six-monthly barometer, KPMG found that the average spend per UK consumer on traditional media fell from \u00a39.19 in September 2009 to \u00a37.46 in March 2010 and spend on digital media dropped from \u00a31.99 to \u00a30.98. Time spent consuming media, however, has ballooned. The average monthly consumption of traditional media rose from 11 hrs 40 minutes in September last year, to 12 hours 13 minutes in March. Hours spent consuming digital media increased even more, from 6 hours 14 minutes to 7 hours 28 minutes. In digital media, spend on video games was significantly down, possibly reflecting the release of popular titles last summer which gamers are still enjoying. \"The findings of the second KPMG Media and Entertainment Barometer illustrate the problem faced by the media sector in curbing the structural decline in revenues,\" said David Elms, Head of Media, KPMG UK commented. \"However, online users are increasing.\" \"There is considerable focus on driving digital media revenues. Respondents indicated they do access more media because of online availability, but the tide has not yet turned, as the majority still prefer consuming media offline.\" The survey found that only a quarter favoured online media access compared with 43% who preferred reading offline and a third that said it didn't make a difference. \"Creating integrated business models which make the most of both traditional and digital business models is therefore key for the sector,\" said Elms. Online, social networking and blogging remains the most popular pastime with half of all respondents doing it compared with 47% six months ago. The big jump in usage most recently has been among 45 to 54 year olds, increasing from 37% to 45%. The research was conducted with members of YouGov's online panel between 11th and 14th September 2009 and 15th and 18th March 2010. Surveys sampled people aged 16 years plus in the UK. Data was subsequently weighted to this profile.",
