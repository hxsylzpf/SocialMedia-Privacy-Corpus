  "content": "What do you do, as a campaigner for libel reform, when a litigious millionaire calls you a liar? This quandary was presented to me last week when the Twitter account of Gillian McKeith \u2013 or to give her full medical title, \"Gillian McKeith\" \u2013 called my book Bad Science \"lies\". Now, first, there is little doubt that this is actionable, and basically undefendable. \"Lies\", I know from seven years of exposing dodgy claims, is one word you never use in England: even if you can show that someone was obviously wrong, even that they probably knew they were wrong, you still need to show that they deliberately distorted the truth, and that's almost always impossible, without direct access to their thoughts. So I have a strong case against the litigious millionaire, and a reasonably good reputation for honesty to defend. And although I believe libel laws stifle debate in science at great risk to public health, there's no issue of science here. But I've always believed that in most cases a simple correction, with the same prominence as the initial libel, should be sufficient. That's why I contacted @gillianmckeith to ask: could she please just tweet \"Bad Science by Ben Goldacre is not lies.\" That would be fine with me. But by now all hell had broken loose. @gillianmckeith's Twitter feed was filled with the abuse of a random passing Twitterer, and long tweets explaining how Dr McKeith's PhD from a non-accredited correspondence college was entirely valid. Then they all disappeared. The tone shifted: instead of first person stuff about Gillian's life and family, lots of third person PR tweets appeared. Then they disappeared. Then, as more than 1,000 people were tweeting about her, making it the top trending topic on Twitter, @gillianmckeith announced \"do you really believe this is real Twitter site for the GM?\" Yes, replied the geeks. The Twitter account @gillianmckeith is linked to gillianmckeith.info, explained some. Then that link was deleted. Ah, explained others: only half-deleted. If you look at the \"source code\" for the page, the link is there, just temporarily inactivated. And that Twitter account is still linked from gillianmckeith.tv, Gillian's YouTube page. Yes, we believe this is the real Twitter site for the real Gillian McKeith. So if you're going to play silly buggers online, at least do it competently. And don't call investigative journalists liars. You never know: we might sue too.",
