In a damages hearing, which is the sequel to a lengthy high court battle against Hello! earlier this year, the Douglases hope to win \u00a3500,000 in commercial damages plus an extra \u00a350,000 each for personal distress. OK! is seeking an additional \u00a31.75m. Michael Wilson QC, representing the Douglases and OK!, argued they should be awarded a \"very substantial figure\" to demonstrate that Hello! was in the wrong when it published unauthorised wedding photographs of the couple. \"The need for such a direction is illustrated graphically by the fact that even the court's reasoned judgement of the trial was distorted and spun in such a way as to convey the false impression that the claimants' rights had been infringed,\" Mr Wilson argued in documents submitted to the court. Mr Wilson cited a front-page headline in the London Evening Standard on the day of the judgement which read: \"Zeta Jones loses her claim for privacy.\" Mr Justice Lindsay ruled in April that Hello! had breached commercial confidence by publishing sneaked paparazzi photographs of the couple's wedding. The Douglases licensed the right to their wedding pictures exclusively to OK! for \u00a31m. However, British paparazzo Rupert Thorpe gained unauthorised access to the event and took photographs he later sold via an intermediary to Hello! for \u00a3125,000. Mr Wilson today told the court the Douglases had suffered \"real personal distress\" over the snatched photographs. He said it was \"rather like a burglary - your possessions are stolen and their value gone and, at the same time, you feel a sense of personal invasion of privacy and real distress quite separate from the value of your possessions, which have now disappeared\". Mr Wilson said the couple had taken enormous care to preserve their privacy at the wedding and their \"sense of euphoria was suddenly shattered\" when they realised Hello! possessed pictures taken during the event. The hearing, expected to last 10 days, will also decide how much the couple and OK! are awarded to cover their legal costs. Both sides in the case are thought to have racked up about \u00a31m in legal costs. \"We say it would not be unreasonable in the extreme circumstances to award each of them \u00a350,000 by way of damages for their personal distress,\" he said. Mr Wilson then moved on to commercial damages, which he suggested could be set at \u00a3500,000 - the notional amount the couple would have charged Hello! to use the pictures. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857",
