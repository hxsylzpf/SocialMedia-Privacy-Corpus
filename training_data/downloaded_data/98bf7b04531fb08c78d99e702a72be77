  "content": "Of late we've been talking a lot at the Guardian about \"mutualisation\" - lowering the barriers between our readership and journalists, cultivating an active community of readers who look at data, and help to crowdsource datasets such as MPs' expenses, adding context and richness to our content and topics through participation. Recently we were contacted by Twitter about their new @anywhere service and were challenged to see how we might be able to use it. We immediately wondered how we might be able to use the service to lower the traditional barriers between journalists and their readers and reducing the frictions around asking questions of parliamentary candidates in the election. So we had a play with @anywhere and have prototyped a couple of nifty integrations in time for the @anywhere launch at Twitter's Chirp Developer conference taking place this week in San Francisco. Politics Given all the current interest in the upcoming UK general election, we thought it might be interesting to build something which brought together content about a parlimentary candidate (on our politics pages) and the ability to contact them directly if they are active on Twitter. Using our Politics API and a list kindly provided by Tweetminster we made a prototype where a user can tweet a candidate from within a politics page. Technology The use of Twitter by our technology journalists, in particular Charles Arthur and Jemima Kiss is well known. They've used it for conversing with the audience, crowdsourcing knowledge from their followers and breaking new stories. Their use goes beyond social distribution, but we wanted to think about the readers who take the story beyond the Guardian's site and become co-distributors of the content. Revealing the ad hoc interest group which forms around a story (\"people who tweeted this story\") brings readers' discovery and sharing of our content much closer to the content itself, and can provide additional jumping off points into Guardian content. To build this proof of concept, we used Google AppEngine as an assembly and persistence layer. We used the Backtweets API to gather in who had talked about an article and used our Content API to find out pertinent details about an article such as the contributor tag, byline and title. We could then mash all of this up with an internal list of Guardian journalists to build a control which lets the @anywhere connected user follow the journalist from the page if they're not already following. A reader can also tweet a story from within the page itself, plus find out more about (and follow!) the Twitter users already talking about that article by looking at the hovercards. At this stage, these integrations are just prototypes, but they clearly demonstrate what's possible when we combine @anywhere with our API. We'll share code when it's possible to do so, but in the meantime, let us know what you think.",
