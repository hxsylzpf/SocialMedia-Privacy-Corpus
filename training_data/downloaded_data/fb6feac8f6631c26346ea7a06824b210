  "content": "MySpace has hired Lindsay Nuttall, the head of marketing for BBC2, BBC4 and the corporation's factual programming, to take on the new role of international marketing director, MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal. Nuttall, a former Channel 4 marketer responsible for campaigns including for E4's teen drama Skins, will take on responsibility for all brand and marketing strategy for MySpace outside the US. Nuttall, 31, left Channel 4 to join the BBC in July 2007 where she marketed Heroes, Mad Men, The Culture Show, Flight of the Conchords, Who Do You Think You Are?, Nature's Greatest Events and the controversial White Season on BBC2, which examined the white working class. \"Lindsay's impressive background in brand development and her experience with media companies such as the BBC and Channel 4 make her the perfect fit for this key strategic role,\" said the managing director of MySpace Europe, Rebekah Horne. At Channel 4, where she worked for seven years, Nuttall was responsible for the launch of E4 and More4 as well as campaigns for several series of Big Brother. Last year Nuttall won the young marketer of the year award, which is open to those under 30, at the annual Marketing Society Awards for Excellence. Nuttall is not a replacement for Jamie Kantrowitz, MySpace's London-based vice-president of international marketing and content, who recently confirmed she is to return the US to work on global marketing for MySpace Music. Kantrowitz will not be directly replaced. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
