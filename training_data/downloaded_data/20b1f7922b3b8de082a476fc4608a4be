  "content": "Brad Greenspan, one of the men behind MySpace, has pledged to appeal against a California court's rejection of his lawsuit contesting the \"fraudulent\" sale of the website to News Corporation. He has also accused the media company of threatening him. Mr Greenspan, former chairman and chief executive of MySpace's original parent company Intermix, said that he had been subject to \"continued personal attacks\" from News Corp over his continued claims that MySpace was bought at an unfair price. He also accuses the media giant of \"ongoing harassment\" of \"friends and associates over the past few months via very aggressive activities by News Corp private investigators with the intent to wage personal attacks on me and discredit me\". \"First, I apologise for the delay in getting out a statement on the state court litigation developments, but the PR firm I was working [with] Allison &amp; Partners received a flurry of threats over the past few days from News Corp's agent and law firm Hogan &amp; Hartson,\" Mr Greenspan added. \"These threats to drag the PR firm into court because they were my 'agent' effectively temporarily chilled the small firm's ability to continue their communications with the media on my behalf in the short term as they retain legal counsel to deal with this baseless attack on free media.\" Yesterday Greenspan had his first lawsuit claiming News Corporation acquired the website at an unfairly low price dismissed in a California court. Afterwards, Mike Angus, General Counsel of News Corporation's Fox Interactive Media, said: \"News Corporation and Fox Interactive Media feel vindicated by Judge Kuhl's ruling and have always believed that this is merely a situation of unchecked envy leading to a loss of common sense. We hope this ruling will finally put an end to Mr. Greenspan's repeated and unsubstantiated attacks and look forward to focusing our attention on continuing to strategically grow our business.\" Richard Rosenblatt, former CEO of Intermix and former Chairman of MySpace, who replaced Greenspan, added: \"I have exercised great restraint in not responding to Mr. Greenspan's baseless and defamatory claims about the propriety of the News Corp acquisition and my role in the transaction, with the expectation of being vindicated by a court of law. Lost in all the rhetoric is that we delivered to the shareholders, including Mr. Greenspan, a nearly 700% increase in stock price.\" The nub of the allegations, and the lawsuit, are that the $580m News Corp paid for MySpace was extremely cheap and that executives involved in the deal knew the site could be worth $15bn-$20bn within a few years. Mr Greenspan, who was ousted from Intermix on 2003 and made around $47m (\u00a325.2m) out of the subsequent sale of MySpace, argued that there was a \"plethora of legal errors\" in Judge Kuel's decision to reject the lawsuit. He claims that pertinent evidence, such as incriminating emails and documents, that \"make up the heart of the fraud\" were not included in the initial lawsuit filing because they have only recently been discovered. In addition to pursuing the lawsuit, filed in February against Intermix and VantagePoint Venture Partners, he is calling for an investigation into the deal by the securities and exchange commission, the US justice department and the Senate committee on finance. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
