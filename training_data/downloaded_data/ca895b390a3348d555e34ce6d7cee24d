The list, which includes more than 1,400 names, mostly US military personnel, is accompanied by calls for Isis supporters to \"act and kill\" those who appear. It gives the names, departments, telephone numbers, emails and passwords of at least eight Australians, including Australian Defence Force personnel, New South Wales health department staff and a Victorian politician. Guardian Australia directed questions to a social media account listed at the bottom of the leak, asking why those particular Australians were chosen. A user claiming to speak for the group suggested their inclusion had been incidental and that neither they, nor Australian servers, had been specifically targeted. \"We hacked a military database, and government servers and database,\" the user said. \"What them [sic] Australians was doing in the database, I don't know, go ask them.\" The user said the \"main focus\" of the alleged hack was the United States, but that Australia was also a target \"due to its role in the coalition\", in reference to the military coalition co-ordinating airstrikes against Isis in Iraq and Syria. The cache is at least the second such list posted by the group, which is believed to be led by Junaid Hussain, a close associate of Neil Prakash, an Australian man among Islamic State's most prominent online recruiters. Prakash posted the list on Twitter with the message, \"*IMPORTANT* Please follow and share ... Cyber war got em shook!\" But the US army chief of staff, General Ray Odierno, rejected the claim that any databases had been hacked. \"This is the second or third time they've claimed that and the first two times I'll tell you, whatever lists they got were not taken by any cyber attack,\" he said on Wednesday. \"This is no different than the other two,\" he said, referring to earlier so-called hacks by Isis supporters in January and May. \"But I take it seriously because it's clear what they're trying to do ... even though I believe they have not been successful with their plan,\" he said. A computer security expert, Troy Hunt, also cast doubt on the alleged hack, suggesting much of it could have been scraped from previous data breaches or publicly available information. \"It's pretty clear that it's been aggregated from different sources,\" he said. \"It's been put together on the basis of a .gov or .mil address. Even the passwords, they're not strong enough to have come from a corporate or government. \"They're not even strong enough to have come from an online service \u2013 you can't create a Gmail account, for example, with a password of less than eight characters, and here we're seeing some passwords of three letters.\" The justice minister, Michael Keenan, said the government was aware of the list and spy agencies were looking into it. \"If there was any threat to any Australian's physical security, then obviously we would take the appropriate action to make sure that people are safe,\" he said. The Liberal backbencher Dan Tehan, who chairs parliament's intelligence and security committee, said the inclusion of Australians on the list was \"very disturbing\". \"It shows that when it comes to Isis or Daesh, what we have to be prepared to do is we've obviously got to degrade the caliphate on the ground but we've also got to win the online war on this,\" he said. The Australian Federal Police said it would liaise with partner agencies \"in regard to appropriate activities in response to this\". \"The safety of members of the Australian community is the main priority of the AFP and its partner agencies. It is not appropriate for the AFP to comment further at this stage.\" The Victorian MP has spoken to police about his security and the premier, Daniel Andrews, said the police were confident the situation was being handled appropriately. \"We take the matter seriously and there's been some discussions with that person, his safety and the safety of his family is very important,\" Andrews told reporters on Thursday. \"I'm satisfied that everything we can do is being done.\" Hussain posted the list on Twitter with the message: \"They have us on their 'hit list', and we have them on ours too.\" A note attached to the spreadsheet warns the group is \"extracting confidential data and passing on your personal information to the soldiers of the khilafah [caliphate], who soon with the permission of Allah will strike at your necks in your own lands\". The British hacker, who has been linked to the gunmen who attacked a prophet-Muhammad drawing contest in Texas in May, is reportedly third on a CIA kill list. Only the Isis leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and its most prominent executioner, Mohammed Emwazi, are higher on the CIA list. The hacking group posted a similar file in March claiming to list the names of US military personnel and their pictures.",
