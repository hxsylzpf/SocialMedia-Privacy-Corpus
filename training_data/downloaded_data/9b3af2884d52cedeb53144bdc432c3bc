  "content": "When Barbra \u00adStreisand discovered in 2003 that an aerial \u00adphotograph of her California beach house was among 12,000 on the internet as part of a \u00adcollection by Kenneth Adelman and Pictopia, she did what any celebrity would: hit them with a $50m lawsuit. But in trying to suppress the images, she caused a different outcome. \u00adOutrage at her legal actions led to almost half a million people visiting the \u00adPictopia site and viewing \u2013 and copying \u2013 the photos within a month. The effect of perversely publicising something you are trying to keep secret (especially via the law courts) was dubbed the \"Streisand effect\" by Mike Masnick of Techdirt.com, who noted how ineffectual lawsuits were at preventing spread in the virtual world. The problem for anyone trying to suppress information is that the internet is the world's biggest and most efficient copying machine. Put a \u00addocument on to a connected machine and it will propagate. The irony of the internet is that when you want to be famous you can't, but if you find \u00adyourself in the spotlight and want to erase \u00adyourself, you cannot. The \u00adevidence \u00adlingers. When people find content which they think should not be suppressed, they will copy it and put it on the net. The replication becomes impossible to hold back because any time a web server gains a new file and is queried by the search engines' \"spiders\" \u2013 which go out looking to see what has changed on the web \u2013 the cache of the web is updated, with the location of the new file. As soon as it crosses national boundaries removal of a file becomes a full-time job. The real enemy of \u00adcensorship is digitisation. That has frustrated many \u00adorganisations: when MI6 wanted to remove a list of its agents from the site cryptome.org, it was frustrated by the site's American owner. The Church of Scientology has been similarly frustrated in its efforts to keep secret its \"briefings\". When the British-based Internet Watch Foundation tried to ban the digitised cover of the German rock band Scorpions' Virgin Killer album from the net, its attempts led to wider circulation of the image than would ever have happened otherwise.",
