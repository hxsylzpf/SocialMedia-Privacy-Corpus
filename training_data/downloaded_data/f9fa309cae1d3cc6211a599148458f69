  "content": "Teenage Corrie star Brooke Vincent, who plays Sophie Webster in the ITV show, has had her hand slapped by studio bosses after trying to make a little money on the side using Twitter. Brooke has been given a \"stern talking to\" after appearing to endorse a range of brands including McDonald's, Domino's Pizza and Sienna fake tan by posting photos of them on her Twitter feed. Apparently the number of products she appeared to endorse to her 76,000 followers got a bit out of hand for ITV bosses who felt she had \"crossed the line\".",
