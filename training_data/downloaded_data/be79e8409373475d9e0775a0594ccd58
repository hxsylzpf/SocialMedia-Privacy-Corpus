  "content": "The Church of England has come up with a new way of adapting its teaching to the digital age \u2013 by drawing up a list of nine commandments for the Twitter faithful. The Diocese of Bath &amp; Wells is urging churchgoers to spread the Christian message across Twitter, but warn that the site is full of unholy temptations such as the rush to gain retweets and followers. Before putting finger to keyboard, the web-savvy diocese is instructing pious Twitter users to think, \"Is this my story to share? Would I want my mum to read this? Would I want God to read this?\" Among the list of other commandments is \"don't rush in\", while believers are also instructed to remember that they are \"an ambassador for the church\" and that all updates are \"transient yet permanent\". And while officials maintain that Twitter is an \"important missionary tool\", they warn worshippers never to conceal their identity behind anonymous profiles and to safeguard the children and the vulnerable. The final three commandments call for users to \"stay within the legal framework\", \"respect confidentiality\" and \"be mindful of your own security\". The diocese tweeted the modern-day commandments on Wednesday morning, using a tablet very different from the ones unveiled by Moses, and said that the commandments were \"based on principles of common sense and good judgment\". \"Essentially, you should participate online in the same way as you would in any other public forums. Your actions should be consistent with your work and Christian values and you take responsibility for the things you do, say or write,\" they said. The church issued the commandments after officials observed a rise in the number of worshippers using social media. The diocese praised social media for being \"immediate, interactive, conversational and open-ended\", but said that the rise in popularity of social media demanded \"a new way of thinking\". The nine commandments of Twitter: 1 Don't rush in 2 Remember updates are transient, yet permanent 3 You are an ambassador for the church 4 Do not hide behind anonymity 5 Think about the blurring of public/private life boundaries 6 Safeguarding: communicating directly online is like meeting someone in private 7 Stay within the legal framework 8 Respect confidentiality 9 Be mindful of your own security",
