  "content": "Hacking has a long and variably honoured history. The first hackers to bear the name, a group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose exploits were recounted in Steven Levy's 1984 book Hackers, were dedicated to building things. Subverting rules, to be sure, but a \"great hack\" meant above all else cleverness and, the ultimate accolade, elegance. Some of the best hacks were student pranks \u2013 MIT has an online gallery of the best of these, though my favourite actually happened at Cornell, where in 1997 someone whose identity is still unknown managed to impale a giant pumpkin on the spire of the clock tower using methods that have never been fully understood. But the more important activity of that time period was laying the groundwork for the computer and network systems we use today. One of the key elements of these hackers' work, however, was that the computers and software they hacked at to improve was open for modification, improvement and extension. When you bought your computer it came with the source code to any programs bundled with it, in the full expectation that the owner would want to take it apart. By 1980, however, this was beginning to change, and manufacturers began restricting copying, redistribution and modification of the software they provided. The discovery in 1980 that the licensing restrictions attached to the latest version of a printer at MIT's artificial intelligence lab launched Richard Stallman's lifetime career of writing and campaigning for free \u2013 as in free speech \u2013 software. It was arguably at that moment that \"hacking\" developed its political edge. A year later, the Hamburg chaos computer club was founded; it rapidly became known for both exposing security flaws and for advocating freedom of information. The identification of \"hacking\" with cracking into other people's computer systems developed through the 1980s, fed by a second stream: phone phreakers, who found ways to bypass charging mechanisms in order to get free phone calls (it's hard for young people appreciate this, but before the internet and mobiles-with-everything telephone calls were expensive). Many of the old-style hackers resent being conflated with crackers even now, but their exclusive rights to what was once a badge of honour have pretty much been lost. To the general public, a \"hacker\" is someone who breaks into other people's computer systems. By the early 1990s, \"hacker\" had come to mean what it still means to many people: a very clever, computer-obsessed, (usually) young, (usually) male with maybe a shaky grasp on the ethics. The equivalent of joyriders, if you like: scary perhaps, because of their abilities to operate weird, new technology and penetrate what should have been locked rooms, but largely motivated by bragging rights and the satisfaction of solving difficult puzzles. This was the chief threat when, in 1990, the first version of the Computer Misuse Act was passed. Things have changed drastically since then. First, the people cracking into computer systems today are curious about how to extract the contents of your bank account, not whether they can plant a pirate flag on the front of your website. Second, the stakes for all of us are much higher now that so many of life's major functions are carried out online. Third, the ready availability of automated tools means that someone cracking into computer systems doesn't have to be smart any more. Today, the ultra-smart teenager in the back bedroom is more likely to be founding an online business. Hacking as politics-in-action is, however, still with us, and likely always will be because, as Lawrence Lessig documented in his first book, Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace and Jonathan Zittrain has elaborated more recently in The Future of the Internet \u2013 and How to Stop It, in the online world the architecture of computers defines what's possible. Design, as AOL did, chat rooms that can have no more than 23 participants at a time, and you have designed a world in which massed protests are impossible. Hacking to subvert that kind of control is not only a probable result but even arguably an honourable act. The WikiLeakers fit reasonably well within the tradition of the hacker as freedom-of-information activist. No one has alleged that they cracked into anyone's system illegally in order to obtain the documents they publish. They are closer to journalists than to hackers. Those mounting the DDoS attacks on companies such as MasterCard, Paypal, and Amazon, may style themselves \"hacktivists\", but it's hard to see how they merit the term. Yes, they are protesting actions they believe to be unfair, even morally bankrupt in a way that attracts public notice. But they aren't building anything or opening sealed boxes to show us things that should never have been kept secret. They're just throwing paint at people they don't like. If I were an old-school hacker, I'd be out looking for a new name for myself.",
