  "content": "The No More Page 3 campaign is to sponsor a women's football team. If the campaigners manage to raise enough money to buy the kit, then the players of Cheltenham Town Ladies FC will soon be wearing shirts emblazoned with the slogan \"No More Page 3.\" The initiative will cause further embarrassment to The Sun, which has refused pleas to stop publishing daily photographs of topless women in its English, Scottish and Welsh editions. First team captain Kirsty Dunleavy says: \"We talked originally about traditional forms of sponsorship but wanted to do something different. We're all very supportive of the campaign so we're delighted to be doing this.\" Another team member, Natalie Berry, says: \"We think the idea is fantastic. Everyone in the club is behind it, including the male members. They all wanted us to run with it.\" That was confirmed by the club's chairman, Andy Liddle, who said the idea was quickly seized on by players. \"It's all happened within weeks,\" he said. The club contacted the campaigners through Twitter, and the response was rapid and positive. Dunleavy says: \"We believe this will not only will this be good for the club but for the promotion of women's football in general.\" Cheltenham Town Ladies FC runs two teams and both will carry the \"No More Page 3\" logo. But the money has to be raised first. People are being invited to donate here on the Just Giving site, which states that it is time to \"send off Page 3.\" The target is a modest \u00a32,025. A statement by the club on the campaign website says: \"If just 200 people give us \u00a310 each, we can achieve our goal and the campaign logo will travel with us all across the south west of the country every match day. \"Through this we hope to highlight the work of No More Page 3 and show our support for their goal.\" At present the online No More Page 3 petition has attracted more than 128,000 signatories. The Sun's Irish edition dropped Page 3 in August 2012 due, it said, to \"cultural differences.\" The paper's Saturday issue, its highest selling edition, does not run a topless picture.",
