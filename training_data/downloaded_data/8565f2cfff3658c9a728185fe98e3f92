  "content": "Facebook is a game. A very social one. Sure, there's no real endgame - unless you consider bringing all of your contacts together into one giant database the ultimate win - but the goals are to win friends and influence people. The techniques you use to do this are to manipulate and to project your identity via role playing (profile development, reputation building, zombies) and minigames (the plethora apps, from Where Have You Been? to Am I Green? which really are just loosely veiled personality tests). There are more than a couple of things that make Facebook different from the commercial games on the market, but here are three of particular interest: first, it's got an awfully large user-base, larger than any computer game has ever seen. Second, the gender demographics for the age of users is astoundingly even (those 50/50 stats bandied around by gamers really only apply to the younger age groups, I'm afraid). Third, and perhaps most importantly, it is a platform through which other people can make and distribute Facebook games, some of which integrate existing gaming platforms into the technology. This last is a realistic step games could make to solve the above two differences. But. Ain't nothing out there (yet) in the commercial gaming sphere that does it, although products like Home and Little Big Planet on the PS3 will attempt to bring this model to a mainstream market (with substantial restrictions) when they're released next year. But back to Facebook. The social network site's commercial gaming apps aren't nearly as integrated as they could be. Most of them are the offshoot of game cultures, the ludic spray that fans bring to a different location than the game world. Today, the location of these playful activities happens to be Facebook. A few years ago it was an enormous library of self-published websites. So what's out there that's attempted to be more than just another fan community? WowKon, a Facebook app that displays the latest World of Warcraft gaming news on your profile, is an example. Second Life Link app, which shows off your SL avatar to your Facebook mates. There are others, but as Raph explains, not very many people are using 'em. Sure, they support social interaction, but they do nothing to support the activities back in the game world. They are, simply, fan solutions. That's nowhere near as interesting as what was possible with the Dreamcast's interactive memory card (the dearly missed VMU). Yet there is one app which is causing ripples in the virtual worlds news. ActiveWorlds, a legacy social environment that pre-dated There and Second Life, is making a comeback using the power of the social network. Virtual Worlds News explains, Active Worlds announced [on 31 October] that they had launched the \"Active Worlds 3D Avatar and World Explorer\" application, allowing companies and developers to build virtual worlds on the Facebook platform. The company says the application is based on Internet Explorer and ActiveX from Microsoft to build on existing standards and to allow certain elements of the virtual worlds to interact with more traditional websites and Web 2.0 applications. Holy cow - build and visit 3D worlds through Facebook. This is proper integration. And there are already loads on there. Will this be the bridge between social networks and the 3D web? It is a pretty prescient move. As one of Raphs' commentators says, \"Platforms for development seems to be the buzzmeme du jour.\" I'm very curious to see how Google's recently announced OpenSocial social network platform could also fit into the virtual worlds space. Facebook's move to open up their codebooks for clever programmers to mess around with was extraordinarily clever. Sure, there's been a silly number of totally irrelevant apps, but rather than the end of virtual worlds, playing games on Facebook could herald the beginning.",
