  "content": "At New York City's Museum of the Moving Image's theater, a dark head of hair peeks over the podium and a 10-year-old-boy explains how he and his partner \u2013 a young girl barely clearing the dais \u2013 created a website about graffiti in the city. The two kids gathered with 48 others on Saturday and Sunday morning \u2013 sacrificing precious video-game playing, friend-hanging and homework-doing time \u2013 to parse open civic data to create websites, applications and mobile tools at Young Rewired State's first international youth hackathon. Young Rewired State started in 2009 to build a network of young programmers. It expanded to multiple events in the UK and has attracted children as young as six. Young Rewired State founder Emma Mulqueeny wanted to expand the events international presence to introduce more youngsters to open government data. \"New York and the US are the heart of entrepreneurism, really \u2013 I think it's moving from Silicon Valley to New York,\" Mulqueeny told the Guardian. \"I could see the most exciting things happening here and the greatest opportunity for the young people we are trying to be bring out of their bedrooms and be a part of this.\" The program emphasizes peer-to-peer learning by connecting participants with the more than 1,000 young people who have participated in the UK program. The idea is to bring the so-called \"bedroom programmers\" out from what can be the lone experience of a programmer to work together and foster their talents. Participants also receive help from professional programmers who volunteer as mentors at the event. Ian McJohn, 12, has participated in plenty of adult developer events, where he is often courted with tentative job offers for the future, but this was his first chance to work exclusively with peers. \"At an adult event, first they're going to look down on you but if you can get them actually talking about computers, it's fine,\" McJohn said. \"But here, people automatically respect you as an individual, which is nice.\" In less than 27 hours, McJohn and three peers made a mobile movie review system called Rotten Potatoes. The project won Best Design and is fully functional (text a movie name to 347-960-4143 in the US to see how it works). He was responsible for most of the coding on the project, but was quick to credit (and introduce me to) his other team members. McJohn, and the kids and teenagers he spent the weekend with, were mostly strangers. After being plied with donuts, and encouragement from mentors, even the 10-year-olds were speaking like experts, ready to present their creations on Sunday. Computer programming is an appealing field for youth facing a fragile jobs market. Each judge who works in the industry opened by recommending the participants contact them if they were interested in pursuing a career in their specific field. The diverse group of kids was 25% female, a relatively high percentage in a field that lacks gender balance. The bathroom lines at professional developers' conference have become a familiar indicator of how great the disparity is. Cameryn, 13, participated in the hackathon after she had some exposure to coding at school. \"There was a push in the US towards Stem \u2013 science, technology, engineering and mathematics \u2013 and she's interested in science and math, so I wanted her to have the exposure,\" said her mother, Haniwa Gottlieb. \"It's a wonderful forum to learn coding, which is the new language to learn.\"",
