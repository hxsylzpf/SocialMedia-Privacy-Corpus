  "content": "In February we announced our second TwiTrip. Benji had conquered Paris: I was going to take on San Francisco, but in a slightly different way. I've just moved here, and while I've been concerned with the normal everyday things like finding supermarkets and identifying new favourite local restaurants and bars, I feel like I've missed out on some of the classic San Francisco tourist stuff. But with most of our readers eight hours away, it was unlikely to lend itself to the same kind of spontaneity Benji was party to: we knew full well that after lunchtime I could ask 'where next?' all I wanted, but most of our readers and followers would have been tucked up in bed asleep. So instead we got lots of suggestions in advance, and cobbled them together into a day out. For the several days beforehand one of the worst storms in ages had been lashing the city with wind and torrential rain. But suddenly, on Tuesday morning - because, apparently, weather gods like Twitter - it was sunny and beautiful. So. While @RodBegbie suggested 'an insanely greasy breakfast at the Java House' - I got it all mixed up in my head with the fact that someone else had suggested Red's Java Hut for a burger later - and ended up going to Red's for breakfast - which was a happy accident: it was a beautiful day, the view from the back patio, looking up at bay bridge was stunning and frankly it couldn't have been more fortuitous. Even if it WAS wrong. Vicky Baker suggested cupcakes of any kind, and I did seek out one of the suggested cupcake repositories - the one in the Ferry Building - but since I'd only just finished a fluffy buttermilk pancake the size of my head, considered it unwise. But @Kathycastro, who suggested Red's for lunch had also suggested the Ferry Market, which was an easy stroll from breakfast and a good source of healthy fruitlike snacks. Which was good, because the next suggestion, which was a local one, popped up that morning - and involved a steep climb. \"The sun is out so enjoy the view from Coit Tower \u2026\", came from @iansftv. This is an unmissable San Francisco landmark on the top of Telegraph Hill - for the murals inside as well as the view from the top on a clear day - which this was. As I reached the top, a local friend following me on Twitter called saying she was nearby, and we went up the tower together. And that was one of the nice things about the day - nice people kept turning up places, because they knew where I was. Once I'd conquered one hill I thought I might as well walk to the other spots - I should mention that there are buses and cable cars and other modes of transport to almost all the locations suggested: I just really like city-walking. Following a chain of Twitter suggestions, I went down the Hill into Chinatown, swung past the City Lights Bookshop and then, as suggested by @miketd, @sarlitchin, @axbell - among others, headed up again - this time to Russian Hill. All suggested a stroll down Macondray Lane - better known to Tales of the City fans as Barbary Lane \u2026 and found it to be just as enchanting as promised. From there, down another hill, just to walk up one again - this time an entreaty to \"walk up Lombard Street\", the wiggly one, and surely one of the most bloody-minded pieces of town planning anywhere. One negative technical thing - I hadn't realised how much phone battery would be chewed up by constantly checking for twitter replies, taking pictures and texting. So if I stopped name-checking people who suggested things - and I did - I'm sorry. That was why. By the time I'd conquered not only Russian Hill but on to Nob Hill, gazed upon suggested places like Grace Cathedral, but not got on a cable car because \u2026 well, because I'm not sure anyone ever suggested it; I was hungry. Luckily, a bunch of people had suggested the famous Diner Lori's, and - yes, though she had her naysayers among the Twitter crowd - they were cheap, and quick, and did the job. After a quick diversion to charge up the phone, I leapt on a Muni (a tram) to the other side of the city. Because @sesp said the best view was from the Beach at the end of Golden Gate, and so I went there and watched the sunset from the edge of the Sunset district. What didn't I get to do? There were some things it was just hard to fit into a single day - cycling across the Golden Gate Bridge on a hired bike is something that deserves more time, and similarly there's an awful lot to explore in the Mission, Castro and Haight Ashbury - and a dozen great suggestions - but it's another day's worth of stuff all by itself. Foodwise, several people, including @Kathycastro and @iansftv suggested a crepe from Ti Couz being the nearest thing I could get to a British pancake on Pancake Day. Didn't get to go there on Tuesday - went on Friday instead; and can confirm that they were superb. Similarly, @charlottemeyer suggested Club Deluxe in Height Ashbury for pizza and cocktails - and after reading the Yelp reviews of it, I'm incredibly cross that I didn't go there and instead ended up at some crappy piano bar near Union Square where by midnight a ponytailed pianist was playing 'One for my Baby (and One More for the Road)' on request from me, his 'London Hottie'. (I'm not special, my friend was his 'Kansas Hottie' - basically we were the only women left in a baseball bar, thus automatically hotties) - but it's on the plan for next weekend. Did it work? Possibly not as well as Benji's. I think for it to be useful as an \"on the spot\" tool you'd either need to have an awful lot of followers full stop, or coincidentally an awful lot in the same place as you happened to be visiting. However - with the urging of followers old and new I explored places I would not have thought of otherwise - and saw them through someone else's eyes - why did they suggest this place? What made it special or memorable for them? That was one thing I really liked about it - the sense of \"let me show you my favourite place\", but spoken by strangers, thousands of miles away. And while there were only so many I could get to in one day - I have a nice little book with an awful lot more things written in it \u2026 So thank you.",
