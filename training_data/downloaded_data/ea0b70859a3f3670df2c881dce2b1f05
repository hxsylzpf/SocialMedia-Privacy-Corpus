  "content": "Three-quarters of British households will be online by the end of the year, according to research from the regulator Ofcom last week, with consumers brought into the fold by cheap broadband deals from the likes of TalkTalk and Sky, which has gone from nowhere to two million customers in three years. The UK sits in 11th place in the global broadband league, with 28.5 broadband subscribers per hundred inhabitants, according to statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD's list was topped by Denmark at 37.2 subscribers per hundred inhabitants, with the Netherlands at 35.8 and Norway at 34.5. But these figures do not give a clear picture of the number of households that have broadband. The UK came third when matched against France, Germany, Italy, the US, Canada and Japan in Ofcom's last international market report, which took figures from 2007. The UK had 60% of households online, behind the US on 61% and Canada on 66%. The UK appears, therefore, to be at least holding its own when compared with other countries. As for the speed of UK internet connections, figures from Ofcom published in January show an average UK internet speed of 3.6Mb per second. The OECD research has the average \"advertised\" speed in the UK at over 10Mb per second. So what are people doing with their internet connections? The most common use of the web is still to send and receive email, according to Ofcom's recent Accessing the Internet At Home survey. More than 20% of internet users go to social networking sites, while despite all the noise about catch-up TV services such as the iPlayer, only 6% of online users said they used the web for watching television, while 13% watch video clips. Despite those relatively small numbers, the size of the files being streamed means that video clips from YouTube or programmes from iPlayer account for more than a third of the UK's broadband traffic - little wonder that internet service providers are trying to get content companies to start paying for the bandwidth their services consume. There are, however, massive disparities in internet usage between the different age groups in the UK. Ofcom's Media Literacy Audit from last month showed 64% of 16 to 24-year-olds uploaded photos to the internet, and 54% had a personal profile on a social networking site such as Facebook or Bebo. Of the over-60s, however, only a quarter had uploaded a photo and just 4% had a social networking profile. The top use of the web for the over-60s is as a communications tool - mostly through email - with 62% of older web users saying they use the internet for purposes of communicating at least once a week. That compares with a national average for web users of 76%. The over-60s do, however, use the web more for news - 22% check the web for news at least once a week, compared with 21% of 16 to 24-year-olds, and a national average of 24%. But perhaps most worrying for Lord Carter's Digital Britain plans are the views of the so-called digital refuseniks. It has always been assumed that broadband penetration is based on PC penetration, which is running at 76.5% at the moment, according to research from Deloitte. But as Ofcom's recent survey showed, 42% of adults without broadband at home cited lack of interest or need as their main reason for not having it, rather than cost. Many said they thought the web was just for the young. Digital literacy and improving take-up of online access - not least because the government wants to migrate more public services online - will be a key area of Carter's report. These figures show just how badly that education is needed to create a truly Digital Britain.",
