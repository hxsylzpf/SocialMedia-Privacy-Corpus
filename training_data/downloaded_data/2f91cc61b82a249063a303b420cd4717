  "content": "So, it's come to this, has it? We're off, having progressed past the good old fashioned hyperventilating over the latest (boring) celebrity sex tape, past teen sexting and upskirt shots and straight on into the heart of darkness: the dirtiest of street drugs and the politicians who may or may not have been filmed ingesting them. Well, if we're going, we might as well have Conrad Black along for the ride. It's been that kind of a week up here in Canada. The whole thing started last week when Gawker announced that it had seen a video in which Toronto mayor Rob Ford was filmed inhaling crack cocaine and uttering homophobic slurs about the leader of Canada's Liberal party. The story became an instant online hit, not least for the fact that Gawker had apparently refused to pay the video's owner the six-figure bounty he or she requested to hand it over and instead decided to crowdsource the payment. As of Tuesday evening, it's raised about $100,000 \u2013 half of its ultimate goal of $200,000. That last bit is a clever bit of passing-the-buck by the Gawker crowd. In the end, as many have noted, the money will go to (apparently) a few drug dealers in Toronto, and nobody \u2013 including Gawker, probably \u2013 could really defend why they want the video that badly. Or seriously justify handing over that kind of cash to what are allegedly criminals. But if \"the people\" provide it? If \"the people\" demand it? Well, then \u2026 The people are demanding it, it seems, even willing to put their own money on the line. And you can almost smell the schadenfreude. Rob Ford took power (that is, as much power as a Canadian mayor can really have) in Toronto a few years ago without winning any support in the city's urban core, and hasn't stopped embarrassing them since. He didn't show up to the pride parade. He's fat. He's been accused of sexual harassment. He hates public transit. And now this. He's the festering blister on the latte-sipping fingers of Toronto's elite, rubbing them exactly the wrong way as they try to go about projecting an image of the city as world class. Ford used to be Homer Simpson, but he's now even lost that eye-rolling, rude humor. Now he's just Amanda Bynes, terrifying and confusing, sad and shameful. Just listen to this testimonial: \"As a friend of mine said, he's like the embarrassing guest at a family Christmas party. We don't need an embarrassing mayor and he need not be an embarrassing mayor.\" That's Black \u2013 the former newspaper baron, and a man recently released back to Canada after spending three years in US jail on for fraud obstruction of justice charges \u2013 speaking in an interview with the Toronto Star this week. Yes. Think of Conrad, Rob. Think of the embarrassment this is causing him. Black's overall point was this: say something. \"If I were accused of being a cocaine user and I wasn't, I wouldn't pretend that the issue wasn't out there,\" Black said, referring to the fact that, immediately following the allegations, Ford went underground, even canceling his radio show for the next week, presumably in the hopes the whole thing will blow over. Ford surfaced briefly Tuesday to make an announcement, but only gave a brief statement that the city's pending deal for a casino might be dead. He took no questions on the crack scandal. If he's hoping for this to all go away, Ford's got another thing coming. He's wobbling on the edge of a new frontier, facing the convergence point where new media companies with terrific reach will pay for news, quasi-news and non-news, and old media will breathlessly report on the how there's someone out there willing to pay for all this news \u2013 the good stuff \u2013 so that when it is duly purchased and public, they can report on it and assure themselves that all along, they maintained the moral high ground. Let's face it, he's also facing the scrutiny of not just the Canadian press, but Americans who can't wait to poke fun at their counterparts to the north and social media users around the world. The question, then, is this: What happens next? What happens when we see the video? What happens if it's all true? Politically, perhaps that will be the end of the Rob Ford mayoralty. If so, it will be a victory of sorts for those that wanted him gone, but hardly an admirable one. For the rest of us, after seeing the video, what will we do? We'll click 'share', we'll rofl, we'll offer snide remarks on Twitter, and emoji each other our amazement at the whole thing in endless combinations of cartoon faces. Then we'll move on, towards another new frontier, another new gawk. Another brief addiction of our own. Like I said: progress.",
