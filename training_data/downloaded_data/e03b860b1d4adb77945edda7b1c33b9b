  "content": "Bill Shorten has become the butt of fast-food related jokes on social media, after accidentally confusing an American sandwich chain with convenience store 7-Eleven. An investigation into the convenience store juggernaut, revealed earlier this week, found that two-thirds of stores were underpaying staff. In speaking against the China-Australia free trade deal on Wednesday, Shorten told reporters, \"We want to ensure that we don't see people coming here on visas being exploited and undercutting Australian jobs.\" \"We've all been appalled and disgusted by the scenes at Subway [where] thousands of people are being ripped off,\" he said, confusing the two chains. \"Labor will not be bullied to give up on standing up for Australian jobs by the shouting of Mr Abbott and his Liberals,\" he said. Social media site Twitter erupted, ridiculing Shorten over his gaffe. Shorten then took to Twitter to apologise. It is not the first time Shorten has found himself mired in fast-food controversy. In 2012, he apologised to the owner of a Melbourne deli for swearing at her, after she criticised then prime minister Julia Gillard.",
