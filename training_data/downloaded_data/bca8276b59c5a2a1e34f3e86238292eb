  "content": "Much of the focus of this discussion was inevitably focused on Facebook's photos product manager, Sam Odio, who disappointingly played the \"not my remit' card when asked the most interested and pertinent questions about Facebook's use of users' photos, including facial recognition and how images might be co-opted by advertisers. \u2022 Facebook sees \"a Flickr's worth of photos uploaded every month\", said Odio. But it's worth considering the different values of those two services: Flickr includes some high-quality, well edited photography, while Facebook focuses on storytelling over quality. It doesn't matter, said Odio, if that first photo of your newborn nephew is blurry: it's the social context behind the photo. \u2022 Odio fielded a question by one delegate about how businesses and advertisers might start appropriating photos for commercial use. \"We're not in the business of selling ads through people's photos and we want to prevent businesses having free rein over users,\" he said. \"But businesses are users,\" pushed the delegate. Odio said Facebook would want the people in the photos to be telling the story \u2013 which means advertising would be there but more subtly, and directed by users. \u2022 As for ownership of photos, Odio said that comes down to the need to build the API in such a way that it can access your friends' photos. If each of those users retained ownership, that would become very complicated. \"There are worries we are going to use photos in advertising but it doesn't really benefit us that much given how sensitive the subject is.\" \u2022 Yan-David Erlick, a serial entrepreneur who founded Mophot.to, predicted that social photos will become even more integrated with our lives through different sorts of tagging. \"Timelines between items will mean that over time, these entities are not viewed as individual pieces of media but will have contextual attributes tying them to other pieces.\" \u2022 Odio explained how after struggling to keep his startup photo site Divvyshot going in 2009, ploughing in all his own savings, he got a random email one Sunday night. It was from Blake Ross, who later turned out to be co-creator of Firefox, at an address at Facebook. \"He said 'Sam \u2013 your site looks interesting. You should come here.' I was living with six developers at the time and they were all looking over my shoulder to figure out if the email was fake or not.\" It was, and Facebook acquired Divvyshot in April 2010. \u2022 Feature requests aren't always the best way to develop a product. Odio said nobody asked for Instagram, which just raised $7m in funding, but now it is taking off. Facebook's engineers also have a monthly hackathon where they can work on whatever they like; that doesn't determine product direction but features such as drag-and-drop organisation have come out of that. \u2022 On facial recognition, all Odio would say is that Facebook \"hasn't been able to move quickly on it given how sensitive it is\", which does seem to imply it would have liked to do plenty if it could have got away with it. \u2022 Odio said a startup should make the product extremely simple; he had got distracted when trying to add too many features and functions. \"Focus on one thing and do it extremely well. In early days the product needs to be explained to users in 10 seconds or less.\" \u2022 One delegate said he was concerned that Facebook is becoming such an important repository for his life, and that photos are the most easily accessible part of that archive compared to status updates or messages. Erlich described the web being used as an external memory for us all, from photos to phone numbers; this ties in with Clay Shirky's idea of cognitive surplus \u2013 if machines can take over the mechanical parts of our brain function, what can we do with the space and energy that frees up?",
