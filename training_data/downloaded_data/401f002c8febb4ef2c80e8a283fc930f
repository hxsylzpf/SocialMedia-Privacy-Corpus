This week is anti-bullying week so it is a good time to highlight the need for technology and media businesses to ensure that tomorrow's customers, workforce and entrepreneurs have the best possible experience online. Social media is a massive global publicity engine, and fundamentally a positive force, but it also has unpleasant elements. We should not forget that technology and social media businesses are also digital natives with some growing up to do. As social media has matured into a significant part of our online and news landscape, more attention has been given to its dark side. According to a recent Thomson Reuters study defamation and libel cases being brought in the UK are falling across the board, but cases involving social media are increasing. The fact that some of these cases achieved significant settlements or damages underlines the importance attached to comments posted on social media. Obviously, threats, harassment and defamation are matters for the police and the courts, but what can social media and tech businesses do to support young people who are targeted on social media? The problem is that although posting a humiliating or nasty comment or photo is not illegal, this can have a profound effect on some young people, to the extent of damaging their mental health, particularly as they are constantly told that admissions officers and recruiters check social media. As well as being upsetting to the individuals involved, this type of online behaviour reflects negatively on the brand image of social media platforms and online forums. What are digital brands \u2013 including social media platforms \u2013 doing to support tomorrow's customers and workforce? At what point should they take responsibility? \"Law and regulation in the online world is consistently outpaced by technology and human behaviour,\" observes Steve Kuncewicz, head of intellectual property and media at law firm Bermans LLP. \"There is a patchwork of laws which regulate how users can behave towards each other and how businesses behave towards them in the online world, but as most of these businesses are based outside the UK not all of them share the sense of perceived responsibility for user behaviour as, for example, Facebook, which was one of the first social media networks to take action against bullying and child exploitation. Much as some online businesses are embracing the opportunity to educate and protect younger users, ultimately it's for the government to grasp the nettle and educate both the next generation and those who deal with them.\" Similar sentiments led anti-bullying expert Luke Roberts and Barry Sheerman MP to launch the all-party parliamentary group on young people and social technology (APPG). Sheerman, who chairs the APPG, brings his experience from the education committee and the all-party parliamentary group on stalking and harassment. \"The plan is to grow the APPG organically to make sure we have representation across the industry and launch a commission of inquiry to raise awareness of the challenges that young people are facing and improve the rules of the game,\" he explains. The APPG is working with children's organisations, tech and social media companies and corporates to create safeguards and guidelines for businesses and users. \"Companies need to recognise the risk of brand damage if they fail to support young people who use their sites,\" says Roberts. \"Top priority is to establish a model of care, whereby people who raise complaints can understand the process and know when they can expect issues to be resolved.\" Some of the biggest tech brands are taking a stand. Independent corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategist Craig Bida highlights Apple's new emoji created specifically to fight cyberbullying. The emoji, which was introduced in October, supports the I Am A Witness campaign created by the Ad Council, an American non-profit organisation, in partnership with Johnson &amp; Johnson, Apple, Google, Facebook, Adobe and Twitter. Another bright spot is The Adobe Foundation's Adobe Youth Voices which harnesses digital and storytelling tools to support creativity and self-expression and has addressed bullying issues. The APPG launch was hosted by BT which supports the iRights initiative and is involved in numerous activities supporting young people online. Through its Barefoot computing project, BT is trying to make a difference, as the company encourages all its employees to get involved \u2013 and it has 70,900 UK employees. Other global companies are also taking a stand. \"Tech companies can learn from looking at proactive anti-bullying efforts being championed by consumer brands in other sectors,\" says Bida, highlighting MTV's A Thin Line , Hollister's All Equal and Secret's Mean Stinks platform. As Kuncewicz observes, supporting young people online is a win-win for businesses and brands as anti-bullying and other campaigns have a positive effect on brand credibility and profitability. \"As social networks continue to court investors, the last thing they will want is to be seen as a haven for trolls or the socially irresponsible. Safe places tend to make more money in the long term.\" Joanna Goodman is a writer and editor.
