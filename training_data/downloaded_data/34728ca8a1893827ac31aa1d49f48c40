  "content": "Justin Bieber has allegedly apologised to Bill Clinton, hours after video footage of the 19-year-old urinating in a mop bucket and shouting \"Fuck Bill Clinton\" emerged. The video obtained by TMZ was reportedly shot earlier this year and shows Bieber exiting a nightclub in New York through a restaurant kitchen alongside a group of friends who laugh and shout: \"Wild kidz!\" As the group leaves, Bieber stops by a yellow mop bucket and empties his bladder, before grabbing a bottle of cleaning liquid and spraying it on to a framed photo of Bill Clinton then cursing the 42nd president.

Your words meant alot. #greatguy.\" Clinton has yet to respond to his tweet, but various gossip sites have claimed that the singer has called him twice to smooth things over. According to Extra, Clinton had advised the pop star that he should \"be conscious of the friends he keeps and to focus on the good work he is doing\", while E! Online reports that he had also told him: \"If that is the worst thing you have ever done, all is well.\" Bieber, who recently abandoned his 20-week-year-old pet capuchin monkey in Germany, has thanked fans on Twitter for their \"kind words\" of support in the wake of this controversy, but there's still no news yet that the singer has made any effort to contact the now soiled restaurant.",
