  "content": "The @MentalHealthCop Twitter feed of police inspector Michael Brown has been reinstated by West Midlands police after he was given \"informal advice\" over allegations of inappropriate use of direct messaging and social media. It is expected to reappear later this week, following the outcome of an internal investigation into the allegations. The account, which has nearly 17,000 followers, was suspended on Friday, causing alarm among many using and providing mental health services. His award-winning blog was also switched from public to private access. The West Midlands police and crime commissioner, Bob Jones, raised the issue with the force's chief constable, Chris Sims. A statement from West Midlands police said: \"A swift professional standards investigation established that the officer accepted there had been some inappropriate use and informal advice was given.\" Assistant Chief Constable Garry Forsyth said: \"I and my colleagues at West Midlands police are proud of our social media endeavours, working closely with officers and staff to engage and communicate in new and innovative ways. \"As with any organisation which communicates with the public, we have to ensure that there are parameters around the way information is shared, particular when that information can be sensitive. \"I am pleased that this issue has been resolved in a speedy manner to the satisfaction of those directly involved. \"It would not be fair or proportionate to release any further detail of this investigation. What I can say is that it's time to move on and we're looking forward to return of @MentalHealthCop. The real issue here is communicating complex issues in an effective way. I am pleased that @MentalHealthCop will once again be providing views and comment across mental health issues.\" The suspension came shortly before a new agreement on mental health care between the police, mental health trusts and charities. Brown is a much admired expert on the issue.",
