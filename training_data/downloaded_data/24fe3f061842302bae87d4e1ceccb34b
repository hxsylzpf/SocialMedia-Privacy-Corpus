  "content": "The search for the hackers behind last year's leaked celebrity photos has led the FBI to Chicago, where a raid saw two residences searched, according to The Hollywood Reporter. An FBI spokesperson said the raid took place last October, but the investigation is ongoing. The search began after it was believed that hackers used the houses to infiltrate the phones of celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton, and then leak personal photos. The seize included computers, phones, a Kindle and a variety of hard drives. The court documents, which were only recently made available, showed that the residents of both homes haven't been criminally charged. \"Based on victim account records obtained from Apple,\" Josh Sedowsky, of the FBI cybercrimes unit, wrote in the documents, \"one or more computers used \u2026 access or attempted to access without authorisation multiple celebrities' email and iCloud accounts over the course of several months.\" The documents also went on to list the initials of celebrities involved in the leak, including \"AS, CH, HS, JM, OW, AK, EB, and AH.\" \"It is not a scandal. It is a sex crime,\" Jennifer Lawrence told Vanity Fair in October. \"It is a sexual violation. It's disgusting. The law needs to be changed, and we need to change. That's why these websites are responsible. Just the fact that somebody can be sexually exploited and violated, and the first thought that crosses somebody's mind is to make a profit from it. It's so beyond me. I just can't imagine being that detached from humanity. I can't imagine being that thoughtless and careless and so empty inside.\"",
