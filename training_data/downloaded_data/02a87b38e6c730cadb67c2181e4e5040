  "content": "An online petition protesting against Katie Hopkins's tweet about Scottish life expectancy in the wake of the Glasgow helicopter crash has passed 75,000 names, as she gave an explanation of how she came to send the controversial message. The Apprentice star and Sun columnist prompted online outrage after she tweeted on Saturday: \"Life expectancy in Scotland based 07/08 birth is 59.5. Goodness me. That lot will do anything to avoid working until retirement.\" The petition read: \"On the 30th of November 2013, Scotland was still in shock and trying to come to terms with a horrible crash that took the lives of innocent people. Within 24 hours of this happening Katie Hopkins posted vile remarks on Twitter about how long the people of Scotland live for. \"This is unacceptable and distressing to those who lost friends and family. \"We the undersigned are sick and tired of ITV and Channel 5 giving her airtime and want her banned from all TV shows on your channels such as This Morning and The Wright Stuff. \"This woman is nothing more than an attention seeker who does not deserve to be a celebrity.\" Gary Caldwell from Hamilton commented on the petition: \"Everyone has the right to an opinion, however when a public figure uses Twitter they should be held responsible for their comments. The comments made by Katie Hopkins were vile and inappropriate on a day where our country was saddened with such tragedy. Some people have no shame.\" Meg Hill from Ayr wrote: \"This woman is vile and offensive and shouldn't be given airtime. At the very, very least she should be made to apologise to the people of Scotland for her disgusting, insensitive remarks.\" Hopkins apologised on Monday for the timing of her comments, tweeting with a link to a Scottish NHS document: \"My tweet on Scotland was directly related to this article: I apologise to those I offended. It was poor timing.\" She appeared on Pete Morgan's breakfast show on BBC WM on Tuesday, saying: \"Just to set the backdrop to it, we'd just done a week on The Wright Stuff and independence was a massive issue. I sat down on Saturday and someone sent me a Yes campaign document from Scotland, and it was talking about the disparities in health. I said to my husband 'Can you believe that? \u2026 Healthy life expectancy for a boy born in 2010 is just 59.5 years, and that was a really big figure. So, in my normal style, I put that out on Twitter \u2026 and of course, that coincided with a terrible tragedy, and I have apologised for the very poor timing of that tweet, which then felt directed at entirely the wrong people.\" She said she didn't think about the Glasgow helicopter crash when she sent the tweet, but the online reaction caused her to rethink her actions. Hopkins added: \"My Twitter feed reads a little differently to many people's Twitter feeds \u2026 it's not like your Twitter feed where you chat to your friends or people are nice to you, or comment on your dress or say how nice you look. Mine is pretty much a wall of hatred, any day of the week \u2026 after a week of discussing independence on the Wright show, my stuff was pretty strong from the Scots \u2026 I don't spend a great deal of time reading all of the tweets people were kind enough to send, but there was a point on Sunday night when I went 'Hold on a minute \u2026 people are correlating this life expectancy tweet with the helicopter crash.' I rang my agent, I rang a number of people for advice. 'What can I do? This really wan't intended.'\" Morgan commented that Hopkins didn't sound very sorry. She said: \"There's no amount of apologising I can do that makes it better, and there's also been comments that I didn't apologise soon enough. there's no way I can say sorry other than explain how I posted that tweet.\" She said of a potential ban if the petition succeeded: \"I always say, I've had my say and people can have theirs. I think it's kind of powerful that people get together in those groups and make things happen.\" Asked if she makes a living out of upsetting people, she replied: \"No \u2026 Can I just park that one tweet. Most of the things I talk about are things that mums talk about at the school gates every day \u2026 I never think of myself as a controversial speaker. What I do see is that in a world where people no longer speak their minds \u2026 politicians are so magnolia that we can't differentiate between the parties, it seems there are only a few of us that are prepared to take the kind of deluge of flak that you are going to receive if you speak your mind.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
