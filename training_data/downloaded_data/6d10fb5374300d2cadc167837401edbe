  "content": "I see that the Winklevoss twins (or the Winklevii, as Mark Zuckerberg calls them) were back in court last Tuesday. For readers to whom this means nothing, I should explain that they are the two Harvard alumni (and Olympic oarsmen) who claim that they created Facebook only to have Zuckerberg steal it from under their noses. Some years ago, in company with Divya Narendra, another Harvard alumnus who had worked with them on the original concept, they launched a lawsuit against the Facebook founder that resulted in two things: a $65m legal settlement in which the Winklevii got $20m in cash and $45m-worth of Facebook shares; and a major Hollywood movie \u2013 The Social Network \u2013 which tells the story in colourful terms. Facebook was quite a phenomenon when the settlement was reached in 2008. But since then it has gone ballistic, to the point where apparently sane men in suits, or at any rate employees of Goldman Sachs, say it is worth $50bn. And as they tracked its rise, the Winklevii came to the conclusion that they had been taken for a ride. Their case was that the number of Facebook shares they acquired was based on a false valuation: they thought the shares were worth $35 apiece, whereas internal Facebook deliberations put them closer to $9. So the actual value of the stock they were offered was closer to $11m than $45m. Accordingly, in 2010 the Winklevii went back to court under the age-old banner \"we wuz robbed\". They asked a judge to unwind the 2008 settlement on the grounds that they were given fewer shares than they were entitled to. The judge refused. So the boys appealed, which is how they came to be facing a trio of appeal judges on Tuesday. If the exchanges in the courtroom are anything to go by, the Winklevii face an uphill task. One of the judges observed, for example, that the twins were sophisticated enough to understand the deal they had settled for. \"The founders are pretty smart people themselves,\" he observed. \"They also had five lawyers from two firms sitting there with them. The twins also have a father from Wharton school, who is very bright. It wasn't like an individual without help. If you have all of those people there to advise you, isn't it a little difficult to say this is one of those things in which they were taken advantage of?\" The twins' lawyer, Jerome Falk, appeared to concur with this. \"I agree,\" he said, \"that my clients were not behind the barn door when brains were passed out.\" So my guess is that the Winklevii will have to be content with their 2008 settlement. But their case raises an intriguing question: what would have happened if they had never heard of Zuckerberg? They had had the idea for a social networking site called Harvard Connection and had enlisted a fellow student, Sanjay Mavinkurve, to build the site. But when he left to join Google, and the next programmer they enlisted also quit, they were stuck \u2013 which is how Zuckerberg came to be involved, on the basis of an oral agreement. But suppose that Mavinkurve had stayed with the project, and built the site. Would we now be looking at a social networking service with 600 million users? My hunch is no: we'd be looking at something more like MySpace, for which Rupert Murdoch paid $580m in 2005 and which last week laid off 500 workers and had only 54.4 million users in November. In other words, a neat idea that rose and fell because its owners lacked the imagination to make it sustainable. The Winklevii were not stupid, but as putative internet entrepreneurs they laboured under two crippling disadvantages. The first is that they are conventional \u2013 people who are good at creating businesses in established sectors but who find it hard to operate in arenas where there are no rules. Their second disadvantage was even more critical: the Winklevii weren't techies, and so had no real insight into the technology and its possibilities. They would have been less likely to spot the importance of allowing Facebook to become a software platform on which other people could run applications \u2013 and make their own fortunes. There are now more than 2.5 million developers such as Zynga writing apps for the platform. The big question is thus not whether the Winklevii could have built a serious company (they could, just as the founders of MySpace did), but whether they would have seeded a software ecosystem that would one day change the world.",
