  "content": "How far can societies shape the development of computing and communications technologies, so that they serve the public good as well as private interests? How can technologists translate values such as privacy into hardware designs, software code and system architectures? Should - and can - governments intervene effectively to ensure this happens? And who decides what those values should be? These were some of the questions discussed this week at the Oxford London lecture, in association with the Guardian. Dr Ian Brown was joined by David Davis MP, Stephen Deadman, Vodafone's global privacy officer, and Nick Hopkins, the Guardian's investigations editor. You can watch a video of the lecture above. Join Brown live today from 2pm to pick his brains about information security, privacy-enhancing technologies and internet regulation. Comments will be open from 1.15pm.",
