  "content": "The Uruguayan fixer employed by Hello! magazine to set up features with international celebrities yesterday accused Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones of being \"childish\" to believe that their lavish wedding at the Plaza Hotel in New York could be totally private. The Marquesa de Varela, described in the high court in London yesterday as a \"volatile and eccentric lady\", told the Hollywood actors' privacy case that the presence of \"1,000 South American waiters\" virtually guaranteed that pictures would leak out. Bringing a taste of fiery Latin temperament to the previously staid atmosphere at the hearing, the marquesa said paparazzi photographers would \"kill or be killed\" to get a good picture. The marquesa told how two paparazzi photographers, Phil Ramey and Frank Griffin, decided to work together on the couple's wedding despite being sworn enemies. \"They hated each other,\" she told the court. \"But this was a big op portunity.\" Under cross examination from counsel for Hello!, Michael Tugendhat QC, the marquesa denied she expected the photographers to \"gatecrash\" the ceremony itself. \"Nobody orchestrated anything,\" she said. Douglas and Zeta-Jones are claiming \u00a3500,000 in damages from Hello! for breach of confidence and invasion of privacy after a paparazzo smuggled pictures out of the wedding in November 2000. The publishers of OK! are claiming a further \u00a31.75m in loss of revenue. The marquesa told the court that the couple's relationship with Hello! had been soured by an earlier \"fiasco\" when photographers, engaged by the magazine to take pictures of Douglas on holiday in Majorca, turned up without a cheque for the previously agreed sum of $600,000. So the deal for the wedding went to OK!, which agreed to pay them \u00a31m - an outcome that annoyed the marquesa greatly. The only option left to Hello!, she told the court, was to get paparazzi pictures - of which she had no experience. The marquesa said she knew of Mr Ramey only by reputation. \"He is known to be the best paparazzo, the most aggressive who would swear quite loudly. He was famous for his personality as well as his photos.\" Mr Ramey and Mr Griffin were in contact with several magazines, including Hello!, before the wedding. It would be easy for them to get pictures, possibly from the hotel lobby, landings or corridors. The Plaza Hotel was well known for hosting celebrity weddings. \"If I wanted a private wedding, I would not do it in the Plaza Hotel. If you want a private wedding, do it like Sir Paul McCartney.\" The former Beatle married Heather Mills in a remote Irish castle. The marquesa attacked the actors' choice of venue. \"I think it was almost childish - that is my opinion.\" She was horrified when six blurred photographs of the wedding and reception eventually appeared in Hello! magazine, and did not believe the publication should have paid a penny for them. \"You cannot compare Armani to Zara,\" she said, in a reference to the Spanish high street clothing chain. The marquesa admitted having submitted a false statement to the court of appeal saying that she, and not Hello!, had ordered the paparazzi pictures. She maintained a fierce loyalty to Hello!'s Spanish proprietor, Eduardo Sanchez, but she now regretted lying. In her written witness statement to the court, she described feeling pressurised into taking the blame for the legal wrangle: \"My whole income depended on my relationship with Hello! and Eduardo. If I refused to help them then I was sure that the relationship would be put in jeopardy and my income would disappear. \"The situation was all the more difficult for me as I support my three children, six grandchildren, an elderly mother and almost 200 dogs (as I have built and run a rescue home for animals).\" After giving evidence, the marquesa left court, briefly stopping to pose for pictures in the rain.",
