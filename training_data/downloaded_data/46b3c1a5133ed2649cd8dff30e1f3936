  "content": "Twitter took a further step towards localisation on Thursday by expanding its \"regional trends\" theme to 12 more UK cities. Users of Twitter can now see what is trending in Belfast, Brighton, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Nottingham, Portsmouth and Sheffield. Trends for Birmingham, Glasgow, London, and Manchester were introduced in January 2010. Announcing regional trends in a blogpost, Twitter pointed to the example of Green MP @carolinelucas and DJ @fatboyslim in Brighton, and Olympian @chrishoy and @edinburghfest in Edinburgh. Twitter introduced tailored trends, based on a user's location and who they follow, in June, while the original trends feature launched in the summer of 2008. Twitter has been expanding its range of features and increasing its commercial tools, such as promoted tweets, as the service has grown and investors have pressed the company for higher revenue. It has also tightening up on access for some third-party services, though trends has spawned a flurry of sites including trendsmap, and ttchart.co.uk.",
