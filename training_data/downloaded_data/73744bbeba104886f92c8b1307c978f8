  "content": "Labor parliamentarians have raised serious concerns about the data retention bill, with one MP warning that the legislation would not have prevented the deadly Martin Place siege in Sydney in December. More than a dozen MPs and senators spoke during a 40-minute debate in the Labor caucus meeting in Canberra on Tuesday, before the party opted to support the the legislation with an amendment to prevent warrantless access to journalists' call records. Guardian Australia understands the people who raised concerns included Doug Cameron, Alannah MacTiernan, Melissa Parke, Ed Husic, Anna Burke, Michelle Rowland and Julie Owens. Several other speakers were largely positive about what Labor had achieved through the bipartisan security committee and the subsequent amendment to require agencies to seek a warrant from a court before seeking to access metadata to identify a confidential source. To the extent there was disagreement, it related to how far Labor should have pushed the government to extract further concessions and improvements to the legislation. A few speakers criticised the party for failing to make its case for data retention with branch members and the public, and said it needed to communicate better. Husic told caucus he understood why metadata was useful to law enforcement, but noted the difficulty of preventing lone wolf terrorist attacks because the perpetrators limited their communications. He drew his colleagues' attention to a section of the security committee's report that \"evidence that data retention would likely not have enabled agencies to prevent\" incidents such as the Sydney siege by Man Haron Monis. Husic said there was still a lot of uncertainty about the cost of the scheme and he underlined privacy concerns by saying the legislation would create a \"digital footprint\" of citizens' activities. Owens, like numerous other MPs, raised concerns about the financial impact on internet service providers (ISPs) of complying with the obligation to store the required data of its customers for two years. MacTiernan told the meeting that the legislation would affect millions of Australians, unlike the previous tranches of national security laws passed last year. People would see this through a privacy lens, she said. Parke suggested that the issue of security of the data ought to be resolved before the scheme was legislated. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, acknowledged the frustration of Labor MPs in helping the government out of its own \"shambles\" after the introduction last year of an inadequate bill. \"This caucus is forcing the government to positions it did not want to go to, including protections of journalists,\" Shorten told the meeting. The caucus vote to support the amended legislation was carried \"on the voices\". It is understood there was broad support in the caucus for greater funding for the ombudsman. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, wants to pass the bill by the end of next week, the final sitting before the May budget. Politically, Labor is caught between the Coalition, which has been pushing it to give bipartisan support to the bill as a matter of urgency, and the Greens, who have accused Labor of \"rolling over\" and not applying adequate scrutiny.",
