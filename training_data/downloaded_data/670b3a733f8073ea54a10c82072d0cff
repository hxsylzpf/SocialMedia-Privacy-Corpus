More than a third of the UK population now visit the site every day, and of the daily users some 20 million \u2013 83% \u2013 use a smartphone or tablet to check updates on Facebook. Facebook released its number of daily users in the UK for the first time on Wednesday, in part to combat data showing that its growth has reached saturation point. \"It's to make clear our audience is growing both in size and engagement,\" said James Quarles, Facebook's regional director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. However, the social network declined to release up to date figures on monthly users. Facebook's monthly active users stood at 33m in December, and a spokesman said that no new number was available. Facebook also declined to publish the number of daily users for prior periods, so it is not clear how fast daily engagement is increasing. Quarles said the UK was leading a \"massive shift to mobile\" among its 1.1 billion registered global users. \"People start the day with Facebook and especially in the UK, which is a very big mobile market, there is a very high percentage of people signing in on smartphones,\" he said. Facebook released its number of daily users in the UK for the first time on Wednesday, in part to combat suggestions that its growth has reached saturation point. The social network has dismissed reports of a drop in visitors as \"unrepresentative\" and said that mobile usage of Facebook in the UK had grown 20% compared with last year. \"It's to make clear our audience is growing both in size and engagement,\" said Quarles. The social network is also beginning to emphasise users' mobile engagement in a bid to drive advertising to people's handsets. Mobile usage of Facebook in the UK has grown 20% compared with last year. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has pinned the site's future prospects on its ability to capitalise on the rapid shift to mobile \u2013 and this year the focus appears to have started to pay off. Revenue from mobile now makes up 41% of its total $1.6bn second-quarter advertising revenue, compared with just 3% in the same quarter of 2012, according to the company's latest financial results released earlier this month. Quarles compared Facebook's mobile reach of 20 million daily mobile users to television juggernauts such as The X Factor, which made over \u00a3100m for ITV at its audience peak in 2010. \"If you think about tentpole television events like Britain's Got Talent or The X Factor, 20 million available throughout Facebook daily is double what that audience would be,\" he said. \"We want to reflect to marketers that mobile is now a big part of the first screen. We have absolutely seen significant demand for it and as they consider places to follow time spent, the graduation to mobile is increasingly going to happen.\" Facebook's December number of 33 million users in the UK dwarfs the latest figure reported by rival social networks such as Twitter, which said it had 10 million registered users in the UK last December, and eBay's 14 million active users. \u2022 This story has been updated to reflect new information on the time period covered by Facebook's mobile data.",
