  "content": "\"Earlier this week the Swedish stasi-government decided -- against the peoples wishes -- to wiretap all internet and telephone traffic in order to protect Sweden against threats. As you all know, being a neutral country makes Sweden a target for all the terrorists of the world, apparantly,\" blogs one of The Pirate Bay's admins, Peter Sunde. Many people have asked me what we're planning to do -- and the answer is \"A lot!\". We're going to help out in any way we can with fighting the law. This week we're going to add SSL to The Pirate Bay. We're also going to help out making a website about easy encryption -- both for your harddrives and your net traffic. As some people know, we're running a system for VPN-tunnels already and we're going to lower the price for that as well and open it up for international users as well. Sunde also says: \"We want Sweden to be banned from the Internet.\" That won't stop The Pirate Bay, of course, because its servers are not actually based in Sweden..... We've written quite a lot about The Pirate Bay, where \"we\" usually means Bobbie Johnson. See, for example, How three Swedish geeks became Hollywood's Number One enemy, and Is the Pirate Bay going to be shut down again?, and Notorious pirate website faces copyright case. There's a January 2008 interview with The Pirate Bay at Slyck.",
