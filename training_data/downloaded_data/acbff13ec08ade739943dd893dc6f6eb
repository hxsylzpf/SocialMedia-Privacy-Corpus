I mean, I can only imagine the level of self-control it must have taken to see a black guy in such an expensive car and resist their natural urge to pull him over. Perhaps they were still stunned by the new President's inaugural speech \u2013 a homily so feel-good, I half expected it to end, Oprah style, with Obama giving each of the assembled crowd a puppy. \"You're getting a puppy, you're getting a puppy ...\" And don't get me started on Elizabeth Alexander's poem \u2013 \"Someone is trying to make music with a pair of wooden spoons on an oil drum ... A woman and her son wait for the bus ... A farmer considers the changing sky\" \u2013 which sounded less like a poem and more like someone reading out Twitter. And then ... ... actually, no, sorry, I can't do it. I may be a professional cynic but tonight, as Blur so memorably sang, my heart's not in it. I've just got back to my hotel room in San Francisco from a party to celebrate the inauguration \u2013 and the last thing I'm in the mood to do is mock. Perhaps I've been here too long and have gone native, but from the moment I switched on the television this morning and watched President Obama being sworn in by the Keystone Chief Justice, I've felt nothing but unbridled, uncynical optimism about this new chapter in American history. I'm staying two blocks from Bush street which, for today only, has been renamed Obama street. All day, in every cafe, grocery store, bar and private home, televisions were tuned to the non-stop coverage of the inauguration and the parade that followed. At the party tonight, organised by my friends Eris and David, they served \"Yes We Canap\u00e9s\" and everyone \u2013 me included \u2013 proudly wore little American flags in their lapels, without even a trace of irony. Finally, in the cab on the way back home, with Obama's speech replaying on the radio, the couple I was sharing the ride with held each other's hands tightly and talked about Change. It's like in Ghostbusters II when the river of evil flowing beneath New York grips the city in collective paranormal madness, except in San Francisco today it's a river of change, putting the populace in the grip of hope. I leave town on Thursday \u2013 I have to be in Munich by the end of the week for DLD \u2013 but more so than on any previous trip, I'm going to miss the hell out of San Francisco. The fact that I've had a great time here is certainly a factor, but more than that I feel like I'm leaving at exactly the wrong time, like walking out of a cinema five minutes in to a brilliant movie. The camera has just faded in on a city with an uncertain future: US share indexes dropped sharply again today, and each week brings a fresh round of layoffs in the tech sector. Last time I was here, back in October, the mood among entrepreneurs at Silicon Valley parties was unequivocally buoyant. Sure, a downturn was coming, but there was a feeling that somehow the tech sector could ride it out. This visit, though, the optimism is all but gone. People are still talking a good talk but behind their eyes the fear is unmistakable. When even Google is laying people off by the ton, no-one feels safe. And then, of course, there's Steve Jobs. Just after I filed my column last week, I went for brunch with a friend who works at Apple. Halfway through the meal, she got a message on her iPhone and abruptly excused herself from the restaurant. When she came back \u2013 10 minutes later \u2013 the look on her face was somewhere between sadness and shock. \"Where did you go?\" I asked. \"I had to reply to an email from Steve.\" \"Steve?\" \"Steve.\" \"Oh \u2026 oh.\" \"Yeah.\" She \u2013 along with every other Apple employee \u2013 had just received the now famous email from Jobs saying that, actually, his illness was far worse than he'd \u2013 ahem \u2013 realised and that he was \u2013 ahem \u2013 taking a few months' medical leave from the company. And at that, just as things are looking terrifying and hopeless, we cut to a week later and our hero's grand entrance. Barack H Obama \u2013 44th President of the United States, and easily the most technologically savvy chief executive the country, and perhaps even the world \u2013 has ever seen. Much has been made of Obama's reluctance to give up his BlackBerry after taking office, and his campaign's use of Twitter and other social networks during the election. But those are just tiny details \u2013 signifiers that underline Obama's comfort around weapons of mass communication. Much more impressive are his actual policies: starting with the pledge to appoint America's first Chief Technology Officer to ensure that his administration is the most open and transparent in history. Then there are the other promises: to defend net neutrality and privacy rights; to roll out next generation broadband to all parts of the country; to make permanent a tax cut for research and development spending; to increase funding for science education ... the list goes on and on \u2013 and every item is music to the ears of the people of Silicon Valley. This is a president that is serious about encouraging America's technology sector. But making election promises is one thing \u2013 delivering on them, while also trying to rescue the economy, fix America's reputation around the world and choose a new White house dog, is quite another. And that's why it kills me that I have to leave just as the opening credits start to roll. I want to be here to see what happens next, to witness the effects of an Obama presidency on the most liberal and technology savvy city in America. But I can't. Thanks to visa restrictions, commitments elsewhere and this strange tech-nomadic lifestyle I've chosen for myself, I rarely stay in any one place long enough to get under its skin. And until today, that suited me just fine. If you asked me yesterday whether I'd ever want to settle down in one place again, I'd laugh and reel off my usual list of reasons why permanent travel and living in hotels is the only way to live. I can go where I want, do what I want, have new experiences with new people every day. Only an idiot would want to give that up. Today, though, something has changed. I got a lift to the party with my friend Scott who has just moved here from London to work as CTO for a company based out here. As I listened to him talk about his new job, something felt different. I was feeling envy. For the first time in over a year, I was actually envious of someone with an apartment and a job that forces them to stay in a single city and a single country. Especially when that city is San Francisco and that country is the shiny new United States of America. I haven't decided what to do about the feeling yet \u2013 and maybe it will pass. But right now, as I watch yet another re-run of his speech on Fox News, it feels like, thanks to Obama, all of the decisions I've spent the last year making about I want to do and where I want to do it have suddenly changed. And, to paraphrase the new President ever so slightly, that's change that scares the living shit out of me. \u2022 Paul Carr is author of Bringing Nothing To The Party: True Confessions of a New Media Whore.
