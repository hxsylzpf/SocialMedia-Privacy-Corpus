  "content": "A highly embarrassed Prince Edward is \"desperate to put right\" the damage caused by his film crew who were yesterday caught stalking Prince William in his first week at university. The chairman of his company, Ardent Productions, has cut short his holiday and is returning immediately to the firm's offices to orchestrate an urgent damage limitation crisis. On his way back to Ardent's offices in Prince Edward's palatial Bagshot House in Surrey, Malcolm Cockren said: \"We are desperate to put it right.\" Sounding flustered, he added: \"We regard this very, very seriously.\" Andrew Neil, rector of St Andrew's University said he was dismayed that the first media group to be caught breaching the privacy of the young prince belonged to his uncle. \"We thought maybe the paparazzi or maybe a British tabloid. But it never crossed our minds that the first people to breach it would be a company owned by the royal family. It beggars belief.\" But Mr Cockren said that as far as he was aware the film team at St Andrew's University was not breaching any code: \"We had a crew in that area, we were invited back by the university there is nothing sinister about it,\" he said. He found himself at the centre of the storm today after the Daily Mail revealed that a crew working for Ardent Television had continued filming at St Andrew's despite an agreement with the media that the young prince would be left to get on with his studies without the intrusion of the press. It appeared last night that Mr Cockren and Ardent TV did not appreciate the seriousness of the situation, which has threatened to deepen the rift between Prince Charles and Prince Edward. He told the Daily Mail: \"I am on holiday - call the office.\" Today, however, Mr Cockren was urgently trying to sort out the problem, said a statement - likely to be a grovelling apology - would be released later today, but he couldn't comment any further because he had not been fully briefed. Relations between Charles and Edward have been strained after accusations that Edward's wife, Sophie Rhys-Jones, was trading on her royal connections.",
