The frequently foul-mouthed comic, a parody of titles such as The Beano and Dandy, took to Twitter on Monday to air its grievance at being blocked to its 150,000 followers. Ian Westwood, group managing director at parent Dennis Publishing, told the Guardian that Viz staff had no clue what content had triggered the page being blocked but that Facebook's rules meant that the publication ran a risk of being \"permanently deleted\" from the social networking platform. A spokeswoman for Facebook UK implied that Viz's frequently risque language and humour had triggered the content block, but that should not have been grounds for removing the Facebook page. \"We want Facebook to be a place where people can express their opinions and challenge ideas, including through satire and comedy,\" she said. \"Upon further review we found that the Viz page had been removed in error. We have now restored it and would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.\" Following Facebook's move to reinstate Viz's brand page on Monday night, the comic tweeted followers to say \"we're not going to tone anything down\". Facebook's community standards do allow users to \"challenge ideas, institutions and practices\", including allowing \"humour, satire or social commentary related to sensitive topics\". However, in this case Facebook moved to block the page for an unexplained breach of those rules. Enforcement is handled by a \"community operations team\" that includes both a manual and automated review of content. Facebook has to monitor a large volume of content posted on a daily basis and on occasion legitimate pages like Viz are mistakenly blocked. Taking advantage of the widespread publicity the publication received following the Facebook block, the magazine moved to offer 15% off all Viz T-shirts when its brand page was reinstated.",
