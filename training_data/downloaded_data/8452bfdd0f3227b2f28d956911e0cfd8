  "content": "The hacker group LulzSec has denied hacked the Office for National Statistics or stolen data from the 2011 census, after what appeared to be a statement from the group appeared on the site Pastebin. Security experts are sceptical of claims that appeared on Pastebin, which is frequently used by hacker groups to make \"announcements\" of attacks against sites or organisations. The claim on Pastebin appeared mid-morning on Tuesday, saying \"We have blissfully obtained records of every single citizen who gave their records to the security-illiterate UK government for the 2011 census. We're keeping them under lock and key though... so don't worry about your privacy (...until we finish re-formatting them for release). Myself and the rest of my Lulz shipmates will then embark upon a trip to ThePirateBay with our beautiful records for your viewing pleasure!\" But Rik Ferguson of the security specialists Trend Micro pointed out that it is simple to put content onto Pastebin \u2013 and that the content of previous LulzSec releases is already there. \"Anybody can paste anything on Pastebin,\" he said. \"It's easy to copy and paste the format of previous releases.\" Some of the details in the claim seemed to refer back to much older releases. LulzSec itself denied the claim on its Twitter feed, which has been the only reliable source of information about its claimed exploits since it first came to public notice in May by hacking the contestant database for the US version of X-Factor. \"Just saw the pastebin of the UK census hack. That wasn't us \u2013 don't believe fake LulzSec releases unless we put out a tweet first,\" said the first. A second added, \"Anyone in the world can copy and paste The Lulz Boat ASCII art and general lighthearted theme. Smarten up, check the [Twitter] feed first.\" The two tweets were later deleted, although The tweets vanished for a while, though readers did capture screenshots of them first. They have now been restored. The Office for National Statistics said it was \"investigating\" the claims that were made. Suspicions had been raised about the possibility of the hack because the census data was collected by the US military and civil contractor Lockheed Martin, which recently announced that it had been the victim of a concerted hacking attack. It is not clear however whether the census data would have been accessible via Lockheed Martin's systems in the US, nor whether the data would have left the UK in the first place. Corrected: the LulzSec tweets did not appear for some time but reappeared on its Twitter stream.",
