  "content": "Do foxes bark, yelp or scream? A YouTube video by Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis that aims to answer that question is going viral on YouTube. Called The Fox, its chorus presents an array of onomatopoeic suggestions, from \"ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding\" and \"joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff\" through to \"Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow\", sung by an excitable man in a furry onesie. It's part Gangnam Style and part Crazy Frog, and three days after the video's release, it has reached just under 2.2m views on the YouTube channel of broadcaster TVNorge, with US blog Gawker having already declared it \"the song of the summer\". Ylvis are brothers B\u00e5rd Ylvis\u00e5ker and Vegard Ylvis\u00e5ker, who've been working together for more than a decade across various live and TV shows in Norway, although they're much less well-known outside their home country. The Fox may be played for laughs, but if it continues its early momentum, it will become the latest Scandinavian success story on YouTube. Swedish gamer Felik Kjellberg's PewDiePie is currently the most popular channel in the world on Google's video service, with 12.8m subscribers and 2.3bn total views. And that's without ever dressing up as a fox.",
