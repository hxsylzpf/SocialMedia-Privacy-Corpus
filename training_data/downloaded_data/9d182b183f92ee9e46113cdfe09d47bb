  "content": "Sienna Miller has reached an out of court settlement for an invasion of privacy action against the Sun and the News of the World over a series of articles published by the papers in June and July. The high court today approved a settlement in which the papers' publisher, News International subsidiary News Group Newspapers, paid \u00a335,000 damages to Miller and agreed to pay her legal costs. A series of articles and pictures were published in both papers that included coverage of the actor's alleged relationship with Balthazar Getty soon after breaking off a relationship with Welsh actor Rhys Ifans. Tom Crone, the senior lawyer for News Group Newspapers has written to Miller on behalf of the two titles saying they accepted that \"we should not have published such information or photographs\". \"I refer to your legal claim against News Group Newspapers, the publishers of the Sun and the News of the World, that was issued in July of this year,\" Crone wrote. \"We have now had an opportunity to look into this matter. We acknowledge that on the specific facts and circumstances of this case you had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of the information and the photographs that we published in the Sun and the News of the World. We also accept that we should not have published such information or photographs.\" Miller is also pursuing what her lawyers Carter-Ruck describe as \"various claims\" against the photo agency Big Pictures over alleged harassment and invasion of privacy. The ruling comes on the same day that the Daily Mail editor-in-chief, Paul Dacre, claimed that a privacy law was being \"imposed\" on the British press by the rulings of high court judge Mr Justice Eady. Dacre said that Eady was harming the British press by imposing a privacy law, with \"arrogant and amoral judgments\". In September, Miller secured an apology and \u00a315,000 in damages from the Daily Star an another out of court settlement of a privacy action. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
