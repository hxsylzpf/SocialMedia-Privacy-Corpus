  "content": "Elizabeth Taylor last night assured fans that her heart operation had been a success. The two-time Oscar winner had been admitted to an undisclosed hospital earlier this week. \"My heart procedure went off perfectly,\" Taylor said via Twitter. \"It's like having a brand new ticker. Thank you for all your prayers and good wishes. I know they all helped.\" Taylor, 77, has been battled ill health in recent years and was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 2004. Last Tuesday, she tweeted that she was to enter hospital for what she described as \"new procedure that involves repairing my leaky valves using a clip device, without open-heart surgery.\" The actor also poured scorn on press claims that she was also suffering from diabetes and earlier admitted that she was still grieving the death of Michael Jackson. \"I always will,\" she added.",
