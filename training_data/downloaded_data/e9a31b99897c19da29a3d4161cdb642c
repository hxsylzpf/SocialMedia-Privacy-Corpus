  "content": "Police in Brighton have installed CCTV in their own canteen to catch officers who shirk their washing-up duties. We've arrested our urge to employ spurious puns like \"grimewatch\", \"grime and punishment\", or \"tough on crime, tougher on the causers of grime\", but we can't pass up this opportunity to enjoy the camera being turned the other way for a change. Being watched at work is a nine-to-five reality for most of us. After all, Britain is currently the most-watched nation in the world. Many employees rightly suspect that management reads their emails, uses swipecard data for observing their comings and goings, and monitors their movements on CCTV \u2013 all for the purposes of fraud, theft or vandalism prevention, of course. According to civil rights watchdog Liberty there is not an awful lot we can do about it. Employers are permitted to monitor workers \"in so far as this is necessary and proportionate to management's reasons for so doing\". CCTV monitoring at the workplace is often carried out for security reasons and in most circumstances is viewed as reasonable. As surveillance technology develops, so too does its application in the workplace \u2013 from keyboard monitoring to biometrics. Location tracking systems, such as Google Latitude are the latest wheeze, and will enable bosses to follow our every step. Should we be alarmed? Can we trust our employers to use this technology wisely? Or in an age where we merrily post personal information to any number of social networking sites (which then try to own it), have we surrendered our right to be angry?",
