  "content": "A man complained to the Press Complaints Commission after he appeared in two newspaper pictures that showed him smoking a hookah pipe at a Glasgow caf\u00e9. He argued that the photographs published in the Glasgow Evening Times under the headline \"Sling your hookah!\" invaded his privacy. The pictures were used to illustrate an article about a \"crackdown\" by Glasgow city council on shisha cafes that were allegedly flouting the smoking ban. But the PCC rejected the smoker's complaint, and it explains why in a ruling issued today. The commission decided that although the man would generally have had a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" in the caf\u00e9 that right was compromised by his having given his consent to the photographer. The consent, however, was a matter of dispute. The complainant said he had been assured by the photographer that he would be \"out of focus\" and would therefore not be identifiable. In fact, in one of the two pictures his features were readily identifiable. But the paper's photographer denied having misled the smoker. The PCC could not establish that the photographer's comments amounted to an assurance that the man would not be identifiable. But it did make clear its regret that the photographer had used a phrase that had confused the man, and stressed the need for newspapers and magazines to \"take steps to ensure that any conditions or assurances are clearly agreed in advance\". Charlotte Dewar, head of the PCC's complaints and pre-publication services, said: \"This was an unusual and difficult case for the commission. \"Its ruling draws attention to the importance of 'full and open communication' about the taking of photographs, particularly if they show an individual in a private place\".
