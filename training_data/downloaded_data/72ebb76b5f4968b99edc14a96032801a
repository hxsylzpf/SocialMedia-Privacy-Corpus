  "content": "As electoral agendas go, they may not seem terribly radical: Yang Lingyun, a 40-year Communist party stalwart, worries about her messy housing estate. Zheng Wei wants to help residents struggling with a switch in energy providers. But the two women's modest manifestos have been enough to land them in trouble with the authorities, like many more Chinese citizens seeking to stand in local elections. Beijing police detained them \u2013 and 10 more would-be candidates \u2013 for several hours on Friday, after they met to discuss the capital's forthcoming poll. Voting is not an activity most people associate with China. But every five years citizens have the chance to pick their representative for local people's congresses, the lowest bodies in the tiered parliamentary system and the only ones determined by direct elections. The 2m places are usually claimed by carefully vetted candidates, but in theory anyone can stand if 10 constituents back them. While Beijing has a handful of independent representatives, Yang, Zheng and their friends are part of a surge of people seeking to use this law in the new election season, which began this summer and runs until next year. Li Fan, of the World and China Institute thinktank, estimates there are tens of thousands of \"citizen candidates\" this time. \"Firstly, people's civic and rights awareness has been enhanced,\" he said. \"Secondly, the relationship between the state and government is worse than before. People dealing with issues like rights protection, layoffs and housing don't have other methods \u2026 thirdly, Weibo [China's Twitter-like microblog service] plays an important role.\" \"In 2006 media were not allowed to report [on independent candidates]. This year there is social media, providing a platform for people to communicate thoughts, exchange ideas and support each other.\" Would-be representatives are posting messages on Weibo, uploading videos, even producing campaign T-shirts. Zheng and her friends have natty red sashes and a large banner that says: \"Honoured to take part in the election for the people's congress\". But their zeal has been matched by official attempts to impede them. Despite Friday's detentions, Beijing is considered one of the more tolerant areas. Authorities in other places have used technicalities to disqualify would-be candidates, have threatened nominators and have harassed those seeking to stand. The law states that local election committees must \"confirm\" candidates; many have simply been omitted from the final list of names. Liu Ping, a labour activist in eastern Jiangxi province, was detained at a hotel until the poll had passed. In Hangzhou, Xu Yan quit his job but stayed in the race when tax officials began investigating his employers. In Guangzhou, Liang Shuxin \u2013 a male party member \u2013 was suddenly told only female non-communists could stand. Though the rule was subsequently withdrawn, he did not appear on the candidate list.Many of these people are long-term activists and some see making the elections meaningful as a possible stepping stone to wider changes in China's political system. But for the most part, their aims are notably restrained. The Beijing group talks of supporting isolated old people, improving relations between neighbours and making sure young children have nursery places. \"They are not really independent candidates in the sense of partisan politics. They are simply citizens who are running of their own accord and want to truly represent the people,\" said Dr Yawei Liu of the Carter Centre's China programme. Local congresses are largely rubber-stamp bodies, but Liu pointed out that powers such as approving budgets were potentially important. \"If there are enough of these candidates around they will be able to hold the government accountable. Hence, there seem to be efforts to prevent them from running,\" he said. Others think the authorities fear independent representatives could encourage growing assertiveness among the public in general. The increased pressure appears to be counterproductive in many cases. Liu Ping's detention prompted others to launch their own campaigns. Zheng Wei wants to sue police for detaining her on Friday and still plans to stand for election. \"Every time I went to register they told me to wait at home and they would come to register me, but so far no one has come,\" she said. \"Our previous experience of rights protection has been filled with trouble, but we strengthen our determination in the face of difficulties.\"",
