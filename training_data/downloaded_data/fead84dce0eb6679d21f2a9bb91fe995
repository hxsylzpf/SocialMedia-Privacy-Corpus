  "content": "What's that? You think it's easy filling a page each week with this gibberish? Well, it is. But some weeks aren't as easy as others. For one thing, pretty much all I've been aware of all week is snow tumbling from the sky, and everyone else has already written about that - and I mean everyone, from Melanie Phillips to the late Roy Kinnear. The only other thing I've noticed is some kind of acute muscular spasm in my neck and left shoulder, and that's hardly entertaining, except maybe for the bit where the doctor rather brilliantly prescribed me diazepam so I necked some and walked very slowly around the Westfield shopping centre listening to Henry Mancini's Pink Panther theme on repeat on an MP3 player, smiling eerily at shoppers. Anyway, being stumped, I decided to ask the people following me on Twitter for some one-word suggestions as to what to write about. For the two or three of you who don't already know, Twitter - which has garnered almost as much coverage as the snow in recent weeks - is a monumentally pointless \"social networking\" thingamajig that lets you type 140-word ponderings or questions to an audience of other timewasters. The high point in Twittering history appears to be an incident last week in which Stephen Fry got stuck in a lift and passed the time by \"tweeting\" about it in real time. Since Fry has about 100,000 followers on Twitter (other users who sign up so they can read about your every move - like benevolent stalkers, basically), this made his ordeal both more entertaining for him and a harmless diversion for everyone else. Like most meaningless indulgences, it sounds fairly nauseating to anyone who hasn't given it a go, but once you've \"got it\", there's something strangely compelling about it. It's the online equivalent of popping bubble wrap. Anyway, the people of Twitter had helped me out once before by explaining how to cook a haggis, which I needed to know in a hurry for reasons too dull to explain. This time I asked them to suggest subjects for this column - and limited them to one word, thinking that might make the selection process easier. In reality, it was like sticking your head out of the window of a moving car and finding the atmosphere was made of words instead of air. Still, having asked for suggestions, it would be churlish not to use some of them. So here's a selection of micro-columns on the most popular suggestions, in order of frequency: SNOW: Every other suggestion, predictably, was \"snow\" - thereby giving me an excuse to write about it after all. I'm not a snow fan. It's cold, white mould and nothing more. Still, the worst thing about the snow is all the TV news reports filled with \"Your Pictures\" of tittering cretins building snowmen. One after the other, all of them rubbish. Having wasted airtime displaying 10,000 dull family snaps, the anchors still weren't satiated - \"Do keep sending your snow photos to our email address,\" they repeatedly pleaded. Jesus Christ, why not abuse your position and ask the audience to send in something genuinely interesting, like close-ups of intimate body parts? BALE: Another popular suggestion: Christian Bale's shoutburst. It wasn't actually that unreasonable: a director of photography adjusting lights in an actor's eyeline during a take is a huge no-no, especially if they do it repeatedly. Also, if the makers of the film are canny, they'll leave his tantrum in the finished cut and work round it. Might break the fourth wall for a bit, but it's guaranteed box office. GOLLIWOGS: Should Carol Thatcher have been sacked from The One Show on the basis of a private, unaired conversation? No, but then she didn't apologise or clarify what she meant afterwards, so yes. That's that cleared up. SEX/FELCHING/NIPPLES etc: A fair proportion of the requests were for \"naughty\" subjects, either body parts or unconventional sexual practices, which suggests a public thirst for unnecessary smut which the Guardian is spectacularly failing to address. The editors don't like me writing about this sort of thing, but the people have spoken, goddamit - so, for the record, my favourite unconventional sexual practice (to read about, not actually partake in, you understand) is \"docking\", which refers to two men facing each other with their penises out; one extends his foreskin and tucks it over the head of the other one's member, thereby \"docking\" them together. There. You'll never see that mentioned in the Daily Telegraph, which is why this is the greatest newspaper in the world. WOTSITS/DIRIGIBLES/TEACAKES/ SONGSMITH etc: See, the problem with asking thousands of people for one-word suggestions is that you're quickly swamped with so many disparate and random entries the exercise becomes less useful than flipping through a dictionary at random. This tallies with my how-to-cook-a-haggis query experience, incidentally: I got so many contradictory responses I was left unsure whether to steam it for 45 minutes or bake it in foil for an hour and a half - which wouldn't matter really, except I was also warned that to cook it incorrectly would result in terrible food poisoning. To glance back through this list, it would seem that asking Twitter for advice on what to write about isn't a great gambit, full stop. The top three suggestions were either too obvious or have been covered at length elsewhere, and the rest were either too dirty to go into in detail (a shame, in my view), or blended into white noise by dint of sheer volume. In summary, I've learned nothing and neither have you. But it's passed some time. And that's Twitter all over. Anyway, next week: Israel v Palestine - who's right? This week Charlie began chewing his way through the final season of The Shield: \"Essentially, it's a comic-book version of The Wire, but none the worse for that.\"",
