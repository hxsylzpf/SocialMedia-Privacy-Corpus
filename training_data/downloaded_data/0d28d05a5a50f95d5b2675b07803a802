A series of patent applications filed in 2013, published recently by Disney, reveal that the company is working on ways of using drones to replace traditional firework displays and large balloons marionette-controlled from the ground by puppeteers. \"In a manner similar to hands holding a control frame of a string puppet, the airborne vehicles are moved, through a flight plan to support and position the tether/connection points of the marionette to articulate or animate the character mimicked by the marionette,\" explains the patent. The patent describes how multiple characters or puppets could be suspended in mid-air by the drones and moved through a carefully choreographed routine, interacting with one another or creating a super-sized display. Each drone could be controlled from the ground or built into a system where the drones are aware of each others' presence, synchronising movements that could adjust for gusts of wind or other disturbances that could throw a drone out of position. \"This is a significant improvement over prior flying characters, which typically were provided in the form of parade or other blimps/balloons filled with hot air or other gases and that had little and/or awkward articulation of any movable parts,\" the patent says. Drones have become the centre of attention over privacy and safety concerns in both the US and the UK. In the UK, no drone can be flown commercially within 50m of a building although the House of Lords is holding an enquiry into the civil use of drones. The US Federal Aviation Authority is currently looking to integrate drones into its commercial aircraft regulations, but new laws are not expected until the end of the year at the earliest. Current guidelines that restrict civilian hobbyists to flying under 400 feet and with drones that weigh no more than 55lbs, forbidding commercial use of drones without license. It is not known how soon Disney would look to introduce drones over its theme parks, but it would likely need special permission to fly them with civilian safety a primary factor. However, we could see a giant-sized flying Mickey, Donald or Nemo in the near future hovering above a theme park or two.",
