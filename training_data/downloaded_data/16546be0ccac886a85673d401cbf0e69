  "content": "And so it came: the final curtain on the most successful managerial career in world football, announced not in a frenzied press conference, nor in a ceremonial farewell on the Old Trafford pitch \u2013 but in a 97-character tweet. Such is the modern way, the official confirmation of Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement from his Manchester United perch was made on Twitter, with the post: \"Sir Alex Ferguson retires. #thankyousiralex\". Hacks hoping for the inside track on his successor would do well to follow the @MUFCOfficial account, and perhaps keep an eye on tweets mentioning Jos\u00e9 Mourinho or David Moyes.",
