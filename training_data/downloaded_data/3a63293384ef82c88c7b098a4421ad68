News Corp revealed that its Fox Interactive Media arm, which includes MySpace, will miss its goal of an 80% increase in revenue by \"about 10%\". The division had been predicted to generate up to $1bn. The news is a setback for News Corp's chairman, Murdoch, who has made MySpace the centrepiece of his media empire's digital strategy. It could raise questions over the soaring valuation of competitors such as Facebook. News Corp's chief operating officer, Peter Chernin, said earlier growth projections had been \"very aggressive\" and that the group remained satisfied: \"Despite the obstacles we're facing, what we're accomplishing is extraordinary.\" Chernin said one of the reasons for the shortfall was the tricky task of evaluating the commercial potential of contacts in cyberspace: \"It's still difficult to quantify the economic value of a friend in the social networking space.\" He said advertisers were accustomed to basing their thinking on long-established measures. In spite of this, News Corp maintains that MySpace is the strongest social networking offering on the net. In the key US market, it boasts 73 million regular users compared to Facebook's 36 million, each of whom spends an average of 44% more time on the site than Facebook users. The figures emerged as News Corp's global profits jumped by $1.8bn to $2.7bn, largely due to a gain of $1.7bn from the transfer of its stake in DirecTV to Liberty Media. The results included a $21m profit from newly acquired Dow Jones, which includes the Wall Street Journal. Speaking on a conference call, Murdoch said his initial impressions of Dow Jones were positive: \"The more time I spend working with the company, the more opportunities I see in improving and expanding its businesses.\" He said he saw particular potential in Dow Jones' newswires, its cuttings service and its indices operation, which compiles Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average. All of these, Murdoch said, could prosper as they serve the rapidly growing financial services industry in emerging markets. \"It may take time but I'm as confident about it as I've been for any acquisition I've ever done,\" he added. Elsewhere, News Corp confirmed it has tabled a bid for the Long Island-based newspaper Newsday, thought to be in the region of $580m. Murdoch wants to combine Newsday's back-office functions with those of his New York Post title to improve cashflow by $100m annually. He brushed aside suggestions that competing buyer Cablevision might outbid him. In Britain, earnings grew in double-digit terms at News Corp's stable of newspapers - the Sun, the News of the World, the Times and the Sunday Times - partly because of the decommissioning of older printing presses as the papers move to new colour facilities.",
