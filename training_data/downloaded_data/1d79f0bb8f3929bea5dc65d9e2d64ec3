  "content": "Recent flooding and other extreme weather events are the most obvious signs that unless we live more sustainably we will face increasingly biblical consequences. Literal storms have arrived within a dreadful economic climate, leading to cuts that threaten the social care, health and other services that an ageing and unhealthy population relies on in increasing numbers. Industrialisation and hi-tech financial markets helped get us into this mess. Now technology, if used to empower people and communities, holds the key to creating a sustainable future. Take waste as an example. It was not so long ago that all waste was chucked into one bin that would be emptied into a giant landfill site, poisoning land, water and air. Now in London, Lambeth council runs a system where food waste is collected separately to be anaerobically digested creating fuel and compost for farming. Recyclables are sorted at a high-tech plant for use as new materials while the small amount of waste that is left over is incinerated to create energy. Since November, when this new system was rolled out with a social media campaign, recycling has increased by 34% and waste is down by one third or 8,000 tonnes. None of this would be possible without residents feeling they are part of a collective effort, doing their bit by separating waste for everyone's benefit. Meanwhile in the same south London borough an unlikely challenger to the 'big six' energy companies is rising from some of the poorest social housing estates in the country. Brixton Energy, a co-operative owned and run by local residents and workers, has placed hundreds of solar panels on the roofs of blocks of flats. Investors get a 3% return for financing the set-up costs and local people benefit from jobs, training and money back on their service charge. Social media has helped Lambeth council recruit hundreds of 'green champions' to support communities to take action to improve their environment. The borough now has 60 environmental groups and 150 community food growing projects reducing pollution and traffic whilst encouraging people to work together, learn new skills, exercise and produce healthy food. This is part of the area's efforts to improve the health of residents and technology has an important part to play. In Singapore three million patients, or 60% of the population, are seen by doctors through remote consultations on digital media. In the UK, telemedicine is nothing like as widespread but it is improving access and outcomes while also cutting costs and waiting times. Across the country, councils and the NHS are investing in telecare and telehealth services which use technology to help people live more independently at home. As well as digital consultations they include personal alarms and health-monitoring devices. Sensors can check whether a person has had a fall, got back into bed safely, has a high heart rate, blood pressure or blood sugar level and alert a family member, warden or health and social care service. Nearly everyone wants to stay in their own home as long as possible and technology makes this possible for longer which also saves the taxpayer the cost of residential care. From generating green energy and improving recycling to enabling independence and reducing isolation technology has great potential to help our communities become more environmentally, economically and socially sustainable. The trick is to ensure that such technologies are used to connect people in a common endeavour and that those who most need it, the poorest and the oldest, are not excluded through lack of resources or support.
