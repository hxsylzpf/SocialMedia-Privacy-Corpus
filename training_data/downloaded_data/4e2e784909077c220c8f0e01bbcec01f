  "content": "Twitter has added an intriguing new feature, which it calls \"lists\": essentially, any person can create groups of Twitter accounts that they think are alike or useful in some way. So for example the @guardiantech account is already on 29 lists (at the last count) - you can see them all at http://twitter.com/guardiantech/lists/memberships. That formula of twitter.com/$user/lists/memberships works for any account, by the way. Try it on yourself. Here's Dave Winer's; and here should be Robert Scoble's, except I got an error while trying it. [Update: you may find these fail if you (a) aren't on Twitter or (b) haven't had an invite to lists.] The question now is, how will this be used? Who and what is it good for? Winer makes an interesting suggestion: It's a new authority system. The number of lists you appear on is a kind of page-rank. So let's hope Twitter does two things: 1. Provides an open API to crawl this data set. 2. Doesn't pollute it by artificially inflating the rank of friendly press and their industry friends. Stay out of the editorial space and let a healthy ecosystem develop. It's another chance to not screw it up. Some people have said it's somehow related to the Suggested User List but I don't see it at all. This feature is for advanced users, the SUL is for total newbies. Unless Twitter somehow data mines our lists, something they could have done right at the start, it won't have any impact on the newbies' user experience. (Winer's reference to \"friendly press\" there is because he believes - I use the word specifically - that publications which are on Twitter's Suggested User List, or SUL, are therefore skewed to write favourable stories about it. [Disclosure: the Guardian's Technology account is on the SUL, but it was purely a decision made by Twitter without the Guardian's knowledge.] I've challenged him previously to prove this, as there are plenty of examples of publications that are and are not on the SUL which also cover Twitter. He hasn't risen to the challenge. And we disagree with the suggestion that we are \"friendly\" to Twitter in our coverage.) So... what will lists tell us? Whether people have a reputation - clearly, if you're on a lot of lists belonging to different users, then it's likely that you're viewed as having some reputation within Twitter. (If you're only on lots of lists belonging to one user, they're just a bit of a stalker.) Winer's suggestion that Twitter - or anyone, via the API - could mine lists to find people with reputation certainly sounds like a good one. The only problem then becomes: is being on many lists the key to that reputation? Or do you have to add something more, such as the number of followers that the people making those lists have, to determine their reputation? The latter question arises because you can imagine that some imaginative spammers - the sort who are always offering you pictures of Britney and her hands-free pink Thermos - will create lists from their thousands of fake accounts in which their thousands of fake accounts recommend each other. Twitter is thus going to face the same problem as Google - how to stop people from trying to game its rankings (if that's how it plans to put lists to use). In which case it might start using the number of followers that the list-maker has as its other criterion for judging \"reputation\". In which case the accounts on the SUL are going to be those with the most weight. Hmm, can you see a problem brewing here?",
