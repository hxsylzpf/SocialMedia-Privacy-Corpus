  "content": "@jazm ROFL @ Rolf \u2022@Rory_Foster The Cheek show potential but material's a bit thin. Think I'll wait for the second album when their songwriting's matured \u2022@laurenloquax Peggy Sue opened the Park with their usual charm. Ideal for easing us all into Friday while sitting in the sun! Lush \u2022@lexplex_ The Rabbit Hole is hiding many musical gems, like Bryony Marie Fry who has a record deal imminent \u2022@lexplex_ Steve Mason was sheer sonic cool. The best of Beta Band and King Biscuit Time in a shiny solo package \u2022@lba_dub Ellie Goulding v Snoop Dogg cursing game: one \"bloody\" v ... er, lost count after five secs \u2022@Wendy_Oloya Snoop offered gin and juice, which he passed to the crowd, reminding us what his m*****f****** name was. Beautiful \u2022@angelus1981 Perfect Snoop weather. Can't help thinking privileged white kids wouldn't be krunking like this in the pissing rain \u2022@lba_dub Gorillaz \u2013 didn't work for me. Damon's other band were 100 times better last year \u2022@EcoTrek2010 Can't even begin to do justice to how amazing Florence was. Doubt I'll see an act this weekend that tops that euphoria \u2022@lexplex_ Mystery Jets haven't skipped a beat since I first saw them in 2004. Really personable stage presence \u2022@charlierapple Disproportionate number of gingers in the audience for Newton Faulkner. Some don't look natural \u2013 I think they are spies #gmreview",
