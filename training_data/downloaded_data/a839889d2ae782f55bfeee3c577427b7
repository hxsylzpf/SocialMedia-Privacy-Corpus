  "content": "BuzzFeed's interview with David Cameron on Monday evening revealed an important fact about the prime minister's views \u2013 his favourite Game of Thrones character is Ned Stark (as played by Sean Bean). However, Monkey notes that on the very Facebook page from which the Cameron interview was streamed sits a Photoshopped photo from an earlier BuzzFeed article that offers a slightly different take on which GoT character Cameron should feel the most affinity with. Cameron's face is superimposed not on Bean, but palace spymaster (and eunuch) Lord Varys, otherwise known as the Spider. Perhaps that would have been a less noble choice, but then (spoiler alert), at least Varys made it past season one without losing his head.",
