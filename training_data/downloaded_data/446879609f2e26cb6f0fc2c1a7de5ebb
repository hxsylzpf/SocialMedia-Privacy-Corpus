For mood on social networks is contagious, and spreads to those you are connected to, scientists say. Researchers in the US analysed over a billion updates from a million or so Facebook users and found that negative posts had a domino effect, causing similarly downbeat posts from others. But the effect was not confined to negative emotions. When people posted happy messages on the site, these spread too, and proved even more contagious than the less cheerful ones. \"People are not just choosing other people like themselves to associate with, but are actually causing their friends' emotional expressions to change,\" said James Fowler, professor of medical genetics and political science at the University of California in San Diego. Emotions are well known to spread among people, but most work on the effect has looked at those in direct contact with each other. The latest study confirms that the same happens when people are in contact online. The researchers used a computer program to analyse the emotional content of anonymous English status updates on Facebook from January 2009 to March 2012. The scientists had no information on the names of the people, or even the content of their messages. To test if emotions might spread from one person to another, the scientists looked at how updates changed when it rained. Rain has a reliable impact on the tone of Facebook posts, with negative ones rising by 1.16% and positive ones falling by 1.19%. The study looked at the posts of people who were friends with someone who lived in a city that was being rained on, but were crucially not in a city hit by rain themselves. According to Fowler, every downbeat post triggered an extra 1.29 more negative posts than normal among people's friends. Every happy post led to an extra 1.75 positive posts among friends. Details of the study are published in the online scientific journal Plos One. The researchers said that, if anything, their study probably underplays the strength of the effect. \"To get away from measuring the effect of the rain itself, we had to exclude the effects of posts on friends who live in the same cities. But we have a pretty good sense from other studies that people who live near each other have stronger relationships and influence each other even more. If we could measure those relationships, we would probably find even more contagion,\" Fowler said.",
