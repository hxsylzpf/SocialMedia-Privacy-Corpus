Sources told the paper the band would break for a year to work on lucrative solo projects. In the grand tradition of band breakups, countless people have predicted a social media meltdown when One Direction eventually go their separate ways. Naturally, the fans had plenty to say about it.

Fortunately for those who were feeling devastated by the news, there were those with advice on hand, from people who dealt with 90s boyband breakups. Or those who managed to bring Jeremy Corbyn into it, pointing out they featured in a Daily Mail piece about an apocalyptic Britain under his leadership. There's always a silver lining! So far, there has been no word from the band over whether the reports are true or not. A 1D spokesman said: \"We don't comment on speculation.\"",
