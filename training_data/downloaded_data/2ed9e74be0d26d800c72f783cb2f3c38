  "content": "Russell Crowe has been forced to remove and apologise for comments made on Twitter about circumcision following a backlash from his followers. Crowe became the latest Hollywood star to land himself in trouble on the micro-blogging site when he labelled the procedure \"barbaric and stupid\". The film-maker Eli Roth later took to Twitter to defend his friend against accusations of antisemitism after being drawn into the row. Crowe's difficulties began on Thursday night when a fan asked if he planned to have his newborn child circumcised. The Oscar-winning actor, who tweets using the @russellcrowe tag, responded: \"Circumcision is barbaric and stupid. Who are you to correct nature? Is it real that GOD requires a donation of foreskin?\" He continued: \"I love my Jewish friends, I love the apples and the honey and the funny little hats but stop cutting yr babies. if you feel it is yr right to cut things off yr babies.\" It was at this point that Roth, who is Jewish, was drawn into the debate after Crowe used the @eliroth tag to alert the Hostel director to his comments. The New Zealand-born actor is due to star in martial arts movie The Man With the Iron Fists, which Roth is writing and producing. In response to a suggestion about circumcision from one of his followers, Crowe later wrote: \"Hygienic? Why don't you sew up your ass then?\" Sometime on Friday morning, Crowe appeared to realise that his comments were causing offence to his followers and had been picked up by the media. He removed the tweets and wrote: \"I have a deep and abiding love for all people of all nationalities, I'm very sorry that I have said things on here that have caused distress. My personal beliefs aside I realise that some will interpret this debate as me mocking the rituals and traditions of others. I am very sorry.\" Roth released a statement that said: \"I am deeply, deeply disturbed at the media's portrayal of Russell Crowe as an anti-Semite for making a joke to me on Twitter. \"Russell and I are great friends, and often tease each other publicly, as you can see from my response ... Not one person from any media outlet contacted me to ask if it was a joke or not before running their vicious stories, which is indicative of a much more serious problem.\" Roth had responded to Crowe's jibe with the tweet: \"You didn't seem to be complaining when I was recutting you this afternoon ...\" The director went on to describe Crowe as \"one of the nicest people I have ever been lucky enough to meet and work with\". He told TMZ: \"It's tabloid journalism at its worst. No one contacted either of us. It's terrible. Russell is a great person and respectful of all religions. \"The press is trying to terrify celebrities into not using Twitter. They want to show they can still ruin you. It's sickening.\" Cher, Jim Carrey and Kevin Smith are among other Hollywood figures who have taken to Twitter and (presumably) later regretted it. The first launched a tirade against Academy voters after a song featured in her film Burlesque was snubbed for the 2011 best song Oscar, while the last implied via Twitter that only critics who had paid to see his latest film Cop Out were in a position to badmouth it. Carrey used Twitter to defend golf star Tiger Woods's infidelities last year, implying that the sportsman's wife Elin Nordegren ought to take some of the blame.",
