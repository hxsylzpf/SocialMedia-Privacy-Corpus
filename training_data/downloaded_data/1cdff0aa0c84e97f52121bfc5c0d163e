  "content": "BBC News and the Guardian are the first UK media companies to sign up to a new Facebook initiative that will transform the way users read news articles. Facebook has become an increasingly important source of online traffic for news publishers, but the US web giant says that the process of reading articles on mobiles is one of the slowest parts of its app. Currently, mobile readers have to click on a link in their news feed with a wait of more than eight seconds for the article to load in another web page \u2013 a slow experience in the fast-paced internet world. The new initiative, called Instant Articles, will see stories run within Facebook that the company says will make for a seamless loading experience 10 times faster than the current system. Facebook has signed up BuzzFeed, the New York Times, National Geographic, NBC News and The Atlantic as US partners with the first five articles from each using Instant Articles launching today (Wednesday). BBC News, the Guardian, Bild and Spiegel are the first European publishers to sign up to trial the new product, with the first articles due to be published later in the summer. \"It is great to see Facebook trialling new ways for quality journalism to flourish on mobile,\" said Tony Danker, international director for Guardian News &amp; Media, publisher of the Guardian and Observer. \"The Guardian is keen to test how the new platform can provide an even more engaging experience for our readers.\" The arrival of Instant Articles has been treated with caution by some publishers who are concerned about how much user data to which Facebook might get access, as well as whether this could be just the first move by the US internet giant in controlling more content. \"We are working with publishers to give even more insight into how stories are read and people engage around it,\" said Justin Osofsky, vice-president of media partnerships and global operations at Facebook. Michael Reckhow, product manager for Instant Articles at Facebook, refuted reports that speculated that publishers might not get as much user data information if stories are hosted by Facebook. He said that Instant Articles will support traffic measurement from major firms such as Adobe Analytics (formerly Omniture), Google Analytics and ComScore, which publishers get audience data from to then sell big ad campaigns, so that publishers will continue to \"get traffic credit\". Facebook is aiming to entice publishers by offering them 100% of the ad revenue that they sell around articles, and 70% of the advertising inventory that Facebook sells. \"It is vital that, over time, Instant Articles delivers recurring benefit for publishers, whose continued investment in original content underpins its success,\" said Danker. Mike Matas, product designer on Instant Articles, said that the new in-Facebook experience would be far superior with the ability to add geo-location tags, \"like\", comment and even zoom to high resolution photos by tilting the phone. \"Publishers can bring all their branding, people should feel that they are on National Geographic or the Guardian,\" he said. Facebook is becoming a behemoth in the mobile advertising space with global ad revenues expected to hit $11bn this year, according to eMarketer. By 2017 this figure will be $17.68bn. Mobile advertising has exploded on Facebook and will account for 71% of its total projected $15.5bn global ad revenues this year.",
