  "content": "It isn't easy for a web-based music company to come up with a great, original idea, realise it effectively and then convince people they need it in their lives. But even if they succeed in those areas, creating a business which can actually make a profit remains fiendishly difficult: indeed, it continues to elude big players like Spotify and Last.fm. Yet a new service called mflow thinks it might just have cracked it. And from the growing buzz ahead of its full launch on April 15, it seems quite a few people agree. Download the free mflow software and you're presented with a desktop application/player not dissimilar to iTunes. Users can then search a large (but by no means exhaustive) catalogue of music, hear 30 second previews and buy high quality MP3s for 79p-99p per track. The big twist is that mflow also closely resembles Twitter: you can follow other mflow users and they can follow you. If someone wants to recommend a track to their followers, they \"flow\" it, along with a tweet-sized comment. The followers then get one chance to stream the song in full via their \"inbox\", which is essentially a continuous playlist of all the tracks flowed to them. To add further spice, if a follower decides to purchase a track, whoever flowed it is credited with 20% of the price paid, to put towards downloading tracks. Mflow has been in beta testing for a while now, but has hit its stride in recent weeks as more people have been invited to try the service. Crucially, those early users include some influential music fans and tastemakers. Sign up, and you can effectively stream on-demand DJ sets put together by NME, Tim Lovejoy, Phill Jupitus or Popjustice (those last two are particularly worthy of a follow). And if you don't like the music they're flowing, simply unfollow them. The service certainly seems to be snagging the interest of those trying it. To give it a go, head to mflow.com and use the invite codes currently being offered by two further enthusiastic mflow users: Zane Lowe (ZANE444) and Clash magazine (CLASH0403). There are two big questions. Firstly, can mflow attract the interest of enough users, in a scene dominated by Twitter and Facebook? It's quality, ease of use and plans to allow flows directly to those two social networking giants suggest it can. But, more crucially, will it actually encourage people to buy music? That is less clear. Follow enough people and you'll be able to hear a constant stream of recommended music. When you're getting that for free, why pay for anything? The danger for mflow is that its \"buy\" button might become as widely ignored as Spotify's. Send your links to chris.salmon@theguardian.com",
