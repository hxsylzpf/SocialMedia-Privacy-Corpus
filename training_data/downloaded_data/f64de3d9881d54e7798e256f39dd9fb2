The cabinet has agreed in principle to the removal of two restrictions that are likely to lead to mergers and acquisitions. Lifting the first, the so-called two-out-of-three rule, will allow media companies to own radio, TV stations and newspapers in a single market. Scrapping the second, known as the reach rule, will end the prohibition on TV networks broadcasting to more than 75% of the population. Communications minister Mitch Fifield told ABC: \"There is the opportunity to bring Australia's media laws into the 21st century to make sure that they reflect not the analogue world, but to capture and cater for the world that we live in today.\" But the abolition of the two-out-of-three rule - which exists in order to protect media diversity - could well prove controversial. Some opposition politicians believe it would enable Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to tighten its grip on Australian media. Although the rule is deemed to be outdated because of the rise of digital media players such as Google, Facebook and Netflix, the main beneficiaries could be \"old media\" companies like News Corp and Fairfax. However, Murdoch has also implied that the reforms are more favourable for his rivals at the Nine Network rather than his own company. Fifield's plan to lift the reach rule is more likely to be acceptable to the Labor opposition. It has had the effect of preventing metropolitan TV networks from merging with, or acquiring, their regional affiliates. Ian Audsley, chief executive of one of the regional network owners, Prime Media, greeted the cabinet's decision. He said: \"This will hopefully see an end to outdated media laws that distinctly disadvantage regional television broadcasters.\" Labor's communications spokesman Jason Clare said the opposition supported the lifting of the reach rule, but removing the two-out-of-three rule is more problematic. Now Fifield, who announced in mid-January that he was talking to all parties with the aim of reforming the rules, must seek parliamentary approval for his changes. Clearly, he has the support of Australia's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who is a former communications minister. Sources: AAP via SBS/ABC/Financial Review. Current media diversity rules: Acma",
