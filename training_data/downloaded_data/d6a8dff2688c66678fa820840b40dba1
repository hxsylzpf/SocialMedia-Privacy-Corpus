But still he refused to apologise to the court. His lawyer said an apology might make people think of Lord Black as a broken man and a criminal. He clearly still regards himself as neither. Black, 63, was found guilty on three counts of fraud and one of obstructing justice. It was an extraordinary fall from grace for the millionaire press baron who had once run the third-largest newspaper business in the world and had homes in London, New York, Palm Beach and Toronto. He had given up his Canadian citizenship for a peerage and counted Margaret Thatcher, Princess Michael of Kent and Henry Kissinger as friends. The sentence was far more lenient than prosecutors had hoped. The tycoon had, perhaps wisely, not taken the stand during his trial - his flamboyant language had in the past got him in trouble with judges. Lord Browne Browne's remarkable career came to a dramatic end when he was forced to resign as chief executive of BP after lying in court about his relationship with a man. Browne's downfall came while fighting a four-month legal battle to suppress newspaper reports about the relationship. He lost his case because he claimed under oath to have met his former partner, Canadian Jeff Chevalier, while jogging in a London park. It emerged that they had in fact met through a male escort agency's website. As he quit, Browne expressed \"deep disappointment\" that his personal life should be made public. He forfeited a leaving package worth about \u00a315.5m. Once hailed as the Sun King of the oil industry, Browne had been at BP for 41 years and was for a time one of the most admired businessmen in Britain. He had run the company since 1995 and built the business through a series of daring acquisitions. But Browne's reputation began to show scars after pipeline leaks in Alaska, allegations of oil and propane-trading manipulation, and the Texan refinery fire in 2005 that killed 15 people. He had been due to stand down in the summer but brought his retirement forward and was replaced by Tony Hayward. Stan O'Neal The head of Merrill Lynch fell on his sword in October after a high-risk strategy of betting billions on mortgage-backed securities went disastrously wrong. Goldman Sachs said Merrill's losses from the sub-prime crisis would reach $12bn. O'Neal's opposite number at Citigroup, Charles \"Chuck\" Prince, also went. Losses at Citigroup are predicted to reach $19bn. Mike Ashley The reclusive founder of the cut-price sportswear chain Sports Direct reluctantly joined public life when the billionaire floated his business on the stock market. Those who bought shares in February have seen more than 65% of the value of the stock wiped off after the company issued three profit warnings. Ashley spent \u00a3133m of his gains on buying Newcastle United. Carlos Slim Carlos Slim, the cigar-chomping Mexican telecoms billionaire, became the world's second-richest man. With a fortune of $53.1bn, he is behind only the Microsoft magnate Bill Gates. Clara Furse The Canadian boss of the London Stock Exchange demonstrated her grit when she saw off a takeover attempt by the US electronic exchange, Nasdaq. Increasingly generous bids in recent years from Sweden, Germany, Australia and the US have all met with the same refusal. James Murdoch Rupert Murdoch's younger son was anointed successor of News Corp at the age of 35 when he was put in charge of the business in Asia and Europe. Mark Zuckerberg Facebook's founder, aged 23, became Silicon Valley's latest billionaire. The sale of a stake to Microsoft in October valued Facebook at $15bn.",
