Britain is getting its Abigail's Party started as we return to the 1970s in our shopping habits, according to John Lewis. With sales of vinyl records soaring, John Lewis' annual survey of its customers shopping habits reveals retro-technology including record players and wall clocks are returning to homes being decorated in the brown and orange tones of Mike Leigh's 1977 play about a suburban drinks party. The retailer's How We Shop, Live &amp; Look report for 2015 suggests other trends from 40 years ago are returning, including macrame pouffes, sales of platform shoes continuing to grow, and wallpapers (up 11%). Even modern technology, such as headphones and cameras, is being given a retro spin. Sales of classic Vitra Eames chairs bounced 758%. Fashions in items for the home echo similar trends in clothing. Seventies-inspired designer looks first returned to the catwalk three years ago, but are expected to reach the peak of popularity on UK high streets ahead of Christmas. \"Fashion has gone full circle,\" said John Lewis chief executive Andy Street. Sales of platform shoes are up by 14% compared to last year at the department store. Cords, suede and flares are all on trend in shades of caramel and coffee. It's a continuation of a fashion flashback that drove thousands of Marks &amp; Spencer's shoppers to snap up its vintage-influenced suede skirt and brought flares swishing back to Gucci's catwalk this spring. John Lewis says Brits are becoming much more adventurous about how they are prepared to style themselves and their homes \u2013 thanks to the influence of social media. Inspiration from sites such as Pinterest, Instagram and Facebook is encouraging shoppers to become their own stylists, while vloggers such as Zoella and Sali Hughes are helping people create tricky hair or make-up looks. Desire for an instant fashion fix has driven an 86% rise in sales of women's clothing via mobile devices including phones and tablet computers. Street believes that very modern-day surge in online shopping will underpin a solid 2% rise in sales this Christmas. Wages are rising ahead of inflation, giving shoppers more free cash to spend. But Street warns that retailers of clothing, homewares might never enjoy as big a proportion of shoppers' spending as they had in the past as shoppers spend more on services. A quarter of John Lewis customers surveyed said they were spending more on holidays abroad this year. \"It is obvious is that customers do have more disposable income than last year. Some of the things they are spending their income on \u2013 eating out and holidays have had a good run,\" he said. \"What is interesting is whether that increase income will feed through into traditional non-food ... Food has taken a progressively smaller share of spending. The question coming is whether the same thing is happening with non-food retail.\" One bright light for fashion and gift retailers, is that shoppers may be prepared to go back to more traditional presents this year as a spike in sales of tablet computers comes to an end. \"Two years ago it was all about technology. That's not going to be the case this Christmas. It is going to be more balanced. People have to be more thoughtful as they can't just reach for a tablet,\" said Street. Luxury smoothie maker the Nutribullet is currently topping shoppers' wish lists at the department store, which says healthy eating and exercise gadgets are increasingly popular. John Lewis sold one Nutribullet blender every four minutes in the past year, with thousands of spiralizers \u2013 which can be used to turn vegetables such as courgettes into an alternative to spaghetti \u2013 also selling every week. Sales of performance-monitoring devices rose 52% in the past year, with sales of leading brand FitBit more than tripling. Yoga mats, weights and men's running tights (up 64%) are also flying through the tills. Different health trends are apparent from varying customer demands in different parts of the country. Norwich recorded the highest increase in sales of treadmills \u2013 more than the 150% increase in Glasgow \u2013 while the Nutribullet was most popular in the south-west London suburb of Kingston upon Thames. Sales of beauty treatments are also on the rise \u2013 up 11% at the group over the past year. That's part of a growing trend towards spending on services \u2013 from facials to dining out and TV installations. John Lewis's opened its first in-store spa at its new Birmingham premises as a trial which might be rolled out elsewhere if deemed a success. More cafes and restaurants, including Benugo in London and Hotel Chocolat - now in Edinburgh, are also going into stores to cater to demand. Street said: \"What's clear is the customers comes for a day out to a prestige location of their choice and want to make it more of an experience.\" Part of the reason the shops' purpose is changing is because an increasing proportion of sales are moving online. About one-third of the department store's sales are booked online, up from just 17% five years ago. In the past year, 60% of the company's online sales came via mobile devices. Street said he expected that figure to rise again this Christmas.",
