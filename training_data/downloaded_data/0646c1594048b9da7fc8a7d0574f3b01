  "content": "Court one in the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand was packed. Standing room only. A rare occasion in the building for what was neither a high-profile libel case nor an acrimonious divorce. The occasion was the hearing earlier this month to decide whether computer hacker Gary McKinnon, who faces extradition to the US for hacking into Pentagon and Nasa computers, was entitled to have a judicial review of his case, in light of the fact that he has recently been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. The offence for which the US authorities are now seeking McKinnon was committed back in 2001. Since then there have been many court appearances and millions of pounds have been spent in trying to remove him from Britain to stand trial in the US. Until the hearing in court one, McKinnon and his dedicated legal team had lost every action. The decision by Lord Justice Maurice Kay and Mr Justice Simon \u2013 to allow a judicial review of the home secretary's decision effectively to disregard McKinnon's medical condition \u2013 was significant in that it represents what McKinnon's lawyer, Karen Todner, described as a first \"ray of light\" in the case. So what now? McKinnon has two possible lifelines: the new director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, is considering whether or not there are grounds to prosecute McKinnon in the UK. A decision will be made by the middle of February. He could prosecute with justification as the offence was committed in the north London flat from which McKinnon hacked. McKinnon has also formally admitted an offence under the Computer Misuse Act and could be punished in the UK. Such a course would demonstrate the independence of the judiciary from the government. Second, the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, could do what the government did for the NatWest Three bankers, who were extradited to the US, and get an assurance from the US authorities that McKinnon would be granted immediate bail. She could also insist that he be immediately repatriated to serve any sentence in the UK. So far, she has failed to take even this minimal, compassionate step. Already dozens of MPs from all parties have signed an early day motion in support of this move and this week McKinnon had another champion in his corner. Here is what the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, had to say in his Daily Telegraph column: \"It is brutal, mad and wrong even to consider sending this man to America for trial. He has been diagnosed as having Asperger's syndrome, for heaven's sake. How can the British government be so protoplasmic, so pathetic, so heedless of the wellbeing of its own people, as to sign the warrant for his extradition?\" McKinnon's code name as a hacker was Solo. What has become clear over the last few weeks is that he is very far from alone.",
