  "content": "So what has the BBC's Jonathan Ross been up to during his enforced 12-week sabbatical? Well, apart from catching up on movies (he loved The Baader Meinhof Complex), eating lots of lunches, coming down with the flu, smoking cigars, helping the kids find their secret santa presents for school and watching TV in bed with his wife, Ross has discovered the wonders of the microblogging website Twitter. Which is how we know exactly what he's been up to. What, did you think we were stalking him? He's still a bit of a newbie to the whole Twitter thing, although Wossy (as he calls himself) is now following - Twitterspeak for monitoring fellow users' updates - more experienced hands Stephen Fry, John Cleese and Caitlin Moran. Wossy himself has attracted 432 followers. But with his holiday coming to an end - he's due back on radio late January - Wossy has turned to his Twitter feed for some help. Here's exactly how it appeared there: wondering what record I should play on first radio show . am maybe \"You're gonna miss me when I'm gone\" by radio Birdman. Any thoughts? We think he should play either Call Me or Hanging on The Telephone, by Blondie. But what do you think? Help the man out by posting your suggestions below.",
