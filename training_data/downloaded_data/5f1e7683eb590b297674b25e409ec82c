  "content": "Thousands of women have shared their experiences of sexual assault and rape culture on Twitter in the wake of Donald Trump's comments about grabbing women \"by the pussy\". Amid the outrage over Trump's remarks, Canadian writer Kelly Oxford called on women to tweet about their first assaults, describing the first time she was sexually assaulted, on a bus when she was 12. Oxford went on to describe a total of five sexual assaults. The response to her tweet was overwhelming, with Oxford saying she was received replies at the rate of 50 per minute for 14 hours. \"Anyone denying rape culture,\" she wrote, \"look at my timeline now.\" Many of the attacks took place when the women involved were minors. The stories, which can be viewed on her timeline, included a litany of all kinds of sexual abuse suffered by women, including rape. Oxford said the volume of the responses had left her in \"horrendous shock\" and called on Americans not to ignore their testimony. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Hotlines in other countries can be found here.",
