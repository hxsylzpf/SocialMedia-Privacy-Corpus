May the creator bless them all for their support of my precious boy,\" reads a note, which was given to Vocativ by a friend who received it via a text messaging app. It was also posted to the group \"Help for Dzhokhar\" on the Russian social networking site VKontakte. \"America is the terrorist and everyone knows it!\" it continues. \"My son is the best of the best. I embrace everyone and thank you!\" Tsarnaeva, a Russian native who left the US for Dagestan in 2012 after failing to meet a shoplifting charge, has always vocally maintained her son's innocence. She told the Associated Press the week after the bombing that the accusations against her sons were \"all lies and hypocrisy\", adding that she was \"sick and tired of all this nonsense that they make up about me and my children\". Nonetheless, Tsarnaev was convicted on all charges Wednesday afternoon in a federal courthouse in Boston, after a day and a half of jury deliberation. The trial will now move on to the sentencing phase, in which the same jury will hear evidence to help them decide whether to give the death penalty. A vote for Tsarnaev's execution must be unanimous.
