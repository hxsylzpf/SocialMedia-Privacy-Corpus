  "content": "Twitter were rather too quick off the mark to suspend the account of a California-based journalist, Darwin BondGraham, after he tweeted a document he had obtained under the state's public records act. It showed an email exchange between an employee and a customer of the law enforcement contractor, PredPol. Shortly afterwards, the employee responded on Twitter by asking BondGraham: \"Can you please not publish my personal information publicly.\" The request apparently referred to the fact that Lovell's office phone number was visible in the emails. When another user pointed out that an office number was a reasonable part of the public records request, Lovell replied that it forwarded to her personal line. That sounded like a pretty lame complaint. But, after BondGraham refused to remove the Tweet, he was shocked to receive a notification from Twitter that his account had been suspended. Within hours, after protests, Twitter \"unsuspended\" his account, prompting BondGraham to say, quite rightly: \"Twitter needs to seriously fix the way it considers reports of 'abuse' or violations of its terms of use.\" Indeed it does.
