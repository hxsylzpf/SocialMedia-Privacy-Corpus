  "content": "I have an admission. A declaration, maybe. I've had to step off the world for a few weeks. It's all spinning too fast, and there's no place to rest, no island, no solace, nowhere to spare a few hours passed out between a battle to fall asleep and being woken again long before dawn by a tornado child. Anyone who has spent a long time working on a screen and online \u2013 and I am long past my Gladwellian 10,000 hours of artisan achievement \u2013 will know the feeling. It's a creeping, anxious restlessness, created by and for the fifth gear, hyper-consumerism of the internet. It's what the mechanisms of what hundreds of thousands of shares, likes, flicks, clicks, skims, scrolls and swipes do to our minds. It's a mile wide and an inch deep, as Ev Williams pointedly cited recently. Sharing implies we have read and recommend what we're sharing and on Facebook that's often not true, especially with journalism. The endless news feed doesn't want you to read that news story \u2013 it wants you to throw yourself into the frantic social currency of scrolling, of liking and of more sharing. It isn't designed to offer the optimum environment for you to lose yourself in a thorough, well-researched piece about the health industry in the developing world, say, that invites you to comment and question the writers and experts who contributed. If an optimum reading experience were the priority, how different would Facebook feel? Curiously, it would probably feel like a book. An in-depth, single subject resource produced on a technology designed for one thing \u2013 to read, and be absorbed in it, its ideas, its characters, its opinions, and in the writer's imagination. Mark Zuckerberg has discovered \"the book\" \u2013 he finds them \"intellectually stimulating\" and has just launched a book club. He will work through 26 titles this year, starting with Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm's The End of Power \u2013 now hastily restocked on Amazon after selling out in the first few hours. How many of its 90,000 members will read every book, pore over every thought and observation? And how many will just \"share\", as an endorsement of the idea, and then move on? Zuckerberg has asked for the former, yet that's not what his own site encourages. Zuckerberg's influence can't be overestimated; he can recommend one title to the 30 million people who follow him. He can make an author overnight, and with a year of sanitised and corporately curated selections he can set the bellwether for popular thought \u2013 yet more homogeneity in a global culture increasingly defined by the internet. For anyone who wants to write a book, however, the internet is probably the greatest enemy to attention and concentrated thought, both for the writer and potential readers. It works in partnership with the mind \u2013 trained during years of internet use \u2013 not be able to concentrate on any one thing for more than 90 seconds. The cost of this butterfly attention span is creativity. There is no space and time among the constant digestion of competing stories, picture, videos, messages and emails. For every instructional video and the remarkable luxury of real-time global instant messaging, there is, on a bad day, a thousand punchlines, a thousand cannibal comment threads, an endless river of pouting, over made-up selfies all demanding your attention and once they have it, they send it off elsewhere. Drowning out noise will only get better when the software companies realise meaningful engagement requires time and curation and when the software itself can truly tailor content to our needs; current attempts are too crude. We also have to develop a new self-awareness so that we know when we're being sucked in, when we're wasting time, when we're being spun an algorithmic line. What's lost, the opportunity cost for us personally, is harder to define, but crucial. Some of the better writing on new year resolutions advised what to cut out rather than over ambitious goals to aim for. Because what I feel I lose in all this noise is creativity and original thought \u2013 random, unpredictable, exciting bursts of ideas that bubble up when you least expect them. And if we are short of creative ideas, observations and thoughts, then we are failing ourselves, recycling the flotsam and jetsam of the internet when we should be crafting ships of thought and insight that can help us navigate this formidable, overwhelming yet disappointing thing we have created.",
