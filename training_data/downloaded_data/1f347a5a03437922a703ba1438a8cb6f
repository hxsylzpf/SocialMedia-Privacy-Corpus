Progress of the exceptions to copyright regulations &gt;&gt;&gt; GOV.UK The Committee has some questions about the private copying and parody exceptions that they would like to discuss with us. It is not unusual for the Committee to want to spend more time considering SIs, but it will have implications for the timetable given where we are in the parliamentary cycle. It is likely to mean these two SIs are implemented later than 1 June 2014. Slightly concerning that the private copying and parody exceptions are being delayed. DDoS attacks costing UK companies \u00a3240,000 per day &gt;&gt;&gt; TechRadar Attacks are lasting longer, with 28 per cent lasting as much as two days. The study also found that there is a 69 per cent chance of repeat attacks, with 48 per cent hit between two and ten times. Some attacks required more than six specialists to mitigate them. These accounted for 39 per cent of attacks in 2013, compared to 25 per cent in 2012, an increase of 56 per cent. Some were even larger, requiring 10 people to mitigate, and this figure doubled from 12 per cent in 2012 to 24 per cent in 2013. DDoS used to be the equivalent of a protest outside a building, now it's becoming a legitimately damaging tool in the hacker's arsenal. LG G3 5.5-inch QHD display panel confirmed by LG Display &gt;&gt;&gt; Pocket-lint \"The certification comes shortly before the new Quad HD LCD panel will be unveiled with the forthcoming LG's flagship smartphone to be launched in the first half of the year.\" (sic) The new panel will have a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, which across the 5.5-inches will equate to 534ppi. That will make it sharper and more detailed than the other flagship rival smartphones from HTC, Samsung and Sony. PPI is the new megapixel. Does it make a difference? Huawei doesn't think so... Huawei: QHD screens are 'nonsense' &gt;&gt;&gt; TechRadar Richard Yu from Huawei: \"We can [put a QHD display on a smartphone], but it's very bad for power consumption and it doesn't offer anything in return.\" \"You eyes cannot see the difference, so why should we do that? I think it's a stupid thing.\" Quite. London black taxis plan congestion chaos to block Uber &gt;&gt;&gt; BBC News LTDA now plans to force the issue by holding the action in early June. \"Transport for London not enforcing the Private Hire Vehicles Act is dangerous for Londoners,\" Steve McNamara, LTDA's general secretary, told the BBC. \"I anticipate that the demonstration against TfL's handling of Uber will attract many many thousands of cabs and cause severe chaos, congestion and confusion across the metropolis.\" TfL told the association last month that it believed Uber's vehicles were not strictly \"equipped\" with taximeters since there was not \"some sort of connection between the device and the vehicle\". From tube strike to taxi strike. The issue here is a valid one. Uber is disrupting a market by skirting the market rules. Is that fair? France's Orange says client data stolen from website &gt;&gt;&gt; Reuters But the intrusion at Orange is embarrassing for its Chief Executive Stephane Richard because he has cast the company as a guardian of its customers data after revelations of widespread spying by the U.S. National Security Agency last year. Ooops. Better get your house in order before promising things and making yourself a target. Chrome extension turns any website into video chatroom &gt;&gt;&gt; Wired UK a Chrome browser extension that turns any website into a live video chatroom for you and your friends, building a transparent layer of information that sits on top so you can see, hear and interact with friends during live videostreams or while reading static content. The logical step from bitching about X-Factor on Twitter. Why Eve Online's economist thinks bitcoin could be a scam &gt;&gt;&gt; Polygon Dr. Eyjolfur Gudmundsson is the in-house economist at CCP Games, and part of his job is keeping Eve Online and its multiple currencies running smoothly. Eve Online and Dust 514 incorporate a series of virtual currencies, such as ISK, Auram and Plex, that are all interconnected and in some cases can be purchased, or sold for, actual currency. Some of Eyjolfur's arguments don't quite ring true \u2013 the point of bitcoin is that the trust is built into the code, and really is independently verifiable \u2013 but it's very interesting to hear someone outside of the mainstream economics world make the case for a central bank and government intervention. Indie Box: Let's Bring Our Data Home &gt;&gt;&gt; Indiegogo Indie Box One is the first ready-to-use personal server appliance for storing your personal data and running indie web applications at home. Made for humans, not just geeks. Pre-installed indie web applications provide functionality such as calendaring, address book management, publishing, sharing, bookmarking, photo and media management and more. On the plus side: moving the cloud back down to a more personal level restores control of our data, and ensures that the companies making the apps we've come to reply on treat us as their customers, rather than advertisers. On the minus side: if you thought Heartbleed was bad, imagine dealing with that sort of security breach in a world where everyone has to patch their own personal server. The Great Smartphone War: Apple vs. Samsung &gt;&gt;&gt; Vanity Fair Kurt Eichenwald: According to various court records and people who have worked with Samsung, ignoring competitors' patents is not uncommon for the Korean company. And once it's caught it launches into the same sort of tactics used in the Apple case: countersue, delay, lose, delay, appeal, and then, when defeat is approaching, settle. \"They never met a patent they didn't think they might like to use, no matter who it belongs to,\" says Sam Baxter, a patent lawyer who once handled a case for Samsung. \"I represented [the Swedish telecommunications company] Ericsson, and they couldn't lie if their lives depended on it, and I represented Samsung and they couldn't tell the truth if their lives depended on it.\" You can follow Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard.
