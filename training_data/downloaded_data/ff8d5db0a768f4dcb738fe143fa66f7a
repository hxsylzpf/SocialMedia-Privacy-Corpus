  "content": "Think about your personal brand When job hunting online, it's a good idea to keep your online impression consistent. \"A big question is what you want your personal brand to be,\" says Zoe Amar, a specialist in social media. \"What do you want people to see when they Google you? Work backwards from that and think about what content you should share to influence this.\" Katherine Burik, founder of The Interview Doctor, agrees: \"The key is having all your search materials support your brand \u2013 who you are and what you bring to the table distilled into the most basic components that all support your goal.\" How to build an online profile from scratch Start your online presence with LinkedIn, adds Burik. \"You need to explore and identify the keywords that employers use when they look for people in your target job then use those words to describe yourself in your LinkedIn profile.\" Likewise, Lydia Fairman, HR specialist and founder of Fairman Consulting, says LinkedIn is the first port of call for jobseekers. \"Once you're on Linkedin, get yourself into a job hunting group. You'll find lots of individuals in the same boat with hints and tips. The best way to understand social media is to dive in head first.\" A Twitter profile is also useful for careers in the creative industries, says Steve Girdler, managing director for HireRight. \"Start posting content and articles that interest you and your network \u2013 you can set it up to automatically post on LinkedIn and Twitter simultaneously.\" Before looking for jobs, clean up your social media profiles Over 45% of employers now look at Facebook, Twitter and other social media profiles to screen job candidates. \"Employers will look at your social media. Guaranteed,\" says Burik. \"So take a moment to clean out those photos of you having a wild party or any comments that undermine the impression you want to make. \"Ensure that all your social media profiles and the content support your professional goal. You can make some profiles private but in the US some employers ask for access to check up on you. Be safe and clean it up so you support your professional brand.\" Jon Gregory, a job search and interview specialist, agrees that \"everything you put online should be as professional as practically possible\". Though he says sometimes it can be worth running separate profiles for professional and private use. However, Fairman adds that \"showing a little personality\" online is no bad thing, as long as you \"keep it within professional boundaries\". Don't rely on social media to find a job online Social media isn't the only way to find a job online. \"Job portals such as Monster, Indeed and many others will give you an idea of what is out there and what sort of skills and experience employers are looking for,\" says Girdler. It's also worth contacting recruitment agencies, \"particularly if there are any that specialise in your field\". Call them up and send them your CV \u2013 and keep in touch, adds Girdler. Connect with employers and network online \"The internet and online job hunting has transformed the way we look for jobs,\" says Rachel Locke, adviser for the National Careers Service. \"Networking on social media is an ideal opportunity to make valuable connections that may be more difficult to make person. Likewise, many graduate schemes are advertised on social media, with large organisations using platforms such as Facebook to market their image.\" Andrew Fennell, director of StandOut CV, agrees. \"I would focus on Twitter and LinkedIn as they are the most popular among professionals. Aim to build a reputable social presence by connecting with relevant individuals and businesses and taking part in group discussions.\" A professional website is only useful in some industries While a professional website can back up a job application, it's more useful in some industries than others, says Burik. \"Check out profiles of other people who do what you do. Do the nicest looking profiles come with professional websites displaying a portfolio of some kind? If so then you should consider adding these things to your profile so you keep up with your competition for the job.\" Looking for a job?
