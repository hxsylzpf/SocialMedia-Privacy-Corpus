  "content": "Twitter. How to explain? It's like having a chat, only much Y2K-ier. Do you see? A celebrity's thumbs aren't really tough enough for a life spent tweeting. Silken milky pads, they are, designed instead for being held aloft in photographs and holding autograph quills. But you must give journalists something to include on page three, so celebritweeters bathe your thumbs in surgical spirit and tweet as David Lynch does: \"Thought of the Day: We are like the spider. We weave our life &amp; move along it,\" which would sound weird if it wasn't the exact same thing you have tattooed on your coccyx. Or you could do as you always do and copy Ashton Kutcher, choosing to dedicate every tenth post to your wife's athletic rump. In this way, you will change the world. It will take some days, mind, but by Autumn/Winter '09 you will have eliminated Proposition 8, ended global warming and (fingers crossed!) got your Hot Tub Island pilot off the ground.",
