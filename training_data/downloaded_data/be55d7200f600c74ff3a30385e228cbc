  "content": "The Tory-Lib Dem coalition government is considering a new privacy law rather than allowing judges to create one by stealth, the justice minister Lord McNally hinted last night. He said there was a \"general consensus\" that legislation was needed that \"clarifies, consolidates and removes some of the more dangerous aspects of the way case law has grown up\". In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, the Lib Dem minister said: \"If we are going to have a privacy law, it should be openly debated and freely decided by parliament.\" The coalition last month unveiled plans for a major review of defamation law following concerns over \"libel tourism\". There have also been concerns over the use of superinjunctions against the media \u2013 such as the ones sought by oil trading firm Trafigura in 2009, and former England football captain John Terry in January of this year \u2013 in which even the existence of an injunction that prevents a newspaper publishing a story cannot be reported. The Master of the Rolls has already established a committee to examine the use of superinjunctions and other injunctions . But McNally's latest remarks seemed to take the issue further. Superinjunctions were, he said, \"something that has grown up by stealth, rather than by considered desire of parliament and therefore they will be in the sights when they look at the reform of the law\". McNally said new legislation would \"hopefully remove some of the more onerous aspects of the way that case law has grown up\". He suggested a joint committee of both houses of parliament could take evidence in public \"which would get us the balance that is needed\".",
