This season sees the launch of Oakley's second-generation Airwave 1.5 goggle with a built-in heads-up display beaming \u2013 via GPS, Bluetooth, accelerometer and gyro sensors \u2013 essential mountain stats directly into your vision while you ski. You can record and view your route, jump stats, speed, altitude et al, while in motion, before smearing it all over Facebook. If you don't want your mates to know what your exact location was and how scared you were, you may want to save your \u00a3520 to buy some ski lessons. Oakley may be an eyewear behemoth, renowned \u2013 rightly so \u2013 for the quality of its lenses, but it is not unique in housing the Recon Snow2 technology in its goggles. Smith Optics and Zeal have models on the market too. Recon Instruments also have a similar device called Jet aimed at road cyclists. But it's a tough sell in the winter sports industry, not least because of the weight of the goggle and the price tag. At first glance, it's an exciting concept: a small screen on the right-hand side of the lens projects data while you ski and you use the Bluetooth attachment (housed in a gloved-hand friendly casing) to control what is displayed \u2013 speed, where exactly you are, your altitude, how high you just jumped as well as, via the link with your smartphone, changing your playlist or seeing incoming calls and text messages. Mountain purists \u2013 or anyone over 25 \u2013 could claim the joy of a fresh powder day for it's own sake is more important than recording the details so you can brag about it later, while anyone who has ever had their smartphone run out of battery while trying to pinpoint which chairlift their friends are on will know the frustration of depending too much on technology in the snow. And other smartphone apps such as Ski Tracks offer many of the same details Oakley is pushing with the Airwave 1.5, so why bother? \"Everyone is contactable 90% of the time, whether it's via phone, text, email or social media,\" said an Oakley spokesman. \"The Airwave 1.5 ensures this level of contact continues on the mountain, plus it takes this to the next level with Buddy Tracking, allowing the user to trace friends using GPS. \"Also, the modern skier or snowboarder is starting to take their riding more seriously. So the ability to analyse all elements of your last run or the complete day is the next step in continual self-improvement.\"In this newer version of the Airwave \u2013 the original was soft launched in 2012 to test consumer reactionto the technology \u2013 battery life has been increased to around six hours, lenses are interchangeable using Oakley's Switchlock system, and peripheral vision is pretty good, though definitely not as wide as some non-James Bond goggles such as Von Zipper's Fishbowl. If your eyesight is sketchy, anyway the chances of being able to keep track of how fast you're going while hanging on to some semblance of spatial awareness are low. Yet considering you're holding the set of Minority Report on your face they are surprisingly comfortable, with Plutonite lenses removing UVA and UVB rays. Whether they also remove the simple joy of skiing in a stunning mountain environment remains to be seen.",
