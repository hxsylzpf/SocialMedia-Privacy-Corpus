  "content": "Scandal - and not for the first time - in Wikipedialand, where freshly minted Republican party vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin had some very flattering edits made to her profile in the 24 hours before she was nominated. Photo by Mike Licht, NotionsCapital.com on Flickr. Some rights reserved. Someone using the handle YoungTrigg - perhaps not coincidentally the name of the youngest of her five children - made 30 mostly edits to the page, including that she \"would sometimes wake at 3 a.m. to hunt moose before school\" and that, as Alaskan governor, she had \"kept her campaign promises, reducing her own salary, as well as reducing property taxes 60%.\" Most of the information was taken from a recent biography, but the sceptical among you might wonder how this supporter managed such a timely and flattering update of Palin's profile before the world knew she was John McCain's running mate. Is YoungTrigg a Republican campaigner? On the night before the announcement, another editor changed Palin's profile to say she was McCain's candidate. YoungTrigg posted a note saying: \"Where did you hear that Palin was the VP nominee? I can't find anything online.\" The conspiracy theorists think that was a red herring. The New York Times spoke to an anonymous lawyer and regular Wikipedia editor who had gone over YoungTrigg's entries and toning down partial material. \"A lot of stuff was useful -- like citing a biography of her,\" he said in a telephone interview, speaking under condition of anonymity to avoid tipping off his clients that he spends time on Wikipedia. \"Some was questionable stuff.\" In general, he said, the editing \"indicates a very close familiarity with Governor Palin.\" \"The lawyer said that when YoungTrigg linked to government documents on a government Web site related to the trooper case, it seemed like this editor was not exactly a political na\u00eff. \"But, he says, this person may be Wikipedically na\u00efve. \"They didn't quite know what they were getting into -- they got a lot of conflict-of-interest notes,\" he said. And much of that original, flattering material has been overwritten.\" As of today, YoungTrigg is on Wikipedia's list of users to be checked. The Wikipedia log says: \"This is a new user since August 28, 2008 who has edited only the Sarah Palin page. Sarah Palin was selected by McCain as his VP the next day after the entry was gone over and sanitized. The edits have a partisan POV and are extensive. The edits evidence some familiarity with wikipedia, more than might be expected for a new user. The discussion of the edits is currently a recommended diary on the Daily KOS. If this user turns out to be someone connected to Sarah Palin it violates Wikipedia's conflict of interest rules.\" But we may never know; YoungTrigg's user information has now disappeared from Wikipedia, following a short spell with the label 'retired' next to his or her profile. The significance? According to the Wiki-watchers, Palin's profile was accessed by 2.4 million people in the 24 horus after her nomination. Wikipedia is, as ever, a fascinating manifestation of our cultural and political obsessions. \u2022 Wired, meanwhile, points out that previous stories claiming Palin \"hacked\" into a colleagues computer to find incriminating details about corruption wasn't exactly hacking; she asked a technician to find a way round his email password. \u2022 John Mcain's daughter has been furiously blogging the whole Presidential campaign; decide for yourself if it's an intimate, personal account of her experience or a cynical, political initiative to garner support from young America.
