  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission, the industry body that regulates newspapers, will tomorrow announce a wide-ranging inquiry into journalistic practices. The investigation follows the conviction of News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman, 49, who was sentenced to four months in prison on Friday for hacking into mobile phones messages belonging to royal aides. That prompted the resignation of the much admired editor Andy Coulson. Former footballer Glenn Mulcaire, 36, a researcher, received a six-month sentence. The inquiry is expected to be announced tomorrow by PCC chairman Sir Christopher Meyer, the former British ambassador to America. He is also expected to say the PCC will question the News of the World over the affair. The PCC had planned to quiz Coulson, but will now seek answers from other senior executives at the paper, part of Rupert Murdoch's News International group. Coulson will be replaced by Colin Myler, managing editor at Murdoch's New York Post A PCC spokesman said: 'We will issue a formal statement next week'. Phone-tapping is outlawed under the PCC code of conduct, although a newspaper can argue it is legitimate if it is carried out in the public interest. Goodman and Mulcaire tapped into mobile phones by discovering the security codes used by their owners to pick up private voicemails. Royal aides first became suspicious when Goodman wrote stories about Princes Harry and William using information known only by a handful of close advisers. Similar techniques are allegedly used by other newspapers, which have used private investigators to obtain phone records or private numbers. Coulson handed his resignation to News International chairman Les Hinton a fortnight ago, but it was not announced until Friday evening, after Goodman was sentenced.He said he had to take 'ultimate responsibility' . Coulson celebrated his 39th birthday at a London restaurant last night at a party organised by his wife. He is said to be 'upset' about the manner of his departure, but he is rated highly by Murdoch and has been tipped as a future editor of the Sun. Many industry observers believe he could return to a senior post at the group.",
