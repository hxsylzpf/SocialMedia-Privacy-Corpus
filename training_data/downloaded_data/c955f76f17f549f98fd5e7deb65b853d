  "content": "Have you attended a peaceful protest recently? The Guardian reported at the weekend that the Metropolitan police are storing the details of protestors on the criminal intelligence database, in some cases even where the person concerned has no criminal record and is not suspected of any offence. This is a worrying development, especially if sensitive personal data such as photographs are being stored in this way. The Met has increasingly been using \"forward intelligence teams\" and \"evidence gatherers\" at protests, ostensibly to obtain video or photographic records which might be useful in identifying those involved in criminal activity. Not an objectionable aim in itself. But using this information to create a file on an innocent protestor, without his or her knowledge, and where details such as name, appearance and political affiliations can be retrieved by a simple computerised search, is another matter entirely. Only very recently the European Court of Human Rights found that the government's policy of retaining fingerprints and samples taken from all individuals on arrest, even if they are not convicted of any offence, was in breach of the right to respect for private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The court was struck by what it called the \"blanket and indiscriminate nature\" of the power of retention in England and Wales, and noted that there was some stigma associated with being included on the police national computer alongside convicted criminals. The same reasoning could be applied to the retention of photographs on a criminal intelligence database, especially as there is no published guidance on when the police will consider it appropriate to add someone's details. Anyone who wants to know whether their details are being held by the police can make a \"subject access request\" under the Data Protection Act for copies of information held on them, but the police are quite likely to say that they are exempt from the obligation to provide such information because the data is held for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime or apprehending or prosecuting offenders, and disclosure would prejudice one of those purposes. So far the High Court has held that the taking of someone's photograph in a public place, and the subsequent retention of it, does not engage privacy rights (Article 8 of the ECHR) or the rights to freedom of expression (Article 10) or freedom of association (Article 11), but this issue is currently under consideration by the Court of Appeal. Whatever the legal position, there is a real danger in public trust being eroded by this kind of surveillance tactic. It is vital that we can all feel free to exercise our democratic right to express a political opinion in public, without the risk of being targeted by the police as a \"troublemaker\" in the future.",
