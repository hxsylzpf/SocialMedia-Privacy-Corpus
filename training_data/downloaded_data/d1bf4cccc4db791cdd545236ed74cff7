While right-leaning tweeters displayed more caution in the language they used, the reds were more blue, as liberals peppered their 140-character missives with a hefty helping of \"shits\" and \"fucks\". Researchers at Queen Mary, University of London, found that those two particular swearwords featured in the top ten used by left-leaning tweeters, after the most common English terms were screened out. Those on the right of the political spectrum expressed themselves in more polite language, but did show a preference for religious terms, with \"God\" and \"psalm\" making it into their list of top words. \"What we think is going on is that the liberal side are expressing themselves with more emotion,\" said Matthew Purver, a computational linguist who led the study. \"It's not that the liberals were shouting at someone else, swearing at them, and saying \"you bastard\", though there were some cases of that. It's more that they were using swearwords to express emotion,\" he added. Historically, politicians on all sides have indulged in profane outbursts. In 1993, John Major denounced three members of his Cabinet as a \"shower of bastards\". President Obama called in experts after the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill because he wanted to know \"whose ass to kick\". Few can outdo Dick Cheney, who as vice-president under George W. Bush, shouted at Vermont senator Patrick Leahy to \"go fuck yourself\". Purver and his colleague Karolina Sylwester gathered tweets from people who followed leading US Democrat Twitter accounts, but not leading Republican ones, and vice versa. For each group, they selected more then 5,000 timelines at random. That gave them nearly half a million English-language tweets for each of the Democrat and Republican-leaning camps. All of the tweets were sent in the second half of June 2014. The 20 words that most distinguished Republicans included \"Obama\", \"God\", \"America\", \"great\", \"tax\", \"Benghazi\" and \"lie\". Those that set the Democrats apart - besides the swearwords - included \"love\", \"feel\", \"watch\" and \"World Cup\". In 2014, the US government was fending off criticisms over a fatal attack on Americans in Benghazi in Libya. In mid-June 2014, when the tweets were gathered, the World Cup had just kicked off in Brazil. Having pulled together the vast number of tweets, the scientists tested a number of hypotheses about how political leaning might influence the words a person uses. Beyond the rather stark differences over swearword usage, their study, published in Plos One, found that right wingers favoured \"we\", with the liberals favouring \"I\". That, Purver believes, reveals a fundamental distinction between the personalities. \"People with a tendency to look at their own individual attributes and their own state are more likely to be liberal, and people who put more emphasis on whether they are doing the same thing as the group, or whether the group approves, are more likely to be rightwingers,\" Purver said. What the findings mean is less than clear though. A person who routinely uses \"I\" instead of \"we\" could be narcissistic and egotistical, though Purver suggests they might be taking responsibility for expressing their own views. Equally, someone who uses \"we\" more than \"I\" may simply be self-effacing and keen to share views that extend beyond their own. According to Purver, it may also signify a reluctance to take responsibility and a preference to emphasise group identity and consensus, an explanation that fits with the more religious language used by Republicans. Purver believes that the Twitter accounts used in the study give a fair impression of right-leaning versus liberal personalities. But he concedes that the ages and genders of the tweeters is unknown and may differ between the Democrat and Republican groups, skewing the results one way or the other. The study shows how the flood of words people post online can be used to draw inferences about their personalities. Purver said that companies are already analysing Twitter and other social media to help businesses target their advertising more effectively. Other studies are investigating how people's language changes with mood, and how online dialects vary from place to place. How people tweet in London, New York, Sao Paolo and Paris could potentially be separated into digital dialects that have little or no connection to how the spoken languages differ in the cities. Research into how online language evolves could help researchers identify people who \"spread change\", said Purver.",
