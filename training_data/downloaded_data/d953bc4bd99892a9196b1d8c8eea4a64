  "content": "There are two juicy political plums in New Jersey about to come ripe. One's already in Chris Christie's paws. It looks like Cory Booker wants the other one. Booker, the popular mayor of Newark, announced his intention to explore a run for the US Senate seat likely to be vacated in 2014. That means Booker would pass on taking a run against Christie, the current governor, when Christie's first term ends next year. True to form, Booker made the announcement in a YouTube video that he tweeted out Thursday morning. \"Let there be no doubt: I will complete my full second term as mayor of Newark, New Jersey,\" Booker says in the video. \"And as for my political future, I will explore the possibility of running for the United States Senate in 2014.\" Booker has been calling leaders of the state Democratic party to inform them of his decision, according to the Newark Star-Ledger. The numbers are with Booker in his decision to skip the statehouse and head for Capitol Hill. Among Democrats, 59% preferred Booker to be their candidate in 2014 Senate race, to only 22% for the incumbent Democrat, Frank Lautenberg, in a November Public Policy Polling (PPP) survey. Lautenberg, at 88 the Senate's oldest member, with five terms under his belt, is thought to be retiring. A run against Christie, whose already robust popularity has soared since his sure performance amid the wreckage of hurricane Sandy, looks less promising on paper for Booker. The latest hypothetical Booker-Christie poll has Christie ahead 53% to 35%. Before Sandy, Christie was ahead of Booker 46%-42%. If the arrows seemed to point to a Senate run for Booker, there had been room for doubt. As a politician, Booker is more executor than legislator, having built his reputation on personal, decisive intervention to solve constituent problems on the spot. As governor he could continue in the same style. As a junior senator he would be consigned for a time to the back bench. He would have to find new ways to hot dog. Then there's the possibility that Lautenberg, who is fit, popular and used to being a senator, might not retire, setting up a nasty primary fight. As for the question of grander ambitions \u2013 and with Booker there's little question \u2013 Barack Obama demonstrated in 2008 that while every senator may want to run for president, sometimes it actually works.",
