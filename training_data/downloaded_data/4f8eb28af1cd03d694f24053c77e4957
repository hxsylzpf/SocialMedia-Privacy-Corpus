  "content": "Over the weekend, Guardian critic Lyn Gardner tweeted her response to a production of A Streetcar Named Desire. \"I actually wept at Bolton Octagon last night when Blanche DuBois throws herself on the kindness of strangers,\" she said. Two things are significant about this. The first is that before Twitter came along, no reviewer would have dreamed of assessing a play in 140 characters. The second is the personally revealing nature of what she said. Something about the informality of Twitter makes an admission of weeping seem acceptable. To do the same in a formal newspaper review, by contrast, is not unheard of but certainly more rare. In her published review Gardner saves the emotion until last, giving an enthusiastic but essentially level-headed analysis before letting slip, in her final sentence, that she \"wept as Blanche walked from the house\". It makes a powerful pay-off, but isn't it interesting that the first line of a tweet becomes the last line of a review? By chance, I posted a similar tweet only last week. \"Just out of Sunshine on Leith for a third time,\" it said. \"In bits again.\" At that stage, I hadn't written my review of the Proclaimers musical and, although I knew I wanted to convey my feelings about the Dundee Rep production, I was reasonably certain I wouldn't use the phrase \"in bits again\". But why not? In his recently published book The Role of the Critic Nicholas Dromgoole writes that, as long ago as the 1st century AD, Longinus concluded that art exists to give us \"transports of delight\". If the Greek writer was even half right, you'd imagine critics to be skilled above all else in expressing such delight. When they were scared, aroused, heartbroken or tickled pink, you'd expect to know about it. Yet how often is that the case? When artists complain about a bad review, we reassure them \"it is only one person's opinion\". That person, however, is not just any person. A newspaper critic is unlikely to admit to vulnerability and uncertainty in his or her impressions \u2013 as an ordinary theatregoer might \u2013 and tends to assume a tone of authority. Published reviews sounds persuasive because they are written with an air of being objectively correct. To betray the essential subjectivity of the enterprise, the critic would risk making their writing seem wishy-washy. Even more frighteningly, they would also have to take down their defensive barriers. Because it isn't only artists who makes themselves vulnerable in front of an audience \u2013 the critic does as well. It's one thing to show off your knowledge of Tennessee Williams or the Proclaimers' back catalogue, to expound some clever theory about what a playwright means or to nail your target with a verbal flourish. It is quite another to admit a show made you feel gooey inside. That is why, in our buttoned-up culture, you're far more likely to see a distancing phrase such as \"it brings a tear to one's eye\" than the more direct \"it made me cry\". Irving Wardle in the sadly out-of-print Theatre Criticism said he could recall only one reviewer, Joyce McMillan (then writing for the Guardian), \"owning up to being turned on while in possession of a press ticket\". At the same time, however, I'm not convinced entirely subjective reviews are the answer. There is limited value in a review that offers an incontestable statement of private experience and no sense of perspective. But bloggers such as those behind West End Whingers and View From the Stalls, who are happy to talk about normal human emotions such as boredom, frustration and joy, have laid down a challenge to newspaper critics. That is to write with authority and honesty, without sheltering behind the illusion of objectivity. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 September 2010.
