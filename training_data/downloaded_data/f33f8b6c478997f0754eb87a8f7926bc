All they wanted was to let people know they would be celebrating Boyle's new CD with some cake and ice cream, but their hashtag looked like it belonged in an adult entertainment store (Su's Anal Bum Party, in case you're still wondering). One of Robin Thicke's social media advisers, however, seemed to think it was a good idea to allow the singer \u2013 who has been at the centre of a barrage of online criticism and accusations of misogyny ever since the release of his Blurred Lines video last summer \u2013 to participate in a Q&amp;A session on Twitter with VH1, using the hashtag #AskThicke.

And by his \"treatment\" of women, we mean his assumption that women enjoy being hit on by sleazy guys like him who have at least 90% more nose-cartilage than is normal and who don't take no for an answer.
