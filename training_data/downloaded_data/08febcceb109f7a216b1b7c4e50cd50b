  "content": "It has to be said that, to the casual observer, the #FreeTheNipple campaign is a very confusing thing. Let's just get this straight, one might say, it's a feminist movement that encourages toplessness, and which has led to an Icelandic MP, respected as a serious parliamentarian, getting her boobs out for everyone to see. And you're telling me this is one in the eye for the patriarchy? Well let's investigate. The movement, which first kicked off in the US \u2013 a reaction against censorship of the female nipple \u2013 was recently reinvigorated in Iceland, when a student and her boyfriend posted a picture on Facebook of both of them topless. Nobody seemed to mind him doing it, but for her, there was a torrent of abuse. She soon took the picture down, upset by all the insults coming her way for revealing a body that she felt had been sexualised by others. Why was his chest neutral? Why should hers, because breasts had grown there, with the biological purpose of feeding children, be judged differently? Why did she have to carry all this shame that she didn't actually feel, or at least, that she didn't want to feel, but did? Without getting bogged down in arguments about secondary sexual characteristics, a campaign was launched. Others decided to free their nipples in solidarity with her, and soon the Icelandic MP Bj\u00f6rt \u00d3lafsdottir had, quite unexpectedly, put up a photo of herself revealing a breast. It's not just Iceland where the campaign has gained traction, though. Last year, a #FreeTheNipple film was made by American director Lina Esco, whose friend Miley Cyrus got involved. Various other high-profile women \u2013 including Rihanna, Scout Willis (daughter of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis), Cara Delevingne \u2013 have joined them, some photographed walking down the street naked to let their nipples loose, in an attempt to desexualise them. But that angle gets a bit complicated, because they looked pretty hot. But am I trapped in the patriarchal conditions of the male gaze for even thinking that? Gah! It's a minefield \u2013 but a fascinating one. Television personality Chelsea Handler put various pictures of herself on her Instagram account to support the movement too, and they were hilarious. In one, she is riding a horse, bare-chested, mimicking a similar photo of the Russian president, and when the site removed it for violating their codes, she put it up again, writing: \"Taking this down is sexist. I have every right to prove I have a better body than Putin.\" She also joked that Instagram was trying to keep its site safe \"because boobies are dangerous\". The general rule with sites such as Instagram, which does this to avoid becoming overrun by porn, is that you can show some breast in a photo, but the actual nipple has to be blurred out. It's faintly ridiculous when you think about it \u2013 are we saying, as a culture, that certain fat cells are OK, and certain skin is nice, but that part where the cells form a small circle with a point \u2013 that's bad? Is it not a little perverted to draw lines around sections of the body, like a butcher's diagram of a pig, designating what enjoyment can be taken from which sections? Having said that, are we going to free the vagina and the penis as well? Actually, I love the fact that Instagram doesn't have any porn on it. I use it every day to look at all sorts of photos \u2013 friends' holidays and kids, as well as art and architecture. Yet I also had a picture removed and got an official warning that they would suspend my account if I persisted in uploading such photographs. It wasn't my own nipple, which hasn't been seen in public in some time. No, it was a black-and-white picture of Madonna in the 1980s, idly caressing her own breast. An arty shot, one might say. But gone. I was annoyed, but I can see the difficulties, and the snobbery, involved in an aesthetic debate over what is art and what is porn. I don't dislike porn in theory, but in practice, those breasts are often made to look a certain way, the nipples not exactly freed but inflated and agitated into a certain erectness for a certain reason. Would the proliferation of those nipples make many women feel more free? Probably not. Official Instagram policy about \"offensive content\" is thus: \"If you wouldn't show the photo or video you are thinking about uploading to a child, or your boss, or your parents, you probably shouldn't share it on Instagram. Accounts found sharing nudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to Instagram may be discontinued.\" Cult model Paula Goldstein Di Principe (@pgdiprincipe), who has more than 12,000 followers on Instagram, wants to know who decides what constitutes offensive, though. She sometimes puts topless photos of herself on her own website and says she recently went to California and ran around naked in the forest with her mates. \"We were just having a laugh, it wasn't sexual. But I published the photos of us and they were treated as massively sexual because we're four women in our 20s. Sometimes it feels like you can only be believed to be making a feminist point if you're not seen as attractive.\" Catherine Bowman, an art history student in New York, uses Instagram (@kate_nyc) to share the Renaissance paintings she loves, many showing nipples. Sometimes she poses like that herself. \"In New York, walking around topless is actually legal for both genders, so it constantly confuses me that this ideal is not translated on to the most popular, accessible social media network,\" she says. I contacted Bj\u00f6rt \u00d3lafsdottir to ask why she set this whole thing in motion, and if people found it confusing. I had been reading the comments on articles about her, including those from a number of men saying they hadn't had much truck with all this feminist rubbish before, and yet now they could see how great it was, and could more women join this campaign and liberate their nipples please. \"I know the #FreeTheNipple trend can seem a bit tricky,\" she agrees. \"It's because at the same time we are saying: Clothes actually suit women very well, wear them! Yet, we also think it is important to fight social norms and the body shame that young teenage girls are subjected to by revenge porn. This is hard for older feminists to understand because they are not familiar with this world of social media that teenagers live in, but the message here is quite clear: the perverts and extorters are the ones who ought to be shamed by society, not us.\" I am reminded of the journalist Angela Neustatter writing in this newspaper about what it was like to board at the progressive school Summerhill, where children had few rules and lessons were optional. Nudity was not a big deal among teenagers who had never been told otherwise. \"I bathed naked in the school pool alongside the boys and girls I had grown up with,\" she wrote, \"noticing with passing interest the way our physiques changed over the years.\" Perhaps the answer is that we all start by freeing the nipple, and trusting that our minds will follow.",
