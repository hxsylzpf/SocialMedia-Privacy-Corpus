  "content": "A student who tried to prevent six Irish newspapers from identifying him, as I reported on Friday, lost his case. A Dublin high court judge dismissed claims by the student that the papers had breached the terms of injunctions he had obtained previously. The 22-year-old student took legal action against the papers and several internet companies, including Facebook and Google, to prohibit the rebroadcasting or republishing of a video clip that he said defamed him by alleging he was guilty of evading a taxi fare. The judge, Mr Justice Michael Peart, pointed out that the taxi driver had come to court to clear the student's name, saying he was not the person who avoided paying the fare. He was therefore satisfied that the papers - the Irish Times, Irish Independent, Evening Herald, Irish Examiner and Irish Daily Star - were entitled to name the student in their reporting of the proceedings. (The Sunday Times had previously been released from the proceedings). The student's lawyers had argued that he was entitled under the Irish constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights to have his right to privacy and his good name protected.
