  "content": "@guardianworld It's an affront on a free society &amp; could be a PR disaster for Twitter after it's much praised role in the #Arabspring \u2014 Tyson B. (@globalvybe) January 27, 2012 Dear @Twitter, I've decided to join #TwitterBlackout Protest of new #TwitterCensored policy. I will NOT tweet on Sat, Jan 28. \u2014 luis prieto (@luisprieto) January 27, 2012 Why boycott it just for 1 day If you really think it's wrong, talk about a week or a month &amp; I shall take you seriously #TwitterCensorship \u2014 Hani Arif (@haniarif) January 27, 2012 Twitter's new policy on tweet censorship will make it increasingly difficult to not be seen as a tool of US-foreign policy during unrest. \u2014 Chanders (@Chanders) January 27, 2012 Surprised there's not more outrage about #twittercensorship - although maybe there is and the tweets are being blocked. \u2014 Rory Wilson (@alnya) January 27, 2012 Twitter, why don't you ban porn spammers instead of free thinkers? #TwitterCensorship \u2014 Noemi Shams (@NoemiShams) January 27, 2012 #TwitterCensorship. Dear Twitter, I face so much censorship in Sudan as a journalist, you were my free and safe space. I'm grieving now. \u2014 \u0631\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u064a\u0633 \u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645 (@ReemShawkat) January 27, 2012 #twittercensorship At least they have stated that a removed tweet will be prominently displayed as removed (as opposed to simply vanishing). \u2014 Matt Giuca (@mgiuca) January 27, 2012 I wonder how much energy will be expended today debating #TwitterCensored that would otherwise be spent discussing #Syria.\u2014 Andy Carvin (@acarvin) January 27, 2012 Share your reaction with @guardianworld",

  "lead": "Users of the social network have shared their views on news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/27/twitter-faces-censorship-backlash\">Twitter has implemented a system to withhold tweets on a country-by-country basis. Many tweeters have accused the service of censorship and, under the hashtags <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/twittercensorship\">#twittercensorship and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23TwitterBlackout\">#twitterblackout, are planning to protest by not tweeting on 28 January in a stand against what they see as a threat to freedom of expression and information. Others question the extent to which this system will be used and if this move by Twitter will result in a shift away from the network",
