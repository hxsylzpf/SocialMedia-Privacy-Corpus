Or rather, not sport per se, (women are brilliant at it, not that you'd probably know, since it only receives 5% of media coverage) but rather, we have a serious attitude problem towards women in sport.  This week, tennis player Eugenie Bouchard became the first Canadian to reach a Grand Slam semi-final in 30 years. So, naturally, the courtside reporter conducting the post-match interview congratulated her on some of her finest achievements:  \"You're getting a lot of fans here \u2026 a lot of them are male\".  Let's not make the mistake of thinking that the pinnacle of a woman's aspiration should be international success in her field \u2013 it's attracting the male gaze that really matters. (To be fair, we should all have learned this important fact already, thanks to John Inverdale, who took the opportunity to broadcast his unfavourable opinion of Marion Bartoli's looks during the very match in which she achieved the Wimbledon title last year.) But wait, there was more. With so many important questions to ask (How had it felt to achieve such a high-profile victory? How had Bouchard's training regime prepared her for the tough match in soaring temperatures?), the interviewer naturally had to use her time wisely. So she asked this of the world-class player: \"if you could pick anyone in the world of sport, of movies, I'm sorry they asked me to say this, who would you date?\" And, predictably, the headlines followed.  Not: \"Tennis star breaks Canadian records\", or \"Athlete at top of her game\", or, hell, even just \"Bouchard reaches Grand Slam semi-final\". But: \"Eugenie Bouchard picks Justin Bieber as dating material\", \"Canadian tennis glamour girl \u2026 says she'd date Justin Bieber\", and, my personal favourite, \"Eugenie Bouchard the Belieber reaches Melbourne semifinals\". So widespread is the utter lack of respect for sporting women that it could be argued that Bouchard's treatment, at the pinnacle of her sporting career so far, wasn't even the worst faced by a sportswoman this week alone. Because this was also the week that Sky Sports News ran a live Q&amp;A session with world champion gymnast and Olympic medallist Beth Tweddle. Using the hashtag #Sportswomen, they encouraged followers to send in their questions for the elite athlete. But what followed was a string of mindless vitriol, misogynistic abuse and sheer, petty meanness. It wasn't Sky Sports News that was at fault, of course \u2013 its  attempt to put the spotlight firmly on women's sport was a fantastic step in the right direction. A Sky Sports spokesperson later said in an email: \"We're committed to supporting women's sport and Beth's Q&amp;A was a chance for fans to engage with one of Britain's most successful sports stars. We're appalled that some people chose to abuse her. This experience highlights some of the unacceptable and offensive attitudes that can be encountered by women in the public eye.\" He wasn't wrong.  That our female athletes are treated with such a lack of respect should come as little surprise really, in the wake of the media coverage of the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games. Whilst incredibly talented women from Jessica Ennis to Victoria Pendleton to Ellie Simmonds brought home medal after medal, the media printed story after story about the \"Sexiest women of the Olympics\". Interviews with male athletes focused on their performance and training regimes, while female stars were draped in low cut ball gowns, sexually posed, and questioned about what make up they put on before each race. The Mirror even published a handy picture guide to the women's beach volleyball competition, headlined \"Battle of the bots\".  The sexism that our sporting women face is symptomatic of a wider culture, in which any woman in the public eye is judged first and foremost on her looks, and pigeonholed into narrow female stereotypes, regardless of her role or talent. The abuse faced by Tweddle this week was similar to misogynistic vitriol recently hurled at female politicians and activists alike. But it is a particularly pernicious problem in sport, because of the massive fight female athletes are already facing to win the coverage and funding they deserve. The tired old arguments about women's sport not being worth watching play into a vicious circle where a dearth of funding leads to a lack of coverage, meaning that there is never a fair chance to prove critics wrong. And attracting new investment remains an uphill battle when sportswomen are bombarded with sexist abuse and just one article about women's sport appears for every 53 written about sporting men.  To crow that men's sport is more exciting to watch while their matches are played in stadiums worth millions, by players paid millions, with millions spent on training and production quality, in a world that belittles and mocks women's sporting prowess, is rather like giving somebody a single piece of dry bread and laughing that their cookery skills will never match those of a Michelin chef in a fully equipped kitchen. Before we can begin to fully appreciate women's sport, we have to level the playing field.",
