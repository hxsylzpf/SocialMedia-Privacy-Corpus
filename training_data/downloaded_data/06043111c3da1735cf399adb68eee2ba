  "content": "This weekend's Untangling the Web column explodes the concept of \"home\": difficult to define but easy to recognise, \"home\" is as different from \"house\" as \"space\" is different from \"place\". More than just semantics, environmental psychologists have been trying to define the nuances between the emotionally warm and fuzzy home as distinct from the pragmatic, physical house since the end of WWII. And interaction designers have spent two decades trying to get us to make their websites our homes online. How has the 20 years of the Web transformed what we think and feel about the concept of home? Global migration and near-ubiquitous connectivity (in many major metropolises, at least) has helped to differentiate between the physical structure and the emotional component, but as Kat Jungnickel and Genevieve Bell ask in this research paper (abstract only), is home really where the hub is?
