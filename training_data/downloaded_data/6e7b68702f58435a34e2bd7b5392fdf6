  "content": "Shares in Groupon rose by more than 50% on its Wall Street debut, pushing the temporary value of the online discount firm up to $20bn (\u00a312.4bn). Groupon saw its share price rise to $31 in early trading on New York's Nasdaq exchange on Friday, 55% above the initial public offering price of $20 per share. The shares later eased back to $28 each. Andrew Mason's online discount firm had earlier faced down sceptics, raising $700m in its keenly-anticipated flotation to become the biggest IPO of an internet firm since Google in 2004. The huge investor demand in Groupon is in part due to the tiny slice of the company on offer. Groupon's 5% share offering makes it the smallest IPO of the past decade, according to capital markets data provider Ipreo. \"They wanted to have a decent pop on the stock so they didn't take that much public,\" said David Berman, a consumer technology and retail specialist at hedge fund firm Durban Capital. \"They created demand by limiting supply, and they got the pop.\" Mason's stake in Groupon is now worth $1.3bn, while co-founder Eric Lefkofsky owns a $3.6bn stake. Early investors, including Morgan Stanley Investment Management and Fidelity, stand to reap dividends from their $8 a share early stakes in the company. At $13bn, Groupon has a price tag worth double the amount Google reportedly offered for the discount firm last year. Groupon's huge surge on first-day trading is dwarfed by that of LinkedIn, the professional social networking site that saw its shares double in value on the New York stock exchange in May. It remains to be seen how Groupon's shares will fare in the long term \u2013 and in spite of further scepticism over its high acquisition price for customers \u2013 compared with LinkedIn. On Friday the professional social networking site was trading at almost double its IPO price range of $45 a share.",
