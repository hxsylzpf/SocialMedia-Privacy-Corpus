  "content": "Dating apps have changed the landscape of single life as irrevocably as an A-road through a moor. Arguably they brought the very act of dating \u2013 previously a particularly American pastime \u2013 to British shores. But as these apps get woven into the social and sexual fabric of Britain, so too have their involvement in incidents of sexual abuse, assault and violent crime. A recent freedom of information request has revealed that crimes with a connection to dating apps increased sevenfold over the past two years; from 55 reports in 2013 to 412 in the year to October 2015. Those crimes include some of the most frightening: rape, sexual grooming and attempted murder. But dig under that statistic a little further, pick the scab to examine the wound underneath, and the picture is not quite so clear, nor blame quite so easy to apportion. Importantly, these figures relate to crimes where the app was merely mentioned, not necessarily used directly by the perpetrator. Second, we may be at risk of muddying the already-murky waters of correlation and causation; since thousands of people join dating sites every month (according to its website, Tinder has already created 9bn matches), it is entirely predictable that they will be mentioned in more and more incidents, both good and bad. Just as last year, a freedom of information request revealed that the number of crime allegations involving Facebook and Twitter saw a 21% and 19% increase respectively over a two-year period, so these apps may not necessarily be causing an increase, but their ubiquity means they simply record an existing trend. Perhaps what is particularly misleading about that initial, entirely understandable reaction to a terrible set of statistics, is that it once again paints sexual assault, abuse and rape as something normally perpetrated by strangers. It isn't. According to Refuge, two women a week are killed in England and Wales by a current or former partner. Globally, one in three women will experience violence at the hands of a male partner. According to the NSPCC one in five teenagers have been physically abused by their boyfriends or girlfriends. In such a climate, it's unsurprising that a number of people close to me, and probably a number of people close to you, will have been treated badly, violently, abusively by their partner. I recently interviewed the artist Chantal Barlow about her work Unconventional Apology, in which she photographs female survivors of domestic abuse. By far the most striking and upsetting thing that her project revealed was how people live in daily, intimately violent relationships. I may have already read that, on average, a woman is assaulted 35 times before her first call to the police, but it is still brutal, still shocking, to hear of someone having their jaw broken by a husband or head smashed into a picture frame by a girlfriend. None of this is to underplay the risk posed by mobile and online dating, of course. The squirming beast of internet safety is still something that many of us struggle to control on a daily basis. It can be tiring, not to say counterintuitive, to stay vigilant about how much you've revealed through your profile, messages and photographs. Could someone recognise where you live from the background in that photo? Will they be able to email you at work if you tell them what you do for a living? If you start texting will they be able to see your location as well as knowing your number? Part of what draws people to dating apps like Tinder is the hope of meeting someone uncynical, unsuspicious and uncalculating in their approach to sex and love. That hope, and the ease with which you can share personal yet apparently inconsequential details like your surname, your employer, where you went to university and who you live with, all too often deafen us to potential dangers. By pulling information from Facebook, some dating apps make it worryingly easy to overshare some of your most private information; to treat strangers as friends. You do not have to be tech savvy to download Tinder, you may never have stopped to think about security settings before you join Grindr, you quite possibly have never dated before joining these vast swiping, clicking communities. And that, of course, can make you vulnerable. But \u2013 and it doesn't matter how many times you hear this, it always bears repeating \u2013 abuse is always the fault of the abuser. Rape is always the fault of the rapist. Certain means of communication or certain institutions may make that abuse a little easier to commit or a bit harder to trace, but the fault still lies squarely with the perpetrator. Attach too much blame to the associated limbs and you may miss the heart of the problem, which is those people who commit assault, groom vulnerable people, sexually exploit others and cause emotional or physical suffering. Many of them, of course, have been victim to similar abuse themselves. Looking for love can be dangerous; letting down our barriers can leave us vulnerable. But it is still surely people, not technology, who are to blame.",
