  "content": "Chinese bulletin boards and microblogs have been buzzing all day with chatter about Google's announcement. The vast majority either supported Google's decision to challenge the censors or expressed regret at the possible loss of a cherished search engine, but there was also criticism of the US firm's business tactics. Here is a translation of selected posts on the Sina microblog, which is inside the Great Fire Wall: \"Just heard Google may quit China. I couldn't believe it. Google has become a trusted friend. Whenever I've got a question I refer to it. You might say I grew up with Google. I hope this unexpected news is not true. If Google really gives up on the Chinese market, it will be a big loss for Chinese netizens.\" Celilia Jing. \"Google quitting China is a case of survival of the fittest. If you can't hack it, then you are knocked out. Baidu must be laughing secretly. Although they have also just been attacked by hackers, they can now have a bigger share of the cake because Google is gone.\" Liangjian99. \"Do Chinese people really need Google so much? It's only a symbol. Don't be so stupid and arouse the public feeling.\" Da Jiang \"Google can't leave China! Since last year, I have been using so many of its products for work. How can it leave? I feel sad, but I am practical. I will try to find alternative software so that I don't need to climb over the firewall to use the English version.\" yaolaner. \"China is a country governed by the rule of law. As long as you are in China you must obey Chinese law and be supervised by the government. Do not threaten China. I think that is the bottom line and if they cannot manage that, then I won't use Google in the future. weiwoguyan. On the Twittersphere, which is available in China only to those who are willing and able to get around the Great Fire Wall, Google was widely applauded, though there was some cynicism about its business motives. \"Technology genius, you can never use your talent in a big intranet monitored by bureaucrats. You can only do nothing or do evil. Please go abroad, for the sake of China's future!\" @mranti. \"Compared with Yahoo's past behaviour, such as [former Yahoo boss] Yang Zhiyuan handing over dissidents' email details, Google statement is very manly. How can anyone not love Google!\" @newsinchina",
