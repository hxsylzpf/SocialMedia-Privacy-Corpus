  "content": "It takes a lot to get Simon Cowell rattled, but rattled he appears to be. At a press conference today, Cowell acknowledged the Facebook campaign to get Rage Against the Machine's 1992 song, Killing in the Name, to Christmas No 1, saying it was \"dismissive\" of the public as it was directed at him. \"If there's a campaign, and I think the campaign's aimed directly at me, it's stupid. Me having a No 1 record at Christmas is not going to change my life particularly,\" Cowell said. \"I think it's quite a cynical campaign geared at me that is actually going to spoil the party for these three.\" The campaign was started by Tracy and Jon Morter, who launched the Facebook group \"Rage Against the Machine for Christmas No 1\" earlier this month with the words: \"Fed up of Simon Cowell's latest karaoke act being Christmas No 1? Me too ... So who's up for a mass-purchase of the track 'KILLING IN THE NAME' from December 13th (DON'T BUY IT YET!) as a protest to the X Factor monotony?\" Jon Morter told NME.com: \"It's been taken on by thousands in the group as a defiance to Cowell's 'music machine'. Some certainly see it as a direct response to him personally.\" So far, more than 500,000 people have joined. Only time will tell whether Rage Against the Machine have a chance of beating this year's as yet undecided X Factor winner. Last year's No 1, Alexandra Burke's cover of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, sold 576,000 copies in its opening week, which means that every single member of the Facebook group backing Rage Against the Machine would need to purchase the song to ensure their chance of victory. However, Leon Jackson, who won the competition in 2007, was able to clinch the coveted Christmas top spot after selling 275,000 copies of his single When You Believe in its opening week. That's almost exactly half the number of people who have promised to buy Killing in the Name on Sunday. Last year a similar internet campaign saw fans trying to get Jeff Buckley's version of Hallelujah to No 1 instead of Burke's. Buckley's version made it to No 2, but Leonard Cohen's original, however, only made it to No 36.",
