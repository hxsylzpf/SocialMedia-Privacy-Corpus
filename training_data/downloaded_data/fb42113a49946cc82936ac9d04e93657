  "content": "Happy belated birthday Facebook. The social networking giant turned 10 years old yesterday and it had all the hallmarks of any other anniversary: well-wishers, memories, embarrassing stories, baby pictures and \u2013 perhaps the last thing you want to hear at your own party \u2013 suggestions about your impending death. Whatever your views on the future of Facebook, you can't deny the platform's remarkable success. As John Naughton wrote for the Observer ahead of its landmark year, the fact that Facebook now boasts more than 1.23 billion users just 10 years after its launch is an incredible achievement: \"A company that did not exist 10 years ago now has as many users as India has people.\" The sheer size and widespread use of Facebook makes it a smart option for arts venues and organisations looking to engage new and existing audiences, but things have not always been straightforward for brands and pages. Facebook's much-debated news feed algorithm (called EdgeRank, but perhaps no longer inside the four walls of the company) is tricky and difficult to master \u2013 just when you think you've got the hang of posting with affinity, weight and time decay in mind, the dials are turned, things are changed behind the scenes and your stats suddenly look entirely different. Promoted Posts are one solution offered by the site, but how do they work and do you really need them? Also, what's going to happen to Facebook in the coming decade that might affect how you engage with your audiences \u2013 will its new standalone app Paper have an impact? Join us from noon on Tuesday 11 February as a panel of experts try to unpick those questions and offer some tips and insights for using the platform as an arts organisation.
