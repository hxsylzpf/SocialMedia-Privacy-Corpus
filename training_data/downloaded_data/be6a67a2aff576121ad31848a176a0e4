  "content": "Three months after walking out of the agency he founded 24 years ago Mark Borkowski, one of the biggest names in UK entertainment PR, is back with a new venture with partners including Jonathan Durden, the co-founder of global media buying network PHD. Borkowski dramatically ended his ties with the eponymous Borkowski PR in April, a week after he published a blog post lamenting that his profession was \"blanding out\" and how people needed to \"listen to your heart, rather than the seductive chatter of money\". He has unveiled his next venture, called Borkowski.do, with two co-founders in Durden and Ivan Clark, the former director of digital and creative solutions at WPP-owned agency Kinetic. Durden, who briefly became a household name after a now infamous implosion on Big Brother 8 in 2007, and Clark, now a media consultant, will take stakes in the business although Borkowski holds the lion's share. \"I'm not saying consumer PR is dead, there is nothing wrong with it, but the Borkowski brand has outgrown it,\" he said. \"I wanted to do something more modern. I want to move my brand further upstream to get into the development space, into consultancy \u2013 to where ad folk and brand folk start their thinking. To do that I needed a tool and people, a star chamber of talent.\" Borkowski, who is currently scouting out new premises in the London Bridge area, has acquired one-year exclusivity rights to a social media analytics tool called Beyond. He said he believed the tool, which is designed to help brands get better value out of their marketing, will be a winner with clients looking to understand how consumers really interact with their brands. Borkowski added that he was inspired to make the move into delivering social media-based consultancy after the runaway success of the campaign for Cadbury, which revived the Wispa brand following a Facebook campaign. Durden is also working with Claire Walsh, who has worked at independent TV producer Wall to Wall, the company behind Who Do You Think You Are? and New Tricks, as creative development consultant on \"trans media\" projects involving TV, online and social media. Borkowski.do is understood to already be working on three TV-style formats \u2013 one for online, one integrating with social media and one for TV. When Borkowski left his eponymous agency he retained the five staff of the arts and entertainment division and its clients, which include Mamma Mia, Womad and Suggs. He said he will also continue to do crisis PR. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
