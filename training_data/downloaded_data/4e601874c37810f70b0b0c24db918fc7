  "content": "Google Wave, a browser-based tool combines email, instant messaging and real-time interaction, is one of the most anticipated products to emerge this year. Today at 4pm BST the company will send out invitations to 100,000 users for further beta testing, including developers, people who signed up early and some users of Google Apps, it announced in a blog post. Lars Rasmussen, the brain behind Google Maps and now engineering manager for Wave at Google's Australian offices, said Google has \"focused almost exclusively on scalability, stability, speed and usability\". But he also warned that Google Wave hasn't implemented all key features and isn't ready for \"prime time\", because bugs are still likely. Google first showcased the product in May and published an 80-minute video on YouTube, which has been was watched more than 4m times to date. The buzz about the collaboration tool soon became deafening. Some have claimed that Google Wave is just an \"email and instant messaging on steroids\", but it could well well change the way web users collaborate. Indeed, the structure of the tool is flexible enough that it could be adapted for many different kinds of team working. Examples that have been suggested include the planing of a trip; scientific work in the lab or on an academic paper; the streamlining of the movie-making process; collaborative business modeling; or journalism. Indeed, Google Wave might have an impact on the landscape of journalism. It could change newsrooms and boost citizen journalism. As Jeff Jarvis has suggested, Google Wave could speed up the collaborative journalistic process from research to writing, including quotes, enriching articles with pictures and videos. Stories could be corrected by subeditors using Google Wave, while readers could suggest changes and use the tool to discuss the article. However, this buzz doesn't guarantee the success of Google Wave. Although the product connects with other live editing tools, it still might fail to reach a critical mass. The fact that Google Wave will run in most browsers except Internet Explorer might be a setback; users of the Microsoft browser will have to download a plug-in called Chrome Frame to use the application.",
