  "content": "Charlie Sheen, the former main man of Two and a Half Men, has two-and-a-half million followers on Twitter. His account reached a million in only 35 hours. He's a record breaker. So his sacking (by Time Warner) for conduct unbecoming has been a major hubbub for over two weeks now. (You don't net over $2m a show without loads of fans and headlines). But wait a moment, say assorted baffled bloggers on the Guardian's Comment is Free site. Bar fairly inconspicuous outings in the MTV and Comedy Central recesses of satellite broadcasting, the Sheen show has barely registered in the UK through its eight years of life. He may be a leftover household name from Wall Street and Platoon, but Sheen is no more of a British icon than, say, Glenn Beck, the oddball that even Fox News seems to be getting bored with. Would America's tweeters leap into action if Channel 4 decided not to use historian David Starkey again \u2013 or deemed comedian Alan Carr a bit of a drag? No. Then why are we supposed to grow quite so exercised about the fate of \"stars\" we barely know?",
