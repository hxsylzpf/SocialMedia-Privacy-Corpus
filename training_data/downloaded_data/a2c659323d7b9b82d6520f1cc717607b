  "content": "Max Mosley, the former president of motorsport's governing body the FIA and winner of a famous privacy victory over the News of the World, goes to the European court of human rights next week to seek a major restraint on press freedom. The court will hold an oral hearing next Tuesday to consider whether newspapers and other publishers should be required to warn individuals before writing about their private lives. That would give people an opportunity to seek court orders preventing breaches of privacy rather than having to make do with compensation after the damage is done. Public hearings at Strasbourg are quite rare these days, with most of the court's vast workload being resolved through written arguments. In choosing to hear short oral submissions, which it does in no more than two cases a month, the court is demonstrating the importance that it attaches to this issue. There is every chance that Mosley's counsel, Lord Pannick QC, will persuade the human rights judges that English law has failed to respect his client's private life, as required by article 8 of the human rights convention. We can see the way the court's mind is working from the questions it has put to lawyers for the two parties to the case, Mosley and the British government. First, the court asks, can Mosley still claim to be a \"victim\", given that Mr Justice Eady awarded him \u00a360,000 damages against the News of the World in 2008? No doubt Britain's reply will be an enthusiastic \"no\". But the court's remaining questions to the parties suggest that it is not likely to be very impressed with the argument that damages are a sufficient remedy. \"Did the government have a positive obligation,\" the judges ask, \"to protect [Mosley's] privacy by providing a legal duty... on the News of the World to warn him in advance of publication in order to ask him to seek an interim injunction? \"Would such a positive obligation ... strike the correct balance between the interests protected under article 8 and freedom of expression as guaranteed by article 10 of the convention?\" You can almost feel the court straining to say \"yes\". That would be Mosley's view, of course: he argues that prior notification is essential. \"Once something private is published,\" he explains, \"no court on earth can remove it from the public mind. That is why, in contrast to libel \u2013 where a court can restore a person's reputation \u2013 the only effective remedy is to prevent publication.\" Any injunction would only be temporary, he maintains. If the courts decide in an individual case that the media's right to freedom of expression outweighs the individual's right to privacy, then publication would be permitted. At most, there would be a short delay. It's a seductive argument. We can feel confident that our courts would have regarded newspaper disclosures in 2009 about MPs' expenses claims as being in the public interest, even though these amounted to invasion of privacy on a huge scale. An injunction would probably have been refused. But other revelations, though similarly justified, might be delayed until they have lost their news value or, at the very least, their exclusivity to one news outlet. That would deter newspapers from committing themselves to investigative journalism. Without it, the scandal of MPs' expenses might never have been exposed. There is also a respectable argument for saying that damages are an adequate remedy for breaches of privacy, as they are for libel. Yes, everybody now knows about Mosley's enjoyment of sado-masochistic activities. But we also know that he was vindicated in the courts. We know that he won a vote of confidence from the governing body of world motorsport and retired at a time of his own choosing. Eady said in 2008 that Mosley was \"hardly exaggerating when he says that his life was ruined\". But that assessment has not borne out by subsequent events. Mosley has earned respect for the dignified way in which he has conducted himself and his privacy campaign. No journalist wants to see an enhanced law of privacy \u2013 especially at a time when the government may be willing to restore some of the balance to libel law. But when the Strasbourg judges deliver their ruling later in the year, we may well find that a prior notification requirement is what the court has imposed on us.",
