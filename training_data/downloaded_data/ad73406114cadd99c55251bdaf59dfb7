  "content": "Have you heard of the Harlem Shake? Last week, neither had we. It begins with one person, usually wearing head gear, dancing alone to the song Harlem Shake by Baauer, while those nearby seem unaware. After about 15 seconds, the bass kicks in and the video cuts to a crowd of people dancing crazily for the next 15 seconds; usually wearing costumes and wielding a prop or two. The UK press were starting to run a few stories about organisations who had got on board, so we thought, \"Why not us too?\" Making our own Harlem Shake video was a great opportunity to engage our supporters, highlight the work that we do and give a more personal face to our organisation. While you can't anticipate that a video will go viral, those that do result in huge brand awareness and the really successful ones live on forever in the mind of the public \u2013 like the brilliant White and Re-Write campaign from Tippex. So, how can we help our videos on their way? 1. Share We live in the age of sharing. If your brand's not across social networking channels it's unlikely that you'll be thinking of making a video with the hope of it going viral. If you are making one, share it! On the surface, organisations behind viral videos maintain a fa\u00e7ade of nonchalance \u2013 but under the water their feet are paddling furiously to get their video seen by as many people as possible. Not everyone has a budget as big as Cadbury's and can get their video on TV, so use what you have. There's no real link to chocolate or Cadbury's in some of their past Dairy Milk adverts, but they got everyone talking about both their eyebrows advert and their gorilla advert. Use every means at your disposal to get your video out there \u2013 share it with people of influence. Whether media contacts, celebrities or other organisations, if these people are interested in what you've produced they will share it on. 2. Finger on the button When choosing the theme for your video, keep it topical. We chose the Harlem Shake because that's what is taking over the internet right now. We filmed the video and got it out on our social media channels within 24 hours. If we'd taken two or three weeks to rehearse and fine-tune, we might have ironed out some kinks, but we would have been too late. The Harlem Shake will soon join Gangnam Style in the retirement home of virals. A major barrier for a lot of organisations is the internal sign off process. We're lucky at Mencap that our management team understand the importance of moving quickly for digital work. Think about setting up specific digital sign-off processes, so that when you've got something amazing to get out there, you're not rushing around looking for the one person who can give the green light. Keep the whole organisation up-to-date with digital success stories \u2013 once people see what can be achieved with a bit of creative thinking, they'll never look back. 3. Be appropriate Particularly in the world of charity, some messages just won't be right for your supporters. Don't let concerns over political correctness stop you, but do make sure you're not putting your foot in it. The Movember campaign to change the face of men's health shows the virality of concepts, not just videos. What started in Australia has spread to South Africa, Europe and North America and the Mo Bros are synonymous with the fight against prostate cancer. 4. Don't take yourself seriously Don't overthink your video. A video that's edited to perfection isn't necessarily what viewers want. This is your opportunity to cut through corporate formality and show the personality of your team, and of your organisation \u2013 like Mike in the Dollar Shave Club video. Social media strategist Laura Olin, who worked on Barack Obama's re-election campaign, says \"I think something that we discovered was that if you put things in terms that people actually want to share, they will share them. We always tried to be really human.\" The aim is to create content that people want to share because it is good content, not because it conforms to ideas traditionally aligned with the brand \u2013 entertainment is first, message second. 5. Measure results Making our Harlem Shake video has really helped us engage in a fun way with our social media supporters. Tweets sent in the first few days after we launched the video from @Mencap_charity had over 1.2 million potential impressions and feedback from our followers has been overwhelmingly positive. The video itself has had over 5,500 views. Considering it was a first attempt, we're pretty happy. Video brings new rules and while anyone who's anyone on social media knows better than to treat their followers like just another sales opportunity, don't lose your friendly attitude just because they can see your face. If your video is staid, people won't engage \u2013 and really, that's what this is all about. Rachel Carn is the online marketing officer at Mencap.
