  "content": "A week on from supposedly leaked divorce papers and it is fair to say that Heather Mills McCartney has received a mauling at the hands of the press. It is also fair to say, as her lawyers have stated, that this has been extremely upsetting and damaging for her. The question she will be asking herself and that the legal process will be required to test is: is it illegal and does it overstep the boundaries of what can be deemed as justified or fair in relation to the effect it has on Mills McCartney's private life and reputation? To the extent that the family courts are likely to take a dim view of last week's \"revelations\", beyond threatening to report the press for contempt, they are not going to step in to stem the flow of derogatory copy about Mills McCartney and her alleged motives. If she wants protection or compensation, she will need to pursue a defamation or privacy claim. The difficulty on both counts is that the damage has been done. A series of defamatory allegations appeared in the press earlier this year, her split from Sir Paul being taken as a signal by journalists that it was now open season on her. Having suffered allegations of being a \"liar\", \"fantasist\" and a \"former hooker\", Mills McCartney may have hoped that last week's revelations might send some sympathy back in her direction. Far from doing so, they have merely served as an excuse for a fresh examination of her character and credibility. Having declared, through her lawyers, that she would be seeking to sue the Mail and the London Evening Standard (and possibly the Sun later) over their allegations, can Mills McCartney counter their coverage with a cogent cause of action? The Sun has been merciless in its response to her complaints and has basically taunted her by suggesting that she has no reputation left to protect. But is it for the Sun to suggest or a court to decide? There can be no denying that the sum total of recent coverage Mills McCartney has been subjected to is defamatory and damaging. With allegations phrased as suggestions and spread across several papers, will she be able to make a specific claim stick? Where the papers have strayed beyond the provable, they may seek to argue their comment is fair. The fairness of some comment may, were it to come to court, be extinguished by malice - do we need to be reminded several times in one piece that she has one leg? - but that will be for a jury to decide if a libel action ensues. If it can be shown that a claimant has no reputation deserving of protection, the courts are unlikely to uphold a defamation claim. This was made clear in the 2002 case of footballer Bruce Grobbelaar and News Group Newspapers in which Lord Bingham stated: \"The tort of defamation protects those whose reputations have been unlawfully injured. It affords little or no protection to those who have, or deserve to have, no reputation deserving of legal protection\". While it will be for the press to justify their attacks on Mills McCartney's reputation, she for her part may have to argue that insofar as they may be deemed to be untrue, they have damaged her reputation. Beyond defamation, she may argue that her privacy has been invaded. The right to respect for her private and family life is protected through the operation of the Human Rights Act and reflected in the press complaints code. The problem here is that her life and divorce have been conducted very much in public. So if she is seeking protection through privacy laws, the courts will need to assess her reasonable expectation of privacy and separate it as a human right from the publicity surrounding it. Thus far her lawyers have not confirmed what cause of action she may be seeking to sue under while the various papers implicated have all said they will vigourously stand by their stories. The bitter irony remains that the only claims that have not been defended by the newspapers as being true are those in the leaked papers that have rekindled this row. \u00b7 Edgar Forbes is senior lecturer in media law at Bournemouth Media School \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
