  "content": "Nigel Havers has denied giving reporters quotes that appeared in a Daily Express news story that is the subject of a complaint by his solicitor. An article about the actor and his new girlfriend attending the premiere of Hot Ice in Blackpool appeared in the Express on Monday, prompting a letter to the paper from solicitors Stitt &amp; Co. No Daily Express journalists were at the Blackpool event, but local radio and news agency reporters did attend. Stitt &amp; Co claimed the article breached the Press Complaints Commission's code of practice in relation to accuracy and privacy. The Daily Express has not commented about the dispute, but David Graham, of Watsons Press Agency, said he interviewed Havers at the event, as did other journalists, including a local radio reporter. Graham then sold his story to the Express. \"We were informed by officials on the night that he had no objection to the relationship being known about. We were given a steer, to put it in journalistic terms. We were ushered towards him,\" Graham said. \"Everybody in the press were told that he was quite happy to talk and during the course of the evening he was talked to. \"The press were doing their job. When I was talking to him he had a microphone stuck under his mouth from local radio.\" Havers was attending last weekend's Blackpool Pleasure Beach's production of Hot Ice, starring the winner of ITV's Dancing on Ice, Daniel Whiston, with theatre producer David Pugh. Stitt &amp; Co said Havers talked to journalists at the event, but he and other witnesses deny he gave the quotes that appeared in the Express article. In its letter to the Daily Express earlier this week, Stitt &amp; Co stated: \"Mr Havers has not spoken to a reporter and is anxious to avoid other newspapers picking up the quotes and treating them as his own words.\" A spokesman for Stitt &amp; Co said that Havers did not receive an appearance fee for attending the event. OK! magazine, which like the Daily Express is published by Richard Desmond's Northern &amp; Shell company, sponsored the Pleasure Beach night in return for picture rights, but not interview rights. Havers, 56, rose to fame in the film Chariots of Fire in the early 80s and recently appeared in BBC1's Little Britain and ITV1's comedy drama Open Wide. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
