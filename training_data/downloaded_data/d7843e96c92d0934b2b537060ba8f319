  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission has agreed to explicitly ban the use of phone hacking and intercepts in its code of practice in response to the Clive Goodman royal phone hacking scandal. The industry watchdog has adopted several code changes proposed by the PCC's editors' committee following the affair, which resulted in Goodman, a News of the World reporter, being jailed and the paper's editor, Andy Coulson, resigning in January. Other changes include banning subterfuge unless in the public interest and making explicit that editors are not responsible for user-generated content on their websites. The PCC said the changes were \"a response to concerns\" raised by the Goodman case. They were also introduced to counter the information commissioner's fears about intrusion into privacy in relation to the illegal trade in confidential information. The PCC editors' committee said the existing code covered such cases but it wanted explicit clauses referring to them. One amendment to the code prevents people accessing private information held digitally without consent. The second change specifies that engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge via agents or intermediaries can only be justified if done in the public interest. Clause 10 of the code has been revised to state: \"The press must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by using hidden cameras or clandestine listening devices; or by intercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails; or by the unauthorised removal of documents or photographs; or by accessing digitally held private information without consent. \"Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge, including by agents or intermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public interest, and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.\" The editors' code of practice committee also made two changes to the code's preamble, which sets out its spirit and philosophy. One change specifically excluded user-generated and non-edited material from the code's remit in relation to online publications. It defined editorial material as that for which the editor of a newspaper or magazine is responsible and could reasonably have been expected to exercise control over. The preamble's third paragraph has been revised to say: \"It is the responsibility of editors and publishers to apply the code to editorial material in both printed and online versions of publications. \"They should take care to ensure it is observed rigorously by all editorial staff and external contributors, including non-journalists.\" The preamble's first paragraph now states: \"All members of the press have a duty to maintain the highest professional standards. The code, which includes this preamble and the public interest exceptions below, sets the benchmark for those ethical standards, protecting both the rights of the individual and the public's right to know.\" The PCC, which adjudicates on complaints under the code, has ratified the changes, which take effect from August 1. The code committee chairman, Les Hinton, the executive chairman of News International, which publishes the News of the World, said the changes made the code stronger and more effective. \"First, we wanted to ensure the preamble and public interest exceptions - which set out to balance the rights of the individual and the public's right to know - are both instantly recognised as essential and indivisible elements of the document by anyone using the code, be they a journalist, reader, lawyer or a judge,\" he said. \"Second, it was vital that the code's approach to online and printed versions of newspapers was fully synchronised. The online guidance note's definition of editorial material as that which might reasonably be expected to be edited applies equally well to printed versions. \"It means, for example, that while readers' letters to the editor continue to be covered by the code, advertising and marketing material continue not to be. \"Finally, in clause 10, we felt that, under the spirit of the code, as removal of documents or photographs without consent is already unacceptable, then hacking into computers to obtain such material must also be. \"Similarly, the use of third parties to gain information that would otherwise be protected by the code would also amount to a breach. In both cases, it would be better, for the avoidance of doubt, to state this specifically.\" The Society of Editors will distribute 40,000 wallet-sized copies of the revised PCC code to journalists, politicians and civic leaders. The other members of the code committee are Neil Benson of Trinity Mirror Regional Newspapers; Adrian Faber of the Express and Star Wolverhampton; Mike Gilson of the Scotsman; Douglas Melloy of the Rotherham and South Yorkshire Advertiser; Ian Murray of the Southern Evening Echo; Lindsay Nicholson of the National Magazine Company; Jonathan Grun of the Press Association; David Pollington of the Sunday Post; Alan Rusbridger of the Guardian: Neil Wallis of the News of the World; Harriet Wilson of Conde Nast; John Witherow of the Sunday Times and Peter Wright of the Mail on Sunday. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
