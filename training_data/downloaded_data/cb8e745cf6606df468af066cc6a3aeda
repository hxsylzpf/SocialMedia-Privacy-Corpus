Mr Murdoch, the News Corp chairman, told a media conference in New York that he had sent his wife to China to help with the launch \"because she understands the language\". He said the company was trying to find a way to enter the Chinese market without running into political obstacles and the \"heavy weather\"\" that Google and Yahoo! have encountered, according to a report in the Financial Times. News Corp bought MySpace last year for $580m (\u00a3307m) and the site has more than 100 million users. \"We have to make MySpace a very Chinese site,\" Mr Murdoch said at a conference organised by investment bank Goldman Sachs. \"I have sent my wife across there because she understands the language.\" He said MySpace in China was likely to have local partners, who would own about 50% and would ensure that the content was suitable for a Chinese audience, while the partners would deal with complaints. The country has the world's second-largest population of internet users, after the US, with 123 million people online. News Corp's expansion plans in China have been curtailed by restrictions on foreign media ownership. The government promotes internet use for education and business but tries to block any material considered subversive or pornographic. Many Chinese-language blogs and websites deemed politically dangerous have been shut down in recent months while dozens of people have been jailed for posting political views online. Google, Yahoo! and other companies have been criticised by human rights activists and internet users for cooperating with Chinese government efforts to censor internet content. Human Rights Watch claims many web firms had become complicit in politically repressive activities. It has called the policies of Yahoo!, Google and Microsoft \"arbitrary, opaque and unaccountable\", saying users deserved to know more about the way they operated. Google recently launched a censored version of its internet search engine inside China. Yahoo! was criticised after it handed over to the Chinese authorities the personal details of two journalists, Shi Tao and Li Zhi, who were later imprisoned. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
