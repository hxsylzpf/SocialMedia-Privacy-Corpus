  "content": "There was a fight in the Palace of Westminster this week. It was a small fight, and nothing to ruffle the International League Table of Legislator Physical Violence, where first place is still held by Taiwan, because the opposition and ruling party frequently beat each other and sometimes throw food. Still, this fight was non-violent, instructive and very British. Mark Pritchard, a Tory MP described \"as mild mannered\" in the way that serial killers are usually described as mild-mannered until the lampshades made of skin are found in the basement, apparently impeded the movement of Speaker Bercow, who was progressing through the palace like a small medieval king mounted on a skateboard. \"The courtesy of the house is that honourable members should stand aside when the Speaker passes by,\" said Bercow, whose rudeness to his former Tory colleagues is marvellous. He even pointed at Pritchard, to emphasise that he was not talking to a random ornamental vase. And so Pritchard, still recovering from an earlier slight in the chamber when the Speaker had not called him, believing Pritchard had been in the toilet or something, freaked. \"You are not fucking royalty, Mr Speaker,\" he said. Mr Speaker didn't comment on this, probably because he is married to Sally. \"Well, a good morning to you, Sir,\" he said instead, and skated off, leaving Pritchard to brief the newspapers, and comment: \"When someone abuses me in this house they are abusing my constituents.\" Yes, I am sure that is exactly what was in your mind. You were thinking of the poor folk of The Wrekin. You should go down there and mobilise the pitchforks. I bet they want to put Bercow's head on a spike and toast each other noisily with ale. The first lesson is that it would probably be best not to have a legislature whose central practices resemble Cinderella inexplicably transformed into a system of government. Burn the stupid costumes; let Black Rod walk forwards, not backwards; and allow the politicians to call each other liars in public, because they long to, and we long for them to do so. Perhaps we could even abolish the word \"Sir\", because it means \"You bastard\", and now everyone knows, rather than strongly suspects, that it does? These few acknowledgments that we may be living in a modern liberal democracy might make British people feel that parliament actually has something to do with them. The next lesson is that public charm is fraying, and it is time that it did. Despite his courtly language \u2013 which should, and indeed might have, come with a free packet of gently fluttering rose petals \u2013 Bercow could not be bothered to be charming to Pritchard: \"Prithee, Sir, I beg you to stand aside, for your enormous feet \u2013 and how wondrous it is that feet of such size should exist in this or any other palace \u2013 may stand on my robe and tear the hem of this lush garment, which should cause me such agonies I would beat my breast and weep for a thousand years.\" Pritchard could not be bothered to be charming to Bercow: \"Why Sir, you had only to ask, for should I tear your pretty hem, even in error, I would weep for a thousand and one years and never duel again.\" This did not happen. I welcome this shrivelling of charm, because charm is a bad thing in public discourse, the verbal equivalent of licking someone while stabbing them in the tongue. Consider David Cameron, possibly the most skilled charmer to ever stand at a dispatch box and lie. I do not say this to compliment him, although he would probably take it as such. Now they can no longer hang poachers and wave their sabres, charm is the weapon of choice of the English aristocrat. They switch it on and off, like the kettle. And I mistrust it. It is the practice of taking everything, while appearing not to, because you make self-deprecating jokes and smile, and are photographed jogging \u2013 see how I suffer! It is the opposite of conversation, a subtle, evasive and malevolent form of lying. And, as Polly Toynbee demonstrated on these pages recently, Cameron is possibly the most skilled liar to ever stand at the dispatch box and charm. The rightwing papers may swallow it \u2013 charmers don't make gaffes that fill pages \u2013 but the voters, it seems, don't. What is charm when your public services wither and you know that they do? Cameron was punched at Oldham East and Saddleworth, even if he charmingly said he didn't mind. He will live by charm, and he will die by it. And what is left, the internet will eat. Charm needs a face and there are no faces online. Twitter, while blunt and shrieking and full of people who use words like Twitter Consensus and talk about pizza, has already demonstrated that it is no longer possible to survive casual homophobia (Jan Moir) or, this week, taunting anorexics (Kenneth Tong). It will outlaw other outrageous behaviour and give us a more honest public discourse in time. And, while we wait, we have Speaker Bercow's impersonation of the late Queen Mother to entertain us.",
