  "content": "The judge in the Old Bailey trial of Princess Diana's former butler Paul Burrell has defended the decision not to read out all of the prosecution's evidence in open court following complaints by the media. Mrs Justice Rafferty said the \"interests of justice\" in the case must also include those of Princes William and Harry. Jonathan Caplan QC, representing sections of the media, maintained that in dealing with Mr Burrell's defence statement, the prosecution had deliberately not read out certain passages when opening the case. \"In opening the case a statement by Mr Burrell - a very important document in his defence - certain passages were deliberately not read out by the prosecution in open court,\" said Mr Caplan. He added that unless there were legal exceptions: \"The principle of justice clearly requires all the evidence in open court to be read publicly.\" The judge replied that she had reminded herself of \"the principle of open justice and the court's duty to balance that principle against the interests of justice, in pursuance of a fair trial\". She continued: \"The interests of justice in this singular case encompass not only those of Mr Burrell but also those of the two young princes.\" The prosecution counsel, William Boyce QC, said that only \"one small passage\" was not read out in open court. He said one of the key themes in the statement was the special relationship between Mr Burrell and Diana, Princess of Wales. Mr Burrell's trial - on charges of plundering the late princess's possessions - is in its third day. A new jury has been sworn in after the first one was dismissed yesterday for legal reasons.",
