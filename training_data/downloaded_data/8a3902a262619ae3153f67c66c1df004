To a team of developers trying to imagine how to make use of the new data.gov.uk repository \u2013 intended to hold all of the government data being made publicly available \u2013 the best way was to build one around people's postcodes. That led to an experiment called the \"Postcode Paper\", unveiled to a team of civil servants at a developer hack day last month by Newspaper Club \u2013 a site which aims to create newspapers of all sorts. The Postcode Paper is \"a prototype of a service for people moving into a new area. In our exercise we imagined you might receive it after paying your council tax for the first time,\" wrote Tom Taylor of Newspaper Club. \"It gathers information about your area, such as local services, environmental information and crime statistics.\" The blogpost shows pictures of the paper, with the example of London E5 0JA \u2013 in Homerton \u2013 showing how much green space there is, where allotments are, and what sort of recycling there is. Newspaper Club also used Transport for London for travel times, and Ito to create a map of transport options and times. Among those present were representatives from the Department for Communities and Local Government, which will be keen to see projects that involve citizens more closely in their area. The example has stimulated a number of people to try to make better use of public data. Jonathan Powell, who has been working on similar projects in Leeds, notes in the comments that \"We're attempting to obtain social history information and geotagged media/discussion as well as raw statistics.\" The data.gov.uk website is not yet open to the public, though developers can sign up if invited. There is also a Google Group where signed-up developers are discussing topics including an API for NHS data, educational datasets, and the extent to which spreadsheets are a sufficient stand-in for semantic web technologies when trying to analyse crime data. Clearly, building a relevant newspaper on local data for anywhere in the country may take a little while \u2013 but good progress is being made behind the scenes.
