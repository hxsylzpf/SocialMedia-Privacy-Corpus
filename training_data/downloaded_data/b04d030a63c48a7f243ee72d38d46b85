  "content": "More than 15,000 people have signed up to a Facebook group supporting Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross, which has a protest planned for tomorrow outside the Daily Mail's London offices. Fans of the pair are planning a demonstrate outside the Mail's Derry Street HQ in Kensington at noon, followed by one outside BBC offices in the capital. Called Support Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross, Facebook group has swollen its membership in recent days as Brand resigned from his Radio 2 show and Ross was suspended without pay from all BBC TV and radio services for three months. The 15,609 supporters who have joined the Facebook group compares with the 34,690 who complained to the BBC about the show following the Mail on Sunday's story on October 26. Only two people complained after the show was broadcast on October 18. The Support Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross group is also presenting a petition signed by almost 4,000 people. \"We, the undersigned call on the BBC to turn blame on the Andrew Sachs incident away from Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross as it was only intended as a joke,\" the petition states. \"We also wish that Jonathan Ross's and Russell Brand's careers will continue just as before this started.\" The idea for protest outside the Daily Mail's offices came from another Facebook group called The Official Picket of the Daily Mail Offices. There was also support today for Brand from campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Despite angry calls and emails to Peta headquarters suggesting it replace Brand on the cover of the latest edition of the organisation's vegetarian starter kit, the animal rights organization has refused. PETA director Robbie LeBlanc says that the organisation will stand by Russell: \"The cover will have him on it because Mr Sachs, who is also a PETA supporter, has accepted Mr Brand's apology, and that's good enough for us.\" Yesterday supporters of Brand and Ross protested outside the BBC Television Centre in west London. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
