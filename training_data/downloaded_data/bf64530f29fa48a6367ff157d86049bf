A high court judge ordered that the \u00adevidence should be handed over to Max Clifford. The celebrity publicist has begun a legal action seeking to prove that the Sunday newspaper unlawfully \u00adintercepted messages on his mobile phone. The result could put fresh pressure on David \u00adCameron's media adviser Andy Coulson, the paper's former editor. Mr Justice Vos ordered that Clifford was entitled to see three sets of evidence in order to establish the truth. The first set concerned documents uncovered by the information commissioner, the \u00adprivacy watchdog, during a raid on a private investigator. David Clancy, an investigator for the information commissioner, told the court the News of the World and other newspaper submitted unlawful requests to the investigator for intimate details of \u00adcelebrities on an \"endemic\" scale. Jeremy Reed, Clifford's barrister, said the documents would help disprove the paper's claim that it generally did not do \"naughty things\". He told the court: \"The documents are likely to illustrate the modus operandi of the News of the World's journalists when seeking private and confidential information about individuals for the purposes of stories being written about them.\" Anthony Hudson, counsel for the News of the World, said the paper resisted the disclosure of the documents, arguing they were irrelevant to Clifford's claim and contained no information about the publicist. He did not dispute the contents of the information commissioner's evidence which alleges that 27 News of the World reporters paid the investigator, Stephen Whittamore, to obtain personal data. One submitted 130 requests. The second set of evidence related to another private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who was convicted of hacking into the phones of five people, including \u00adClifford, in 2007. He was paid by the paper to hack into phones. Also convicted at the time was Clive Goodman, the paper's royal reporter. The court heard that Mulcaire admitted he hacked into Clifford's phone messages. The judge ruled that Mulcaire disclose the names of everyone who instructed him to target Clifford as well as those who received recordings or transcripts of the messages. Copies of secret agreements between the paper and Mulcaire would also have to be disclosed. Clifford is following in the footsteps of Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers Association, who was secretly paid \u00a3700,000 in damages and costs by the paper for breach of privacy. Yesterday, the judge ruled that a copy of the confidential settlement between the paper and Taylor should also be handed over to Clifford's legal team. This week the Guardian revealed more evidence contradicting the paper's official version of events that there were \"only a handful\" of victims in the scandal. Three leading mobile phone companies said more than 100 customers had their voicemail accessed by Mulcaire and Goodman.",
