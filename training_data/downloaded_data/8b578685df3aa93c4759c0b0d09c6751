  "content": "This may cause some sort of cataclysm: the collision of Apple and Twitter. No, not the daftly-rumoured buyout last year of the one by the other; Scott Forstall, the excitable and always-happy senior vice-president of Apple's iPhone software division, has a Twitter account. How do we know it's him? Because it's verified - Twitter will have checked against his email and other details. At the time of writing, he is following one person (the highly-favoured American comedian Conan O'Brien) and more than 18,000 followers. And he has tweeted... not at all. Not a single time. Nada. Zilch. Though the account was only created yesterday, and he might have been busy with meetings or something about, umm, the possibility of an iPhone software update in the very near future. So the world waits breathlessly to see if he's going to explain what's really up with the antenna. It's a fascinating development; although there are already a number of Apple staff on Twitter (Chris Espinosa, one of its longest-serving employees, for example), Forstall is one of the highest-ranking executives there, and certainly the most senior at Apple - unless Phil Schiller has a stealth account. Of course, if you choose to be like the Daily Mail, then you could always believe that ceoSteveJobs is the real item. (Though, reading it, it's a pity it's not.)",
