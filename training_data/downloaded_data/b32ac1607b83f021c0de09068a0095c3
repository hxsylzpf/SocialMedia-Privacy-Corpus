Along the way they blogged, tweeted and \u2013 even \u2013 reported on the event, and in the process revealed that Brazil doesn't like James Cameron much. That the South Americans are antipathetic to the Avatar man is certainly the impression you'd get from looking at the trending topics on Twitter this morning. The social networking site was churning through thousands of posts a minute during the height of the Oscars ceremony, and many of those that originated from Brazil were followed by the tag #chupajamescameron. A piece of local slang, chupa means \"suck it!\", suggesting either that either Brazilians were glad the Avatar director lost to his ex-wife's The Hurt Locker, or he's being offered a giant caipirinha complete with straw. In other locations, topics trended differently. Londoners, being a bunch of poncey so-and-sos, were talking about Logorama, the winner in the animated short category. Also trending there were Christoph Waltz, the Austrian who won best supporting actor for his role in Inglourious Basterds, and Molly Ringwald, who delivered a tribute to the departed John Hughes and looked a lot older than people remembered her being in 1985. Meanwhile in the States, the coasts were posting about Kathryn Bigelow (the Hurt Locker director's name trending well in LA and New York), whereas the chart for the US as a whole had another woman entirely, Catherine Bigalow, as the name of the moment. When everyone and their dog is tweeting about the Oscars, there are some voices that are worth listening to a little more attentively than others. Roger Ebert (@ebertchicago) is a case in point: the Chicago Sun-Times film critic is a dab hand at the 140-character format and was tweeting with aplomb throughout the night. Examples included: \"WTF? Cinematography for \"Avatar\" and all that CGI and green screen? Not for Basterds or White Ribbon?\" And, when Quentin Tarantino and Pedro Almod\u00f3var appeared to introduce the best foreign film category: \"Almod\u00f3var intros a category in which his Broken Embraces absolutely should have been nominated.\" And, finally, after Jeff Bridges collected his best actor gong: \"The Dude Aboded.\" Away from social networking, and most of the big online film sites were running live blogs of the event. Some offered nothing much more than endless sniping about dresses; others, like the one at Entertainment Weekly, were hosted by staffers as keen to share details of their private lives than talk about the nominations (Missy: \"From the French husband: 'This is a cool format.'\" Missy: \"Il s'appelle Julien\"; Missy: \"We watched The Big Lebowski together on the night we were married\"). Nikki Finke delivered a \"Live Snark\" on her Deadline Hollywood Daily pages that definitely lived up to the title. This, for example, was her take on The Hurt Locker best picture win: \"So David slew Goliath. Or, to put it another way, Academy voters rewarded a tiny film that made no money just because almost everyone in Hollywood really dislikes James Cameron. This shows how out of touch the Oscars are with moviegoers around the world, who loved Avatar. And people wonder why I have nothing but contempt for the Academy?\" Finke's was an opinion almost entirely contrary to that of AO Scott, who was liveblogging at the New York Times. \"No great surprises in the end,\" Scott wrote, \"but a reminder that 2009 was a pretty good year for movies ... sometimes even in Hollywood money and hype and spin are not entirely decisive. The Hurt Locker is an honest, tough, well-made movie. The Academy got it right: not something I'm used to saying.\" Finally, if you were after something other than the printed word, there were other ways of consuming Oscar commentary. The Movie blog, for example, chose to do its Oscars coverage via Ustream; a live unedited video feed. This was all marvellous and modern, in principle, at least. In practice, it was more than four hours of watching a man peer at his laptop reading other people's comments.",
