  "content": "Thanks to an article in the Observer last Sunday, the West End has been all a-twitter with wild (and for the most part, I suspect, grossly inaccurate) speculation about the identity of a mysterious theatrical tweeter who goes by the moniker @westendproducer. The tweeter describes themselves as a \"theatre impresario\", who \"likes musicals [but] plays tend to be a bit long\". They comment (in rather vague, general terms) about goings on in Theatreland, signing off tweets with \"dear\" and referring to the amount of Dom (champagne) they imbibe. The tone of the tweets is waspish; they drop none-too-subtle hints that they might in fact be the genuine theatrical impresario Cameron Mackintosh. I've been following @westendproducer on Twitter for the best part of the last month. He (or she) has rather nicely captured the caricatured persona of a camp, bitchy theatrical impresario. A typical comment might be \"Jerusalem was fantastic. Even though I was disappointed at the lack of jazz hands, tap dancing, and falsetto-singing, dears\", or a titbit of advice for a would-be performer might be \"Dancers \u2013 if you want to distract the choreographer from the fact that you don't know all the moves, just wear less clothes, dear.\" Most of it is pretty inane, some of it is gently amusing, but it doesn't sound like any theatre producers I know. Indeed, before the Observer article, it had never seriously occurred to me that @westendproducer might be the real deal. I see absolutely no reason why the creator of that persona should be an actual producer. In fact, I'd be hugely surprised if that was the case. For a start, most (although admittedly not all) of the producers I know aren't particularly au fait with Twitter. As Cameron Mackintosh himself acknowledged when approached by the Observer about whether he was @westendproducer, \"the fact that someone thinks I am technically savvy enough to tweet (dear) is a big compliment!\" Mackintosh isn't the only one. Forget tweeting \u2013 I can think of at least one major West End producer who doesn't use email. But, for me, the biggest indication that this isn't a real producer is the sheer volume of tweets. At a quick glance, I recently counted more than 50 tweets in a 24-hour period. Producers, especially the successful ones, are incredibly busy people; there's no way I can see any of them having time to devote themselves so completely to an extended joke like this. My best guess, if we really need to get into it, is that @westendproducer is an out-of-work actor (someone with time on their hands and a general knowledge of the industry) or perhaps a theatre blogger. On that note, another thought. I can't help but catch a whiff of the West End Whingers in all this: the exploitation of digital media, the waspish tone, the anonymity, the frequent references to booze \u2013 and, of course, the use of theatrical masks as a logo.",
