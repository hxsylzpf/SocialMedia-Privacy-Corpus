  "content": "The wait is over. The embattled Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) today levied its first financial penalties for serious breaches of the Data Protection Act (DPA). Hertfordshire county council will have to stump up \u00a3100,000 for faxing details about child sex abuse cases to the wrong recipients on two occasions. Employment services company A4e was separately fined \u00a360,000 for losing an unencrypted laptop containing sensitive information about 24,000 people. Today the ICO bore the teeth that it was given in April. The incidents \u2013 both of which occurred in June, just weeks after the ICO was given extended powers to fine up to \u00a3500,000 \u2013 now set a barometer for future breaches of privacy. They sit somewhere between Google's unlawful collection of so-called \"payload\" data \u2013 deemed unworthy of a monetary penalty, despite deafening calls of encouragement \u2013 and HM Revenue &amp; Customs' loss of 25 million peoples' child benefit data in 2007, which the information commissioner retrospectively said would have warranted the maximum fine. Which leads us nicely on to London-based solicitors' firm ACS:Law, from which incriminating details of thousands of UK internet users leaked in September. The private information \u2013 which included the addresses and telephone numbers of people suspected of sharing adult material \u2013 emerged online in the aftermath of a coordinated attack on its website. If the commissioner determines that the data exposure was through ACS:Law's security shortcomings, rather than directly as the result of hacking, then it could heavily fine the company. Chris McIntosh, of security encryption firm Stonewood, said the guilty party \"should not be too concerned\" about being heavily punished, based on today's ruling. \"After all, the data loss was a one-off event,\" he said. \"It could be argued that the loss was due to the activity of hackers rather than the firm itself, and 'only' 13,400 individuals' data was lost. \"Bearing this in mind, I don't have high hopes that the maximum fine will be levied. The ICO may see this as beyond its remit, preferring to leave a larger fine to other powers.\" Bridget Treacy, the head of UK privacy and information law at London-based solicitors' firm Hunton &amp; Williams, said it was hard to predict the outcome of the ACS:Law investigation since there are \"other complexities and other parties involved\". Conservative MP Rob Halfon revealed in a parliamentary debate on privacy and the internet last month that the ICO conceded to him that it was constrained by UK data protection legislation when it came to taking action against Google, though he did not elucidate on how it was held back. \"The ICO is hamstrung because it has very limited enforcement powers,\" Treacy said today. \"They are fairly paltry compared to other regulator organisations, the Financial Services Authority for example.\" Asked what powers would strengten the ICO, Treacy said: \"There have long been calls for imprisonment, they would be able to issue greater fines. The use of the [legal] undertaking is quite interesting. Internationally, we see regulators using powers creatively. But all of this is part of an ongoing debate. \"There will be surprise that a public sector entity has been fined. In this case, Hertfordshire county council's breaches were serious, but there is no escaping the fact that local council taxes will be funding the fine in a time of public sector cut backs,\" she said.",
