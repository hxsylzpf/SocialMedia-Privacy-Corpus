  "content": "\"Would you like an easy peeler?\" Liz Kendall asks me, pulling out a massive bag of satsumas. The job, says the shadow minister for care and older people, and the Labour candidate for Leicester West, is extremely unhealthy, though that's not the biggest problem with working in politics. First elected as an MP in 2010, Kendall has already been disciplined for tweeting in the House of Commons and for passing a bottle of water to a colleague doing her maiden speech, and complains about the inefficient and outdated Parliamentary conventions \u2013 including the 40-minute ritual of physically walking through the lobby to vote. The process would be far more efficient voting electronically, she says, while the order of speakers could also be published online so members didn't have to wait four hours to talk for five minutes. \"Parliament is just not fit for purpose,\" she says. \"Even in the chamber there's no list of who will speak, but an unwritten list that they won't publish. But we won't get there without strong leadership that recognises that they need to lead by technological example.\" Technology has been neglected by every party in this election. Even the Conservatives, who published a simple but compelling technology manifesto in 2010, have failed to follow up for 2015. And Labour, which has been working with some respected UK technologists for months, developed a slate of compelling ideas that failed to make it into its manifesto. Why? After a long pause, Kendall says: \"Well, it was a significant part of the policy review,\" referencing the work done by Labour's policy coordinator Jon Cruddas. \"The big theme was of giving people power and control, and we have to do more to push technology as a party.\" So it wasn't deemed a priority by the top brass, in other words. Tech is 'crucial to life chances' Today, Kendall is exploring the Manchester Digital Laboratory, a networking, events and community space that has thrived since it started as a non-profit in 2009. MadLab has an eclectic roster, from meetups for redundant engineers to jewellery workshops to hacking and DIY genetics sessions. A recent series of successful digital skills training courses covering social networking, website design and programming have trained 150 unemployed women and a further 80 are on the waiting list. Former student Claire Lewis now works as a teacher, but credits the course with giving her the confidence boost she needed. \"It came at a time when I was really low, a single mum living with my parents and with no job. Not only was it a really smart course, but the people on it were smart as well. And somehow being women, the dynamic was really different.\" Kendall said she's \"obsessed\" with ensuring the UK has good jobs and an economy not reliant on low-skilled workers. \"Tech is crucial to tackling inequality and giving people life chances, as well as getting the best value for public money. We should be open about how the government works and every department should be thinking about how it can use technology. We have to take technology into politics.\" 'Technology enables individualised care' She is more animated about the potential of technology in the NHS. Kendall talks about visiting a constituent who suffered with the lung condition COPD that was significantly improved by a trial of tele-nursing. Rather than hospital visits and being on oxygen 19 hours a day, Clive Callow was monitored in his own home with data sent back to a team of specialist nurses who advise on adjustments in his treatment or visit him at home. \"It has given him more control over his life and helped him manage his condition, and his wife is over the moon,\" she says. Another scheme in Kew, south-west London, teaches patients how to manage their own kidney dialysis at home. The nurses said patients \"felt more in control of their lives\" and ready to take responsibility for their own health. And the CLASH project in Leicester helped an arthritis group learn how to use digital communication tools like Skype, which, says Kendall, helped to tackle the related depression and isolation that often affects sufferers. \"It's not just wealthier people and the middle class that benefit from health tracking,\" she says. \"Technology helps give people individualised care. If you're Clive, you have a huge incentive to try anything because COPD is a horrible condition, and the NHS has a huge incentive because treatment costs a fortune.\" Health data belongs in a national health service When the NHS was founded, average life expectancy was 65 and many people died of infectious diseases and accidents. Now one in three babies will live to 100 and the challenge is long-term chronic diseases. That crisis, she says, can be staved off with technology. \"One of the biggest challenges is to use technology not just to manage conditions but to prevent health problems in the first place. The state normally tells people what is good for them, but people should have as much control over their lives as possible and be self-reliant. \"If you look at the possibilities of monitoring data about genetics and susceptibility to diseases, then there's an even stronger argument for a national health service, because the principle of owning and controlling your own data, for example, is really important. \"The problem is that the NHS hasn't brought the right people together yet \u2013 those who have an incentive to keep people healthy and those who know how the tech works. We need to make huge changes for that to happen.\" Private finance initiative 'not the cause of NHS problems' But if relationships with specialist, external companies are critical, that doesn't sound like a commitment to end PFI, the private finance initiative, within the NHS. \"I don't believe PFI is the cause of the NHS's problems,\" says Kendall. \"The current system is hospital based, despite the future challenge being about community care, and the Tories have done nothing to address this in the past five years other than add more layers of bureaucracy. \"We have an ageing population, elderly people ending up stuck in hospital because we don't have community nurses and social care to look after them at home.\" Striding out of MadLab, Kendall strikes a glamorous figure for a politician, a combination of film star glasses and forthright charm. How long will the health role contain her? She deftly responds to rumours that she is being lined up to eventually run for the Labour leadership, being appropriately dismissive. \"If anybody says anything nice about me, then that's great. We need strong, diverse voices up there, which means making space for women \u2013 literally \u2013 around the table, in meetings and party and government level. But right now, though, we have the mother of all battles.\"",
