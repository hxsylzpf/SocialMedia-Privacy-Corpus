Information released in a blogpost entitled 'Instagram as a growing business' was light on the details, but hinted at the company's need to get the ad experience 'right' and the need to turn the photo service, sold to Facebook for $1bn in 2012, into a viable business.  \"Seeing photos and videos from brands you don't follow will be new, so we'll start slow ... We'll also make sure you have control. If you see an ad you don't like, you'll be able to hide it and provide feedback about what didn't feel right,\" read the post.  In the months following its acquisition by Facebook, the company drew fire from users for a number of attempts to generate revenue. The first of these was removing the option for Twitter users to preview Instagram posts in Twitter streams. Then, news surfaced that users would be forced to allow Facebook to sell their photos to advertisers. In the days following, Instagram reversed the terms, but not after drawing mass amounts of protest online.  At the time, Instagram's co-founder Kevin Systrom clarified: \"It is not our intention to sell your photos. We are working on updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear.\"  Now, Instagram's intention is clearly to make money by selling to the user. Whether or not this move will draw as much ire as the company's drawn in the past remains to be seen. Early results to the announcement on Instagram are decidedly mixed: \"Here we go with ads \u2026 Leave it alone. That is the most annoying thing and sometimes very disrespectful to your own personal views and beliefs, \" wrote first commenter mikita007. \"You're all acting like spoiled children. They have to make money somehow and if you all even want Instagram to be here for a long time, you'd understand why they would put this into effect. Morons,\" wrote user pinkbloodyfloyd soon after.  These two users, along with the site's 150 million-user base, can expect to see the changes surface within the next two months. ",
