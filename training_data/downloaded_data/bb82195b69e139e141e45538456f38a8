  "content": "The posthumous tributes on Kelly Stephenson's Bebo page certainly don't read like a suicide cult. Of the hundred or so teenagers who have posted messages on the social networking site since the 20-year-old's death was reported last week, most are sombre, reflective and determinedly life-affirming. \"I just plea to all the young children/teenagers even adults please stop taking your lives and express to the ones you love how you feel and seek help,\" one typical correspondent remonstrates. But that plea was ignored by 16-year-old Jenna Parry, also from Bridgend, South Wales, who was found hanged on Tuesday, taking to 17 the grim tally of young people from the area who have ended their lives since January 2007. Pronouncing on another suicide last month, the coroner queried whether social networking sites, which many of the victims frequented, were responsible for encouraging a romanticism around teenage deaths. The police promptly dismissed the proposition, and this week cautioned the media against excitability about social networking, and the very real danger of copycat suicides. But the innuendo nonetheless has taken root, playing as it does to adult fears about the infinitely corrupting capacity of the internet in relation to young people, whether as enforcer of sedentary isolation, vehicle for bullying, grooming tool or, in extremis, normaliser of fatalities. The Bridgend deaths are indeed unfathomable, and the impulse to attribute blame only natural. But the unseemly rush to collar social networks only exposes adult ignorance about the integration of technology into young people's lives. Over 90% of UK teenagers belong to a social network like MySpace, Bebo or Facebook, and one-third of those keep at least four separate profiles running at once. The distinction between online and offline relationships has become increasingly indistinct for this generation, and the medium is integral to the way they present themselves and manage peer-group connections. In a few weeks, the child psychologist and House of Tiny Tearaways presenter Dr Tanya Byron will report to the government on her commissioned review of the impact of new technology on childhood. Her findings are expected to centre on classification proposals for violent and overtly sexual computer games, but submissions to the review have also addressed the more nebulous questions of how the internet is mediating children and young people's capacity for intimacy, their conceptions of privacy, and the public construction of identity. Does social networking encourage a sense of disposability in friendships? Does it obviate the need for trust or authenticity, and does it simply foster a jejune narcissism and the celebrity-inspired expectation of instant recognition? At a moment when this age-group is again spot-lit for its dislocation from any sense of community cohesion - whether displayed via self-harm or the tendency to kick innocents about the head while filming it on mobile phones - these questions are more pertinent than ever. This is the first generation to grow up beyond the digital divide - now that social networks are available on mobiles and there is free internet access in schools and libraries, the barrier is no longer about hardware but literacy. It is the first generation to be socialised in hyper-connectivity from primary school. But for all the potential of an instant global voice, Jimmy, an eight-year-old Club Penguin devotee, is far more circumspect in his reach. Research shows that most social network contacts are local, based on pre-existing networks, and Jimmy is no different. \"I'm in touch with people from school, people from my area,\" he tells me. \"I feel safer with people I know already, because you don't know who is on the other end of the line.\" Deciding who to trust, and what to reveal about yourself, can be just as complex offline. But while adults worry that it is easier to dissemble at a keyboard, young people don't. It's partly about perspective: teenagers simply don't adhere to the offline/online binary. And it also relates to the nature of the sites, which invite collaboration. Thus, you can't simply invent an idealised profile for yourself and rigidly control it. Within the hour, a friend will be posting on your wall, querying your claims. The concept of \"friends\" on a social network is similarly contested by adults, who wonder how meaningful it is to have 1,001 friends on MySpace. But young people are finding ways to differentiate. \"If you're a private person, you can still be private online,\" says 15-year-old Alice. With 3,852 friends on the site devoted to her band, Pull in Emergency, she would seem to fit the definition of exposure. But Alice makes a distinction between her band's site and the personal profiles she keeps on MySpace and Facebook. \"MySpace is the main way that people find out about the band and book us for gigs. There's nothing personal on it. But with my own profiles, I don't accept anyone I don't know or like. With the band, the web connects you so you can find out what's going on. But I'd only use my own profiles to talk to friends.\" So it has become possible to create private space publicly. Just as another teenager I spoke to has a named YouTube account that his parents and other family members can access, plus a pseudonymous one he only allows his friends to see. As children's media expert Sonia Livingstone points out, one of the reasons for generational anxiety about social networks is that they display as standard information what older people consider private - age, religion, political affiliation. Through her research, Livingstone has found that young people have not discarded privacy but rather that their definition of it has changed. Privacy is tied to having control over who knows what about you. The indelibility of online exposure remains a concern. But Alice asks: \"What employer would care about what you wrote on your wall when you were 14?\" When more than 90% of the coming workforce are creating their own museums from childhood, companies may just have to bite it. As with the Bridgend tragedies, adult anxieties do not compute with youthful realities. Children and young people have always sought spaces beyond adult surveillance. It would seem teenagers are moulding new media to meet their needs, rather than being moulded by it, as feared. At a time when children are more captive than ever - whether because of adults' risk aversion, extended schools, lack of outdoor space - maybe we ought to celebrate the way they have ducked under the wire and created a whole new version of intimacy. \u00b7 Libby Brooks is the author of The Story of Childhood l.brooks@theguardian.com",
