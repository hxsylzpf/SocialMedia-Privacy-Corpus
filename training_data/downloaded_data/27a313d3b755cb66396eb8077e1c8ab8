  "content": "As the BBC puts Television Centre up for sale, the nation laments the end of an era (on Twitter) @prodnose [Danny Baker] Flogging off TV Centre. From the company that brought you Restoration - Saving The Nation's Heritage. Soulless, soulless bastards. @prodnose Just last week they broadcast Paul Merton in MGM's old studios waxing lyrical about \"how much magic...\". Cynical hypocritical creeps. @prodnose Why not wipe all the videotape at TV Centre too, eh BBC pinheads? You were absolutely sure about that on our behalf not so long ago as well. @prodnose BBC half-wits. That Tower Of London. Whats it cost? Do we really need it? isn't it a bit London-centric? Couldn't it be recreated elsewhere @tracey_thorn I'm going to BUY TV Centre. And then start making Top of the Pops again. It's gonna be great. Simon_Pegg BBC Plans to sell Television Centre... Or if you're reading the inevitable repeat, they've sold it. @bbctvcentre @simonpegg Roy Castle would have fought this with the might if 400 tap dancers. @kentonallen [producer of the Royle Family and Six Shooter] Can someone bike the keys to Television Centre round to Sky please. Game's over. V sad. @KirstieMAllsopp [Kirstie Allsopp] Stop selling off our stuff! We paid to build it, we paid to keep it going &amp; we love it, biggest thrill of working life: Visits to TV Centre! @KatyFBrand [Katy Brand] On work experience at #TVC as a teen I had to work all night - on my break I'd climb over the Blue Peter garden fence &amp; sit by Shep's grave. @KatyFBrand Perhaps the 'selling London Bridge to the Americans' myth could be revisited for TVC, and the Beeb could sell Westfield instead...? @Markgatiss A black, black day. As soon as #TV Centre has gone, a new report will no doubt recommend the building of a 'sort of HQ' for the BBC. @domjoly I have to say, I've always loathed BBC Television Centre, worked there for two unhappy years @charltonbrooker [Charlie Brooker] Be good if we could all club together and buy TV Centre. Even if we let it stand empty. So it won't just become part of the Westfield Mall. @charltonbrooker There's an air when making a show *at* TV Centre. Excitement, a sense of history... It's just more 'fun'. And that bleeds into the shows. @charltonbrooker It's like they're going to saw up the TARDIS and use it for firewood. @charltonbrooker TV Centre is not just a building, but part of our collective experience. Frequently onscreen; a comforting local landmark for everyone. @KirstieMAllsopp For the record, before more idiots dive in &amp; tell me TVC sell off is my fault! I have always had very mixed feelings about benefits of PFI.",
