  "content": "Buckingham Palace is to ask the Press Complaints Commission to intervene after claiming the London Evening Standard committed a \"serious breach\" of the Duke of Edinburgh's right to privacy with its front page splash alleging he was suffering from prostate cancer. The palace took the unusual step of issuing a denial to the story published today in the Associated Newspapers title, saying it would \"be taking this issue to the Press Complaints Commission\". In a statement, Buckingham Palace said it had been authorised by Prince Philip to \"confirm that the claim made by the Evening Standard that he has received a 'diagnosis of prostate cancer' is untrue\". \"We believe that the Evening Standard's front page story today titled 'Prince Philip Defies Cancer Scare' is a serious breach of Prince Philip's privacy,\" the palace added. The statement said the palace would be asking the PCC to remind all editors of their obligations around privacy issues. It is not yet known if the palace has submitted an official complaint to the PCC. Quoting unnamed medical sources, the Evening Standard claimed that Prince Philip, 87, was diagnosed with the condition while being treated in a London hospital for a chest infection in April. The palace responded: \"Buckingham Palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy, particularly in relation to their personal health. \"For this reason, we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health, particularly during the quieter news months. \"We will continue to observe this long-standing practice; but on this occasion, because the damaging story is now being reported widely, the Duke of Edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the Evening Standard that he has received a 'diagnosis of prostate cancer' is untrue. \"We believe there has been a serious breach of the Duke of Edinburgh's right to privacy and we will be taking this issue to the Press Complaints Commission. \"We will be asking the PCC to remind all editors of their obligations.\" Clause three of the PCC code of practice, which newspapers sign up to voluntarily, states: \"Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital communications. \"Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private life without consent.\" A spokesman for the PCC told MediaGuardian.co.uk: \"We have been informed that we will be receiving a complaint regarding the Duke of Edinburgh story, over clauses one and three of the code, accuracy and privacy. But we have not yet received it.\" A source at the Evening Standard told MediGuardian.co.uk the paper had updated its original story in later editions but that there was a public interest in the health of the Duke of Edinburgh. \"We updated the story for the later edition. We will respond to any potential enquiry from the PCC but we do believe that there is a public interest in the health of the Duke of Edinburgh,\" the Associated insider said. An updated version of the story on ThisisLondon.co.uk, the Evening Standard's website, focused on the Buckingham Palace denial of the Standard's report that the Duke of Edinburgh had received a diagnosis of prostate cancer. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
