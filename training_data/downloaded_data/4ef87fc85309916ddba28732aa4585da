Results released on Monday for the third quarter of the year show Twitter's revenues soared to $361m, up 114% from the same period last year, beating expectations.

The number of monthly active users represents a 23% increase year on year but was up just 4.8% from the last set of results and below the 6.3% quarter-on-quarter growth it reported in the second quarter. The company has shaken up management and begun changing its platform in order to make it more accessible to new users. During the quarter it updated its service on Apple's iPhone, introduced a new options for its Vine video service and launched a new service tailored to NFL fans.

In a conference call with analysts Costolo said he was happy with the \"strategy and the quality\" of what the company was doing but that given the scale of the company's ambitions it was \"more critical than ever\" for Twitter to pick up the pace. The company remains strong in mobile \u2013 the fastest growth area for advertisers. Mobile advertising revenue accounted for 85% of total advertising revenue in the quarter.
