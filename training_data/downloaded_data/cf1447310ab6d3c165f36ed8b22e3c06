We recently reported on Nato officials suggesting that a virtual A-bomb could be required to prevent future internet attacks - but with language like that, it's a shot across the bows of President Obama's cybersecurity review, which we're told is due this week. \u2022 Some interesting reading over the weekend, including this piece from Thomas Crampton, highlighting the New York Times' botched closure of the International Herald Tribune's website. Particularly intriguing when you consider the reports that Rupert Murdoch is considering pay-for-news models, including micropayments at the Wall Street Journal.
