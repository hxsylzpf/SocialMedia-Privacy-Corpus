  "content": "Over the last few months, a number of far-right demonstrations have taken place in German cities, organised by a group which says it is anti-Islam. On Monday, thousands of Germans turned up to counter protests against the group, which calls itself Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West, or Pegida for short. Dubbed the \"pinstripe Nazis\" its critics say they are promoting Islamaphobia and anti-foreigner sentiments. Pegida supporters claim they are patriots worried about the \"watering down\" of their Christian-rooted culture and traditions. Throughout the protests across a number of cities, German social media users have been sharing photos and pictures as many German landmarks and buildings turned off their lights in support of the counter-protests. This video shows how Cologne's central square was plunged into darkness after the cathedral lights were switched off: Meanwhile on Vine, many shared videos from the protests themselves. The following Vines are from Zeit journalist Tilman Steffen, who was in Berlin on Monday. And this YouTube video shows scenes in M\u00fcnster on Monday evening. Are you German or living in Germany? How do you feel about these protests and counter protests? Let us know in the comments below.",
