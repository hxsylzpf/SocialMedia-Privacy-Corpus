  "content": "As a councillor you are open to public criticism. Whether it's discussions on doorsteps or in council chambers, people often disagree with your politics and decision making. It can be tough to take at times, but it is part and parcel of the job. However, what you don't expect \u2014 or accept \u2014 are personal or abusive remarks. These were the kinds of comments I received last year. Things started off pleasant enough: I received a response to a tweet I sent about a licensing issue, and a conversation started up. I discussed, with someone who I thought was just another \"normal\" Twitter user, about street trading and bin collections. He got involved in my conversation about the \"No More Page 3\" campaign. We didn't agree but I was happy to debate with him. It was in response to a question posed by the Local Government Association (LGA) about the experiences of young councillors that the interaction turned nasty. I am 30 and in the first few months of getting elected there were a few comments about my age, so I responded to the LGA. The abuse I got as a result was horrible : I was told I was incapable because of my age, lacked experience and was even called stupid. As a councillor I support constituents with complex problems and make decisions that are going to change people's lives. I didn't have the energy to deal with nasty comments and so I blocked my troll. My next and most recent experience of trolling was in response to my tweets on the Lose the Lads Mags campaign, which coincided with the success of Caroline Criado-Perez in persuading the Bank of England to maintain a woman on the English banknote. I tweeted Caroline to find out what abuse she had been getting, and if she was okay. She said \"Violent misogyny happened. People said I should report it so I did.\" I must admit that it made me a bit nervous about commenting on the campaign but I didn't want to desert it either. However, I wasn't looking for trouble. When I tweeted about BBC Sheffield to talk about the co-op's decision to cover up lad mags, I was met with nasty responses. One person wrote: \"Oh god I pity you, really I do. Off you trot jog on\", and another said: \"As fun as it is pointing out inequalities of your pathetic campaign I have a real job to get back to.\" So while I did not receive rape threats like Stella Creasey MP, or bomb threats like recent female journalists, my experiences were disquieting. There is nothing wrong with a good debate but when trolls start telling you that you're too young, unqualified, pathetic and so on, they cross the line. The nature of being a councillor means that you are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Whether you've gone to the supermarket having just rolled out of bed, or enjoying a pint at your local, there is always the chance that someone will want to speak to you about a local issue. So effectively, your life is your office. And you wouldn't put up with abuse in an office so why put up with it as a councillor? My advice to anyone who experiences trolling is to challenge them but also know when to stop. Don't let it take over your life, and don't take it to heart. Blocking is useful when you can't take it anymore but it doesn't mean the problem has gone away because a troll will just bully someone else. You can make a difference by standing up for yourself, something we have seen a lot of lately. Nikki Bond is a Labour councillor at Sheffield city council \u2022 Have you had similar experiences?
