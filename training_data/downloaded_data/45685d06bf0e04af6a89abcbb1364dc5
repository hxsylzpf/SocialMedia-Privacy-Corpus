  "content": "Sky Sports have condemned the \"unacceptable and offensive abuse\" of Beth Tweddle during a live question and answer session on Twitter aimed at promoting women in sport, following a series of derogatory tweets sent to the former gymnast. The broadcaster hosted an interactive session on Tuesday morning which gave fans the opportunity to ask sport-related questions to Tweddle regarding her time as an athlete, having competed at three Olympic Games and won bronze on the uneven bars at London 2012. However, the 28-year-old soon became the victim of a number of vulgar messages, predominantly from males, completely unrelated from gymnastics. One man tweeted: \"are all sportswomen lesbians?\" while another said: \"do you think pregnancy is a poor injury excuse and women should be able to run it off?\" Representatives of Tweddle said on Tuesday night that they were considering a response following the vile nature of the abuse. In a statement Sky said it was extremely disappointed that an attempt to host a constructive Q&amp;A was used by some to air sexist views. \"We're committed to supporting women's sport and Beth's Q&amp;A was a chance for fans to engage with one of Britain's most successful sports stars. We're appalled that some people chose to abuse her,\" said the statement. \"This experience highlights some of the unacceptable and offensive attitudes that can be encountered by women in the public eye.\" The Everyday Sexism project, aimed at promoting equality, said: \"Using the hashtag #Sportswomen, it was a great opportunity to bring a spotlight to women's sport, which is so often under-represented. What followed was the perfect display of the misogyny, aggression and imbalanced treatment faced by sportswomen in every discipline.\" Tweddle competed at the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Olympics, while also winning three gold medals at world championships and six golds at European championships.",
