  "content": "Facebook censors have prevented a band from promoting a gig in Scunthorpe. As a result of the four-letter profanity spelt out in the middle of the word, the alternative group, called October Drift, were blocked from posting news about their show in the North Lincolnshire town. The social network does not ban profanity, but it does identify and filter swearwords in boosted posts, the paid-for function that allows users to promote a message to a wider audience who have not already \"liked\" their page. \"We tried to boost our posts to promote the Scunthorpe show, but Facebook is having none of it due to the town name containing a really rude word. That's utterly bonkers. Sort yourself out Zuckerberg you crazy bastard,\" the group wrote on Facebook. \"Shit ... can't boost this one now either!\" Band member Dan Young said that the group have attempted to raise the issue with Facebook, explaining that it would benefit them if the filter was removed, but the company has not yet replied. \"We always put a note in saying that it's the profanity filter that's failing for the town name, but Facebook still doesn't make the amendment,\" Young told the Independent. \"Surprising given they're supposed to be at the forefront of modern tech.\" A spokesperson for Facebook told the Guardian they are \"investigating\" the issue.",
