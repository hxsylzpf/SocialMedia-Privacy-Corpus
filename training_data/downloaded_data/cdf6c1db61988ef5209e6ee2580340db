Jeff Blackett, the RFU's disciplinary officer, will meet with Rob Andrew today to determine whether Care should face action for publicly questioning some of Barnes's decision-making during Harlequins' 18-13 defeat by Leicester on Friday, and Blackett was warned that the England squad may require \"wider education\" in the use of sites such as Twitter. \"I think that there needs to be a wider education about the use of those sites,\" Blackett said. \"Danny and I will have some words. \"I have still got to decide if what Danny has said has damaged the image of the game, or whether it was just injudicious, in which case he needs a slap on the wrist and get on with life. Rob and I will also have a meeting tomorrow.\" Care, one of several England players who use Twitter, apologised to Barnes on Saturday after writing: \"Does Wayne Barnes want to give any more shocking decisions to help the Leicester home team out?!! No shock there!!\" The 23-year-old later posted: \"Wayne Barnes... hang your head pal!! Reward the team who want to play rugby, not just kick penalties!!!\" Care subsequently deleted the tweets.",
