The arrests were part of a wider inquiry which began in December when three members of the royal household at Clarence House complained to Scotland Yard's Royalty Protection unit. The investigation has been extended because detectives believe that public figures beyond the royal household - among them an MP - have also had their phones tapped. Officers from the Met's anti-terrorist branch and the specialist crime directorate have not ruled out the possibility that other royal households could have had their phones intercepted, or that the conversations could have involved members of the royal family. Scotland Yard said three men were arrested early yesterday in south London. A 48-year-old man was arrested at his home in Putney, another man, 35, was arrested at home in Sutton, while a third, 50, was detained at another address, also in Sutton. All three were arrested under section 1 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and taken to central London police stations where they remained in custody last night. It later emerged that the 48-year-old man was Clive Goodman, the News of the World's royal correspondent, and that police had searched the paper's offices in Wapping, east London. The News of the World confirmed last night that Goodman was one of the men being held. A spokeswoman said: \"Clive Goodman, a News of the World journalist, was arrested today and is currently being questioned at Charing Cross police station in London.\" Scotland Yard said the initial investigation at Clarence House had focused on \"alleged repeated security breaches within telephone networks over a significant period of time\". Given the seriousness of the potential security breach, the inquiry was then passed on to SO13, the Met's anti-terrorist branch, who made yesterday's arrests. Scotland Yard added: \"As a result of their inquiries police now believe that public figures beyond the royal household have had their telephones intercepted, which may have potential security implications.\" The investigation is being led by a small team of officers from SO13 and officers from the specialist crime directorate. Detectives have also been liaising closely with the Crown Prosecution Service. Scotland Yard is known to be angry about repeated press breaches of royal security which force them to divert officers from anti-terrorism operations to chase undercover journalists. A Clarence House spokesman said last night they would not be commenting on the arrests. Although the exact nature of the alleged tapping remained unclear last night, it is thought that the allegations related to calls from mobile phones rather than land lines. Scanning equipment has often been used by those wishing to eavesdrop on mobile phones. Prince Charles, his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Diana, Princess of Wales, have all been unwitting subjects of phone interceptions in the past. In 1993, a tape of an intimate late-night phone call between the prince and the duchess was made public. During the conversation, Prince Charles was allegedly heard telling the duchess he would like to \"live inside your trousers\". It is thought the recording was made by a radio enthusiast using a hi-tech scanning device. The tape was released a year after a recording of Diana allegedly talking to a mystery man - later identified as her close friendJames Gilbey - emerged. The conversation came to be known as Squidgygate because of Mr Gilbey's alleged pet name for Diana. Stung Investigative errors Questions have been asked about the News of the World's journalistic practices after a series of high-profile investigations went wrong. \u00b7 Last week, the paper was forced to pay former leader of the Scottish Socialist party Tommy Sheridan \u00a3200,000 in damages after he sued for libel over untrue allegations that he had cheated on his wife and visited swingers' clubs. In court, Mr Sheridan described the News of the World as \"pedlars of falsehood, promoters of untruth, concerned only with sales, circulation and profit, not people's lives and truth\". \u00b7 The paper's star reporter, Mazher Mahmood - dubbed \"the fake sheikh\" - was embarrassed in court at the end of July after three men who the paper had claimed had tried to buy radioactive material for a terrorist \"dirty bomb\" were acquitted. The three were arrested after a joint sting operation involving Mahmood and the Metropolitan police's anti-terrorist branch. \u00b7 In March this year, George Galloway claimed Mahmood had unsuccessfully attempted to push him into making anti-semitic remarks and accepting improper political financing. The MP went on to exact his revenge by publishing photos of Mahmood on the internet after a court battle with the News of the World. \u00b7 In 2003, a sting operation carried out by Mahmood backfired very publicly when the trial of five men who had been accused of plotting to kidnap Victoria Beckham, and her children collapsed after the revelation that the News of the World had paid a convicted criminal, Florim Gashi, who acted as their informant. Gashi, who has been convicted for dishonesty, admitted lying in a police statement about the kidnap case.",
