  "content": "Bill Keller, the former executive editor of the New York Times, has made quite a bit of noise in his new punditry role about online news and social media, lamenting the rise of \"credible digital Cassandras\" and worrying about an end to \"seasoned judgment.\" I wonder how he must be reacting to the decision of his successor, Jill Abramson, to introduce a new commenting system for the Times's website. Invective, conspiracy theory, self-promotion: the Gray Lady is under siege, the readers are taking over! If only that were the problem. Some readers reacted with righteous fury after the country's bestselling newspaper without news from every state or fanatical anti-tax editorialists got its revamped feedback feature up and running last week. That's inevitable whenever these things are introduced, but anger was widespread enough that one new addition, which abbreviated comments to a few initial lines, has already been abandoned. The users seem to be settling in. But the design of the new system reveals a lot about the Times's approach to the web, which from here looks more like a wary half-embrace than a bear hug. Comments at the Times website are nothing new, of course. The new system, though, places reader interventions directly below the stories (often directly bashing the reporters' work), a rather large concession from a paper that often strikes an Olympian tone. And, following the Washington Post earlier this year, they've introduced a tab highlighting \"reader picks\", comments that users vote up \u2013 though, classically, there's also a second tab for \"NYT picks\", and the two never match. Designing a newspaper comments system is a Scylla-and-Charybdis problem: make it too restrictive and nobody will use it, make it too open and you diminish your brand by letting the crazies run amok. The Times's solution has been to create a class of \"trusted commenters\", a status earned over time and meted out via some hidden algorithm, who will be allowed to post their comments immediately. The rest of us poor souls \u2013 untrusted commenters \u2013 must wait for editorial approval before our rejoinders hit the site. It's a curious trade-off, this. Many wild-west, low-supervision media properties, from the Huffington Post to Wikipedia, encourage repeat commenters by awarding them some sort of special designation: \"level 1 superuser\", \"level 2 networker\". But they don't combine it with rigid editorial control for everyone else. (Though how rigid remains unclear: which editor approved this weekend's \"You are on the Obama campaign trail along with the rest of the liberal media\"?) On the contrary, creating ranks among commenters \u2013 officers and grunts \u2013 normally goes hand in hand with decentralisation and greater responsibility for readers. At Gawker, for instance, star commenters can promote the comments of workaday users; editors decide who adds the most value, and then entrust them to take care of their territory. That could be a truly worthwhile experiment at a news property, where the most valuable comments may come from one-time contributors, often people who require a pseudonym: the eyewitness, the banker with market intelligence, the disgruntled employee inside the corporation. But a Times \"community\" divorced from Times oversight just isn't the paper's style. There's something more. Once the mysterious algorithm has determined that you've achieved officer-class status, you'll have to jump through a few hoops before your commissioning. It would be ungenerous to call it a background check. But you'll have to verify your name and where you live \u2013 and it'll have to match up to the same data you've already provided to Facebook, that noted safehouse of digital privacy. No Facebook account? Then it's back to the barracks with you, grunt: to be a \"trusted\" commenter, you'll have to already have placed your faith in the least trustworthy digital company of them all. The Times insists in its FAQ that it's relying on the big, bad blue network only to make sure that their trusted commenters are on the level, and to lessen the trollishness that anonymity can let fester. It's worth pointing out that TechCrunch said much the same thing this year; in fact, they went further, making Facebook a requirement for all commenters. But as the digital researcher Danah Boyd recently pointed out (while discussing Google+'s insistence on real names), Facebook is, in fact, riddled with pseudonymous accounts \u2013 from young users particularly, but also teachers, government employees, victims of stalking and other crimes, and many other categories of people for whom an alias is not an option. For the paper, the real value of Facebook integration lies elsewhere. Once you've sealed your pact and linked your Facebook account to nytimes.com in exchange for little more than a check mark next to your name, the homepage will look a little different. Alongside the box that announces that, yet again, today's most read stories concern a new iPhone and tips for college admissions, you'll also see that some forgotten high school acquaintance has \"liked\" a puff piece on gifts for dog lovers, or that Republican you had a thing for once wants you to have a look at David Brooks. And while the data that each company can then glean from the other might have substantial monetary value, its profitability for users (and, indeed, for reporters) doesn't extend very far at all. It's no bad thing to see the Times getting more serious about the shape of the community that surrounds its website, and its concerns about commenter quality are hardly unfounded. But the design of this new system, and its exclusive integration with the most rapacious social network of all, suggests that \u2013 as with its recently introduced paywall \u2013 business and editorial concerns are only very loosely intertwined. Building a community of readers requires a change in style, as well as substance: ceding at least a degree of responsibility to its allegedly \"trusted\" commenters, encouraging reporters to mix it up with readers, and accepting that the Times is a brand or an idea that belongs to its consumers as much as its producers. Those are realisable and, perhaps, ultimately profitable goals. But it will only work if they're driven not by the boardroom, but the newsroom. \u2022 Editor's note: the quotation attributed to Bill Keller originally stated \"creditable digital Cassandras\"; this was amended to the correct version of \"credible digital Cassandras\" at 4.30pm EST on 5 December 2011",
