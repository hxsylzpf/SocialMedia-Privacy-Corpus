  "content": "Where were you when #PopeBars started trending, in tribute to Pope Francis throwing hip-hop shapes in the Central African Republic? How did #BeingFemaleInNigeria help you to understand modern misogyny? And where do you stand on the heated #JollofDebate \u2013 is it from Ghana, Nigeria or elsewhere? Hashtags have become a key way to measure how millions of people react to the biggest news events and debates of the day. They're also where some of the best jokes are made. Mapping this trend, satirical news site YesiYesighana and digital bloggers Circumspecte have just released their list of the most influential topics debated by Africans on Twitter (#AOT) in 2015. From #BringBackOurGirls which, on 6 December, marked 600 days since the schoolgirls of Chibok were abducted by Boko Haram, to #WhatWouldMagufuliDo, a tribute to the newly-elected Tanzanian president's \"revolutionary\" commitment to cutting wasteful government spending, looking back at popular hashtags offers a useful overview on how the big events of the year played out online. \"If African Twitter was a bar then the year 2015 would have been one of those memorable nights out,\" YesiYesighana said. \"Noisy drinkers would be eating jollof while debating xenophobia, everyday sexism and everything in between.\" But that was 2015. The new year brings new opportunities for memes, jokes and social commentary \u2013 and we want you to help us predict what's coming up. Which president will be the most memed? Which campaigns deserve the most attention and how many times will #someonetellCNN trend as Kenyans on Twitter call out poor reporting?
