  "content": "Labour has pledged to overhaul libel laws to encourage freedom of speech in matters of public interest in its manifesto, published today. Labour's manifesto promises to \"bring forward new legislation on libel to protect the right of defendants to speak freely\". It is thought to be the first Labour manifesto to explicitly mention reforming libel law and the importance of encouraging freedom of speech. The government said that the aim is to \"encourage freedom of speech and access to information\" and its pledge follows high-profile news about the impact of superinjunctions, so-called libel tourism and the crippling costs of cases. In the 76-page manifesto, Labour has made only one mention, totalling just eight words, about highly controversial plans to introduce tough new anti-digital piracy measures. Last week the government managed to push through highly controversial digital piracy measures, which could see persistent illegal downloaders have their internet connections suspended or websites that host copyrighted content blocked, during the fast-track \"wash-up\" period before parliament was officially dissolved. Despite the huge public furore about the measures, Labour has today made just a passing reference that it will \"take further action to tackle online piracy\". The manifesto also reiterates government support for the BBC, while simultaneously pushing an intention to fund regional TV news pilots from digital switchover under-spend set aside in the licence fee, as well as backing the corporation's watchdog the BBC Trust. Labour also said that it will \"safeguard the independence of Ofcom\". \"We support an independent and world-class BBC at the heart of a vibrant public broadcasting system,\" says Labour. \"Our strong support for its editorial independence and the licence fee that finances the BBC's programmes and activities will continue.\" The BBC Trust \"should fully involve the public in decision-making\", it continued. The Conservatives have said that they will cut back Ofcom's powers, drop plans for a regional news service to replace ITV's service and scrap the BBC Trust. Labour's manifesto also protects the future of Channel 4 as a public sector broadcaster, introduces a tax relief to boost the UK video games industry and plans to introduce a controversial 50p-per-month tax on landlines to pay for superfast broadband. \"Because we are determined that every family and business, not just some, should benefit, we will raise revenue to pay for this from a modest levy on fixed telephone lines,\" says Labour. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
