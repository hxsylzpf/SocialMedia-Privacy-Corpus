  "content": "On Sunday, Sir Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen will reunite on Broadway in a double-bill of No Man's Land, by Harold Pinter, and Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot. The two first appeared in this production of Godot in 2009 on London's West End. Though the New York shows \u2013 which also star Billy Crudup and Shuler Hensley \u2013 have been tipped as the biggest event of the theater season, Stewart and McKellen haven't exactly been spending all their time in rehearsal. They've been frolicking all over New York, stopping by iconic tourist destinations like Times Square, posing with their likenesses at Madam Tussauds and sampling the city's cuisine. And as a gift to the internet, the two tech-savvy knights have documented their adventures on Twitter. Though such outings may be brilliant if heartwarming marketing stunts, we like to think the revered thespians do this sort of thing every weekend. Therefore, we've documented their travels below \u2013 so you can marvel at the glory of their friendship\u2026 as well as McKellen's magnificently odd fashion sense. Stewart and McKellen's adventures began in the faraway land of Berkeley, California, where No Man's Land/Waiting for Godot ran prior to its New York debut. To blow off some steam, they took archery lessons together. McKellen came dressed for the occasion: But the duo soon made their way to New York, to rehearse the Broadway run, and their shenanigans kicked into high gear. Donning Vladimir and Estragon's iconic bowler hats, they hit up all the usual tourist destinations, including Times Square... The Empire State Building... As well as few historic sites: Things got a bit weird at what we're guessing is Madame Tussaud's: Going slightly Method, Beckett's two tramps posed by some garbage. They voyaged to Coney Island to sample the local fare, and bonded over a pint: All the carbs obviously necessitated some exercise. In summary: No Man's Land/Waiting for Godot opens 24 November 2013 at the Cort Theater in New York.",
