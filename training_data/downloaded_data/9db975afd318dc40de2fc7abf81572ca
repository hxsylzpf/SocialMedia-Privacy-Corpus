  "content": "So how's the snow where you are? And more importantly, how many marks would you give it out of 10? We only ask after a rather ingenious weather map turned to Twitter for help in mapping the wintry conditions hitting many parts of the UK. Marks are awarded not for artistic impression \u2013 or how good your snowman looks \u2013 but the severity of the snow. One or two for a \"few flakes\", 5 for \"steady snow\" and 10 for \"Arctic blizzard conditions\". Oh, and 11 if it's so cold your iPhone's seized up. Let's hope not.",
