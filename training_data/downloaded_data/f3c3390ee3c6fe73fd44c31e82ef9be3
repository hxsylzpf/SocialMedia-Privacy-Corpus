  "content": "A few weeks ago, I received an email from my bank saying that due to a breach of security by an online retailer my credit card was cancelled and would be reissued. I contacted the bank to ask who was responsible but it said it did not have that information. I am appalled that the retailer is not required to send me information via Mastercard as to what occurred and the steps it has taken to stop it happening again. I should be given the option to decide if I wish to do business with this company in future. LT, London It will surprise most people that, according to the Data Protection Act, companies have no obligation to inform customers of a breach. The Information Commissioner's Office guidelines merely state that they should \"consider notifying the individuals concerned\", along with banks and authorities, to help them take precautionary steps if there's the chance they are at risk. Service providers such as telecoms firms are the exception and must inform customers of any security concerns. Otherwise, the emphasis is on damage limitation and recovery but this (as Talk Talk customers have discovered) does not necessarily mean that you will get your money back if the leak of personal information allows thieves to defraud you. If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU. Include an address and phone number.",
