  "content": "Jen Chang has left his post as director of communications at Liverpool by \"mutual consent\", the club have confirmed. Chang, only appointed in May, was recently involved in a controversial meeting in Manchester with Sean Cummins, a Liverpool fan behind the parody Duncan Jenkins Twitter account that purported to have inside knowledge of the club. During the meeting, it was alleged that Chang made threats to Cummins. Although Cummins insisted his alter ego was nothing more than a spoof, Chang wrongly believed Cummins was being fed information by an Anfield insider and had apparently become vexed by \"Jenkins\" costing the club money in the \u00a310.5m Fabio Borini transfer. Chang denied the allegations and said he \"will not be responding to total nonsense\" the day after Cummins had accused him. But the incident still caused Ian Ayre, the club's chief executive, to apologise on behalf of the club last month. \"Clearly it is not appropriate for me to comment on how the club is managing this internally, and I trust you understand this,\" Ayre wrote. \"It is apparent that you clearly feel that you have not been treated in a manner that is becoming of Liverpool FC. \"Based on everything I have heard and seen, including information provided by parties involved in this matter, I acknowledge that some of the elements you highlight were not appropriate. If you perceive them to be threatening that is not behaviour that is acceptable for a member of staff. I would therefore like to apologise to you on behalf of Liverpool FC for any upset and distress this has caused you.\" Liverpool did not specifically link Chang's departure to that incident but a spokesman said he had returned to the US, where he previously worked Sports Illustrated, \"for family reasons\". A statement continued: \"Jen brought a fresh perspective to the overall communications function through the use of a variety of media channels, including social media and blogs. \"He reviewed and refocused the Liverpool Ladies and created a new impetus in relation to their structure, organisation and future playing strategy. \"We would like to thank Jen for his contribution to Liverpool football club during his time here and wish him well in his future career back in the US. \"Jen would like to thank everyone he has worked with during his time at Liverpool for their support and respect and wishes the club every success.\" When contacted Chang declined to comment.",
