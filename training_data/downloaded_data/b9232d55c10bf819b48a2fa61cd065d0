  "content": "H641mn asks: According to Criminal Records Bureau guidelines published on 9 May \u2013 regarding students who visit sites to collect data from children or vulnerable adults \u2013 CRB clearance is not required, as long as a responsible person is present: \"It is an offence to request unnecessary levels of clearance, 'just to be on the safe side'.\" I assume that this applies equally, or more so, to independent tutors visiting sites to train staff? Is there a clear statement one can present to an institution which may be erring on the side of caution, explaining that a request for a CRB check is unnecessary and unlawful in the circumstances outlined above? If the request/demand constitutes an offence, and a breach of the CRB code of practice, to whom should one report it? H641mn raises another problematic CRB issue: the tendency of employers and other bodies to apply for CRB disclosures without giving any real consideration to whether the law permits it. All CRB disclosures (whether standard or enhanced) contain records of spent, as well as unspent convictions and cautions, so the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (ROA) applies. The ROA provides a measure of protection against disclosure of \"spent\" convictions. The act's main function is to provide \"rehabilitation periods\" so that after a certain amount of time has elapsed (depending on the sentence given for the offence), a person is treated for most purposes as not having been convicted at all, and is not required to disclose the fact of their earlier conviction. The police do retain the data: the records are not \"wiped\", but ordinarily should not be disclosed. Section 9 of the ROA makes it a criminal offence for those who have access to official records of convictions (such as the CRB or the police) to disclose them otherwise than in the course of their duties. The ROA section 9(4) also creates an offence for anyone to obtain such information by fraud, dishonesty or bribe. The Police Act 1997 (which governs CRB checks) creates further offences, including, at section 123, knowingly to make a false statement for the purpose of obtaining, or enabling another person to obtain, a CRB certificate. I do not think it is an offence for an employer to make an inadvertently wrongful application for a CRB certificate, unless the employer knowingly makes a false statement as set out above. If seeking to challenge an employer or other registered body who asks you to apply for a CRB check, the best place to start is probably on the CRB application form itself (section Y), which spells out to the employer that knowingly to make a false statement on the application form may be a criminal offence. The employer or other registered body applying for the disclosure is required to certify on the form that the disclosure is required for the purpose of asking an \"exempted question\": that is, a question exempted from the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (ROA) as set out above. Positions that are exempt from the ROA (and accordingly those for which a standard CRB certificate can be obtained) are set out in a table on the CRB's website. Some of the exempted professions are clear, such as doctor or chartered accountant. Others are less clear, such as \"any work which is defined as regulated activity relating to children within the meaning of Part 1 of Schedule 4 to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. The CRB's table provides a link to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, but the definitions contained in the act are fairly indecipherable. These definitions are currently under review (as part of the review of the much-criticised Independent Safeguarding Authority) and hopefully a more workable definition can be found, as the current position seems highly likely to lead to confusion all round. Where an enhanced CRB check is sought, the position additionally needs to meet one of the \"prescribed purposes\" set out in regulations: too many to list here. Without more information, it is difficult to say whether h641mn's example of independent tutors visiting sites to train staff would be exempt from the ROA and therefore warrant a CRB check \u2013 the nature of the sites, the frequency of the visits and whether an enhanced or standard CRB check is sought would all be relevant. If you are asked to consent to a CRB check and are unsure whether your position warrants one, you can point to the declaration on the form and ask the employer or other body to explain why your position is exempted from the ROA: which position on the CRB's table applies to you? If you are dissatisfied with the response, you should complain to the CRB of a potential breach of the CRB's code of practice, section 6, which requires all those employers and other bodies entitled to make CRB applications to \"use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that they only submit disclosure applications in accordance with the disclosure eligibility criteria for relevant positions or employment\". Section 8 of the code of practice also reiterates that it is a criminal offence to \"knowingly make a false statement for the purpose of obtaining, or enabling another person to obtain a disclosure. Persons guilty of such offences are liable to deregistration, imprisonment or a fine unless a relevant exception applies as outlined in CRB guidance.\" In my experience, the CRB has not always been especially vigilant in monitoring whether CRB applicants do in fact meet the eligibility requirements: it appears to rely to a great extent on the good faith of employers and other registered bodies. There is a possibility that inaction by the CRB in this regard would violate article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998, which protects the right to respect for private life. Disclosure by government agencies of personal information, such as details of criminal convictions and cautions, undoubtedly brings article 8 into play. Article 8 includes a positive obligation on the government to ensure that appropriate legal and practical safeguards are in place to protect against unauthorised disclosure of such personal information. In a 2008 European court of human rights case called I v Finland, relating to the unauthorised disclosure by a hospital of a person's HIV status, the court said that compensation after the event would not suffice, and that \"What is required ... is practical and effective protection to exclude any possibility of unauthorised access occurring in the first place\". This is a very strong statement, and it is difficult to conceive of a scheme that could be so safe as to exclude any possibility of unauthorised disclosure. However, it may be that the duty in the code of practice for registered bodies to \"use all reasonable endeavours\" to ensure that ineligible applications are not made, falls somewhat short. While there are legal safeguards (the criminal offences and code of practice set out above), and while it seems unlikely for practical and economic reasons that the courts would require the CRB itself to investigate whether each individual application for a certificate meets the eligibility requirements, if it could be shown that registered bodies were routinely making undetected unlawful applications for CRB certificates \u2013 whether inadvertently or not \u2013 there may be a breach of article 8. In addition, there may be a breach of article 8 in any individual case where it should have been obvious to the CRB (for example from the position given on the application form) that the eligibility test was not met. In conclusion, I do not think it is an offence for an employer to be honestly mistaken about whether someone qualifies for a CRB check, but employers have a duty under the code of practice to make all reasonable endeavours to ensure only eligible applications are made, and this must involve being able to explain to you why a check is required. If they cannot do so, complain to the CRB. If you believe that incorrect information is knowingly being put forward to the CRB to procure a wrongful disclosure, certainly complain to the CRB citing the code of practice, but complain to the police as well (but be prepared for a slightly nonplussed response). If you have recently (in the last three months) been subject to a CRB check but you do not come under any of the exempted positions, Liberty would be interested to hear from you.",
