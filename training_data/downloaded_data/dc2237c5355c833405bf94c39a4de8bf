  "content": "Police officers and others public authorities who use false identities to disguise their online presence when they use social media to investigate a suspect's personal lifestyle or associates without authorisation have been warned by the chief surveillance watchdog. Sir Christopher Rose, the chief surveillance commissioner, said too many investigators working for government departments and local authorities had yet to realise the dangers, particularly for \"collateral intrusion against innocent parties\", in the \"inadvertent or inappropriate\" use of Facebook, Twitter or other social media sites to gather intelligence without proper authorisation. In his annual report Rose also disclosed that the commissioners had strongly criticised some agencies for running undercover operations in which the legally required \"oversight officer\" had turned out to be part of the operational team. The chief surveillance commissioner also complained that there was \"too much cut-and-paste content\" in the periodic formal internal reviews of longer-running undercover operations run by the police and others. But Rose, a former appeal court judge, who is the most senior watchdog monitoring the use of covert surveillance powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, said it was not his responsibility to \"give a view on how much or how little use is made of the tactics that I oversee\". He said that was a matter initially for parliament, observing that the changing nature of crime meant the virtual online world provided fresh ways for public authorities to obtain intelligence: \"It is my role to ensure that such investigative activity is lawful, though the statutory basis is not always easy to find,\" he said. However he did acknowledge there had been public concern over the past year caused by the disclosures by Edward Snowden of the scale of mass surveillance, the historic inquiries into past police actions, and the current court cases about police undercover operations. But he said the data provided to him by the law enforcement agencies showed only a relatively small increase in the use of their powers and it was highly unlikely given the \"robust process and internal security in place\" that \"save in very rare circumstances, unauthorised activity has occurred\". He said that in general he was satisfied the public had no cause for any general concern: \"If it were otherwise I would say so.\"",
