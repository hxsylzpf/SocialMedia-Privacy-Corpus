  "content": "Have you ever wondered what happens inside Birmingham magistrates court? Well, speculate no more. This week, West Midlands police took to Twitter like \u2026 well, like underemployed pen-pushers who could be working on increasing the rape conviction, but are Tweeting instead. I'd imagined that the combination of local court plus Twitter would be a marriage of inanity. I was wrong. It turned out that the 24-hour \"tweet-a-thon\" was both funny and sad. The life it showed is not a rich tapestry, but the repetitive bottom two inches of a threadbare rug: the thieves, the liars, the chancers, the sad, the desperate. There's the woman who stole cucumbers and flour from a shop (cucumber fritters?), the guy who stole electric fans, and the woman who stole mascara and hid it in her bra. The West Midlands \"tweet-a-thon\" is a creative reaction to the decline in newspaper reporting of court proceedings, but I don't think it should be a police priority. There are surely other areas they should be focusing on. My last two encounters with the police went like this: a knock at the door late in the evening. A nice officer: \"Hello, nothing to worry about. We've had a call from a woman in distress from around this area and all we know is that it's a dark-coloured front door.\" Another knock months later. A brusque officer to my mother: \"We've had a call from a woman in distress with an Asian name. Who else lives here? Do you have a daughter? Does she know how to speak English?\" Guess what, I do! And whoever this woman in distress is, cops, you'd better get the hell off Twitter and find her.",
