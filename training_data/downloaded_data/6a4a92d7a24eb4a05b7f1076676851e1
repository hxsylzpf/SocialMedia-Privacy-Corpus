That's right, it's democracy, gone mad \u2026 Cheryl Cole vs Sausage Roll 'Can this sausage roll get more fans than Cheryl Cole?' Mission statement \"Currently Cheryl Cole has 1,522,310 fans, can this plain sausage roll get more? I think so.\" Members 1,118,458 VERSUS \u2026 'Cheryl Cole' Mission statement \"Sign up for Facebook to connect with Cheryl Cole.\" Members 1,573,385 fans Verdict First Ashley, now a sausage roll? What more must the nation's second-favourite X Factor judge put up with? You've got to roll with it: vote Cole! Cliff Richard No1 vs Banned From The Charts 'Sir Cliff Richard For Xmas number 1, 2010' Mission statement \"Mistletoe And Wine is just one of a number of pieces of musical genius he has produced! It is a tune and everybody should have it in thier (sic) library.\" Members 93 VERSUS \u2026 'Cliff Richard should be banned from the charts' Mission statement \"Cliff is outdated his music no longer floats our boats.\" Members 78 Verdict The last boat Cliff tried to float was the Titanic, but all he needs is another 546,329 members and he'll match the numbers of last year's Rage Against The Machine's campaign. Gary Glitter Legend vs Should Be Locked Up 'Fuck off Gary Glitter, pop paedophile at large, you should be locked up!' Mission statement \"I want to say Fuck Off, I don't want YOU free in my country!

GG has done nothing wrong and is now finally returning to his homeland a free man.\" Members 98 Verdict The lynch party has spoken, and it doesn't want us to be in his gang. I Love Mad Men vs I Hate Mad Men 'Does anyone watch &amp; love Mad Men besides Diane &amp; me?'

It's even a shitey, drab colour. I bet there are tonnes of people who'd rather be a fan of it than of Nick Griffin.\" Members 43,734 Verdict With another Panorama appearance, Nasty Nick could be on course for a knighthood for services to comedy. I Hate Michael Mcintyre vs Mcintyre For President 'I hate Michael McIntyre' Mission statement \"Kill him.\" Members 6 VERSUS \u2026 'Michael McIntyre for President' Mission statement: \"He would just be brilliant, who wouldn't want him in charge of the world? Also his hair is epic \u2013 that's a good enough reason :)\" Members 124 Verdict President of what? Comedy Hell or The Deaf And Blind Association?",
