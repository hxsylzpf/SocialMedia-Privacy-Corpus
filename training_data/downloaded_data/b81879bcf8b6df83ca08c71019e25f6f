  "content": "The most senior job at the UK's press watchdog will be advertised in newspapers in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales from this Sunday. Headhunters Spencer Stuart have been hired to find a replacement for Guy Black, the former director of the Press Complaints Commission, who has left to join the Conservative party. The recruitment specialists, who handled the hunt for a new BSkyB chief executive, are placing adverts in the Sunday Times, the Scotsman, the Belfast Telegraph and the Western Mail, and shortlisted candidates will be interviewed in the first week of March. Mr Black's former deputy, Tim Toulmin, is acting director until a replacement is appointed and is likely to be a candidate for the permanent post. Advertising in the national and regional press reflects the new, more open ethos of the PCC, which earlier this week named its first lay commissioner appointed through an open advertising process - a female solicitor who has previously held senior positions at two media watchdogs. Mr Black, who joined the PCC in 1996, came under criticism over his close personal friendship with Rebekah Wade, the editor of the Sun and before that the News of the World. He and his partner Mark Bolland, a former press secretary to the Prince of Wales and himself a former director of the PCC, holidayed with Wade and her husband, actor Ross Kemp, a childhood friend of Mr Black's. However, Mr Black has always maintained that this personal friendship did not in any way affect his professional judgment. He now works from the office of Tory leader Michael Howard in the House of Commons and reports directly to him. Spencer Stuart was responsible for drawing up a list of 209 potential candidates for the post of chief executive of BSkyB, a job which eventually went to James Murdoch, son of the company's chairman, Rupert Murdoch. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
