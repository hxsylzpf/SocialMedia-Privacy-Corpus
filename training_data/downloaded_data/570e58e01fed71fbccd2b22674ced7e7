  "content": "Facebook played little or no role in the organisation of the summer riots, and was mainly used by people to comment on what was happening, the Guardian and LSE's study has found. Despite harsh sentences handed down by the courts for incitement on the social networking site, few rioters we spoke to used Facebook in a significant way during the riots or thought the site was used to spread disorder. In short, this was because they saw Facebook as a public forum \u2013 and not the place to arrange criminal behaviour. \"I'm not on Facebook or nothing,\" said one 16-year-old from Birmingham who was later arrested on suspicion of burglary, \"but, what they did, they've supposed to use their brains, yeah, they ought to know that the police are watching it. I know that the police are clever to track it, innit.\" He added: \"They shouldn't use social media, they should have used their phones to contact each other.\" A 16-year-old involved in the disturbances in Birmingham updated his Facebook status only to later delete his posts. \"I jumped on Facebook and that, I started putting statuses up, but I deleted them,\" he said. \"'Cos I just remembered \u2026 people telling me that the police had got hold of Facebook and all of that, so I deleted the statuses.\" There has been huge variation in the sentences handed down to Facebook offenders. Some were found guilty but released after writing letters of apology, or given community sentences in place of jail sentences, but the lengthiest of any of the sentences relating to the riots to date were for incitement through Facebook: Jordan Blackshaw and Perry Sutcliffe both received four-year terms for creating Facebook \"event\" pages that were deemed by the court to be encouraging disorder \u2013 although no disorder took place as a result of their actions. The Guardian interviewed a young man in prison after he was jailed for posting Facebook statuses inciting riots. His messages on the social networking site said: \"Who's on rioting?\", \"Anyone wants anything from Flannels [department store]\" and \"Kill one black youth, we'll kill a million feds [police]\". The teenager said he had meant the messages as a joke, and had not taken part in any riots. Flannels was attacked, but he said this was unrelated. \"Like, if somebody told you to jump off a cliff, would you do it? Like, you read magazines and that, and you see a stupid thing in it, and people don't get arrested. I put a stupid thing down, and I got arrested. Terrible,\" he said. Lord Judge, the lord chief justice of England and Wales, takes a different view. In October he dismissed Blackshaw and Sutcliffe's appeals, concluding that incitement through Facebook was just as serious as incitement through other channels \u2013 and should be treated as severely, whether defendants argued they were joking or not. \"Neither went from door to door looking for friends or likeminded people to join up with him in the riot,\" he said of Blackshaw and Sutcliffe. \"But modern technology has done away with the need for such direct personal communication. \"It can all be done through Facebook or other social media. The abuse of modern technology for criminal purposes extends to and includes incitement of very many people by a single step.\"",
