  "content": "Since becoming the latest, Twitter has rarely gone a day or two without stirring up some new point of interest. Today, for example, Kara Swisher at All Things Digital suggests that the love-it-or-hate-it website is in talks with Google and Microsoft to license its vast amount of data to them, for incorporation in their search engines. And only a couple of weeks ago, the dotcom confirmed a huge new round of investment - reported to be around $100m. Yet for all of this, the site continues to be plagued by technical issues. For the past few hours, Twitter appears to have suffered a major blockage, with only a trickle of messages coming through to be displayed on user's pages. I've got the issue here in California, while colleagues in London are reporting the same thing: right now, I've got a number of messages that say they're no more recent than three hours ago. It's not just Twitter's website either, the API that feeds all of the applications that plug into Twitter appear to be having the same problem. Confusingly, however, it does look like messages are actually being received and stored by Twitter - a quick search on Cameron will reveal, for example, plenty of people talking about the Tory leader's speech today. And if you go and look directly at different user pages, you can see some messages that have been sent more recently. Confusing. What's going on? I asked Twitter to comment, but they haven't said anything aside from a message on status.twitter.com that says \"We are currently investigating a problem causing many users' timelines to be delayed\". Earlier this week Amazon's EC2 service - the cloud-based infrastructure that is used by Twitter - was hammered by a denial-of-service attack, but the fact that Twitter messages are being incorrectly processed (rather than not being received at all) would indicate that the problem lies with the San Francisco startup. Whatever the reasons behind this glitch, it highlights the fact that the service is still amazingly unreliable for something with so much money in the bank. In the early days, Twitter was notorious for falling over on a regular basis - particularly if a big news event prompted millions of people to simultaneously share their thoughts. It was so common that the \"Fail Whale\" (the graphic that appeared when the site was out) even generated its own fan club. But while users were prepared to forgive Twitter when it was still relatively small, today it's a different story. Now the site has got a lot of money and a lot of users - many of them new and without the warm and fuzzy feelings that early adopters have towards the service. If Twitter wants the sort of loyalty from its users that will help it forge those deals with Google, Microsoft and others, then it's going to have to seriously improve reliability.",
