  "content": "Eagle-eyed Twitterers may have noticed very discreet and rather nicely designed ads creeping into the sidebar on profiles, but in very clever and useful format. A small box under the following/followers/updates box at the top of the page now introduces one of a small number of recommended Twitter clients or tools, including Twittervision, Tweetie and ExecTweets, and a short description. One of Tweetie's developers, Loren Brichter, told TechCrunch that he's not paying for the ad - it's part of a trial Twitter is running to test the response to text ads. Further to that $35m funding round last month, Twitter is also expanding rapidly with engineering, PR, Japan country manager and business development roles advertised on its site - but also product managers for search and for Twitter's API. Given the buzz around real-time search of late, that's very interesting. (There's a Greasemonkey script that will combine real-time Twitter results with Google search results, and it's fascinating...) ExecTweets, which launched late yesterday, works on that same principle as fledgling service Twitter Jobsearch - filtering and contextualising Twitter's content. VentureBeat has a great rundown. We've written before about a few of the options for monetising Twitter, but as the scrutiny continues to pile up, contextualised search will become an increasingly important part of the pie.",
