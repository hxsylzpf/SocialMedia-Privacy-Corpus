A statement from Guardian News &amp; Media said the app is generating almost 1m extra page impressions per day. For October, guardian.co.uk recorded 3.2 million daily browsers, up by 12.23%, according to the latest ABC internet audience figures. It is also reaching a young audience: data shows that 56.7% of the app's users are 24 or under, and 16.7% are 17 and under. In a statement, Andrew Miller, chief executive officer of Guardian Media Group, which owns GNM, said: \"As well as increasing traffic, the app is making our journalism visible to new audiences. Over half of the app's users are 24 and under \u2013 traditionally a very hard-to-reach demographic for news organisations. The Facebook app is one of a number of successful launches by the Guardian in recent months as our 'digital first' strategy gains momentum. We're delighted with the results.\" The Guardian's \"digital first\" strategy, announced in June, is intended to bring about a \"major transformation\" of the newspaper group which aims to double digital revenues to nearly \u00a3100m by 2016 as traditional sources of revenue \u2013 notably print \u2013 fall away due to the decline in physical reading of papers. The Guardian's Facebook app was launched in September as part of a partnership with the social network, along with other news sites including the Washington Post, the Independent and The Daily. In a blogpost, Austin Hagen, a product manager at Facebook, says that the Washington Post's Social Reader app has drawn more than 3.5 million monthly active users so far, and that 83% of readers are under 35. The Independent has seen more than one million monthly active users \"connecting their Facebook accounts to the new social news experience on independent.co.uk\" which Hagen says \"has bumped up older articles that have gone viral through social distribution\".",
