  "content": "\u2022 The bombshell news that Steve Jobs had a liver transplant - first reported in an unsourced story by the Wall Street Journal and since confirmed by CNBC - is still echoing around the technology industry. The smallest details are now being scrutinised: his movements, his alleged mansion in Memphis, his medical prognosis. And if the torrent of attention seems a little overwhelming, it's probably just a recognition of the fact that Jobs is one of the most influential figures in the technology industry - and hence society - over the past 30 years. \u2022 The ongoing trial of four Google executives in Italy - accused of complicity in the bullying of a teenager who was ridiculed on YouTube - is set to take another step this week. The FT reports that privacy chief Peter Fleischer and legal boss David Drummond are due in court in Milan on Tuesday. \u2022 As is traditional for a Monday morning, I've got a few longer reads that are worth digesting for you: first is copyright campaigner Lawrence Lessig's rejoinder to a recent essay by Wired's Kevin Kelly, called The New Socialism. I'm not sure I agree with either of them, but it's fascinating reading (particularly the comments on Lessig's post). And finally: is Twitter planning to make money through shopping recommendations?
