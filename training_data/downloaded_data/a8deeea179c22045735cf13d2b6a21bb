Gizmodo says the \"malware\" was on its site \"for a little while last week\". Its announcement did not specify the nature of the problem, but some attacks are now able to infect some Windows machines simply when an advert is viewed. Others flash up warnings that encourage people to download and pay for programs that claim to protect them from fake viruses. Brian Lam, the editor of the site, said in an apology on the site that the hackers who planted the script \"somehow fooled our ad sales team through an elaborate scam\" but that \"only a few people should have been affected\". However, he added, \"this isn't something we take lightly\". He said that the problem would have been noticed sooner but was not, because the editorial team does not use Microsoft Windows. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for the security company Sophos, was critical of Gizmodo's attitude to its readers, because it did not initally specify the threat. \"I'm rather disappointed that Gizmodo doesn't offer more information about the threat, or some links to anti-virus products that may help its readers check and clean-up their computers. Instead, they make a rather snotty remark about how they didn't notice the infection themselves as they are running Mac and Linux computers,\" he wrote on his blog. The problem of such \"malvertising\", as it had been dubbed, appears to be spreading. In September the New York Times suffered a similar attack from hackers posing as ad buyers for the internet telephony company Vonage; hackers have even succeeded in placing malicious adverts through Google's DoubleClick service, which is then syndicated among a number of different sites. The Daily Mail was also affected in December 2008 by banner ads which would infect Windows machines with viruses from Russia. Malware and fake virus adverts \u2013 \"scareware\" \u2013 are hugely lucrative for the hackers who plant them. The security firm Symantec estimated earlier this month that more than 40 million people had fallen victim to \"scareware\" scams in the past 12 months: it identified more than 250 versions of the programs, and estimated that criminals can get more than \u00a3750,000 annually from them. One security startup company, Dasient, formed by former Google staffers, recently estimated that more than 600,000 websites have been hacked and are running malicious programs without their owners being aware of it \u2013 making them a potential risk to anyone who browses them. Google has set up a search engine at anti-malvertising.com specifically to let companies check would-be advertisers against a register of potentially dangerous or untrusted clients.",
