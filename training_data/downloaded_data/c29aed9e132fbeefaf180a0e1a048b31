  "content": "Dazed Digital, the online incarnation of Dazed &amp; Confused magazine, has a new look from this week. Jefferson Hack described his vision for the site not as a magazine web site, but \"an ideas factory, a destination site, a reference tool, a content hub, a radar for what's vital and relevant in an information soaked culture\". Quite. The new look involves more fashion features, including profiles of designers and studios, moodboards and trends, and an impressive list of big names contributors including Gareth Pugh, Hedi Slimane , Kim Jones, Mariano Vivanco and Nicola Formichetti. I found a great piece on a 15-year-old photographer from Reading, Eleanor Hardwick , who is\"fast becoming an internet sensation\" with a portfolio of more than 2,000 images on Flickr. It made me bitterly envious that I didn't have access to all these amazing sites when I was younger (and at art college) and had time and inspiration to explore. There are some fascinating projects you could create around identity and persona online, using sites like Flickr and Facebook creatively. But it'll have to wait until I have some [cough] spare time. \"I joined Flickr when I started my doll collecting so that I could upload my doll photos and holiday snapshots,\" said Hardwick. \"Most of the contacts I met on there were fellow doll collectors, although I did meet a number of portraiture photographers in my early days too. I love flickr because I have met so many close friends on there, and without the support everyone has given me, I'm certain I would have lost interest in photography and dropped the camera in a dusty corner years ago.\" So many ideas in her photos. If Dazed Digital can give more air to this kind of talent, then bring it on.",
