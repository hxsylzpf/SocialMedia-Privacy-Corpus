  "content": "The high court judge who allowed details of Jamie Theakston's visit to a Mayfair brothel to be published in the Sunday People said today the rights of prostitutes needed to be considered in the case. Mr Justice Ouseley granted an order on January 26 banning the paper from using any photographs of the Top of the Pops presenter taken inside the brothel. However, he allowed the newspaper to publish an article based on interviews with the prostitutes involved. The article carried a picture of a bed set up for sado-masochistic sessions, which were among the services offered by the brothel. However, the People and the newspapers that followed up the story were banned by the court from using pictures the prostitutes had taken of Theakston inside the brothel. Today Mr Ouseley said the law of confidentiality should not be judged solely from the point of view of \"one participant\". \"The prostitutes clearly took a different view of the confidentiality of what they had seen and done with the claimant,\" he said. \"If a well-known man has sexual relations with a prostitute in a brothel, the desire on his part to keep their actions and 'relationship' confidential and the desire on the part of the other to exploit their actions and relationship commercially are irreconcilable.\" The judge said just because a customer and prostitute engaged in sex did not mean they were bound by any law of confidentiality. \"It is not inherent in the nature of a brothel that all or anything that transpires within it is confidential,\" Mr Ouseley explained. \"It is difficult to see why the protection of confidentiality should be imposed essentially for one party, to a fleeting transaction for money, when there is no reason to suppose that, at the time, the other party would have considered the relationship or the activity confidential for one moment.\"",
