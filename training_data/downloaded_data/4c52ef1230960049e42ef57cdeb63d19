  "content": "After updating my Twitter feed for the umpteenth time on Wednesday, I came across two trending topics #whitepeopleactivities and #blackpeopleactivities. It appears this topic began as a comedic way to express noted and age-old differences between the two races. A great idea in theory, but in execution the majority of those tweets lacked comedy and overflowed with offensive assumptions and stereotypes about both races. If I were to accuse any of those tweeters of prejudice, they would be appalled and vehemently deny the accusation. They might rattle off the names of all their United Colors of Benetton friends, or tell me of their unwavering support of La Raza, or show pictures of themselves in hoodies in memory of Trayvon Martin. I find that hilarious. I also find it amusing that these topics trended during a time when everyone is fighting so hard for America to be identified as \"post racial\" since the election and reelection of President Barack Obama. For me, #WhitePeopleActivities and #BlackPeopleActivities made one thing abundantly clear: Not only is America extremely far from being \"post racial\", but Americans have no clue how NOT to be prejudiced. We look at everything with a \"which one is different\" mentality. Even the back page of the Highlights activity book for kids asks that question. It is just as easy to focus on the ways we are all alike, but that doesn't hold the same allure. We want to be different, but, as evidenced in the majority of tweets, we do not know how to respect differences and expose them without malicious intent. Subconscious or not, we habitually approach those unlike us with an unhealthy fear and disdain for what often times has yet to be revealed. Just the fact that someone or something is \"different\" is enough to set us on edge and work very hard to come up with devices to be set apart. The most riotous aspect of the tweets was that most were preposterous and/or simply untrue. That's the problem with stereotypes and assumptions. I have yet to see or hear of a stereotype that fully applies to every member of the group addressed in the assumption. Below are a few examples with my commentary: #BlackPeopleActivities beating their children in public#WhitePeopleActivities children beating their parents in public \u2014 2Chainz (Tity Boi) (@2ChainzLyrics) March 6, 2013 False: Last week, I saw a black parent who needed to (but did not) whoop the hell out of her child for knocking down a display of potato chips because she refused to put a bag in the shopping cart. A month ago, I also saw a white woman tear into her child for running through racks and knocking down clothing. #WhitePeopleActivities watching the Kardashians.#BlackPeopleActivities sleeping with the Kardashians \u2014 \u261e\u2655\u03b1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c7 \u03c2\u03b7\u03bf\u03c9\u2122\u2655\u261c (@AlexSnoww) March 7, 2013 Mostly False: Kris Humphries is three-quarters white. #blackpeopleactivities loving Michael Jackson when he was black #whitepeopleactivities loving Michael Jackson when he was white R.I.P. \u2014 Glen Lewis (@Mega20vision) March 8, 2013 False: Ok. Really? Vitiligo or not, Michael Jackson is the greatest of all time. I'm serious. He is the GOAT! RIP! 4. #WhitePeopleActivities eating chicken salad. #BlackPeopleActivities eating fried chicken. False: The founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken is a white man, Harland David Sanders, who is more affectionately known as, \"The Colonel\". Let's also take advantage of the opportunity for cultural exchange here: You have not lived until you've had a fried chicken salad. Yum! #WhitePeopleActivities going to Penn State#BlackPeopleActivities going to State Penitentiary \u2014 Offensive Tweets\u2122(@TooMessedUp) March 6, 2013 There are so many directions I could go here. None of them are appropriate. #toosoon I unraveled the arguments of five (or more accurately 4\u00be) tweets here and I am sure that, given the time, I would be able to do the same of every other tweet on the subject. If I were able to quickly disprove those tweets, then why write them? They are not funny. They are false. They are not grounded. They hurt. They perpetuate years of racial discord that not even the election of a man of color to this nation's highest office can heal. We must refocus the nature of our interactions with one another and the conversations surrounding those interactions. We have spent several generations denoting and operating in the differences between the two groups. We totally mastered that art, if you want to call it that. It is time for us to commit to and master the art of inclusion, acceptance, and tolerance for #AnyGroupsActivities.",
