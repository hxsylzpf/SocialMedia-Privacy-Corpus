  "content": "Six of the US's biggest media organisations are pushing for the court records related to the high-profile child molestation case against pop star Michael Jackson to be made public. Lawyers for the New York Times and broadcasters CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox News are claiming the court acted illegally when it ordered that the documents remain sealed until the singer's appearance in court next week. The search documents were due to be released on December 31 but the date was changed after consultation between prosecutors and Jackson's lawyer, Mark Geragos. But the media organisations claim the public was not given proper notice of the change of date. \"There needs to be notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the sealing of court documents,\" said lawyer Theodore Boutrous Jr, acting on behalf of the media firms. \"There must be notice so the public can go in and argue that documents should not be sealed.\" The records include a search warrant, an affidavit in which authorities explained their reasons for seeking the warrant, and a list of items seized. Separately, prosecutors in the case this week applied to the courts for a gagging order that would bar Jackson or his lawyer from talking to the media. \"There are two prosecutions pending in California that, for different reasons, are each the object of unrelenting comment and speculation in the tabloid press, 'tabloid television' and even the regular purveyors of news,\" the prosecutor's motion said. It goes on to quote Jackson's lawyer, Mr Geragos, as calling the actions of the family of the star's accuser \"a shakedown\" and a \"scam\". \"Attorney Geragos has not been shy about offering his own opinion about the supposed 'financial motive' of the boy identified as the victim in this case and the boy's family for reporting their concerns to the authorities,\" the motion said. But Mr Geragos told the Associated Press he would oppose the order, saying prosecutors should share responsibility for the publicity which Jackson's case has received. \"When I first read [the motion], I wondered if the district attorney's office was suffering from short-term memory loss,\" Mr Geragos said. \"I was not the one conducting multiple press conferences with audio and visual displays.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
