  "content": "A photographer was sentenced to 140 hours of community service today for assaulting Heather Mills-McCartney in a subway as he tried to take her picture. Jay Kaycappa, 32, grabbed the estranged wife of Sir Paul McCartney by her right shoulder to swing her round and take her photograph. He was convicted of assaulting Mills-McCartney on July 5 last year and her friend Mark Payne the following evening, after a three-day trial at Brighton Magistrates' Court. Chairwoman of the bench Juliet Smith today sentenced Kaycappa, of Fareham, Hampshire, to a 12-month community order consisting of 140 hours of unpaid work concurrent on each count of assault. The father-of-three was also ordered to pay Mills-McCartney \u00a3100 and Payne \u00a350 as well as costs of \u00a31,000. The magistrate told him: \"In both incidents you demonstrated persistence that in fact we consider to be beyond an acceptable level. \"However, your actions have not caused any injury.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
