  "content": "I must take issue with some aspects of your editorial on the Whittingdale affair (14 April). John Whittingdale is not an obscure figure. He is a cabinet minister and before that he was chairman of one of the most high-profile select committees (for culture, media and sport), during which time he chaired the most watched session ever \u2013 that with Rupert Murdoch in 2011. You say that Whittingdale \"presides over the flawed but fledgling system of press self-regulation that emerged in the aftermath of the Leveson inquiry\", but this is to mask the iniquity of his unwarranted breach of the principle that no politician should have a role in press regulation, a principle that all sides used to agree with until newspapers saw they had an ally in the post. Through his decision not to bring into effect section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013, Whittingdale is undermining the entire post-Leveson scheme that was carefully designed to protect press freedom and was approved by every party in parliament. I should have thought the Guardian would argue it is wrong for the will of parliament to be frustrated by discretion of the executive, at the behest of large companies with vested interests. It is surprising to read in the Guardian \u2013 of all papers \u2013 that suggestions of press misbehaviour and collusion are \"machiavellian\" and \"conspiracy theories\". How did the rest of the press react to the Guardian's brave journalism on phone hacking? By denial and collusion. Finally, you assert that section 40 might have prevented publication of the Panama Papers. Yet you must know that, under section 40, a newspaper in a recognised regulator is immune from libel chilling. If the Guardian were to join Impress, and if Whittingdale's block on section 40 were to be lifted, you would enjoy costs protection in the courts. Christopher Jefferies Patron, Hacked Off, Bristol \u2022 You devote space to four takes on Mr Whittingdale (14 April): a story (page 4), an editorial (page 28), an opinion (page 29) and a cartoon (page 29). Simon Jenkins's opinion piece and your editorial appeared balanced, humane and modern. Running the \"story\", however, makes you part of the problem (even if you run it as a story about a story). Taken with the cartoon, you give the impression that Mr Whittingdale or the government have been up to no good and have something pertinent to hide. The conspiracy here is of all media wanting it both ways: the low end want a public example of \"being responsible\"; the high end want to tut and run the story anyway. When one considers Hacked Off's bizarre take on a matter of personal privacy, this story is a late Christmas present for you all.
