  "content": "The Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, has called for an end to the internet phenomenon of \"planking\" after a man died when he fell from a seventh-floor balcony while having his picture taken. Planking entails people lying face down on their stomach in unusual locations and posting photographs of their act on social media websites. Gillard described the death of Acton Beale, 20, as \"really tragic\", and urged plankers to consider the safety implications of their pastime. The planking Facebook page is liked by more than 116,000 people, although there is a separate \"planking Australia\" page with images showing planking on a basketball hoop, a chair and a television. Queensland state police deputy commissioner Ross Barnett told reporters that Beale fell from a balcony railing while a friend photographed him on Sunday morning in Brisbane. The railing is believed to have been two inches wide. \"There's a difference between a harmless bit of fun done somewhere that's really safe and taking a risk with your life,'' Gillard told reporters on Sunday. \"Everybody likes a bit of fun, but focus has to be on keeping yourself safe first.'' Beale's death comes less than a week after another Australian man was charged with being found on a police establishment without lawful excuse, after he allegedly indulged his passion for the craze by planking over a police car. The activity came to prominence at the end of the previous decade, when it was most commonly known as the lying down game. Planking is believed to be the more Australia-specific term, where it has gained particular popularity. The Planking Australia Facebook page has more than 100,000 fans, although some were using the page on Monday morning to express dissatisfaction with the planking culture. \"Planking is so STUPID!!,\" posted Ammy Louiisee. Samie Musawi was of the opinion that, \"You guys look like idiots doing this\". However, others showed their support, with Alison Schrader writing: \"Bahahahahaha. I had never heard of planking til it was on the news. I thinks its (sic) gold. Some pics r just too funny.\" Schrader added: \"This just proves that aussie r the funniest mob.\" Sam Weckert, the founder of the Facebook page dedicated to planking in Australia, denied that the craze encourages people to take unnecessary risks. \"Planking was started as a fun and quirky pastime,\" he was quoted as saying by Australian media. \"While we have no control over the actions of others we'd like to encourage any members of the planking group and the general public to undertake this in a safe and responsible fashion. We would like to encourage all planking members as well as the media not to sensationalise this tragic event.\" Australian police said it had no problem with planking until taken to extremes. \"If you want to take a photograph of yourself planking on a park bench two feet off the ground, there are no risks to your health with that,\" Barnett said. \"But ... when you start doing it seven storeys up or lying across a railway line or in a range of other places that invite death or serious injury, that's what we have a concern about. Ultimately, is it worth life in a wheelchair to take a funny photo to impress somebody you don't know on the internet?\" Plankers continued to upload pictures of their exploits to the internet on Monday, with one man appearing on top of a bandstand, another atop a bush, and one woman on an open fridge.",
