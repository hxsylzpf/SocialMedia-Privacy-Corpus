  "content": "The case had been expected to establish if there is a new law of privacy following the adoption of the Human Rights Act, with its insistence that everyone has \"the right to respect for private and family life\". But, while the act is expected to form part of Ms Campbell's case, her lawyers yesterday indicated that the trial was unlikely to establish a legal precedent. \"The first point of the defence is that Miss Campbell has forfeited all protection because of her statements on her family and relationships and saucy photographs in the Madonna book, and we say to that: so what? How can anodyne disclosures like these waive for ever anonymity for fair treatment for an addiction?\" Mr Caldecott said. But Mr Browne said it was in the public interest that the Mirror publish the story since, by abusing drugs, Ms Campbell was guilty of \"serious criminal behaviour\". She had deceived the public over a number of years by claiming she had never taken illegal drugs, and such problems were obviously related to her behavioural problems. He said: \"For over a decade, Miss Campbell has courted publicity by delivering interviews in which she provides glimpses of her private life, normally her relationship to her current boyfriend, in exchange for an opportunity to promote her latest commercial venture. \"We say - to adopt the language of the PCC [press complaints commission] - that in so doing she is compromising the privacy of her personal life.\" The case continues.",
