  "content": "With the allegations in the New York Times linking Andy Coulson to phone hacking while he was editor of the News of the World, it is becoming clearer day by day that the sticky carpet of British journalism \u2013 with honourable exceptions \u2013 is in profound need of a good steam-clean. It was pretty shocking when I asked Coulson and Rebekah Wade (then the Sun's editor) during a select committee investigation on media intrusion in March 2003 whether they had ever paid a police officer for information \u2013 and Wade replied that they had, and Coulson added that he would do so again, adding, weasel-like, \"within the law\". It's shocking because it must be an offence to suborn a police officer, and the chequebook-enticed leaking from police investigations has all too often compromised them so seriously that no prosecution has been possible. It was even more alarming when we discovered that Glenn Mulcaire had hacked his way into the messages of the princes. He went to prison, and although Coulson denied all knowledge of it, he resigned as editor. All along, the line of News International (the newspapers' owner) has been that this was just one bad apple, but the clear evidence is that it was a far more sustained campaign. Two things remain truly disturbing. First, the Metropolitan police have manifestly failed to pursue their investigations with anything like the full vigour of the law. Last summer I wrote to them on the offchance that, as a Labour MP, I might have been another target of Mulcaire's illegal activities. The police reply in December confirmed that they had indeed secured material relating to me from Mulcaire and that it might be worth my while contacting my phone company, who then confirmed that there had been several attempts to access information on my phone in 2003. What is astounding is that the police had not thought to mention this to me beforehand. Nor, as I understand it, have they informed many, if any, of the thousands of others who may have been targeted by Mulcaire and the News of the World. So despite having evidence that the tapping and hacking may have been far more extensive than Coulson or Mulcaire admit, the police have only investigated further or prosecuted in relation to a tiny proportion of those almost certainly affected. It is as if they have decided it's not on to tackle the royal family but that the rest of society is fair game. Yet surely it is the job of the police to protect all victims of illegal hacking, and it would be wholly wrong to allow any consideration about the power of News International to prevent the full force of the law being brought to bear. After all, it seems as if we are talking about more than 3,000 people. We rightly balk at the idea of the security services tapping MPs, but it seems that dozens of MPs were among Mulcaire's targets, along with many celebrities and journalists. Second, it seems extraordinary that Coulson is still the prime minister's director of communications. He has admitted that under his watch News International paid police officers for information. For all we know this was a regular habit. The New York Times claims that during his time he freely discussed Mulcaire-style \"investigations\" with his journalists and that these unlawful news-gathering techniques were pervasive. Coulson denies this, and has asserted this to parliament. I find it hard to believe he didn't know how his scoops were being sourced. The most worrying aspect of all this is that unless the police take proper action, these illegal practices will carry on. And unless David Cameron sacks Coulson, he will be openly condoning some of the dirtiest politics in Britain.",
