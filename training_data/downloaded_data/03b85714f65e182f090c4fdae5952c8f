While one's commitment to Roe has become the litmus test for electing every president and appointing every supreme court justice in recent decades, it's useful to recall that the case itself, decided by a 7-2 margin on 22 January 1973, became controversial largely in the rearview mirror. As Linda Greenhouse and Reva Siegel point out in their landmark 2012 book, Before Roe v Wade, a good deal of the political firestorm engendered by the Roe decision came about for political and electoral reasons that had little to do with the actual result of the case. Because American legal scholars always enjoy a good after-dinner counterfactual, however, a good deal of academic debate has emerged over whether Roe caused a political backlash that has ultimately done more harm than good to the abortion rights movement. It's hard to know. Even supreme court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested as much last year, when she observed: \"it's not that the judgment was wrong, but it moved too far, too fast.\" Ginsburg and others have suggested that had the law evolved slowly on a state-by-state basis, or been rooted in something more substantial than the amorphous privacy rights sketched out by then Justice Harry Blackmun, Roe might have stood on firmer legal footing today. Lost in the four intervening decades is one other factor in the original Roe decision. As Justice Blackmun envisioned the right to an abortion, it was a right enjoined as much (if not more so) by the physician as the pregnant woman. In Blackmun's view: \"The attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy should be terminated.\" As New Yorker legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin writes this week, the original Roe decision mentions physicians 48 separate times. \"Woman\" appears 44 times. The physicians tend to be designated as \"he\". By the time Roe was reaffirmed, in 1992, that slightly paternalistic vision had been refined by the court to apply to women and their bodies. And doctors were left to wander in the constitutional wilderness. But before we dismiss the constitutional rights of the kindly old country doctor as a patronizing footnote, it's worth pointing out that the legal backlash against Roe that's occurred in the past few years has often taken the form of weaponizing the physicians themselves. Following big Republican wins across many state legislatures in 2010, more than 130 bills were passed with the express object of reducing abortion. What's astounding is the extent to which the once-sacred relationship between doctors and pregnant mothers has now been flipped on its head: some of the new legislation forces physicians to read from scientifically discredited scripts warning women of the links between abortion and breast cancer. The most radical proposals force physicians to perform invasive trans-vaginal ultrasounds on women seeking abortions whether they are medically necessary or not. In some of the proposed legislation, the mother is prohibited from averting her eyes when the physician shows her the ultrasound image. In other cases, physicians failing to perform the procedure may be charged with a felony. Whatever you may think of the outsize reverence for physician advice and support that undergirds the original opinion in Roe, it's quite clear that the current efforts to dismantle Roe tread heavily upon the independence, judgment and training of modern medical professionals. And they do so at a moment when a pregnant woman most needs science-based, objective and situation-specific guidance. In short, one aspect of Roe that has suffered most damage in the past 40 years has gone almost unnoticed: the anachronistic notion that doctors still matter. The other enduring paradox of Roe is a statistical one: if it is true that approximately one woman in three will have an abortion in her lifetime, how can it be the case that \u2013 according to polling by the Pew Research Center \u2013 52% of Americans say abortion should be only be legal under certain circumstances, with 20% wanting it outlawed in all cases. The data overwhelmingly show that Americans commonly avail themselves of legal abortion, yet also oppose it. And public opinion has changed almost not at all in the 40 years since Roe. There are many theories put forward for American ambivalence toward abortion: a generation of millenials that can't recall life before Roe and is thus unaware of what's at stake; an unwillingness of women who have had an abortion to admit to it publicly; a \"do as I say, not as I do\" mentality that allows us to find abortion morally reprehensible and yet necessary under certain circumstances. Americans are invariably both idealistic and pragmatic. State laws purporting to save unborn babies are wildly popular, but political candidates suggesting that women should be grateful for a pregnancy resulting from a rape are laughed off the national stage. Because the supreme court started this fight in 1973, it seems fitting to point out that the supreme court can also end it. Deeply-coded conversations about privacy and abortion have become the mainstay of every supreme court confirmation hearing for two decades. And with four of the nine current supreme court justices approaching 80, and a high court (as it's currently constituted) that would likely split 5-4 on upholding Roe, the court is the place to watch. It is true that the ground war is happening at the state legislatures, with a stroke of the pen, the court could change everything. Barack Obama has four years and at least one likely court appointment to change that balance, if he can. Of course, the final irony here is that as modern medicine makes strides in enabling us both to sustain and to terminate fetal life at ever earlier stages, the culture wars rage on as though it's still 1973. Or better, 1983. Which means that long after the anti-abortion camp has determined that actually life begins pre-conception (as it has argued in Arizona), and long after the pro-abortion camp has made it possible to terminate a pregnancy with a simple pill, we will still be arguing about when life begins and under what circumstances we can end it. The actual facts of Roe have shrunk down to almost microscopic dimensions. The rhetorical and legal war, however, looms larger than ever.",
