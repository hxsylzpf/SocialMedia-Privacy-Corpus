  "content": "A royal surveillance scandal has shocked Norway with revelations that a popular tabloid magazine had attempted to spy on the country's crown princess. A former journalist at Se og Hoer (See and Hear) claims that the weekly magazine stopped at nothing to dig up information on Crown Princess Mette Marit, a commoner, single mother and the daughter of a former journalist herself. She married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001 after they met at a rock concert. In a tell-all book published yesterday, Haavard Menaes said he was sent to London to buy spying equipment worth 80,000 kroner (\u00a36,500) so he could take pictures of the princess and her friends at a private party. He also claimed that Se og Hoer bribed police officers so they would check if the princess, her former boyfriends, her friends or her relatives had criminal records and if so, for what offences. Menaes also said that in 2001 the magazine sent him to squeeze details about Princess Mette Marit from a former boyfriend. He was told to pay the man, who was then a drug addict, 1,000 kroner per hour to have drinks with him - and give him every possible detail about their life together. According to the story, the man downed beers for several hours on Se og Hoer's money but never revealed any details about his ex-girlfriend. The revelations did not stop at the crown princess. Menaes claims the magazine also paid 250,000 kroner to a friend of Ari Behn, who is married to Princess Martha Louise, the daughter of King Harald, for private pictures of Mr Behn. The revelations have shocked the Scandinavian country, which is not used to such methods. Already the head of the national union of journalists has called the methods unacceptable. The royal family has so far kept silent, as it always does. The scandal echoes the case of the News of the World's royal editor, Clive Goodman, who was recently found guilty of intercepting mobile phone messages of Prince William and other members of the British royal family and sentenced to four months in jail.",
