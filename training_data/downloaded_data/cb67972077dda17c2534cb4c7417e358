  "content": "A Jeb Bush campaign aide resigned on Tuesday after controversial remarks he had made years earlier were uncovered online, prompting the aide to warn his fellow tech sector workers about the challenges of the political sphere. Bush hired Ethan Czahor as chief technology officer of his political action committee Right to Rise as the former Florida governor considers running for president in the 2016 election. \"I only hope that my recent news won't dissuade future techies from entering politics, regardless of political affiliations/backgrounds\u2026\" Czahor said on Twitter. \"...and I've resigned my role at Right to Rise. Best of luck to everyone there, and I apologize in advance to whoever fills my position.\" Silicon Valley has in recent years put its considerable wealth towards politics, and in April 2013 a group of tech executives led by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg launched the fwd.us campaign to push for immigration reform. Initiatives like these have brought the two powerful spheres together, as has the need for politicians to integrate technology into campaigns. Czahor co-founded Hipster.com \u2013 a site that experimented with creating a variety of products like digital postcards and content, but was ultimately bought and eliminated by Aol. Time spotted that Bush had hired Czahor this week and soon after, reporters turned up Czahor's online postings that a future presidential candidate might not want tied to his campaign. \"new study confirms old belief: college female art majors are sluts, science majors are also sluts but uglier,\" Czahor wrote in a since-deleted tweet from March 2009 catalogued by Buzzfeed. \"i saw a sign that said 'drunk driving kills,' but that's not logically correct \u2013 it should be 'having accidents while drunk driving kills',\" said another. The Huffington Post also found comments on race Czahor made about Martin Luther King Jr on his radio show while at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania. \"First of all, Martin Luther King Jr was a well-dressed, extremely well-spoken man; he didn't have his pants sagged to his ankles, and he wasn't delivering his speech in 'jibberish' or 'slang' (ie. he wasn't speaking like a rapper). He understood that looking respectable and speaking clearly and concisely isn't a trait of white men \u2013 it's a trait of intelligent men.\" As these comments spread across the internet, Bush's campaign said it did not approve of Czahor's comment and that it had asked him to delete the tweets. On Tuesday, Czahor tendered his resignation. \"The Right to Rise Pac accepted Ethan Czahor's resignation today,\" Bush's spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, said in a statement on Tuesday. \"While Ethan has apologized for regrettable and insensitive comments, they do not reflect the views of Governor Bush or his organization and it is appropriate for him to step aside. We wish him the best.\"",
