  "content": "The Register has a veritable scoop: 121 Media - the company that metamorphosed into Phorm - and BT tried out their data-sniffing systems on 18,000 customers between October 23 and November 3 2006. The Register explains: Documents seen by The Register show that the companies used the secret profiles to target advertising at broadband customers when they visited certain popular websites. Phorm had purchased commercial space on these websites, although their URLs are not included in the documents. The groups targeted included people interested in finance (for an Egg credit card campaign), weight loss (a Weight Watchers campaign), and jobs (a Monster.com campaign). BT has confirmed the dates and the numbers in a statement: BT can confirm that a small scale technical test of a prototype advertising platform took place for two weeks during September - October 2006. The purpose of the test was to evaluate the functional and technical performance of the platform. It is important for BT to ensure that before any new technologies are deployed, they are robust and fit for purpose. No personally identifiable information was processed, stored or disclosed during this test. We have asked whether the 18,000 were at a single exchange, or location (say, London or Bristol) or geographically disparate; we're awaiting a response. The important question, which The Register raises, is: was this lawful? Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000, it is an offence to intercept internet traffic without a warrant or consent. Was there a warrant or consent here? Clearly not. The question then becomes whether this was \"interception\" in the legal definition. BT did not answer The Register on this point; we have re-asked. BT meanwhile still intends to move ahead with trials of the Phorm system later this month. \"Not today though,\" said the spokesman. \"And not tomorrow either.\" One final detail, for which we're also grateful to El Reg: at the time of this trial, Stratis Scleparis was chief technology officer at BT Retail, which provides its broadband service. Since January 2007, he's been group CTO at.. Phorm. How interesting..",
