  "content": "What a lovely welcome for Meg Hillier, the new shadow secretary of state for energy and climate change: a lovingly crafted fake Twitter account, and some hand-picked people to follow. The fun starts with a Twitpic posted yesterday, supposedly to help constituents reach a meeting. It rather cleverly appears to reveal more than was desired. Tab four on the fake screenshot of the browser reads: \"climate change\" - Google Search. But the real gag is on tab two: are polar bears real? Just to help cement the deception, the fake Hiller posted this an hour after the picture: \"oh gosh, I didn't quite mean to include everything that I did in that screen shot. How do I undo a tweet?\" The rest of the fake tweets were fun too. The day before the shadow cabinet election results were revealed, a tweet reveals alarm that no commenters on a Guardian article - Shadow cabinet: your pick - had volunteered Hillier's name: \"Hi everyone, can you help me out by commenting here? http://j.mp/dwpjtD Gosh I don't think anyone's mentioned me yet, oh dear!\" My favourites, following Hillier's actual election to the shadow cabinet are a 1.50am tweet: \"WOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" and the hungover, recession-baiting follow-up: \"Oh dear, had one too many glasses of champers last night I think!\" It's not quite up to the supreme level of the spoof BPGlobalPR account set up in the wake of the Gulf oil spill, but it has cheeky plausibility. As for the real Meg Hillier, she's not known to have had a deep interest in climate change. A former journalist (like climate secretary, Chris Huhne) and privately educated (like Huhne), she was elected for the first time in 2005 as MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, having been mayor of Islington and a member of the London assembly. Probably most useful for her new job among her interests are the work she has done on housing and transport (well, bus routes). In government, she spent a year working for Ruth Kelly at the Department of Communities and Local Government, then three as a Home Office minister juggling the identity card hot potato. We're inviting her to come on this site and answer your questions. I'm taking the first one: \"Why don't you have a Twitter account?\" What do you want to ask her?",
