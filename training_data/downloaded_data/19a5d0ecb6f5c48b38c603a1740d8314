Without data, no innovation, no prosperity. However, consumers' attitudes to privacy vary depending on the situation, the company involved and a range of other factors. New research from the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) and Acxiom, conducted by the Future Foundation sheds some light. When we first asked the Future Foundation to carry out this research in 2012, they identified three archetypes: Pragmatists \u2013 who consider what's worth sharing case-by-case. Fundamentalists \u2013 who are opposed to sharing online. Not concerned \u2013 who frankly don't care either way. Data sharing Today, slightly more people take a pragmatic view, the proportion increasing slightly, from 53% to 54% of the total. There are fewer fundamentalists, this proportion dropping from 31% to 24% while those not concerned grew from 16% to 22%. Clearly consumers are warming to the idea of data sharing. This can be seen in other ways. The proportion who expect to exchange information before buying something online has risen from 65% to 73% between 2012 and 2015. 55% are comfortable with the notion that free products are available in exchange for data. Importantly, just over half (51%) of consumers believe data sharing is \"important to the future success of the UK economy\", according to the research. But if businesses want that data, they need to remember a few important principles, then consumers will be better predisposed to sharing. Trust is the most important factor. When asked what would persuade a consumer to share information with a company, almost four in ten (38.9%) chose trust. That's almost four times the next most popular option, which was access to free products or services (10.1%). But ask consumers what works as a justification to share data, the top reasons are a good reason (62.1%); the type of information (59.2%), and how the information will be stored (53.1%). Consumers want good and clear reasons to share, but they also need to know that their information is safe and secure. Dealbreakers Consumers also think about dealbreakers that need to be satisfied if they are going to share any information. Four replies stand out: Benefits made explicit at the start \u2013 86%. Easy to read and understand terms and conditions \u2013 86%. A flexible privacy policy that gives consumers control \u2013 85%. The link between data shared and the benefits provided made clear \u2013 84%. It seems relatively simple: be clear, upfront and tell consumers what to expect. But it's perhaps this last area that businesses are least successful. 80% of respondents said businesses benefit the most in the exchange of data, compared to 7% who say it's the consumer, but for those aged 18-24 this rises to 20%. Younger people feel they benefit more from sharing data compared to the general population. But that's still a pretty large disparity. To make themselves more trusted, businesses should make clear what the benefits are to sharing information. What do consumers get out of it? The danger is that consumers may decide that brands are not worth sharing their data with. This would be a problem. But there are new possibilities on the horizon. If consumers are waking up to the idea that their data is worth something, couldn't that data be used to trade for better deals, money off or something else? The proportion that think this way has risen from 40% to 52% of the total since 2012. 80% agreed with the principle: \"My data is my property and I should be able to trade it if I like\". So there could even be real opportunities for new businesses to trade, or broker data on the consumers' behalf. 28% were interested in this idea. Clearly control of personal data is emerging as a significant trend. And it's another way to build trust in tandem with more pragmatic consumers. While consumer attitudes to privacy are complex, marketers responses are be simple. Be clear about why you need consumer data and be clear about what your customer will get back. And give the consumer control. These are good principles to stick to and will build trust, which is the most important factor of all if you want to succeed in using data and make it work for you. Privacy may be a complicated notion, but the responses are simple. Build trust and they will come.
