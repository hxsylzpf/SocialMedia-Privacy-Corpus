  "content": "\"I'd rather see The Wizard of Oz 20 times than this ersatz show once,\" said the Times. \"I enjoyed very little \u2026 the acting is, by and large, appalling,\" was the Independent's verdict. \"More like a piece of industrial product than something that genuinely touches the heart or mind,\" said the Guardian. When it opened in London in 2006, to judge by the reviews, the musical Wicked appeared to have been cursed. Yet five years on \u2013 it celebrates its anniversary on Tuesday \u2013 it is filling one of the biggest theatres in London and has taken more than \u00a3145m at the UK box office. It has outlasted all the other musicals that opened the same year, and at some point in the next couple of months its four millionth visitor will enter the green-tinged foyer of the Apollo theatre. \"I can only assume that for Americans it plays on all their nostalgic memories of The Wizard of Oz \u2013 [seeing it] is clearly a rite-of-passage in the same way that Rent was for their predecessors,\" said Michael Billington, the Guardian's theatre critic. \"But that still doesn't explain its mysterious popularity in Britain.\" The musical, which is based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel and first opened on Broadway in 2003, invents the origins of the Wicked Witch of the West in L Frank Baum's Wizard of Oz. One of the reasons for its success is \"this untold-story angle, which seemed to completely engage the public,\" said Michael McCabe, the executive producer of the British production. \"There is massive affection for The Wizard of Oz, but the notion that everything you've heard is not true fired imaginations.\" In Maguire's revisionist take, the Wicked Witch began life as a good, spirited green-skinned girl whose later evil can be explained by, among other things, suffering appalling prejudice and becoming a dissident of the Oz regime. The focus in this predominantly female production is on the friendship between Elphaba and the spoilt, shallow Glinda, who later becomes the Good Witch in Baum's stories. On a packed midweek night at the theatre, it is striking how many audience members are young women. Teenage Wicked fans \u2013 and there are many \u2013 are notorious for camping outside the theatre for tickets and turning up dressed as witches (though there are none tonight). It has elements that could not be more perfect for many teenage girls than if it had been focus-grouped: the trials of friendship, insecurity about appearance, and feeling like an outsider; makeovers, mean teachers and angst about crushes \u2013 and songs delivered with a definite X Factor-style shoutiness. Not that there aren't also weightier themes \u2013 racism, freedom of speech, the evil of dictatorial regimes \u2013 hulking under the surface. This is the first time Gabriela Mendelsohn, 19, has seen it, but was brought by a friend who had been before. \"I love the story about the friendship,\" she says. \"The effects and the costumes are amazing.\" Linda Fuentes, on holiday from San Antonio, Texas, has seen the production three times in the US. \"It's witty, I love the songs, the emotion of it.\" After the show Mariana Gualano, 28, from Brazil, waits at the stage door to get her programme signed. She has also seen Wicked three times and has \"lost count how many times I watch [clips of it] on YouTube. I love the story of the underdog. Elphaba is different \u2013 people misjudge her. I like that it's a story about friendship.\" The spectacular rise of Wicked would not have happened without the parallel rise of social networking. \"This extraordinary community has grown up around the show and they have been the drivers of its success,\" said McCabe. \"These passionate fans spread positive word of mouth in seconds, as opposed to the weeks and months it would normally need to travel.\" There are more than 600,000 members of the Broadway production's Facebook page, fans regularly talk about the show on forums and Twitter, run sites devoted to cast members and trade illicitly recorded video clips. There are Wicked fans around the world who have seen the show hundreds of times. Fonsaca Malyan-Brooker, 25, a teacher from Reading, has seen the production 30 times \u2013 11 of those since July \u2013 and has her ticket for Tuesday's anniversary show. She loves the story and the songs, but the Wicked community enhances her enjoyment. \"I've made friends on Twitter to go and see it with. When you're there, you see the same people and it's been great to get to know people.\" When she starts queueing at 5am to get a prized front-row day seat, she says, \"It's nice that there are other people in the line who are as excited about the show as you are.\" Why I Love Wicked Sophie Jean Lane, 15 I first saw Wicked on my 14th birthday with my mother and some friends. Kerry Ellis and Dianne Pilkington were playing Elphaba and Glinda and they were just as wonderful as I'd hoped. By the time I saw it, I already knew all the words off by heart, and on the car ride home, my friends and I amused ourselves by playing the Wicked album and singing along very loudly. My mother spent the entire journey rolling her eyes at us. The story is fantastic, and suprisingly easy to relate to \u2013 especially considering it's about two witches in the land of Oz. I think that is why Wicked is so loved. It takes a typical story \u2013 of a child who is mocked for being different, but who uses those differences to achieve success \u2013 only the play is set somewhere brilliant and magical, so it feels new and different and inspiring. The Wicked album on my iPod is what I listen to when I need to cheer up, and I make a point of listening to Defying Gravity before every exam \u2013 it is the most played song on my iTunes. Wicked will always be my favourite musical, and 18 months later, I love it just as much as when I saw it for the very first time.",
