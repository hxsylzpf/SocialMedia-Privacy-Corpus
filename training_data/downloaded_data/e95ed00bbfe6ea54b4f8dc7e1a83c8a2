  "content": "Hugh Tomlinson QC, the lawyer who has been at the centre of the debate about anonymised injunctions, has given a lengthy interview to The Lawyer magazine. It is interesting without being revelatory. After all, Tomlinson hasn't changed his mind since writing a brilliant piece for The Guardian a month ago in which he outlined his views on the media's hysteria over privacy. But he did make one or two points that merit attention. For example, he dismissed claims that editors have stoked up a controversy in order to \u00addistract from other legal problems facing their papers: \"I don't subscribe to the conspiracy theories that this has been drummed up by the press to distract from the phone-hacking affair. What's happened recently is that a set of coincidental factors have come together.\" So why have editors suddenly made such a public fuss, pushing at the political, rather than legal, level? \"There's no doubt that the print media's realised the value of political campaigning. It's much cheaper and more effective than fighting in the court.\" Tomlinson is scornful of the Liberal Democrat MP, John Hemming, who revealed the identity of one of his clients under the protection of \u00adparliamentary privilege: \"Parliamentarians shouldn't be discussing individual cases. It's perfectly proper to talk about the principles involved, but they shouldn't talk about individual cases.\" And he isn't too overjoyed by tweeters either: \"If the judges get it wrong, the court of appeal's there to put it right. If Twitter starts to become the court of appeal it would cause severe damage to the administration of justice.\" As for press self-regulation, Tomlinson points to a contradiction between what editors are obliged to do under their own code of practice - by offering a public interest justification for publication - and their failure to do so when faced with injunctions. The code states that \"everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and \u00adfamily life\", which is roughly in line with the human rights act (see article 8). Yet the newspapers, says Tomlinson, \"are consistently attacking the court on orders they haven't opposed.\" In other words, they are ignoring their own code by trying to publish and then ignoring it all over again when attacking judges for granting anonymised injunctions preventing such publication.
