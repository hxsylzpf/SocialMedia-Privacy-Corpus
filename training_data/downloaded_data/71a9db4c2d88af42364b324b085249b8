  "content": "Spike Lee has been criticised on Twitter after appearing to dismiss an open letter from a graphic designer who said his poster designs were \"stolen\" for the director's remake of cult thriller Oldboy. Juan Luis Garcia says his designs are currently being used to promote the film, which has just been released in the US, despite the fact that he has not been paid for his work or agreed to their use. In an open letter pleading with Lee to intervene, he said the unnamed agency involved made an \"insultingly low offer\" when it decided to use the designs, and continued to use them when he declined their offer. Lee's response was to label the letter a \"cheap trick\" from a person he had never had any dealings with. \"I Never Heard Of This Guy Juan Luis Garcia,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"If He Has A Beef It's Not With Me. \"I Did Not Hire Him, Do Not Know Him. Cheap Trick Writing To Me. YO\". The comments were largely pilloried online. Wrote @NevPierce: \"Or it might be the last resort of a desperate man? Could be BS, but surely worth a call or two, given it's your movie?\" Added @BudCollier: \"Yeah, ... too bad he thought you'd care about fellow artists being ripped off. What an idiot!\" @grillermo confided: \"Whether you wanted it or not, now you know and if you don't act you are as guilty as that scumbag of agency\" while @ashclark opined: \"As a big fan of your work - and an underpaid freelancer - just wanted to register my huge disappointment at your response here.\" UK blog Den of Geek also quoted Lee responding to a follower on Instagram who suggested he \"pay the guy\". Lee reportedly wrote: \"Why Should I Pay Someone Who I Never Met Nor Had Any Contact With Ever? He Never Made Any Deal With Me. Why Don't You Pay Me For Your Stupid Text On Thanksgiving Day?\" The Guardian was unable to track down the latter comment online, suggesting it may have been deleted.",
