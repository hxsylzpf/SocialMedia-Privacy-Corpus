She reported both his profile \u2013 which showed violent pornography, references to rape, photographs of women with their mouths being covered by men's hands and an image of the US news anchor Megyn Kelly's face Photoshopped onto that of a naked woman engaged in intercourse \u2013 and the specific threats he'd made to Twitter. \"Twitter got back to me and let me know they had contacted him and asked him to 'discontinue this behaviour',\" she says. \"This prompted more abuse \u2026 he knew who had reported him.\" The onus was on Moss, 42, to report him again if the behaviour continued, she says, which left her in the position of having to receive more abuse in order to stop it. She continued to receive messages from him, which she took screenshots of and saved as evidence in order to prove to Twitter \"what was obvious in the first place \u2013 he was using Twitter for abusive purposes, against its terms and conditions\". Eventually, after four days, his account was suspended. This was shortly after the introduction of Twitter's new reporting mechanisms, touted to be a big step forward in protection for its users, remembers Moss. She wrote to them to say: \"I hope you will agree that allowing a user to continue in this way makes a mockery of [your] rules and new complaint procedures.\" Though Moss has a public profile and a track record of speaking on feminist issues, her example is by no means unusual, as increased scrutiny of the problem of online abuse goes to show. As recently as in the past six months, the high-profile campaign against domestic violence spearheaded by Rosie Batty has expanded to include the abuse regularly experienced by women on the internet, by both known and unknown perpetrators. New data has helped to reveal the staggering extent of the problem in Australia. A study by the digital security firm Norton, released in March, found nearly half of women had experienced some form of abuse or harassment online and suggested that women felt that online abuse was a growing problem that they were powerless to act over. The rate was as high as 76% among adult women under 30, who were over-represented in every category of online abuse. But previously unreleased research, carried out by Norton and released exclusively to Guardian Australia, reveals about that same staggering rate (77%) across Australians of any gender aged between 18-29, compared with 50% across all age groups. The result was similar for the admittedly small pool of respondents aged under 30 who identified as either Asian, Pacific Islander, or Indigenous Australian. It suggests that, while there is no doubt that online abuse disproportionately affects women, it is an issue for young people and queer people as well. Though the number of homosexual, bisexual, transgender and intersex Australians surveyed was small, 70% had experienced online abuse, and an astonishing 95% of those aged under 30. Recent high-profile examples of activism have played a key role in putting the spotlight on online abuse. In early October, 25-year-old Zane Alchin of Sydney was charged with using a carriage service to menace after allegedly making rape threats on Facebook. Paloma Brierley Newton, who was the target of several of the alleged threats and first reported Alchin to her local police station, launched an advocacy group to lobby for more awareness and policing of online abuse; Alchin was charged shortly after her campaign began receiving media attention. The case will be heard in Sydney on 20 June and campaigners hope it will set a precedent for both legal and police responses to online abuse. The charge carries a maximum prison sentence of three years. At a court appearance last month, Alchin's legal representative indicated that the case for the defence would rest on not whether or not he had made the threats but whether the internet is a carriage service. Less than a decade ago, Australians were being charged with using fax machines to menace \u2013 which reveals both how far the technology has come and how little the law has changed to keep up. In New Zealand, the Harmful Digital Communications Act was passed last year to deter online abuse and cyberbullying \u2013 maximum penalties are two years' prison or a fine of NZ$50,000 (AU$45,000) \u2013 as well as to \"provide victims \u2026 with a quick and efficient means of redress\". Despite criticism the bill set a different standard for the content of speech online, risking impinging on freedom of speech, it passed with an overwhelming majority; in the wake of the Ashley Madison security breach two months later, the Privacy Commission said the law was passed \"for situations like this one\". A sense that the law is ill-equipped to handle abuse cases, online or offline, and an absence of legal options for redress has led to an uptick in \"digital vigilantism\" in Australia. A few months after Alchin was charged last year, columnist Clementine Ford shared a screenshot of a Sydney man's post on her Facebook page, calling her a \"slut\". She had 80,000 followers at the time; the man was fired from his job shortly afterwards. Though Ford, as a feminist activist, is a frequent target of particularly virulent abuse, she is by no means alone. A recent study by the Media Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance's Women in Media initiative found that 41% of women working in the Australian media had been harassed, bullied, or trolled online. Several said they had been silenced on social media, or even changed careers as a result. Dr Emma Jane, a former newspaper journalist now a senior lecturer in media studies and research fellow at the University of New South Wales, has interviewed close to 50 Australian women, including Ford, for her Cyberhate Project: a three-year, federal government-funded study that will culminate in an international symposium on what Jane terms \"e-bile\" in 2017. Her findings so far have suggested an \"absolute correlation\" between being a woman with an online profile and \"getting a bucketload of abuse\", as well as the failure of law enforcement to cope with it. Interviewees who had reported their experiences to police spoke of \"dreadful, just utterly inadequate responses\", Jane said. \"Almost all of them were advised to take a break from the internet. It's on a par with saying, 'just take a break from going outside your house for the next few months'.\" Jane said police forces not just in Australia but overseas seem to treat the internet as a place for recreation. \"There's this sense that it's an opt-in thing, like it's a PlayStation, and you can easily opt out of it if it's becoming problematic,\" she said. \"And that's just not the case.\" But, Jane warned, changes to processes, platforms and even legislation can only go so far to address something so embedded in broader culture. \"After all these decades of feminism, all this misogyny has just welled up again,\" she said. \"As soon as there was a place it could play out where there weren't consequences for the perpetrators, there's been this tsunami of fear and loathing and sexualised vitriol directed at women. \"It really makes me despair about how best to respond.\" The internet, Jane said, \"is the new frontier of the feminist battle\". \"It's really depressing, because it looks a lot like the old one.\" In the 1970s, feminists campaigned to have workplace harassment, domestic violence and rape treated as public crises, not private problems \u2013 the issue of online abuse is the same, Jane said, in that there is a sense that \"women need to sort it out themselves\". \"But it is a public crisis. There's a big feeling of deja vu for me. It's depressing, as a feminist, to see that these battles are still so far from being won.\"",
