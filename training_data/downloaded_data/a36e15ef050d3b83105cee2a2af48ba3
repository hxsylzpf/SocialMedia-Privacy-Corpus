  "content": "In the wake of protests in Ferguson, Missouri following both the killing of Michael Brown and the grand jury's refusal to indict the police officer who did it, and the killing of 12 year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio, and the appalling lack of charges in Eric Garner's homicide at the hands of a New York City police officer, many white people have been asking how, exactly, they can help. It's a vital question, and I get it: I want to help, too. I'm just not so sure #CrimingWhileWhite is the best way to do it. This latest viral hashtag started on Wednesday night after the Garner decision came down and, using it, white people have detailed crimes they've committed without much trouble (let alone violence) from authorities. The hashtag is meant to be a glimpse into the incredible world of white privilege, where you can shoplift and get away with it, dine and dash with impunity, tell a cop to fuck off or even have one drive you to the ATM for bail money on the way to jail. While these stories do highlight just how biased law enforcement in the US really can be, #CrimingWhileWhite has the unfortunate side effect of redirecting focus from the continued police violence against communities and people of color back to white people and their experiences. (Nate Silver's post-Ferguson \"burrito\" story, which was widely condemned as tone-deaf, is unfortunately typical of the genre.) White people acknowledging white privilege is important, but in the midst of national tragedies, tweeting about how you got away with criminal acts feel like a performance of awareness that you are privileged rather than what we really need \u2013 a dismantling of the power obtained through that privilege. White privilege and white supremacy are not news to people of color, so the primary audience for #CrimingWhileWhite tweets is really just other white people who are likely equally aware that they can, for instance, speed with near impunity. The intention may be to demonstrate to the unaware how ubiquitous white privilege is, but as Kara Brown wrote at Jezebel on Wednesday afternoon, \"intention is not the same as impact\". And as writer (and Guardian contributor) Stacia L Brown tweeted, \"Have these conversations ever converted a critical mass of people who didn't believe that [white people are treated better]?\" Brown continued in a series of tweets: \"What makes that upsetting for the black people who are involuntarily subjected to it is that, every day our lives are actively threatened by ideas that are strictly conceptual/passive for white people.\" Jamilah Lemieux, senior digital editor for Ebony.com (and a partner in the Guardian's post-Ferguson collaboration), offered a counter-hashtag on Thursday, #AliveWhileBlack, wherein black people could detail their experiences with racism and law enforcement. People shared stories on everything from watching parents get pulled over for driving a nice car to being blamed for sexual assault. Lemieux told me that while she thought #CrimingWhileWhite \"seemed well intentioned\", she created her hashtag because \"we need to focus on the brutality and harassment that black people face at the hands of police daily.\" And that's the rub: There are experiences and stories that matter more right now than how the cops let white people slide. There is a hierarchy of who should be listened to and read about the way race impacts lived experiences \u2013 and white people are on the bottom of that totem pole. For instance, what will get more attention on social media? Jon Stewart's rant about the lack of charges in Garner's death ... or the emotional response from Garner's widow, Esaw Garner, upon hearing that the cop who put her husband in that fatal chokehold would not face trial? Well-intentioned white people demonstrating that we know racism exists and how we benefit from it doesn't change the existence of racism or that we benefit from it. It doesn't end police brutality against people of color, it doesn't change racial profiling and it doesn't train anyone, including police officers, to see people of color as equally human. Public performances of guilt over your privilege doesn't stop racism from hurting people \u2013 but keeping the focus on changing the system that does ... well, that's a start.
