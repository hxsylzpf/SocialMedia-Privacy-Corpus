In an interview published today in Total Politics magazine, Pickles appeared relaxed about the fact that it is impossible to control everything generated through new media channels. Describing the use of technology in political campaigning as a \"two-edged sword\", he said: \"As sure as eggs are eggs, my campaign will probably be dominated by candidates saying something particularly stupid on Facebook or a YouTube video of them doing something silly.\" On the Tories' chances of winning office at the next general election, Pickles speculated that the party would be braced for a \"much more unpredictable outcome\" if Labour changes tack on spending. The government has sought to define the political divide as Labour investment or Tory cuts of up to 10% across a number of government departments, though some Labour ministers privately fear the battle lines could prevent the chancellor from making tough decisions on public spending later in the year. Pickles said the \"Tory 10%\" line was no longer believed outside the chamber or even within it. \"If the debate got on to Tory cuts versus Labour cuts, I think we then get into a much more unpredictable outcome. We might be able to have a sensible discussion, a real debate about the politics of priority against a realistic backdrop.\" Asked if the Tories were worried a shift by Labour could reduce their chances of winning at the polls, Pickles said: \"It has the advantage it would be on the basis of truth. I think we would be triumphant, but I don't think it would be predictable.\" Pickles described Brown as a \"one-trick pony\" who had disappointed expectations by failing to give \"some sense of direction\" after becoming prime minister. Pointing to Brown's decision not to call a snap election last autumn \"to give us an idea of where it was going\", Pickles added: \"I think he's stuck in a discotheque in 1992 and he wants to refight the election and the chorus goes 'here we go again, here we go again'.\" The MP for Brentwood and Ongar, who was appointed Tory chairman in January, said the parliamentary recess due to begin next week was time for the party to prepare for the poll. In a rallying message to Tory colleagues, he said: \"I would say the election is starting now and now is a time to work hard locally and to connect with the electorate. By all means take a break but be ready because we could have an autumn election.\"",
