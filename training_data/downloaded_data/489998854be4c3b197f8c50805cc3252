  "content": "The president may have come out swinging in the second presidential debate Tuesday, but on the web another pugilist is still dominating the week. Perhaps you are one of the millions who've watched the grainy video of a Cleveland bus driver who coldcocked an unruly passenger, delivering a brutal uppercut to the jaw that sent her tumbling out of the vehicle. Or perhaps you've watched one of the many spoofs, or the slow-motion replays, or the fan edits in which the bus driver's fist of fury is accompanied by Batman-style \"Pow!\" effects or the theme song from the video game Mortal Kombat. This grim video is everywhere, from USA Today to national and international news broadcasts. The airheads of the View, exhibiting a degree of inanity exceptional even for them, got in on the act Monday: one observed that the driver may have been set off by fears of contracting the flu (the passenger had spit on him), while another opined that Ben Kingsley's performance in Gandhi had inspired her to follow the path of nonviolence. But the original publisher of this brutal video is none other than World Star Hip-hop, one of the most depressing outlets in an already bleak constellation of gory shock sites, third-rate mixtape feeds and desperate content aggregators. If you're not yet familiar with World Star, you're one of the few. In the past year, its videos of rappers, strippers and, especially, street fights \u2013 all screened in a Ram-hogging proprietary format, on a site whose design would have looked dated during the Clinton administration \u2013 have won a million or so pageviews a day: about the same as Gawker, or double the traffic to the soon-to-be-exclusively-digital Newsweek. Major stars like Nas and P Diddy now leak their material to World Star, while those desperate to break into music stardom pay a grand or so \u2013 sometimes via Paypal, sometimes in cash \u2013 to have their (usually terrible) videos promoted. And there is also World Star Candy, a soft-core porn site: one recent submission featured a scantily clad woman who had written \"WORLD STAR\" down her thighs. But the bread and butter of World Star is violence, and by the site's standards, the bus driver uppercut video is relatively tame. From the past few days' contributions alone I have watched a man get attacked by a pack of dogs, a group of friends beat up a rival after homophobic taunts, a police officer brutalize a man in a wheelchair, and a teenager in a parking lot tackle another like a pro wrestler. And this is a tame week: at least no one got killed or maimed, unlike recently, when World Star featured a toddler getting hit by a car. Almost always, when the first punch lands or hair gets pulled, World Star's URL coasts across the screen, sometimes in three or four instances. Even USA Today, reproducing the bus driver uppercut, left the World Star logo on. Perhaps you remember the full-frontal photograph of Chris Brown, which they published with over a dozen World Star watermarks? They might not know how to design a website, but they sure know about branding. The proprietor of this funhouse is a New Yorker named Lee O'Denat, though he prefers to be known only by the initial \"Q\". To hear him tell it, World Star is a public service; he likes to call his site \"the CNN of the ghetto\". That line is shamelessly cribbed from Chuck D of Public Enemy, but then again, Q exhibits a permissive approach to reproducing others' material that would make even Arianna Huffington balk. The site likes to reproduce local news broadcasts featuring murder or arson, viral comedy videos or sports highlights \u2013 but it sucks them into its awful proprietary video player, with no link and no credit. And once you're on World Star, you play by World Star's rules. In an interview last year, Q explained that he took down a popular video of a naked girl performing a Nicki Minaj song after she phoned him in hysterics. She hadn't submitted the video herself; she'd sent it to someone, and the third party uploaded it without her permission. Her parents had disowned her, she explained; she'd been kicked her out of her house. Q agreed to remove the video \u2013 but only if she gave him $500 in hush money. World Star isn't pretty, no doubt, and black critics in particular have castigated the site for its perpetuation of stereotypes, exploitation of women and indifference to cruelty, and even murder. But it's not news to anyone who's seen Jerry Springer or the Saw movies that there's money to be made from violence, especially in its most pointless forms. It's not the beatdowns themselves that make World Star so disturbing; it's how they get there. We are all videographers now, and bystanders now do the work of media outlets, and for free. There was no thought on that Cleveland bus of stopping the altercation; people were too busy filming! (Indeed, it turns out there were multiple cameraphone-wielding passengers on the bus that day; after the first video went viral, a different angle was uploaded to another site \u2013 and then swiftly stolen by World Star.) Not long ago, the knock against modern urban life was that it isolated people, and that in the face of violence we turned away. How things have changed: today we don't only pay attention to violence, but we offer it up, gratis, to anyone who wants to make a buck off of it. New media titans, from the Huffington Post to Facebook, have been built on less. World Star is maturing from a bottom-feeder into a brand \u2013 and the proof is that everyone near a cameraphone knows, even before the brawls have ended, where the footage will end up. Just today, a new video appeared featuring a disheveled, seemingly mentally disabled man on the New York subway screaming obscenities before getting punched in the face. As he lies on the floor, you hear the bystanders cackle \u2013 and one voice offscreen shouts, \"It's over! World Star!\"",
