  "content": "The Leveson inquiry into press standards helped drive the number of defamation cases against British newspapers and broadcasters to a five-year low in the 12 months to May 2012, according to a leading legal publisher. Research by Sweet &amp; Maxwell showed a 36% year-on-year drop in the number of reported defamation cases against newspapers and broadcasters to 27: a trend they partly attributed to a more cautious approach by editors during Lord Justice Leveson's public inquiry into the ethics and practices of the media. \"Public scrutiny following the eruption of the phone-hacking scandal is leading to a lower appetite for risk for some media outlets,\" said Korieh Duodu, a partner at specialist media law firm David Price Solicitors and Advocates. The number of reported defamation cases against all publishers, including online blogs and websites, fell 15%, year on year, to 71 in the year to May. Sweet &amp; Maxwell said that the number of defamation cases involving celebrities was down to seven this year, including Morrissey's settled action against NME and Charlotte Church's payout from the People. The Thomson Reuters-owned publisher said that the fall in defamation cases is also partly down to a change in tactics by prominent figures, who have used privacy injunctions to prevent potentially damaging stories seeing the light of day. \"The use of privacy law by celebrities and other high-profile individuals has certainly increased over the last few years, with individuals using these new legal threats to try and stamp out negative stories before they arise,\" Duodu added. In December last year, Sweet &amp; Maxwell reported that there had been 50 privacy cases launched in the 12 months to May 2011, compared with 43 in the same period the previous year. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
