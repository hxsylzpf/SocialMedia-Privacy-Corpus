Quite possibly a lot more than on news sites and with printed papers, even the free ones. But what if all you had were the social networks? What would you find out about the world if you had no access to anything else? Five French-speaking journalists, led by Radio Canada's Janic Tremblay \u2013 have just tried that, holing themselves up in a farmhouse in France and forcing themselves to abstain from the news habit. For more details on the idea behind the experiment, see this article from the Toronto Star. As for their conclusions, they weren't very clear when Tremblay spoke to BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning. By his own admission, it's too early to draw conclusions. But he did note the power of Twitter to make information instantly available, citing the example of a man arrested in Russia who was able to brief the journalists from the police station using his smartphone. Conversely, social networks react so swiftly to rumour that they can generate a huge amount of uncorroborated speculation \u2013 something Tremblay found \"dangerous\". He gave as an example an \"explosion\" in the French city of Lille that prompted 5,000 people to join a Facebook group, only for it to turn out the following day to be nothing more sinister than an aeroplane breaking the sound barrier. Quite what any of this proves was left unspecified \u2013 but Tremblay suggested that when you are drowning in web chatter, old media still plays a crucial role. \"The intensity of the web surveillance was absolutely crazy, to have a little bit of information,\" he said. \"And this is what makes media still, I think, a good news source because they're so practical.\"",
