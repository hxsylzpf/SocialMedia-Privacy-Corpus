The biopic will give an insight into the inner workings of the site, as well as exploring the behind-the-scenes drama. Timberlake will play the role of Sean Parker, who was Facebook's original president and the co-founder of filesharing site Napster. Production is due to start in October, with David Fincher, the man behind Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, set to direct. West Wing writer Aaron Sorkin has penned the script. Rumours have been circulating for many months as to who will play the film's lead characters. Although not confirmed, Adventureland star Jesse Eisenberg is the favourite to play Zuckerberg, with Shia LaBeouf and Michael Cera also rumoured to take starring roles. The project will be Timberlake's highest-profile acting role yet. He has previously appeared in Alpha Dog alongside Bruce Willis and Black Snake Moan with Christina Ricci, and will voice a character in the forthcoming animation, Shrek Forever After, to be released next year.",
