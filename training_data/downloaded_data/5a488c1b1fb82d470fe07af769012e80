  "content": "Rupert Murdoch has issued an apology, after suggesting on Twitter that Barack Obama was not a \"real black president\". Murdoch sent a tweet on Wednesday night praising the Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson and his wife and jabbing at the current president \u2013 although not by name. The tweet met with a remarkable stream of ridicule and invective. Carson traces his ancestry to slaves in Harris County, Georgia. Obama's parents were a black Kenyan and a white Kansan. Murdoch, a white man born in Australia with a primary residence in the UK who is a naturalized American citizen, sent his apology about 11 hours after the first tweet: Charming \u2013 but black? Murdoch could not be reached for comment. The mogul has in the past had to apologize on Twitter for tweets about American politics. In July 2012 he tweeted that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's staff was not up to snuff: A couple of hours later he followed up with this: Turned out he was right about Romney.",
