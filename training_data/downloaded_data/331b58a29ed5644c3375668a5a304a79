  "content": "Shonda Rhimes, the influential TV executive and writer behind Grey's Anatomy and Scandal, has spoken out about a leaked email exchange between Sony Pictures executives, calling their comments \"racist\". The emails, leaked as part of an attack on Sony Pictures by hackers possibly linked with North Korea, are between Amy Pascal and Scott Rudin, and feature jokes about whether President Obama's favourite movies would include Django Unchained, Lee Daniels' The Butler, or 12 Years A Slave. Pascal and Rudin both apologised Thursday for the content of the emails. Pascal said that the exchange was \"insensitive and inappropriate\" but also \"not an accurate reflection of who I am\". \"Although this was a private communication that was stolen,\" she said, \"I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologise to everyone who was offended.\" \"Calling Sony comments 'racially insensitive remarks' instead of 'racist'?\" Rhimes tweeted Thursday evening. \"U can put a cherry on a pile of sh*t but it don't make it a sundae.\" Comedian Kevin Hart, who is referred to as a \"whore\" in another email exchange between Sony executive Clint Culpepper and Pascal, also spoke out. \"I worked very hard to get where I am today,\" Hart wrote in a post on Instagram. \"I look at myself as a brand and because of that I will never allow myself to be taking advantage of [sic].\" \"I PROTECT MY BRAND,\" Hart, who is starring in an upcoming Sony movie called The Wedding Ringer, wrote. \"Which is why I'm able to brush ignorance off my shoulder and continue to move forward. I refuse to be broken people.\" The Rev Al Sharpton also added his voice to the criticism, comparing Amy Pascal to Donald Sterling, the disgraced former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers.",
