The rest of the time he is a party sales representative, organising gatherings to promote the locally sourced jams and cooking utensils he distributes. \"My customers and I get together for a cup of tea before getting down to business. It's more fun with just girls,\" he says with a laugh. In a trade in which women account for 85% of the vendors, a man comes as a bit of a surprise. This kind of sales technique caught on with Tupperware, and many associate it with housewives aged over 50. Goupil, on the other hand, is one of a new, younger generation of sales reps, which consists of more men and makes much greater use of new technology. In his search for custom he doesn't just rely on word of mouth, but uses everything the internet can offer. In particular, he belongs to Seedbees \u2013 a French social network for brand ambassadors. The Seedbees site, which went live almost a year ago, aims to brighten up the trade's slightly cranky image. The idea is for a sort of Facebook for party sales \u2013 a platform that brings together sellers, brands and buyers. \"On the site you can chat with friends and find out about new products, but you can also check out future meetings near home, or indeed apply for work as a rep,\" says Bertrand Legrand, co-founder of Seedbees. So, using the zest of social networking, party sales are beginning a new chapter. This approach \u2013 midway between a web community and a gathering of friends \u2013 is attracting a new audience: young people who are looking for new ways of buying and for whom the social side is an additional asset. \"By linking up with party sales, virtual social networks can turn into real social networks,\" says Legrand. The under-25s account for one in five of Seedbees recruits. It seems to be going well. The site claims to have 12,000 members, and about 60 brands have already registered. For brands, it is a way of enhancing visibility and marketing their wares at lower cost, thanks to brand ambassadors. \"The site enables us to share the cost of our sales force,\" says Gilles Auberger, a partner at Denovo Design, France, one of the firms involved in the Seedbees initiative. Sales reps who are registered with the site can work for several distributors, a system that allows Goupil to earn \"between \u20ac500 [$650] and \u20ac2,500 a month\". Seedbees' success isn't unusual. The party sales sector is expected to report record earnings this year of around \u20ac4bn, up 4% on last year, according to market analyst Xerfi. The number of self-employed ambassadors increased by a third between 2009 and 2011, to reach 300,000 \u2013 an indication of how dynamic the business is and perhaps how deep the employment crisis is. It offers a solid argument against those who claimed that e\u2011commerce had sidelined such marketing techniques. Tired of anonymous superstores and virtual vendors, consumers are switching increasingly to sources closer to home. \"There's a social side to party sales you don't get in shops,\" says Goupil. Taking their cue from Seedbees, other sites such as unjourunevente.com (a sale a day) or verygoodmoment.com are blending social networking with party sales. With online sales pulling the rug from under their feet, the big players are also updating their business model. For example, the cosmetics firm Avon \u2013 which has specialised in direct sales for years \u2013 is now well represented on social networks and encourages its ambassadors to promote their products in forums and blogs. To this end, it has developed a widget to facilitate broadcasting of brand news. As for Tupperware itself, it still seems a little uncomfortable on the net but plans to set up a Facebook page this year\u2013 in the hope of giving its homeware a new lease of life.",
