  "content": "Jerry Hall's former boyfriend Tim Attias is considering taking legal action against the Daily Mail over an article that claims to reveal intimate details about their break-up. The feature in the Mail's women's pages, Femail, includes the allegation that Mr Attias was not prepared for Ms Hall and her former husband Mick Jagger to maintain a close relationship, even for the sake of their children. \"Tim Attias is very annoyed by it and disputes its validity,\" said a source. It is understood Mr Attias is this week meeting with lawyers from Schillings to decide on his next step. In August Ms Hall's agent, Jonathan Phang, lambasted Hello! over a feature about Ms Hall and Mr Attias he said was compiled entirely from the magazine's cuttings library and quotes from her \"friends\".",
