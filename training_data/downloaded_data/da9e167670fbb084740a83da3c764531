  "content": "In a world that has specific dating sites for farmers, World of Warcraft players and Ayn Rand fans, it was inevitable that internet users would one day have the capability to play matchmaker for the person who taught them about the birds and the bees. And with the launch of My Lovely Parent on Friday, that day has arrived. This new site lets adult children in seven countries set up their lovely parents, step-parents, aunts, uncles or older acquaintances on dates using the internet. Site founder Matt Connolly sees the platform as a way for the older crowd to find companionship, especially those who may not be comfortable making dates online or at their age. \"One of the roles, a really vital role the child has, is saying digital can help you meet new people, websites are good\", Connolly told the Guardian. Connolly, 35, decided to create the website when his own lovely mum asked him to help her find her \"knight in shining armor\". He had been looking for an idea to start an online business, and his mother's request was an idea he couldn't ignore. Marketing data wouldn't let him ignore it either. Connolly said that in the UK, the over-55 crowd is the fastest growing group entering the digital dating world. And in the UK, more than 5.8 million adults over age 45 live alone \u2013 in the US, more than 20 million adults over age 50 live alone. Connolly doesn't like other online dating sites but created My Lovely Parent to let older adults know it's okay to make connections via the web by having the people they raised assist them. It starts with the adult child registering their parent for the site. Then the child can peruse the offerings to find matches for their parents while they wait to see if their parents accept the invitation to the site. \"So I can have a look at all the handsome chaps who live nearby who are into dog-walking and have great big beards, whatever it is, and if I see somebody lovely, I am able to then view his profile and recommend him to my mum,\" Connolly said. If the parent is ready for some online love matches, they can select how much, or how little, they want their kids on board. Dear old mum or dad can choose whether they want their kids to be alerted when the parent receives a private message or favorites potential suitors. For the more vindictive offspring, there is little room to attain revenge through an intentionally malicious matchup. Connolly explained that it would basically work the same as if you tried to sabotage a parents date in real life, with them being able to decide whether or not to trust your pick. As for Connolly's dear old mum? \"All I can say, is I'm going to be putting her on there straightaway, and whether she decides to carry on that journey \u2013 let's hope she does, cause I think it's going to be a great place \u2013 but that falls down to her.\"",
