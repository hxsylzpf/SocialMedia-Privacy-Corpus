  "content": "He may be the most flush 18-year-old on the planet, but Justin Bieber faces being sued for \"megabucks\" over an online prank that spectacularly backfired, according to the Daily Star. Bieber teased his army of Twitter fans by posting a false phone number followed by the message \"Call me now\". Sadly, the phone number turned out to be incomplete, leading fans to guess the number. This led them to call a couple from Texas, who now plan to sue Bieber for inciting harassment. And what do the pair want as compensation? Tickets to see the singing sensation in concert.",
