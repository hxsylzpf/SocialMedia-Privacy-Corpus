  "content": "This week the Viral Video Chart takes a look at digital technology. In 1974 Arthur C Clarke, standing in a computer bunker, told a stunned kid on Australian television that when he was as old as the presenter \u2013 which would be the year 2001 \u2013 he would have compact version of one of those computers. He predicted he would be able to use it to get all the information he needed: bank statements, theatre reservations. The presenter worried what it would mean in social terms. \"It would mean people would we able to live anywhere on earth [and do their jobs],\" replied Clark. Aah, those crazy pipe dreams ... On to the present. Did you know Twitter is now seven years old? It seems like it was only yesterday we were trying to figure out where you could find the hashtag on a keyboard. To celebrate, Twitter has made one of those feelgood videos illustrating what an important part it has played in world history. Cue the plane that crashed into the Hudson River in New York, Tahrir Square, the Japanese earthquake and tsunami ... you get the picture. If you think dating will be awkward once people start wearing Google Glass, being able to secretly record you all through the evening (or check their Twitter feed while simultaneously trying to look interested) \u2013 this little peek into the future makes that notion seem romantic. Sure, it would be tempting to have a virtual wingman coaching you along, but it can go terribly wrong, as this video illustrates. 1. Celebrating #Twitter7 It's quite tweet 2. Arthur C.
