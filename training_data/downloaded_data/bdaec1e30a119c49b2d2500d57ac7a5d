  "content": "Lord Howell's ill-advised opinion that it would be best if fracking took place in the \"uninhabited and desolate areas\" of the north-east has earned him a front page rebuff in the Newcastle Journal. Picking up on the fact that Howell also happens to be father-in-law of the Tory chancellor, George Osborne, the paper's front page today asks: \"What on earth is your father-in-law talking about George?\" The headline is overprinted on a montage of pictures of rural splendour in Northumberland - Hadrian's Wall, the Kielder Reservoir, Bamburgh Castle and the village of Alnmouth. Inside, the paper carries of page of criticisms of Howell, including a series of tweets. Editor Brian Aitken tells me #desolate was trending soon after the former Tory minister sat down. The main piece reports how Howell was forced to make a public apology for his gaffe. The critics included the Archbishop of Canterbury - and former bishop of Durham - Justin Welby who took to Twitter to defend the region as \"beautiful, rugged and inspiring\". The piece also mentions that the former leader of Newcastle city council, Labour peer Lord Beecham, was in the Lords to hear Howell's comments. Beecham is quoted as saying: \"Neville Chamberlain spoke of pre-war Czechoslovakia as 'a far away country of which we know nothing'. Lord Howell clearly has a similar view on the north-east and his comments once again highlight the Tories problem with the north.\" Aware of the political damage, the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Berwick-upon-Tweed, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said she \"firmly disagreed\" with Howell's characterisation of the region. \"I am appalled by the implication of Lord Howells's comments that the north-east has a disposable landscape value,\" she said. And David Skelton, director of an independent campaign group aimed at broadening the Tory appeal, Renewal, said: \"As a proud north-easterner, I know that such a description isn't even close to the truth. \"I'd be delighted to give Lord Howell a tour of the north-east to show him that it's far from desolate and is, in fact, one of the gems of the nation.\" The paper also quotes the Northumberland county council leader, Grant Davey, who could not resist a sarcastic dig at the noble lord. \"We must thank our lucky stars that he's resigned from his role in the foreign office, where his diplomatic skills will be sorely missed.\" One of the best tweets quoted in the Journal came from @Rich_Penny: \"Lord Howell says the north east is 'empty, desolate and full of gas'. Is this not a better description of Lord Howell?\" Ouch.",
