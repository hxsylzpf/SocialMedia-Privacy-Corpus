  "content": "The Marquesa de Varela, the Uruguyan fixer who has secured Hello! many of its royal scoops, came close to tears in the witness box today as she described how she was persuaded to lie to save the celebrity magazine's Catherine Zeta Jones wedding edition. She told high court judge Mr Justice Lindsay that Hello!'s managing director, Javier Riera, had asked her to sign untrue statements later used to lift injunctions barring the sale of the magazine. \"I was very upset and very nervous about the whole idea,\" the marquesa told the court. \"But when the magazine you have worked for for 20 years asks you to do something, it is very difficult to say I can't do it.\" The marquesa said she now believed Mr Riera had an ulterior motive in getting her to sign the statement - he had been trying to get rid of her as a contributor to Hello!. She was being cross-examined by Michael Tugendhat QC, who represents rival magazine OK!. Hello! is being sued for \u00a31.75m by OK! because of the alleged damage caused when a paparazzo photographer gatecrashed Ms Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas' wedding in New York in November 2000. The photographer, Rupert Thorpe, son of former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe, and his associates, including well-known Californian paparazzo Philip Ramey, sold pictures to Hello! in defiance of a \u00a31m exclusive deal the couple had struck with OK!. The Hollywood couple is also seeking \u00a3500,000 damages for breach of confidence and privacy. The marquesa said she had tried desperately to contact Mr Riera to try to find out why he wanted her to make untrue statements but he did not respond. \"I have never been able to get on with this man. He was really after me from the beginning, arguing on the telephone and criticising me even when I negotiated good deals for Hello!. \"I think that deep down it was not just to lift the injunctions that he did this to me. It was something that he had been planning for a long time. I think he was trying to get rid of me,\" the marquesa said. Her voice cracking up, she said: \"I never wanted to get into this. After my divorce I wanted a quiet life.\" The marquesa and her company, Neneta Overseas Ltd, are two of the defendants in the action brought by OK!, Ms Zeta Jones and Mr Douglas. She has admitted signing a false witness statement to the court of appeal, which said that she, and not Hello!, ordered the paparazzi pictures. Mr Tugendhat said that if someone asked you to sign a false document, the first reaction would be to say you could not do it. The marquesa said she left her office in London early when she saw the fax sent by Hello!'s Spanish sister publication, Hola!, for her to sign. \"I wanted to get rid of the problem but then I had phone calls the next day saying I only had a few minutes to sign it before it had to go to court. I could not get out of it.\"",
