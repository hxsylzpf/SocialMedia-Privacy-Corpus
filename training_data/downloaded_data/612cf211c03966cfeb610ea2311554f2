  "content": "Any hopes Prince Charles and his advisers had of curtailing media scrutiny were in disarray last night, following a second day of high court hearings into his claim that the Mail on Sunday breached his confidence and infringed his copyright by printing his private thoughts about the British handover of Hong Kong. As his entire nine-year-old report about the visit was handed over to the rest of the media, questions were already being raised about the wisdom of Clarence House's relentless pursuit of the newspaper which has turned a one-day story three months ago into what may become long drawn-out litigation. Prince Charles is seeking a summary judgment, during what will now stretch to a three-day hearing, in the hope of heading off a full jury trial including the calling of witnesses. But even the heir to the throne does not take on Associated Newspapers and its lawyers with impunity - or immunity. They are arguing that a full trial is needed. The day's hearing produced the 3,000 word journal, detailing the prince's candid thoughts on having to travel Club Class, his ruminations on the geriatric Chinese leadership and his sorrow at the imminent loss of the Royal Yacht Britannia. To add insult to injury there was also, in passing, a reference to his personal authorisation in September 2002 of a leak to the Daily Mail - the Mail on Sunday's sister paper - of a letter he had written to the then lord chancellor Lord Irvine, bemoaning the spreading culture of excessive litigation. The prince is, Associated Newspaper's counsel Mark Warby QC informed the court with imperceptible irony, \"a figure of genuine literary stature\". Copies of the work, said to have been written by the prince on the lengthy journey home from China in July 1997, were handed to journalists by the newspaper's lawyers on the basis that they were not to be reproduced in full or removed from the building. The Great Chinese Takeaway, as the report is called, starts with a whinge about being forced to travel Club Class on an outward bound British Airways jet because government ministers such as then foreign secretary Robin Cook and dignitaries including Edward Heath, Douglas Hurd and Paddy Ashdown had bagged all the first class seats. \"It took me some time to realise that this was not first class (!) although it puzzled me as to why the seat seemed so uncomfortable. Such is the end of Empire, I sighed to myself.\" Sadness On arrival in Hong Kong, the prince was taken to the Royal Yacht Britannia, shortly to be decommissioned as a cost-saving measure. \"[The ship] was tied up alongside the old naval base and near to the Prince of Wales building I must have opened in the 1980s (goodness only knows what the Chinese will have renamed it by now). As usual it was wonderful to step into the familiar atmosphere but this time tinged with an overwhelming sadness at the thought that this was going to be the last time of doing so on an overseas visit. Every moment seemed precious, to be held as a lifelong memory of what it used to be like and of how incredibly well Britain could be represented and marketed overseas.\" He records Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, invited aboard for a breakfast of home-made Danish pastries, asking of the ship's disposal. \"Why is this happening?\" she said. Robin Cook, too, described the vessel as \"a world negotiating advantage\" but only after \"I had invited him and his wife to stay the night on board,\" says the prince. Charles also described a meeting with the Tony Blair, then in office for less than two months. \"He is a most enjoyable person to talk to - perhaps partly due to his being younger than me! - he also gives the impression of listening to what one says which I found astounding.\" Curiously, the Mail on Sunday omitted this reference from its report, though it assiduously recorded other, critical, remarks about the prime minister. The prince says he told the prime minister: \"Introspection, cynicism and criticism seem to be the order of the day and clearly he recognised the need to find ways of overcoming the apathy and loss of self-belief, to find a fresh national direction. I said I thought the best way was to concentrate on the things we do best as a nation.\" He turned positively Eeyore-ish when drenched in rain during the handover ceremony: \"Just as I had thought and as if on cue the rain came lashing down and I found myself standing at the lectern and trying to make sense of my speech which by now had become a soggy mess of paper pulp and each page stuck together. \"Never before have I been called upon to make a speech underwater ... as it transpired no one could hear anything I said because of the noise of the rain on the umbrellas. The things one thinks one is doing for England!\" As reported by the Mail on Sunday, the prince did indeed find the Chinese leadership a bunch of waxworks and regarded the ceremony as \"an awful Soviet-style display\" with goose-stepping soldiers and \"the ultimate horror\" an artificial breeze, created to make the flags flutter. Geoffrey Howe and Edward Heath however came in for almost as much criticism as the Chinese leaders: \"It would seem that long ago they had succumbed to the sinologists' line that that it was far better to kow tow.\" Consoled The prince left Hong Kong with spirits lifting: \"I stood on deck gazing at the departing skyline of Hong Kong and telling myself that perhaps it is good for the soul to have to say goodbye to that and the dear yacht in the same year. Perhaps.\" He was consoled by a steam-past by the ships of the Royal Navy's fleet in the Pacific. \"The American navy could not have carried out a manoeuvre like it. It takes 300 years of hard-won experience to do it so the Chinese must have been mystified by what was going on.\" The newspaper's purpose in publishing the prince's journal, which had been circulated only to a few friends, Mr Warby said, was to enable public to understand his views and it was justified in doing so. \"They are not 'what I did on my holidays',\" he said. The barrister said the prince had authorised an official - apparently deputy private secretary Mark Bolland - to leak the prince's views on the litigation culture to the Daily Mail in 2002. \"It was done with the Prince of Wales's knowledge - it is somewhat ironic,\" he said. \"We are not critical of the prince over this conduct but the price of political activism is transparency. You cannot have it both ways.\" The case is due to finish today.",
