  "content": "They don't want me talking,\" Bill Cosby finally said over the weekend. \"You do that you have to go in with a neutral mind.\" But we are never neutral with our idols, because we give them our faith. Here was the man who brought us Doctor Cliff Huxtable \u2013 and with him a new vision of the black nuclear family and the middle class. For years, it had been whispered about: \"Cliff Huxtable drugs and assaults women\". But this year was the year of the fallen idol, when the whispers became shouts and we were forced to confront how sometimes, we place too much faith in the wrong people \u2013 how sometimes, we don't want to be talking amongst ourselves but we must. Of course, famous people fall from public grace every year. There have been celebrity scandals for as long as there have been celebrities, because nobody is perfect and one of the prices of fame is the constant threat of exposure. You could blame it on TMZ and glossy gossip rags. You could point to the rise of social media \u2013 there should be a keyboard shortcut for the phrase \"amplified by social media\" \u2013 or you could blame it on terrible people doing terrible things and having those terrible things come to light one way or another. But 2014 \u2013 from athletes in elevators and Hollywood executives in emails to \"alleged\" sexual predators and, yes, even fallen young men in the streets \u2013 was not about public figures falling from grace so much as we, the public, lowering our pedestals and staring our idols in the face. This year, we could no longer look away. This year, we could not allow ourselves that luxury. There is a statistic in this month's Harper's Index \u2013 that bastion of frank, impossible-to-ignore data points that have always been timeless: Number of times NFL players have been arrested for domestic violence since 2000: 90. Athletes, perhaps more than any other brand of celebrity, are held up as intrinsic heroes. We tend to look the other way when these heroic athletes are accused of domestic violence or other crimes because we want to believe in our heroes and, of course, because the game must go on. We also do this with actors, comedians and musicians, because we are wiling to accept the \"bad boy\" persona as part of the act. We appreciate those for whom redemption is ever possible. But knocking out your fianc\u00e9e in an elevator \u2013 cold-cocking your soon-to-be-wife \u2013 that is no game, no act, and it is completely unacceptable. Ray Rice was initially suspended for two games, and it was one of those slaps on the wrist to which we have become accustomed \u2013 indeed, it was the same punishment Adrian Peterson now claims he was \"promised\" by the NFL for leaving his young son \"bloodied and bruised\". But then came the public outcry, prompted by video and pictures of the undeniable. Public outrage forced longer suspensions and demanded more severe punishments for blatant wrongdoing. Public outrage pushed these athletes off their pedestals and forced them to face the public as men. These were small measures of public justice that will, hopefully, become more commonplace. Such small measures will not, however, resurrect Reeva Steenkamp \u2013 killed by Olympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner. Though he was not convicted of premeditated murder, Pistorius was found guilty this year of culpable homicide and reckless endangerment. A charge of reckless endangerment for Oscar Pistorius should be a reminder that we, too, can be reckless when we so blindly place our faith in our idols. Our recklessness can have very real consequences. The year 2014 was a year when unarmed black men were killed by police officers. The same could be said for every year. Tamir Rice. Akai Gurley. Eric Garner. Michael Brown. John Crawford. Ezell Ford. Dante Parker. We know these names. Their lives are mourned by mothers and fathers, wives and girlfriends, children and other loved ones while police officers continue to see black men and women as criminals, as demons, as dangerous. Law enforcement \u2013 those who have been tasked to serve and protect \u2013 has failed us all, but especially those of us with black or brown skin. They have acted with impunity and the justice system has only reinforced that impunity time and again as grand juries have declined to indict the police officers who kill unarmed black Americans. This was the year we did something with our rage. We protested. We marched. We stood behind the families of these fallen men and said, \"Your loss will not be forgotten.\" There is a character on the television show Seventh Heaven named Eric Camden, a Protestant minister who was spiritual but relatable in his fallibility. Each episode offered a tale of everyday morality while chronicling the growing pains a sprawling family. In real life, the man who plays Eric Camden, Stephen Collins, is reportedly an admitted child molester who is avoiding prosecution, largely because the statute of limitations has expired. As his lawyers deny the many allegations, Bill Cosby, too, seems free to live out the rest of his life in coddled luxury, enabled by the same people who stood by silently while he allegedly committed acts of serial rape over decades. But the statute of limitations on silence, too, has expired. Because 2014 was the year we stopped worshipping at the altar of monsters. It was the year when we saw predators for who they really are, even if justice eludes them. The Canadian radio host Jian Ghomeshi tried to get ahead of claims that he is a sexual predator by claiming he was a participant in consensual BDSM relationships. That claim was quickly dismantled, as more and more women came forward. Ghomeshi has since been charged with four counts of sexual assault and his fate remains unknown. This was the year we stopped letting celebrities get ahead of the truth, where it was the truth that mattered more than the spin. Another radio host, Anthony Cumia, half of the Opie and Anthony duo, was fired from Sirius XM after taking to Twitter with racist comments following an incident wherein Cumia alleges he was punched by a black woman after trying to take her picture. This was the year we reminded people that you are free to speak your mind but you are not free to do so without consequence. Comedian Artie Lange made \"inappropriate racial remarks\" about ESPN host Cari Champion. And, yes, he made them on Twitter, but any other year, he probably would have made them on the Howard Stern show, or in a standup bit, and, yes, maybe somebody would have recorded him like somebody recorded Michael Richards in 2006, when Seinfeld's Kramer fell from grace. But this was the year we told Artie Lange we didn't care about his boner, that we refused to listen to his inappropriate remarks anymore. All year long, the pop star Iggy Azalea has reveled in the appropriation of hip-hop culture to great personal advantage while remaining silent on race and making inappropriate racial remarks. This was the year we demanded that our idols forego the luxury of golden silence. And here at the end of the year, Sony executive Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin made \"inappropriate racial remarks\" in leaked private e-mails. This was the year we began to see people for who they really are, despite their protestations. Each time an idol falls, we also lose a sense that justice, criminal or social, is a possibility \u2013 that there are true consequences for grave mistakes. Perhaps 2014 was not a year of fallen idols. It was a year when we began to see behind many people's masks. It was a year of a fallen ideal: that of justice for all. It was a year of accepting the truth that everyone is a little bit more racist than we are comfortable believing. It was a year of accepting that powerful men can be far more dangerous than the men they play on television. It was a year of facing the truth that the people we admire, our idols, are not heroes; they are human and it is our responsibility to see them as such.",
