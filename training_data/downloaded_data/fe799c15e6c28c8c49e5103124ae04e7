But Monday's day of mass action by the Climate Camp protesters showed just how badly Twitter can backfire. The Climate Campers set up in the grounds of the Royal Bank of Scotland corporate headquarters on the outskirts of Edinburgh and were protesting against the bank's funding of fossil fuel interests \u2013 including highly CO2-intensive tar sands in Canada. During the course of the day small bands of protesters targeted RBS-owned locations and other companies across the city. Climate Camp had its own Twitter feed of course, but anyone browsing through the #climatecamp hashtag would probably not have got the impression of the day's events that the spinsters at Climate Camp wanted. Supportive texts were swamped by tweeters ridiculing the activists or even pretending to be them. @oldhoborn, for example, mercilessly lampooned the campers all day for their middle-class demographic. For example: and Oldholdborn also threw in a fake retweet: Others, went for the \"get a job\" or \"get a bath\" line while @Akvavitix, had this: But the rather presumptuously named @wearethebritish put it most concisely: He was right. It is surprising that an organisation that puts so much emphasis on the art of manipulating the media (according to the Climate Camp media pack journalists are \"weak and cowardly\" and \"astoundingly unimaginative\") did not think harder about how to use a medium that cuts out the peaky middlemen altogether.",
