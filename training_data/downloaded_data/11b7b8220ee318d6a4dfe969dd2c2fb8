  "content": "Reaction by privacy campaigners and others to Friday's landmark ruling that GCHQ's mass surveillance was unlawful contrasts sharply with that of the intelligence agency itself. While a GCHQ spokesperson insisted the ruling by Britain's Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) found against the authorities only \"in one small respect\", Privacy International said the decision had \"vindicated\" the actions of Edward Snowden, the former US National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower whose revelations led to the IPT investigation. Downing Street said the judgment \u2013 which found that GCHQ's access to intercepted information obtained by the NSA breached human rights law until the end of last year \u2013 did not require GCHQ to change its operations. GCHQ spokesperson We are pleased that the court has once again ruled that the UK's bulk interception regime is fully lawful. It follows the court's clear rejection of accusations of 'mass surveillance' in their December judgment. The IPT has, however, found against the government in one small respect in relation to the historic intelligence-sharing legal regime. The court has ruled that the public disclosure of two paragraphs of additional detail, voluntarily disclosed by the government during the litigation, were essential to make the public regime sufficiently foreseeable and therefore fully compatible with the European convention on human rights. They found that to the extent that these two paragraphs were not previously in the public domain, the intelligence-sharing regime prior to that point was in contravention of human rights law. But the judgment does not in any way suggest that important safeguards protecting privacy were not in place at all relevant times. It does not require GCHQ to change what it does to protect national security in any way. Today's IPT ruling reaffirms that the processes and safeguards within the intelligence-sharing regime were fully adequate at all times \u2013 it is simply about the amount of detail about those processes and safeguards that needed to be in the public domain. We welcome the important role the IPT has played in ensuring that the public regime is sufficiently detailed. By its nature, much of GCHQ's work must remain secret. But we are working with the rest of government to improve public understanding about what we do and the strong legal and policy framework that underpins all our work. We continue to do what we can to place information safely into the public domain that can help to achieve this. James Welch, legal director for Liberty We now know that, by keeping the public in the dark about their secret dealings with the NSA, GCHQ acted unlawfully and violated our rights. That their activities are now deemed lawful is thanks only to the degree of disclosure Liberty and the other claimants were able to force from our secrecy-obsessed government. But the intelligence services retain a largely unfettered power to rifle through millions of people's private communications \u2013 and the tribunal believes the limited safeguards revealed during last year's legal proceedings are an adequate protection of our privacy. We disagree, and will be taking our fight to the European court of human rights. Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International For far too long, intelligence agencies like GCHQ and NSA have acted like they are above the law. Today's decision confirms to the public what many have said all along: over the past decade, GCHQ and the NSA have been engaged in an illegal mass surveillance sharing programme that has affected millions of people around the world. We must not allow agencies to continue justifying mass surveillance programmes using secret interpretations of secret laws. The world owes Edward Snowden a great debt for blowing the whistle, and today's decision is a vindication of his actions. But more work needs to be done. The only reason why the NSA-GCHQ sharing relationship is still legal today is because of a last-minute clean-up effort by government to release previously secret \"arrangements\". That is plainly not enough to fix what remains a massive loophole in the law, and we hope that the European court decides to rule in favour of privacy rather than unchecked state power. Elizabeth Knight, legal director at Open Rights Group This ruling is a very welcome first step. It shows that secret policies are not an acceptable basis for highly intrusive intelligence sharing practices. However, the IPT has not gone far enough. These flimsy policies are not enough to comply with the requirements of human rights law, even now they are public. And GCHQ's own Tempora programme of mass interception is clearly both unlawful and disproportionate. We hope the European court of human rights will go further than the IPT and find that mass surveillance breaches our human right to privacy. Cori Crider, director, Reprieve After a decade and a half of siding with the government, it is welcome that the IPT is beginning to hold our spies to account. But stark problems with the UK's surveillance system remain: for years the government has written itself a blank cheque to eavesdrop on confidential communications between lawyers and clients, even in cases where the government itself is in the dock. This is totally unfair and undermines the core premise of our legal system. Downing Street spokeswoman The overall judgment this morning is that the UK's interception regime is fully lawful. That follows on from the court's clear rejection of accusations of mass surveillance in their December judgment, and we welcome that. It's important to be clear that the overall interception regime and bulk interception they found fully, fully lawful, and that it was compliant with the right to privacy at all times. What they said was, on the legal framework governing that, that there should be more about the rules that should be disclosed publicly. I think it was two paragraphs of additional detail, and the government did that during the proceedings. They are not questioning in this judgment that the safeguarding of privacy was in any way jeopardised and the judgment will not require GCHQ to change what it does. The spokeswoman added that the prime minister believes the government should make sure the intelligence agencies \"continue to have the powers they need to keep us safe\". On Twitter, the longer term consequences of the ruling were seized upon.
