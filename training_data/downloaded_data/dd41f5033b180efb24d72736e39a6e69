  "content": "The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has published new guidelines aimed at helping app developers abide by data protection laws. The ICO has also published advice for smartphone and tablet users on how to keep control of their personal information, after finding that many are concerned about how their data is being used by apps. A survey of 2,272 British people conducted by YouGov and commissioned by the ICO found that 59% have downloaded apps, but that 62% of them are concerned about resulting privacy issues. 49% said they have decided not to download at least one app due to these fears. \"On one hand, these are classic data protection problems. The Data Protection Act itself is technology-neutral, and just as applicable to apps as it is to websites and other businesses,\" Simon Rice, the ICO's principal policy advisor for technology, told The Guardian. \"But apps are slightly unique in that they're often driven by a particular need \u2013 you need an app to show train times when you're standing at the station, for example \u2013 and consumers may be more willing as a result to just press 'OK' and accept all the data permissions that an app requests.\" The ICO's new guidelines are intended to help developers understand their data protection responsibilities, including making it clear what information they are getting from their users, and what it will be used for. \"We want to raise awareness of the DPA and show that it shouldn't be an onerous task to remain compliant,\" said Rice. \"It's not generally about saying 'you're not allowed to do such and such', but rather saying 'are you really doing it in the best way, and how have you communicated it to your users?'\" Rice said the ICO will be following up its guidelines in the new year to check that they're being implemented, although he stressed that any action taken against developers would be the result of specific complaints from consumers. The ICO's privacy advice for app users \"1. Only download apps from official and trusted app stores. Be extremely careful if using untrusted sources.\" \"2. Read the information available about an app in the app store before you download it. Check you are happy about the personal information it will be using.\" \"3. Have a regular clear-out. Many of us have downloaded an app and only used it once. If you no longer use the app, uninstall it.\" \"4. Consider downloading mobile security software to help keep your device secure.\" \"5. Make sure you erase any apps from the phone before you donate, resell or recycle an old device, as these may have to access to your personal information. You should be able to find a 'factory reset' option in the device settings.\"",
