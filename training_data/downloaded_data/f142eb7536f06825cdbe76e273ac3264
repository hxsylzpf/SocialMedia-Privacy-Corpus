  "content": "David Remnick is meant to be talking about the New Yorker's weekly radio show, which launched this weekend. Yet his answer to my opening gambit, asking why the venerable weekly is going on air, starts with an unfathomable American expression about Texas and rice, segues through the cultural and economic impact of new technologies via Dickens and Dostoevsky, before quoting a 20th century mobster. \"People used to ask Willie Sutton why he robbed banks and he said: 'That's where the money is.' That's where the readers are. If they are online, if they are in print as they still are in huge numbers, I want to be there.\" The roughly seven-minute answer is as entertaining, erudite and occasionally baffling as the magazine itself. The author of a Pulitzer-prize winning book about the collapse of the Soviet empire, Remnick appears to embody Tom Wolfe's definition of New Yorker style as \"one of leisurely meandering understatement, droll when in the humorous mode\". From his glass eyrie on the 38th floor of New York's One World Trade Center, Remnick has a panoramic view across lower Manhattan to Ellis Island, where his grandfathers arrived from eastern Europe in the early part of the last century. With a stunning office far more Vogue than ink-stained newspaper, Remnick has a bottle of bourbon near his desk, is partial to the use of \"fuckdoodle\" to express surprise and calls journalism \"the most fun you can have with your pants on\". Founded in 1925, the New Yorker has only had five editors: the first two, Harold Ross and William Shawn, lasted 62 years in total, while the next two, Robert Gottlieb and Tina Brown, managed 11. Remnick has been in charge since 1998; 17 years during which the magazine has faced the existential threat of the internet and the collapse of print advertising. Yet the New Yorker appears to be in robust shape. It has not only won more national magazine awards than any other US title during the past 90 years but its circulation, as measured by the Alliance for Audited Media, reached an all-time high of 1.1m in June 2015, up 2% year on year. With his favourite article in a recent edition a take-down of Henry David Thoreau, Remnick is keen to avoid the charge levelled at the great American writer that he is \"more revered than read\". It would be wrong to see the circulation success as the triumph of seriousness. \"The formula of the New Yorker is too complicated to just be called serious \u2026 you're reading a 10,000-word piece on the war in Sudan and speckled within it are Gadd cartoons about talking dogs and desert islands,\" he says. \"It's a magical formula.\" The jury is still out on how successful the formula is online. The vast majority of sales still come from print with just 80,000 digital subscribers in 2014, according to research from the Pew Center, a figure that has since risen to more than 96,000. This is better than most comparable magazines, however, and the subscription package encourages combined print and digital sign-up. The company introduced a metered paywall just over a year ago. At the same time, the site's 15-20 stories a day became newsier or, in the words of Michael Silberman, digital media general manager at publisher New York Media, the New Yorker \"stepped up its metabolism\". Perhaps more importantly for the New Yorker and its future, the money-losing title returned to the black in 2002 and has been profitable since. Indeed, the year to date has been its most profitable yet, according to Remnick, although, as ever with a privately owned Cond\u00e9 Nast title, such claims are hard to verify. When Remnick took over in 1998 advertising accounted for the vast majority of revenue; now it accounts for less than half, with most growth coming from subscriptions. In 1998, the cover price was $3. If the price had stayed in line with inflation, it would now cost about $4.50 but the title sells for $7.99. \"This is a very simple story in a certain way,\" says Remnick. \"Print advertising is not increasing. Our future is more and more towards the reader paying for what we do.\" Tina Brown, who poached Remnick from the Washington Post and was criticised for her high-cost, high-profile ways while editor, said she grew \"frustrated\" arguing with the Newhouses, ultimate owners of the magazine and Cond\u00e9 Nast, over a business strategy that mis-priced the title in the 1990s. \"I always said the subscription price was too low,\" she said in an interview. \"This is one of the best clubs in town and an extra $10, $30 is not going to make any difference to the committed New Yorker audience. In the same way, people will pay HBO or Netflix when they want premium content.\" Remnick pays tribute to Brown, now responsible for the global Women in the World saying, \"Tina spent to revive it.\" Remnick, who interviewed writer Ta-Nehisi Coates in his opening show, believes the hour-long programme on local public radio could attract a younger audience, as the site's existing podcasts, with about 150,000 downloads a week, do. Readers aged between 18 and 34 make up 27% of the magazine's consumers but 45% of unique visitors to newyorker.com. \"If they come to the magazine, if they come to the site, because they listen to us on a radio podcast, then what a great bonus.\" Other brand extensions include an annual festival at which this year Remnick played guitar to Patti Smith singing Because the Night. \"I don't get nervous about anything any more,\" he says. Of course, radio has nowhere near the reach among young people of platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Earlier this year, Facebook started to host articles from news organisations such as the New York Times and the Guardian; Remnick describes the New Yorker as \"in conversation about all this stuff\" and expects the talks to \"come to a good resolution\" but on his terms. \"It's gotta work for us in terms of subscription. I can't just give away material and get all excited about a big bump in traffic that has no real benefit. Then I'm in business to do what? Help Facebook.\" Remnick is a \"twurker\", someone who doesn't tweet but looks at Twitter all the time: he insists he has enough to do without distilling his thoughts into 140-word characters. \"It's not lost on me that I've got blasted on Twitter for not tweeting. But I'm not sure it's a character defect.\" He only becomes slightly defensive once asked about the diversity of his workforce. He starts on a rollcall of senior women on the staff \u2013 later adding that the gender mix is about 50/50 \u2013 and says he wants to appoint more people from ethnic minorities, then adds, \"A great editor of the Washington Post once said to me 'never get into defensive crouch', but do I think we can do better on all kinds of things? You bet I do.\" He is 57 now and I ask, how much longer will he continue as editor? \"Do I look like I'm falling apart to you?\" he snorts, before turning serious. \"We are living in a revolutionary time. My job \u2026 is getting the New Yorker from one side of the river to the other with its soul intact. \"When I'm old and creaky the job is to hand the keys to another person \u2026 so that she has got a New Yorker that's intact, that has its journalistic and literary values in place, and yet is a commercial success and is healthy. I tell you one thing: William Shawn did this until he was in his 80s. I won't.\" Curriculum vitae Age 57 Education Pascack Valley high school, Hillsdale, Princeton University (comparative literature) Career 1982 reporter, Washington Post 1988 Moscow correspondent 1992 staff writer, the New Yorker 1998 editor 2000 Advertising Age's editor of the year",
