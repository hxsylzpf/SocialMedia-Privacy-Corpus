  "content": "Pinterest is considered one of the highest growth social platforms and according to Shareaholic its referral traffic share grew by 48% on last year. However, numbers aren't everything with 69% of online consumers who visit Pinterest having found an item they've purchased compared to only 40% of online consumers visiting Facebook. Everybody knows that Pinterest is a great platform for those selling business-to-consumer and specifically for those in retail. But those working in a business-to-business setting should also be using the platform to increase visibility, sharing, brand awareness and essentially revenue. Here are six quick tips when it comes to making a pin-worthy business: 1. Position yourself as an expert in your industry You can pin videos, excerpts from white papers, brochure images, ebook sections, look-books, ad campaigns, events, statistics, examples of your work, templates, webinar images, infographics, testimonials, PR coverage\u2026 all positioning your company as knowledgeable in your area of expertise. Not only that but everything you pin can click through to your website so people can find out more about the blog post/e-book/webinar and actively engage with your brand. 2. Engage with others Encourage pin-its and re-pins. Getting other people to share your content is great as this helps it travel and makes it more likely that your content will be seen by prospective customers. Also, as comments are still up and coming on Pinterest now is a great time to get started. Engage and comment on pins in your industry, follow people and get involved, interaction (as with every social platform) is key. For a list of the most popular pins, board and pinners check out Postris. You can also authorise customers to pin on certain boards, a great way to get brand advocates to market on your behalf, sharing your product in action, reviews, recipes or whatever is relevant to your specific industry. 3. A pin is not just for Christmas Pins last forever so make sure you keep your content timeless and sticky so it remains of value. You need to plan them properly as part of your content strategy. Pinterest has its own analytics page so you can measure the success of your pins and use this to inform and adapt your plan as well as learning more about your audience and their interests. As well as this, people who aren't on Pinterest will still see you as your Pinterest images will appear in their Google searches. 4. Think picture, think pin Wherever you use images on your current website or online, make sure you add the 'Pin It' icon so that your audience are able to pin directly from your website to their Pinterest pages, encouraging others to collect and share content from your website with their own captive audience. In reverse, make sure all of your pins include a link back to your website or call to action. Remember also, people can follow a board as well as a person so make sure each board stands alone as well as part of your company collection. 5. Get rich I cannot write about Pinterest without touching on rich pins. These enhanced pins are well worth their salt, showcasing more sales information, live stock and pricing and free automatic emails to anyone who has pinned a product if you amend the pricing or run an offer. This is active marketing to a database of customers who have shown interest in this specific product. However, not just built for products, rich pins come in five different types. Be sure to check out the 'article' version which details the author, article title, description, web URL and contains a call to action. 6. Cash in on the caption Remember your caption counts as well. People will be searching for specific search terms so make sure you use these in your descriptions and that they relate back to what you offer as a company so people are finding the business behind the board and converting leads into website visitors and ultimately customers. As always, it's all about quality. Keep your images eye catching and pinnable. Longpins that are taller and vertical will look better in mobiles and tablets and, where possible, pin at least once per day so you remain fresh in your followers home feeds.
