  "content": "The Twitter user who joked that he would \"blow up\" Robin Hood airport in South Yorkshire has lost his attempt to overturn his conviction \u2013 but a stalemate between two judges means that his appeal will now be heard again. Three high court judges will consider the case against Paul Chambers, 27, from Doncaster, who sent his message when the airport was closed by snow in January 2010. Unlike tweets, the essence of which is to be brief and to the point, the increasingly notorious legal action is now heading for its third unresolved year. No date has been set for the fresh hearing. Protests against the alleged \"over-reaction\" have multiplied, with high-profile support from celebrity tweeters such as Stephen Fry. Chambers lost his job as an accountant following an avalanche of publicity when he was convicted in May last year of sending \"an electronic comunication of a menacing character\", contrary to provisions of the 2003 Communications Act. He was fined \u00a3385 and ordered to pay \u00a3600 costs after crown court judge Jacqueline Davies, sitting with two magistrates, called the tweet \"clearly menacing\", with airport staff sufficiently concerned to report it to police. Chambers had been tweeting with his girlfriend, whom he wanted to visit in Northern Ireland. One tweet in the sequence said: \"Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!!\" In the way of Twitter, this was shared with around 600 regular followers of his messages and came to the attention of airport security staff. The two-judge divisional court of the high court has ordered a fresh hearing after Chambers appealed earlier this year to have his conviction overturned. Chambers' solicitor, David Allen Green of Preiskel and Co, said that a split divisional court was highly unusual, adding to the legal interest \u2013 as well as longevity \u2013 of the case. The original trial heard that there had never been serious concern that the tweet was anything more than a prank, but in the context of national alerts about terrorism, it was not considered funny. Ben Emmerson QC, appearing for Chambers before Lord Justice Gross and Mr Justice Irwin in February, said that the conviction had proved the opposite of a deterrent. Around 4,000 people retweeted the message in protest with support gigs including a fundraising event hosted by the comedian Al Murray. the comedian likened the affair to \"something out of Monty Python\". Emmerson told the court: \"One has to inject common sense to avoid the law ending up looking silly. Was this a steamroller to crack a very small nut.\" The Doncaster hearing played a separate role in twitter's ever-hectic story, by opening up many court hearings to the instant messaging service. In spite of disapproving looks from the bench, proceedings were tweeted more-or-less as they happened, and a high court ruling subsequently put the issue at the discretion of judges, many of whom have allowed it. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 May 2012 to remove a reference to Chambers as a hoaxer and his tweet as a threat.",
