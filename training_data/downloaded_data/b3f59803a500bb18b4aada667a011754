  "content": "Twitter is adding support for posting up to four photos in a tweet and tagging up to 10 people in photos. The multiple photo upload feature is currently rolling out to Twitter's official iPhone app, with Android and Twitter.com users gaining the feature soon. Tagging works like the existing username mentions system tweets, using full names or Twitter usernames during the image attachment process. Those tagged in a photo are sent a notification, but are given the option to opt out of tagging notifications. Hiding the 'scaffolding' Tagging users in photos does not affect the character count of the 140-character limited tweets, and could indicate a further move to hide the \"scaffolding\" of Twitter that includes @replies and #hashtags. The move shows the importance of photos and photo sharing to Twitter, which rolled out photo filters similar to Facebook's Instagram in December 2012. Twitter is also testing a replacement of the familiar \"retweet\" with \"Share with followers\", further evidence of Twitter's move to simplify and remove jargon from the service, which is seen as a barrier to entry for new users. The \"Share\" move prompted a backlash from Twitter users and comparisons to Facebook, which also uses the Share terminology for posting updates and content on user timelines. Twitter's music app is scheduled to cease operation on 18 April, after failing to gain traction. A report by the Wall Street Journal suggests that Twitter is trading its own service for a partnership solution \"centred on music conversations and content\" with Beats Music, SoundCloud and Vevo. Existing Twitter partners like Spotify, iTunes and Rdio may also play a role.",
