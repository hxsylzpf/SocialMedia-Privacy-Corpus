  "content": "Twitter's new expanded character limit is a baby step forward on a long journey. The feature will certainly change things, mostly for the better, but it's nowhere near the game-changing level they could be operating at if they were bolder. Back in 2010 when they were encouraging a developer ecosystem to grow, they introduced a similar feature called Annotations. Annotations was a much more interesting and uniquely Twitter-ish approach to more robust tweets. Structured data could be included in a post which opened a seemingly endless world of possibilities. Interestingly, they shared the concept with developers without having a clear path for integrating it into the core Twitter stream. That was a pretty bold thing to do. It meant they didn't know how, or even if, people would use it but they showed great confidence by giving partners the ability to plug their ideas into Twitter's network. One of those ideas may have been long-form content which they are only just now offering, nearly six years, later via this 10k character feature. Other ideas may have been more unique and Twitter-native. For example, someone could have extended @replies or hearts to things or places or songs or whatever, not just Tweets and Twitter accounts. Twitter Annotations was never released. Raffi Krikorian is engineering lead at Uber Advanced Technologies Center. He was the vice-president of engineering for Twitter's platform then, and he told me there were concerns about return on investment and the cost of serving Annotations. Krikorian said: \"We couldn't make a good business case for it at the time.\" Being bold can often mean pushing against what customers say they want. But there's a fine line between being bold and having poor judgment. Remember when Apple decided to ship laptops with no CD drive? That was a real eye-opener. The evolution of the laptop form factor was being held back by an increasingly irrelevant technology, and they decided to improve the quality of their product by breaking free of a physical constraint. Apple rejected standards and norms and public demand to make a more interesting product, a lighter, more streamlined and more attractive laptop. They took advantage of the freedom gained by removing the shackles of a clunky technology. Software is different from hardware, of course. It has many constraints, too, but size is generally not one of them. Twitter operated natively in SMS which was unique, and so the limitations of SMS were a reasonable excuse for 140 characters initially. But that didn't need to be the defining feature of the product. They then moved the product away from SMS as smartphones took off, but they failed to fully take advantage of the environment. iOS and Android didn't have the content size constraint. Twitter did. Artificially imposed constraints shouldn't be used to justify a design solution. Had Twitter fully invested in its developer strategy instead of becoming a publishing platform, they may have found a lot of value in being the lightweight communications network. But even then 140 characters would've been a tier of service rather than the core solution. Instead they decided to own and control the content sharing experience. And it is way past time they made content sharing more robust. Somewhere along the line Twitter became way too precious about what a tweet is. To be fair, Twitter's mobile apps have been very successful. They work great. And many apps have picked up ideas and applied Twitter innovations to their own products, including Facebook. Larger tweets will infuse some new energy into the product. That's a good thing. Twitter is, after all, a valuable piece of the digital media ecosystem, and it's important that it thrives. Unfortunately, it's getting harder and harder to work out why to use Twitter instead of other platforms. The only really unique thing about Twitter is the Twitter network, which is a hugely powerful thing, and they have the ability and a track record to do something great with that. Perhaps this is a sign that some of the past ideas that excited people about Twitter in its early days are going to be reintroduced or reimagined even if they are drip fed to us. A steady stream of product innovations can be just as effective as a big splash type of change. But it would be very disappointing if that didn't happen and we end up looking back on this release at the end of 2016 and wonder if the company could've done something bolder.
