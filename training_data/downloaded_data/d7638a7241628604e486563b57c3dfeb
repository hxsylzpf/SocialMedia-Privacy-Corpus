  "content": "The $580m (\u00a3331m) sale of the website MySpace.com to News Corporation was a \"giveaway\", a law firm attempting to block the deal said today. Intermix Media, which owns the community and entertainment website along with 30 others, was worth \"over a billion dollars\" said Marc Moller, a partner of US law firm Kreindler &amp; Kreindler, which has launched a class action against the sale on behalf of Intermix Media shareholders. \"I cannot tell you how far above that with any certainty right at this moment because the books aren't available to us but it's crystal clear that there's been a major undervaluation of Intermix which we have got to set straight,\" Mr Moller said today. In July News Corporation said it was buying Intermix Media as part of a $1bn plan to invest in the internet, marking a major reversal of its policy of shunning the internet. The deal was the first investment by Fox Interactive Media, the recently-formed News Corp division which now houses the group's online assets. MySpace.com, the two-year-old website that allows friends to share blogs, photos, instant messages and music online, is the jewel in the crown of Intermix, and by page impressions is the fifth most popular site on the internet. Intermix's other sites include Grab.com, a gaming and social network site, coolquiz.com and myleague.com. The firm, which is listed on the Nasdaq market, reported profits of $4.5m last year on revenues of $79m. The lawsuit alleges that Intermix executives failed in their duty to get the best price for the business because they did not auction the company off, even though News Corporation rivals were interested in purchasing it. The law firm said that Intermix gave News Corp rivals interested in the company \"the cold shoulder\". Intermix Media said that the lawsuit was \"meritless\" and it would defend the class action. Mr Moller said the shareholders could seek an injunction to stop the sale, or seek to delay a shareholder vote on the transaction scheduled for September 28. \"We are not opposed to a sale at the right price but we are opposed on behalf of shareholders to what is essentially a giveaway,\" Mr Moller said. News Corporation declined to comment on the lawsuit. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
