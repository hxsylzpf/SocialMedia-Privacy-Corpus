  "content": "Facebook for Android has more daily active users than its iPhone counterpart for the first time. The iPhone app launched in July 2008, while its Android cousin rolled out in September 2009 and has been closing the lead ever since. According to the AppData tracking service, the Android app now has 58.8 million daily active users, while the iPhone version has 57.6 million. The iPhone app has 99.5 million monthly active users compared with Android's 86.1 million, but the daily figure is regarded as a more important measure of use. Android's rising user figure is an important step in that it reflects its generally expanding user base and means that Facebook may devote more resources towards developing services for the platform.",
