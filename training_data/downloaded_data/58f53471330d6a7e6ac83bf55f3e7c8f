  "content": "Any lingering scepticism over claims that London 2012 would prove the first proper social media Olympics was swiftly, if unwittingly, dispelled by the American hurdler Kerron Clement on Monday. Weary and, by the sound of things, perhaps in need of a comfort break, Clement took to Twitter to bemoan the fact that the coach he was on was taking an awfully long time to find its way from the airport to the athletes' village. \"Um, so we've been lost on the road for 4 hrs. Not a good first impression London,\" he wrote. \"Athletes are sleepy, hungry and need to pee. Could we get to the Olympic Village please?\" Although his plaintive observations were quickly seized on by the media as further proof of Olympic teething troubles, they also revealed the unprecedented ease with which competitors can now express their anger, joy and disappointment. Although the Beijing Games hardly went unremarked upon on Facebook and Twitter, the past four years have seen an explosion in the sites' use, be it personal, professional or corporate. The former Olympic rower Matthew Pinsent has used his Twitter account (20,531 followers) to provide a little historical context and to take the occasional pop at the naysayers. \"The cycle of any Olympics is a period of intense scrutiny in 10 days before OC. Even Sydney 'the best Games ever' (deserved title) got pasted,\" ran one tweet. Another was even more terse: \"Dear Vancouver 2010, Beijing 2008 etc \u2013 see? we told you \u2013 UK media PLC will kick the crap out of our own Olympics too.\" Current British Olympians have so far been a little less combative in their 140-character communiques. Tom Daley and Rebecca Adlington \u2013 who between them have more than 320,000 followers \u2013 have used Twitter to post pictures from inside the athletes' village. Daley's snap shows a room decorated with balloons and good luck cards (not to mention a cuddly Pride the Lion guarding his pillow); Adlington's, meanwhile, reveals a talent for patriotic paper-chain manufacturing. Social media have also furnished sportspeople from all over the world with a quick and convenient way to thank the sponsors who have bankrolled them. They had until Wednesday to make their gratitude felt: from the Games period of 18 July to 15 August, competitors are banned from pushing personal brands and, like all those who attend the Games, they are not allowed to post video or audio clips that would tread on the toes of the official broadcasters. A brief and unscientific poll conducted in the rainy and still sparsely populated athletes' village this week showed that British and US hopefuls are not alone in embracing Facebook pages and Twitter feeds \u2013 although it did reveal a sharp linguistic divide when it comes to who favours which social media network and why. What did Ola Sesay, a long jumper from Sierra Leone who was loping across the village plaza with her colleague Ibrahim Turay, make of suggestions that London 2012 is the first true social media Games? \"Definitely, definitely,\" she said, nodding at the question and then at Turay. \"We were just in the mall trying to get a laptop or iPad so that he can use his Facebook.\" Sesay, 33, said the network was her way of keeping in touch with those at home. \"I use Facebook a lot, mostly just to communicate with my family and give them updates on how I'm going and how my training's going,\" she said. Her view was echoed by Erislandy Sav\u00f3n, a 21-year-old super-heavyweight boxer from Cuba. \"The internet's really important because it's a way of staying in touch with your family and friends \u2013 and with some other competitors in other countries,\" he said. \"But I don't use Twitter; only Facebook and email. All my teammates are on Facebook, too.\" The preference for Facebook over Twitter appears more pronounced in non-English speaking countries. \"We use Facebook much more because Twitter is a little more Anglophone,\" explained Kouassi Brou, a competitor in the men's 50m freestyle from Ivory Coast. Like many other Olympians, Brou uses social media to keep in touch with those at home and, like them, he admits to being slightly addicted to updating his status so they don't miss any aspect of his time in London. \"I had some connection problems, but I managed to get my phone hooked up yesterday and since then I swear I haven't stopped tweeting and going on Facebook and posting photos,\" he said. As Kerron Clement's coach tweet \u2013 not to mention its deathless follow-up, \"In Wales. I'm so loving this city and I just arrived\" \u2013 demonstrated, American athletes have a natural affinity for social media. Shea Buckner and Peter Varellas, a pair of attackers from the US water polo team, confirmed they were both avid and adept social networkers. \"We use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,\" said Buckner, 25. \"We mostly do it from our cellphones and we're following maybe a handful of other athletes.\" Other athletes? Were they ever tempted to harness technology to ignoble ends and indulge in a bit of pre-competition psychological warfare? Both laughed and shook their heads before bowling off towards the accommodation blocks at great speed.",
