  "content": "Hacked extramarital dating site Ashley Madison discussed hacking a competitor, according to emails released as part of the massive leak of the site's data. The leaked emails show that in November 2012, the site's chief technology officer, Raja Bhatia, emailed chief executive Noel Biderman after apparently examining the security of the new dating section of online sex and relationships magazine Nerve.com and finding a security hole in the site. \"They did a very lousy job building their platform. I got their entire user base,\" Bhatia wrote. \"Also, I can turn any non-paying user into a paying user, vice versa, compose messages between users, check unread stats, etc.\" The email also contained a link to a Github archive with a sample of the database, suggesting that Bhatia had acquired some data. Ashley Madison did not deny the emails were accurate, but said that they were taken out of context. The company says that Bhatia's discovery of security holes in the website was part of \"due diligence\" performed in the runup to a proposed partnership between the two firms. Six months after the first emails and in advance of a meeting between Biderman and Nerve.com, Bhatia again emailed the chief executive, asking whether he should \"tell them of their security hole\". Biderman did not reply. The emails are contained in the second of the two major document dumps from Ashley Madison, which was hacked in late July by attackers calling themselves Impact Team. The first dump, released last Tuesday, contained the full database of Ashley Madison's members. But a second database, released on Thursday night, contained a number of internal documents from the company itself \u2013 including the full email spool of chief executive Biderman. In a statement given to Vice, Ashley Madison's parent company Avid Life Media said that the emails were \"taken out of context\" and that the interpretation that Bhatia had hacked Nerve was \"incorrect and unfortunate\". The statement continued: \"Nerve was exploring strategic partnerships in May of 2012 and reached out to Noel to determine Avid Life Media's interest in the property. At the time Noel did not act on that opportunity.\" \"In September PTC Advisors, representing Nerve, contacted Noel and provided a more detailed brief on the opportunity. This communique was followed by a number of conversations. Subsequently Noel contacted Raja Bhatia and asked for his assistance in conducting technical due diligence on the opportunity. This activity, while clumsily conducted, uncovered certain technology shortcomings which Noel attempted to understand and confirm. \"At no point was there an effort made to hack, steal or use Nerve.com's proprietary data.\" Ashley Madison has refused to confirm the legitimacy of the dump overall, and, short of confirming that the hack is being investigated, has largely failed to answer questions surrounding the hack at all. The Guardian has asked Bhatia, who no longer works for the firm, for comment.
