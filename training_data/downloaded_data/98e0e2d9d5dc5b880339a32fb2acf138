  "content": "It seems not. After five months of exploring Mars, digging up the soil and making some startling discoveries along the way, the world's favourite interplanetary laboratory has gone off the radar - probably for good. Earlier this week, Nasa officials finally closed the book on the Phoenix Mars Lander five months, $475m (\u00a3308m) and 605 Twitter messages after it first touched down on the red planet. In a final message at twitter.com/marsphoenix - yes, even interplanetary craft get their own social media accounts these days (even if they are run by a team back on Earth) - Phoenix signed off with a binary representation of the word \"triumph\". Veronica McGregor, from Nasa's press office at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, gave Mars Phoenix its human face through Twitter - and saw its followers grow from 3,000 on landing day to more than 9,000 not long after, principally due to her willingness to respond to questions. \"The Twitter audience is both intelligent and incredibly humorous. I think I was entertained by them as much as they were entertained by MarsPhoenix,\" she told us. But the Twitter feed also offered news: it had the first public announcement on July 31 of the discovery of water ice: \"An ice-containing sample made it into the TEGA oven. I can now say I'm the first mission to Mars to touch and then *taste* the water. FTW!\" (The latter being triumphant gamer jargon - \"for the win!\") \"We've started other Twitter feeds at JPL, and other Nasa centres have also started accounts for their missions,\" McGregor said. \"Personally, I'm continuing to post to @MarsRovers and I'll be starting @MarsScienceLab in the next few days. I'll post occasionally to @MarsPhoenix, too, with science updates and other news.\" Over the course of its mission - which lasted five months in total, two more than initially planned - Phoenix took 25,000 images of the Martian landscape, became the first landing craft to taste the ice below the Martian surface and even found perchlorate salts, which left scientists speculating about the possibility of Martian life. But Nasa's engineers had an off-again, on-again relationship with the machine, having lost contact last month before a brief rally when Phoenix got back in touch on Halloween. Its rise from the ashes did not last long, and communications went quiet again on November 2. This, said experts at JPL, means Phoenix is most likely now frozen beyond the point of repair. Still, there is a faint glimmer of hope for Phoenix's legion of fans. Although the skies are too dark and the weather too cold for Phoenix to operate during the winter months, it has a special \"Lazarus\" mode which might see it hibernate through to the spring ... before rising once again to carry on with its mission. FTW!",
