  "content": "Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly is sticking by his man, throwing his support behind the prime minister, Tony Abbott, in the face of increasing leadership chatter. In a passionate Facebook post, Kelly, who holds the New South Wales federal seat of Hughes, lists the reasons he feels Abbott is the best choice to lead the Coalition and the country. Here is his post, republished in full: I'M STICKING WITH TONY * He's scrapped the carbon tax * He's stopped the boats \u2013 and the deaths at sea * He's gotten rid of the mining tax \u2013 so Australia is once more seen as a safe place to invest * He has over $1 trillion worth of new projects approved, projects that had been held up by Labor * He has new road projects now under way to overcome commuter gridlock in our cities * After 50 years of buck passing, he's made a decision on a new western Sydney Airport * He's delivered a trifecta of free trade agreements covering more than 50% of our exports \u2013 with China, Japan and South Korea * He has the live cattle trade \u2013 closed down in panic over a TV program \u2013 booming again * At last, he has the NBN rolling out, reliably and affordably * He has jobs growth running at 4,000 new jobs a week \u2013 triple that of 2013 * He has new housing approvals at record levels \u2013 creating a boom for tradies * He has the registration of new companies at the highest on record * He has economic growth now running at 2.7%, up from 1.9% a year ago * He's cracking down on the likes of Hizb-ut Tahrir and others who nurture Islamic extremism in our suburbs * For small business, he's cutting company tax by 1.5% on the 1st July to encourage further employment growth * And right now, petrol prices are nearing 15-year lows, home loan interest rates are the lowest on record, and the September quarter had the biggest fall in power prices on record Therefore, even if he'd given a knighthood to Camilla \u2013 I'm sticking with Tony!! Kelly has previously dismissed criticism of Abbott knighting Prince Philip, saying it was \"a harmless nothing\" that would not cost taxpayers anything. His verdict on Abbott's press club address on Monday was that it was a \"very, very good speech\". Kelly joined parliament in 2010. Before that he was a small business owner and consumer advocate, and played first-grade rugby for Sydney's southern districts.",
