  "content": "Snapchat has tweaked its design to give more priority to its Discover section, sparking anger from some users. Discover offers videos and news stories from media partners, including Sky News, Mail Online and Vice, but some users find the service at odds with instant messaging and photo sharing with friends. Users took to Twitter to criticise the increased prominence of Discover with some complaining about the change, and rubbishing Discover as a feature more generally. While the response on Twitter may not be representative of Snapchat's 100 million daily active users, the company will keenly observe how it's users respond to its expansion beyond messaging. When Discover launched in January, it occupied its own screen within Snapchat's app, accessed by swiping right twice. While that page still exists, Discover also now appears in a sliding carousel at the top of the app's Stories screen too. This means Discover partners now appear above recent updates from friends on Snapchat, as well as the app's recently-introduced \"Live\" section spotlighting users' photos and videos from specific events and locations. \"Since we launched, we have been experimenting and learning what content works well,\" a spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal. \"We're very excited about where we are today and making Discover accessible on our Stories page feels like a natural fit.\" Snapchat's logic is clear enough: it wants more of those 100 million people watching the stories produced by its partners, who also include MTV, Cosmopolitan, People, National Geographic, Yahoo and Warner Music Group. That in turn would boost revenues from advertisements running around those stories. According to tech news site Recode, Snapchat cut its ad rates from $100 per thousand views in March to $20 per thousand views in May, in an effort to get more brands spending money within Discover. This means that a video story within the section watched 1m times could generate as much as $20k in advertising revenues, while a video watched 10m times could make $200k - with these revenues split with publishers according to the terms of their deals with Snapchat. Discover, as well as the Live section, are key planks in Snapchat's strategy to become a big player in the world of media, rather than just messaging. In May, the company claimed its users were watching more than 2bn videos a day, although it did not say how many of those views were of branded videos rather than clips sent between friends.",
