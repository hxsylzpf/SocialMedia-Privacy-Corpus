  "content": "Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas are threatening legal action after topless pictures of the actress while heavily pregnant were posted on the internet. The Hollywood couple's lawyers accused US radio operator Clear Channel Worldwide of \"continued malicious conduct\" for allowing the photos on its websites. One picture appeared to show Oscar winner Zeta Jones smoking a cigarette on a private estate in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, while expecting daughter Carys, who was born last month. Her lawyer's three-page letter to Clear Channel, posted on a US website, said the \"surreptitiously taken\" photos were an invasion of privacy and warned the couple could be awarded \"substantial\" damages. It said that the unauthorised posting of the photographs was a \"violation\" of Zeta Jones' right of privacy, among other legal rights.\" It described 33-year-old Zeta Jones as \"heavily pregnant and topless\" in the pictures. The legal notice said that although Clear Channel had removed various images, the photographs remained on the company's computer servers and \"are still viewable\". Meanwhile US magazine Star published a long lens shot of Carys asleep in her mother's arms on the cover of its latest issue, the first picture of the baby. Zeta Jones and Douglas's legal battle with Hello! magazine over the publication of unauthorised photographs of their wedding ended last month with both sides claiming victory. The high court judge ruled that Hello! magazine breached the couple's rights of confidence, but said they had no claim in law on an invasion of privacy.",
