  "content": "Here we go, then: it's the Twitter flotation. It's a moment when the investment world tosses aside dull yardsticks like profits and cash flow and instead gives a collective shrug and declares: \"What the hell, if Facebook is worth $120bn, then $17bn (\u00a310bn) for Twitter can't be that silly, can it?\" The flotation will probably proceed swimmingly, of course. Investors seem to have made up their minds that, by Silicon Valley's normal standards, Twitter's hype machine has been vaguely restrained. The impression has been created that, notwithstanding a late rise in the price range, the company's shareholders are not trying to squeeze the last dollar from the sale of a 13% stake. But so what? The Twitter valuation, even if it were cut in half, would be ridiculous if you care about profits and earnings. It has never made any. Indeed, losses for the first nine months of this year widened to $133m from $71m. Yes, revenues may double this year to about $600m, but that is hardly a basis from which to justify a $17bn price-tag. Indeed, we are not even close to discovering whether Twitter can be transformed into an advertising medium without destroying its value in the eyes of users. Facebook may be able to turn itself into an online billboard without provoking a backlash, but that does not mean Twitter can repeat the trick with commercial messages. Users may simply regard a \"promoted tweet\" as one that should be ignored \u2013 which, given the fast and furious nature of the medium, is easy to do. Yes, Twitter is a social phenomenon and will continue to be so. With 200m users, that status is undeniable. But persuading the outside world that $17bn is a reasonable valuation in loss-making form is Twitter's most remarkable achievement.",
