  "content": "Getting the political spectrum on Twitter to all chuckle at once is not the easiest of tasks, but a spoof Jeremy Corbyn account has managed it. In what could either be a scathing parody or doting endorsement of the left, the account, entitled @corbynjokes, has generated more than 2,000 followers in the past 24 hours by tweeting election issues disguised as classic one-liners. A disclaimer states: \"Jeremy hasn't heard or told a joke since 1964\", perhaps as a nod to previous comments made about the Labour leadership candidate and self-proclaimed \"parsimonious MP's\" lack of visible humour. One rightwing newspaper went as far as to describe the account as \"the best thing about the Labour leadership campaign\". Read a selection of the best tweets below and make up your own mind.",
