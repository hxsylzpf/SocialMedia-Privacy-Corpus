Rebecca Leighton was arrested by Greater Manchester police in 2011 as they investigated the deaths of five elderly patients at Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport. She was dubbed the \"angel of death\" and subject to hostile media attention after being charged in connection with the investigation in July 2011. But in December that year she was cleared of all charges after prosecutors admitted they had insufficient evidence. Now Leighton, from Heaviley in Stockport, is claiming aggravated damages from the police for breach of privacy and negligence. In her claim filed at the high court, Leighton alleges that officers requested her Facebook password following her arrest \"to minimise the potentially damaging intrusion into her private life and avoid prejudicing public opinion towards her\". However, she claims that an officer then reset her password before deactivating and reactivating her account \u2013 meaning previously private details, including wall posts and photographs, were visible to all internet users. Leighton also alleges that police gave her name to journalists who then gleaned information from her online profile, reputedly including comments about how she liked to get drunk on days off. A number of media reports detailed her Facebook updates, with one Daily Mail article reporting that her profile was \"littered\" with comments that \"tell of a frantic social life that helped her cope with the stress of work\". In an interview with ITV's This Morning in September 2011, Leighton accused the media of fuelling public hostility towards her, which she said resulted in a judge refusing her bail at Manchester crown court following the charges. \"Because of how the media have portrayed me to be \u2026 they could not be any more wrong, people have formed an opinion about me, so I believe [the bail refusal] was for that reason,\" she said. \"It's hard to even say about having a normal life because even now my life is not normal. I am living at my parents', I am not living where I was living. I'm not working. I can't go outside my house without people taking pictures of me. \"I can't walk down the street on my own because I'm a bit scared. Someone has always got to be with me all the time. It's far from normal.\" She has hired the prominent media barrister Hugh Tomlinson QC to fight her claim for breach of confidence, negligence and breach of a statutory duty. Her solicitor is Charlotte Harris, of the law firm Mishcon de Reya, whose clients include high-profile victims of the phone-hacking scandal. Greater Manchester police confirmed it had received the claim for damages, but declined to say whether the force would fight it. A spokesman said: \"This matter is ongoing and as such it would not be appropriate to comment further.\"",
