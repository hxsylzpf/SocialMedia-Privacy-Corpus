  "content": "Social networking website Bebo is threatening to overtake News Corporation's MySpace as the most popular online community destination in the UK, according to new internet usage research. Bebo ranked third most popular among all UK internet searches for the month to April 29, compared with MySpace, which ranked just 24th, according to figures from Hitwise UK. Heather Hopkins, the Hitwise UK director of research, predicted Bebo would overtake MySpace before September. Searches for Bebo have spiked since January, highlighting the growing interest in the online community site and the opportunity it has to oust MySpace. In terms of visits to social networking sites, MySpace still ranks as the number one player, with a 12.2% share compared with second-placed Bebo at 10.3%. However, Bebo is closing the gap rapidly. In the eight weeks to April 29, Bebo's share of visits rose 45% compared with 29% for MySpace. \"At current growth rates we can expect Bebo to overtake MySpace in share of UK visits before the start of the new school year,\" said Ms Hopkins. \"MySpace will need to continue to innovate to keep and grow its membership base if it is to maintain top position. The youthful audience these sites attract is highly fickle.\" Reflecting this, Hitwise said there had been a 29% year-on-year change in the websites appearing in the top 100 net communities and chat websites category. MySpace's worldwide membership base is reported to be more than 70 million. Rupert Murdoch acquired MySpace for $580m (\u00a3315m) last year as part of a wide-ranging internet strategy to drive News Corporation into the digital age. News Corp's UK subsidiary, News International, is looking at launching a UK version of MySpace linked to its Sun newspaper. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
