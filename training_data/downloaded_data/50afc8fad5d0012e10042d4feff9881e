  "content": "\u200bMedia representations and reactions to the tragic shootings at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado on 20 July 2012 illustrate media culture gone wild \u2013 a complex, emerging \"ecology of communication\", involving new social media and web-based channels of information. How different this was than the first reporting of the \"Columbine massacre\" 13 years ago, which relied mainly on interviews with eyewitnesses. The current tragedy was driven by so many visuals, grainy \u2013 but seemingly, more authentic \u2013 that CNN and other TV networks resorted to split-screen presentations to display several at once. Though context-free, the coverage of the shootings was captivating, featuring nearly live coverage of suffering and death of young people \u2013 indeed, children \u2013 the ultimate innocent victims. Driven simultaneously by new technologies and old scripts about fear and evil, the complex explanations, meanings, significance and implications of more gunshot deaths remained elusive. The social media that blur the lines between private and public behavior provided raw visual materials \u2013 the lifeblood of TV \u2013 that led initial mass media presentations as \"breaking news\". Social media visuals dominated the coverage of the event (such as CNN's), but also by hundreds of smart phone tweets and videos that were often sent simultaneously to friends, families, and the internet, including YouTube. \u200bThen, there were the previous scripts of fear, risk, and evil that have been honed to elicit the deepest emotional empathy and reactions. The standard discourse of fear involves individual-oriented crime, illicit drugs, terrorism, illegal immigration, and assorted forms of deviant pathologies and character defects that inspire moral panics to control them. We are constantly told that guns don't kill people, that certain kinds of people kill people. But the suspect in the recent Colorado slaughter is a research graduate, an honors student, who does not fit the stereotypes of fear. This is where the concept of free-floating evil comes into play: such loss is explained by popular narratives of \"evil\" borrowed from history, as well as decades of gun massacres \u2013 and borrowed even from Batman movies. The social order, and our normal expectations, are grossly violated because of how everyday life is construed as \"it ought to be\": we symbolically manage risks by stressing some (such as crime) and shielding others (such as gunshots and dog bites); we go about our daily routines, have fun and assume that nothing untoward will occur that has not been anticipated (for example, traffic accidents). Thus, crashing meteorites or gun massacres are seemingly beyond our control, so exist in an \"evil\" space. The point is that \"evil\" is socially useful because it moves us toward another discourse and understanding. The official reaction comes from leaders: both President Barack Obama and presidential candidate Mitt Romney offered concise statements about family, prayer and love: Obama talked of how \"My daughters go to the movies \u2026\"; Mitt Romney's four-minute statement, emphasized his faith, love, and our great country \u2013 \"hearts break for victims and families.\" He quoted the Apostle Paul: \"Our prayer is that the comforter \u2026 brings peace to their souls.\" Politicians are not the only actors adept in this script of fear and evil. The film industry helps to socialize audience members, who reproduce the standard roles by imitating the reporters that their use of social media has engendered. Consider CNN's eight-minute interview with witness Chris Ramos, that included the following: \"Like the true message in Batman, standing up against evil, against death \u2026 that is basically the message the Batman movies give out, standing up for something that's right \u2026 and the darkness is always darker before the dawn. The second movie, that's what it says \u2026 It is exactly like this.\" The reporter concludes: \"That's as powerful as it gets. I'll leave it right there and let viewers soak it in.\" In Aurora's narrative of trauma, fear, and evil, too, I bet there will be a sequel.",
