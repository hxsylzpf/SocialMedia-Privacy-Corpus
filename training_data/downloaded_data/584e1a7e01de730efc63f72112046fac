Creator Tara Rae describes the Mirror as the country's ONLY Labour-supporting newspaper and, less correctly, as \"the only left wing paper left in Britain\". She says the paper - along with its stablemates, the Sunday Mirror and The People - are \"about to be decimated by chief executive Sly Bailey's cuts of 200 journalists\" and she quotes National Union of Journalists general secretary Jeremy Dear's description of the decision as \"neanderthal\". Rae adds: \"The paper will no longer be able to function with a skeleton staff - and will rely on agency wire copy instead.\" Among the early signatories are Dear himself, NUJ stalwarts Tim Gopsill, Miles Barter and Donnacha DeLong , and a former Mirror Group sportswriter Norman Giller. As for the redundancy deal itself, the NUJ says it is backing up to 80 Mirror casuals who are \"facing the sack without receiving a single penny in redundancy pay.\" Most of the full-time Mirror group staff across its three titles are members of the British Association of Journalists. And the BAJ has said that 32 journalists have applied for voluntary redundancy. In a bulletin a couple of days ago, the union said six of the 32 had had their deals approved by the Trinity Mirror management. Two staff members have already departed.",
