  "content": "The two most important articles in last week's tabloid press were pieces that the editors didn't want to publish and dreamed that their readership might somehow miss if the page lay-out could be made distracting enough. The Daily Mail printed a retraction concerning a piece about the end of Francesca Annis's relationship with Ralph Fiennes. The paper acknowledged that it had wrongly intruded into areas of her private life and that quotes had been wrongly attributed to her. At the same time, the Daily Star ran an apology to the Arsenal and England footballer Ashley Cole, completely withdrawing allegations of his involvement in a homosexual orgy, even though the paper had never named the player. Confessions of error are very rare in red top newspapers. The tabloid interpretation of journalism has always followed the movie Love Story's definition of love: it means never having to say you're sorry. But the particular significance of these two media mea culpas is that both resulted from journalistic practices which have long been regarded as safe. The Mail piece about Annis, for example, used the device of quoting remarks which the actress was supposed to have made \"to friends.\" In newspapers, this phrase usually means one of two things. Sometimes, it's employed when a figure wishes to get a story out but doesn't want to be directly linked with release of the information. So, if a leading political figure \"has told friends\" that it's time for a change of PM, that politician has been conversing not with acquaintances but with a friendly journalist. In the same way, if you are a young woman who has slept with a famous footballer or politician, but who doesn't want to look like the kind of slapper who blabs to the tabs, the newspaper will usually agree, for a lower fee, to attribute all your revelations to \"a friend\" of yours. Annis, though, seems to have been a victim of the second version of the chum-quote. If a celebrity is refusing to speak, an obvious alternative is to ask their mates how they are taking it. In fact, it wouldn't even strictly be necessary to trace the person's circle through 192.com. Suppose that - let's take a clearly ridiculous example - Tony Blair were exposed over a ten-year simultaneous affair with all of the former Nolan sisters. Cherie refuses to take our calls. But, with the deadline approaching, we need a bit of human colour for our story. Guessing that she's probably a bit miffed with her husband over all this, we find ourselves typing: \"A weeping Cherie has told friends: 'I don't know what to do. I've always loved Tony but it would be bad enough finding your husband has betrayed you with one woman, never mind five! I'm certainly not in the mood for dancing!'\" This kind of journalistic creativity has always been considered low-risk. Unless the wife can prove in court that she knew and approved of the adultery with the singing quintet, it would be difficult to bring any action. But what seems to have happened in the Annis case is that the \"friends\" quoted by the newspaper went into rather too much prurient detail about the consequences of the age-gap between the actors and that the phrasing of these sections seemed strongly to hint that Ms Annis had spoken to the newspaper while hiding behind the styling of \"friends\". Accordingly, she felt provoked to intervene to protect her dignity and privacy. Second-hand testimony ascribed to the famous has been such a stand-by of tabloid narrative that we can easily imagine that Ms Annis's action victory has led tabloid editors to confide in their friends that they are going to have to rethink seriously how to write such pieces in the future. And another working principle of popular journalism is shattered by the apology to Ashley Cole. For decades it has been assumed that a simple double-tap of the delete key when the cursor reaches the subject's name will protect most reporting from legal jeopardy. The Newspaper Library at Colindale is filled with lurid pages describing misbehaviour by a \"household name\" or \"senior figure\". Several newspapers even run gossip slots which ask, for example, \"which leading footballer has run up gambling bills of a million quid and daren't tell the missus?\" Newspaper lawyers would have been happy with the crowd cover that description gives: there are very many footballers who both gamble and are married. What happened in the past was that journalists would circulate the name among themselves, while the public guessed. Such secure innuendo, though, has been ended by the worldwide web, which - as happened in the Cole case - cheerfully unwraps the barrister's bandages the paper has wrapped around the tale. The Arsenal defender's victory has sent an important warning that anonymity no longer works as a precaution against the publication of reports which (as in the Cole case) turned out to be entirely false and defamatory. In recent years, a war has been fought between celebrities and the press over privacy. Annis and Cole have won landmark battles for the famous, which will force the handbook for tabloid reporting to be rewritten. History, though, shows that, like viruses, popular journalism simply adapts and finds new ways of getting through. There's a hint already - in the case involving the publication of the Prince of Wales's private diaries - that newspapers will react by targeting figures of such significance to national issues that intrusion can be justified by a defence of public interest. Even so, something changed last week. Tabloid journalism no longer means never having to say you're sorry.",
