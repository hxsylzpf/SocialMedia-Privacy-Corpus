  "content": "Facebook, the second largest social networking website in the US after MySpace, is facing a revolt by disgruntled users over a new service that reveals all of their online activities to other members. The site, which connects college and university students, introduced News Feeds on Tuesday. The site's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, said on his blog that the idea was to \"highlight what's happening in your social circles on Facebook\". News Feeds, which appears on each user's homepage, shows a log of every action of users in the same group - from updating a profile to posting a photo. Ruchi Sanghvi, a product manager at Facebook, said in a blog announcing the launch that the service does not \"give out any information that wasn't already visible. Your privacy settings remain the same - the people who couldn't see your info before still can't see it now\". However, more than half a million users are thought to have formed protest groups over the amount of information that is being shared. The service, and a second similar product called Mini-Feed, has been described by some users as \"spooky and stalker-esque\". The level of concern moved Mr Zuckerberg to post a blog agreeing that \"stalking isn't cool\" and defending the News Feed service as \"still evolving\". He stressed that no privacy rules had changed as a result and that the company would continue offering the product. Last year, Facebook made inroads into Oxford and Cambridge universities and has since sought to connect students at universities throughout the UK. The site originally grew out of a student website at Harvard University, founded in February 2004 by Mr Zuckerberg. Microsoft last month signed a three-year deal with Facebook to provide online advertising services. Advertising group IPG, the owner of agencies including Lowe and McCann Erickson, took a 0.5% stake in Facebook earlier this year. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
