  "content": "Age: 56. Net worth: approximately $20bn. Appearance: he's a rich prince; who cares what he looks like? Fair enough. What, if anything, does he do for a living? He's the CEO of Kingdom Holding Company (KHC), through which he maintains a range of diverse business interests. Such as? He owns a chunk of News Corp, 10% of Disneyland Paris, a bite of Apple, the Fairmont Hotels group and quite a lot of other stuff. And KHC is the largest foreign investor in the US. Yes, but what has he invested in lately? He recently purchased a $300m (\u00a3192m) stake in Twitter. You can't buy Twitter. It's just words that float across the air, like clouds. Twitter is a micro-blogging site, and a company valued at up to $10bn. Well I don't pay for it, so they can't be making any money. Actually it made $140m in advertising this year. OK, but even at that rate it doesn't sound like he'll be making his investment back any time soon. He's probably expecting big growth, especially in the Middle East. The volume of tweets in Arabic is 22 times what it was a year ago, thanks largely to the role Twitter played in the Arab Spring. A big fan of social networking as a tool to facilitate popular uprising, is he? Unlikely. The prince is the nephew of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. So he's buying a stake to silence the masses! He hates freedom! Also unlikely. The prince holds rather progressive views on women's rights and elections, and is most likely investing for financial reasons. Does the prince tweet? There's no evidence that he ever has, but his wife, Princess Ameerah (@AmeerahAltaweeL), tweets all the time, and has 85,000 followers. Do say: \"There are great changes sweeping across the Middle East, and somebody needs to figure how to monetise that.\" Don't say: \"I'll follow you, your Royal Highness, but only if you follow me back.\"",
