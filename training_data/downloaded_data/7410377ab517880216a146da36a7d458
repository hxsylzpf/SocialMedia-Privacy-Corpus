  "content": "Facebook has acquired fellow Silicon Valley startup FriendFeed, in the clearest sign yet that it plans to extend its lead over rivals such as MySpace and Twitter. The world's largest social networking company said it was acquiring its Californian neighbour for an undisclosed sum \u2013 believed to be in the tens of millions of dollars \u2013 in an attempt to hire \"the best engineers\". \"Since I first tried FriendFeed, I've admired their team for creating such a simple and elegant service for people to share information,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and chief executive of Facebook. \"As this shows, our culture continues to make Facebook a place where the best engineers come to build things quickly that lots of people will use.\" FriendFeed, which was founded in by a quartet of former Google employees in 2007 but still has just 12 employees, has gained a devout following of more than a million users with its all-in-one approach to social networking. It allows members to interact with a variety of different websites from a single place, plugging into popular sites like Blogger, Facebook, Digg and YouTube as well as a host of others. While the site's fast pace and overwhelming approach has proved baffling to some, others have claimed its focus on short, conversational messages could also prove a possible rival to Twitter. In recent months, Facebook has made a significant number of changes that aped FriendFeed's approach, including changing user homepages to it what it has called its \"real-time stream\". The acquisition will bring the company's team of engineers to Facebook \u2013 and while for the moment FriendFeed will remain a standalone product, it is expected that many of its systems will be integrated more fully with Facebook in time. \"As my mom explained to me, when two companies love each other very much, they form a structured investment vehicle,\" said the FriendFeed chief executive, Bret Taylor, in a blog post on the company website. \"We've always been great admirers of Facebook, and our companies share a common vision. Now we have the opportunity to bring many of the innovations we've developed at FriendFeed to Facebook's 250 million users around the world.\" The company's co-founders include Taylor, Jim Norris, Sanjeev Singh and Paul Buchheit \u2013 who all found success as engineers in Google, and led products including Google Maps and Gmail. They initially funded the company themselves, before raising $5m funding last year from Benchmark Capital, a Californian venture firm with offices in London and Israel. What they're saying around the web: In an interview with Silicon Valley news blog TechCrunch, Bret Taylor said that it was \"an 11th hour deal\" and that \"The basic idea is that Facebook doesn't want to disrupt the product\". Blogger Robert Scoble, one of FriendFeed's most evangelical users, said that he was \"excited\" by the acquisition. \"Facebook is aiming its big guns at Google NOT Twitter,\" he said. Developer Dave Winer \u2013 a vocal proponent of open systems such as those promoted by FriendFeed \u2013 said that the acquisition was \"bad news\" for the site's users. Talking to Kara Swisher, Facebook's director of product Chris Cox said that it was important to compete against Twitter, which has stolen a march on both its bigger rival and smaller competition (as well as turning down a reported $500m buyout from Facebook) in the area of real-time information. \"I think all this stuff is evolving very quickly and and at the speed of light and there are not many that understand it at a deep level,\" he said.",
