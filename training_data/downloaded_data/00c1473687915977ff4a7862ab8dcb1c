  "content": "The media \"should not get too worried\" about the implications of the ruling by Justice Morland in Naomi Campbell's lawsuit against the Mirror, says a solicitor specialising in privacy issues. Sarah Thomas, a solicitor for Charles Russell, said today that Naomi Campbell's lawyer, Keith Schilling, was \"disingenous\" in saying that today's ruling established a law protecting the privacy of celebrities. Ms Thomas's assessment was reinforced by the editor of the Independent, Simon Kelner, who said today's case was too \"narrow\" to set any precedent in terms of de facto privacy law. \"I don't think this will significantly change the processes adopted by or the checks made by the press before a story is published,\" Ms Thomas said today. \"Some people are saying, 'If they are prepared to recognise that breach of confidence law extends to personal confidential information then why don't the court go a step further and recognise privacy?'.\" \"But the court of appeal has made it clear that it is not prepared to do this.\" The ruling today is \"consistent with the gradual extension of the law in this area which has been developing since the early 1990's before the Human Rights Act,\" she said. \"It is important for the media to understand that in this case Naomi Campbell did not pursue damages purely for invasion of privacy.\" She said the damages paid to Campbell were awarded for breach of her confidentiality, rather than for invasion of privacy. \"Although the court had to consider her right to privacy as part of her breach of confidence, the decision was not inconsistent with what the court of appeal said in the footballer case,\" she added. She was referring to the People's success in overturning a previous injunction banning it from naming a Premiership footballer in a \"kiss-and-tell\" case. The court of appeal overturned a high court ruling banning the paper from identifying the footballer. Lord chief justice Lord Woolf ruled that \"any interference with the press\" by courts in privacy cases \"had to be justified\". Mr Kelner said: \"I don't think this case or the one of the footballer or Sarah Cox amounts to a test case for the press. When we get to a case where a newspaper is taken to court over the human rights convention by a politician over his privacy rights after serious investigative journalism then that ruling will have wider implications. \"This is a narrow ruling on a very narrow case.\"",
