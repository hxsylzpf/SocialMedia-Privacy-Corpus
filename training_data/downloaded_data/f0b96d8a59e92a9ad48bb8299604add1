  "content": "Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham murderer Ian Huntley, will apply early next year for an order protecting her new identity and restricting media coverage, it emerged at the high court today. Mr Justice Eady was told that a two-day hearing, to start on February 23, would not be contested by the media. Ms Carr's counsel, Edward Fitzgerald QC, said today that she wanted a \"Mary Bell-type\" order - a reference to the 60s child killer. A similar anonymity was granted to Robert Thompson and John Venables following their release from prison after serving time for the murder of toddler James Bulger. In July, Ms Carr's lawyers successfully asked Mr Justice Mitting for a tightening of an existing order protecting her new life. The injunction now in place bans the publication of any details that could reveal her new identity, including any description of where she lives and the nature of her work. Ms Carr, 27, was convicted a year ago of conspiring to pervert the course of justice with Huntley, who killed schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. She provided a false alibi for Huntley by lying to police about her whereabouts on the weekend in August 2002 when the 10-year-olds were murdered. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
