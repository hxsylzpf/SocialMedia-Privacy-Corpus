  "content": "\u2022 Lord Butler of Brockwell, the former cabinet secretary and a member of the intelligence and security committee, has strongly criticised the government for rushing its emergency surveillance bill through parliament in just three days. Speaking in the bill's second reading debate in the Lords, Butler said that he supported the aims of the bill, but opposed the decision to push it through parliament so quickly. Why has parliament been given so little time to consider this bill? The two issues which it addresses have been apparent for weeks, indeed months ... Butler said that the government had been discussing the need for new legislation with internet companies ever since the European court of justice ruled against the EU's data retention directive in April. So the government was discussing this problem with Microsoft and Yahoo and other providers. Why was it not willing to discuss the issue similarly with select committees of parliament? And if the government could reach a conclusion about the necessity of this legislation one week before the Commons went into recess, it beggars belief that it could not have reached that conclusion three weeks before the recess, and thus given parliament proper time to consider the bill. Butler said that the government did consult widely on proposals to extend surveillance legislation two years ago. That draft bill was widely criticised. But there was no consultation on this bill, he said, even though its scope was more limited. Those how take a conspiracy view of government might be tempted to speculate that having burnt its fingers through consultation on the communication data bill, the government thought it wiser to bounce parliament rather than to run the same risk again. Lord King of Bridgwater, the Conservative former Northern Ireland secretary, also said in the debate he was concerned about the amount of time allowed for MPs and peers to debate the bill. And the Labour peer Lord Knight of Weymouth also said the government's handling of the bill had been \"a disgrace\". But all three main parties back the bill, and it is certain to pass its second reading later tonight. King, a former chair of the intelligence and security committee, also said he supported the Labour proposal for a rule saying the ISC should always be chaired by a member of the opposition. \u2022 Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy leader, has accused David Cameron of lying at PMQs. (See 2.41pm.) In a letter to the prime minister, she said that he misrepresented an interview she gave to LBC. You claimed at PMQs today that \"yesterday Labour announced - in an important announcement - that it is now their policy to put up taxes on middle income people\". This is not true. It is a lie ... In her letter Harman quoted what she said in full. See 12.42pm. Then she went on: It is utterly clear that this is not a call for higher taxes, but a defence of a system which has previously commanded wide support, in which people on middle incomes contribute more than people on lower incomes. \u2022 Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, has confirmed that the Conseratives will bring forward plans to \"curtail\" the role of the European court of human rights in its election manifesto. Speaking on the World at One he said: We will curtail the role of the European convention on human rights in the UK. We will replace Labour's Human Rights Act (enshrining the convention in British law). We will have a balance of rights and responsibilities in our law, which I think is very important, and we will have a Supreme Court that is supreme. That gives a very clear sense of direction, of the big change which is what I think we need. \u2022 Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has strongly criticised Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, for threatening to veto Lord Hill as Britain's European commissioner. (See 2.41pm.) This is a declaration of war by Schulz on the choice of the British government. How dare Martin Schulz interfere in the British nomination of European commissioner and prejudge what the decision of the MEPs will be. He is supposed to an independent chairman, but he has demonstrated absolutely no respect for national democracy or national government. And where he even gets the idea that Jonathan Hill is a Eurosceptic is completely beyond me. \u2022 Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has announced a new inspection regime for failing care homes. \u2022 Labour has said that David Cameron should be forced to give evidence to a Lords committee about his decision not to make the leader of the Lords, Lady Stowell, a full member of the cabinet. Lady Royall, the Labour leader in the Lords, said that when she heard how Cameron was treating Stowell, she was \"deeply dismayed that the prime minister could treat this House with such contempt. In a mini debate in the Lords, Lady Scotland, a Labour former attorney general, said the decision was \"a constitutional outrage\". Lord Forsyth, a Conservative former cabinet minister, said the move meant that for the first time in history there was now no full member of the cabinet sitting in the Lords. \u2022 A Conservative MP has accused John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, of swearing at the outgoing clerk of the Commons. In a mini debate held to allow MPs to pay tribute to Sir Robert Rogers, who is retiring, Michael Fabricant said: We don't know why [Rogers] has chosen to retire early - though his working environment behind closed doors has not always been easy, as those in the know have already alluded, and in that respect despite Sir Robert having studied Anglo Saxon at Oxford and being told at least once in front of others to f.*.*.* off by you Mr Speaker, I think that wouldn't have encouraged him to stay. Bercow said: \"I'll ignore that last observation which suffered from the disadvantage of being wrong.\" That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is a short afternoon reading list. \u2022 George Eaton at the Staggers says it is now not clear what David Cameron stands for, apart from wanting to win. Rather than Macmillanite pragmatism, much of the 2010 intake espouses the doctrinaire liberalism of the free-market right. Shortly before the end of her prime ministership in 1990, Margaret Thatcher declared: \"Do not say it is time for something else! Thatcherism is not for a decade. It is for centuries!\" It is a sentiment with which many of the Tory intake of 2010 would concur. By contrast, beyond the dry technocracy of deficit reduction and a self-destructive war over Europe, it is unclear what the purpose of another five years of Cameronism, let alone a century, would be. \"This wasn't Cameron's last reshuffle, it was Lynton's [Crosby] first,\" one Conservative MP told me. Under the aegis of the Australian strategist, the previously shambolic Conservative Party is being moulded into a disciplined war machine that Tory MPs believe is capable of routing Labour next May. Optimists on the Tory side and pessimists on the Labour side maintain that \"the fundamentals\" \u2013 economic competence and political leadership \u2013 favour the Conservatives. But as he and his new cabinet approach the battlefield, the Prime Minister should ask himself what he now stands for, other than a desire to win. \u2022 Alex Stevenson at politics.co.uk says David Cameron ended up snubbing the Lords, by not making its leader a full member of the cabinet, because he did not want to downgrade William Hague. This is about symbolism - and the perception within the Lords that the prime minister is utterly disinterested in its doings. \"Ministers are quite good at forgetting to think about the consequences of things in the Lords,\" says Meg Russell of the UCL's Constitution Unit. \"And the Lords jumps up and bites them.\" Cameron has chosen to insult peers instead of Hague. It's a gamble which could cause huge problems as his government tries to push through the coalition's final batch of legislation before next year's election. As Russell warns: \"If the Lords becomes cut adrift, it becomes more unpredictable.\" Peers have now started debating the second reading of the emergency data retention and investigatory powers bill. The list of peers speaking is here. I will not be covering the debate in full - the government's arguments for the bill have already been set out at length, and the second reading is due to go through without a vote - but I will report any highlights from the opening of the debate. And the reshuffle is still carrying on. Anne Milton has been made a whip. Harriet Harman has responded to what David Cameron said at PMQs about her comments about tax on LBC yesterday. (See 2.41pm.) A colleague points out that Andrew Selous, the new prisons minister, is also an Old Etonian. (See 3.37pm.) That means two of the four government appointments announced by David Cameron today have gone to Old Etonians. In the Lords Lord Forsyth, the former Conservative cabinet minister, is asking an urgent question about Lady Stowell's appointment as the new leader of the Lords. He says the Lords standing orders say the leader of the Lords should be a full member of the cabinet. Stowell has the right to attend cabinet, but she is not a full member. This is the first time the Lords does not contain a member of the cabinet, he says. Stowell says that she is confident she has the authority she needs. She is someone who gets things done, she says. Lady Royall, the Labour leader in the Lords, says she did not believe it when told that Stowell was not a full member of the cabinet. She was dismayed when told it was true, she says. She says she will refer this to the Lords constitution committee. She says she wants David Cameron to give evidence to it. She says Labour would reverse this arrangement. And she asks what precedent there is for a political party topping up the salary of a cabinet minister. Stowell says carefull consideration is being given to the propriety of any arrangements. \u2022 Labour says David Cameron should have to give evidence to a Lords committee to explain why he has not made Lady Stowell, the new Lords leader, a full member of the cabinet. More on the new reshuffle appointments. (See 2.41pm.) Labour point out that the Lord Ashton of Hyde, who's just been made a whip, is an Old Etonian. If you're interested in attending a different Question Time, and you live near Marlborough, an old colleague of mine, Michael Kallenbach, is chairing a Question Time debate tomorrow night. On the panel are: Lord Whitty, the former Labour party general secretary; Laura Sandys, the Conservative MP; Lord Tyler, the Lib Dem peer; Neil Hamilton, the Ukip deputy chairman; and Ryan Bourne, head of policy at the Institute of Economic Affairs. It's in the Ellis Theatre at Marlborough College and it starts at 8pm. Tickets are \u00a310 on the door. The Conservative MP Christopher Pincher has been in touch to say he thinks it is a bit unfair to report that Michael Gove lost his first vote as chief whip. (See 2.41pm.) Fair enough. But if it was the government's line to abstain, why were 16 MPs voting against? Perhaps it would be more accurate to describe it as Gove's first backbench revolt. \u2022 Labour has accused David Cameron of being \"deeply dishonest\" after Cameron used a quote from Harriet Harman to imply that Labour wanted to raise taxes for people on middle incomes. Cameron deployed the quote at PMQs, where he challenged Ed Miliband to explain his plans to raise taxes. Yesterday Labour announced in an important announcement that it is now their policy to put up taxes on middle-income people. Perhaps you can get to your feet and tell us which taxes on which people? But Labour said that Harman was just defending the current, progressive tax system that involves the rich paying (and a fair reading of what is a slightly garbled quote suggests Labour is right - see 12.42pm.) Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, told the World at One: [Harman] was saying what is the status quo at the moment in terms of the different [tax] bands. And for Cameron to try and take that out and turn that into some sort of new policy from Labour \u2013 which it is absolutely not \u2013 I think does politics a discredit. And a Labour party spokesman said: The Labour Party wants to cut taxes for middle and low earners. Harriet Harman was clearly talking about the tax system as it is now where people on lower incomes pay less tax. It is deeply dishonest of David Cameron to suggest otherwise. \u2022 Cameron has told MPs that he wants Lord Hill, his choice for Britain's next European commissioner, to be given an economic portfolio. Speaking at PMQs Cameron said: I think there is an opportunity to make sure that Britain has an important portfolio, one where we can maximise our influence in the areas that we care about most - and those are areas to do with our economy - and we will look and work very hard to do that. I think that Lord Hill, with his experience in the previous Conservative government and in this government, holding as it is the equivalent post that Baroness Ashton held before she became a commissioner, will do a very good job for our country. \u2022 Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, has suggested that Lord Hill could be rejected by the parliament as a European commissioner because of his \"radical anti-European views\". According to German media, Schulz told German radio: I can't imagine that Hill, with his radical anti-European views, which he is supposed to have, will get a majority in the European Parliament ... It remains to be seen whether Mr Hill is unprejudiced towards us, and on that will depend whether he gets a majority. Cameron's spokesman said the European parliament has the opportunity to approve or reject a new commission \"as a whole, as a slate, not as individuals\". \u2022 Cameron has said that, although he is not personally in favour of legalising euthanasia, he would be in favour of MPs debating the topic. Peers are debating an assisted dying bill on Friday. Asked about this at PMQs, Cameron said: I think it is good a debate is being held and I am sure it will be worthwhile reading the debate that takes place on Friday in the other place. I am very happy for a debate to be held here and of course there are now opportunities for backbenchers to hold debates in the chamber and I am sure the new Leader of the House of Commons who I am sure we all want to welcome to his place, will be listening carefully to that request. For myself I am not convinced that further steps need to be taken, I worry about legalising euthanasia and people might be being pushed into things that they don't actually want for themselves, but by all means let's have the debate. \u2022 Cameron has defended his decision to award knighthoods to MPs and former ministers. Following reports that three ministers sacked in the reshuffle are to get knighthoods (see 11.16am), Labour's Jonathan Reynolds said at PMQs that Cameron had \"given more knighthoods to men that he has sacked than he has given cabinet jobs to women\". Cameron replied: I make no apology for saying that I think in public life we should recognise public service, people who have worked hard, people who have contributed to our nation, contributed to our government. I think that is a good thing to do. \u2022 Cameron has refused to say whether he will publish his tax return. Although he indicated in 2012 that he would before the general election, when Labour's Fiona O'Donnell asked him at PMQs when he would keep his promise, Cameron sidestepped the question. Later a No 10 source said Cameron was willing to publish his tax return \"in principle\" but described it as a \"complex issue. The source said: In principle, he is willing to do that - he is looking at the detail. It will take as long as it takes. It's a complex issue. \u2022 The Office of National Statistics has revealed that a sharp rise in the number of jobs and a fall in unemployment only lifted average wages by a fraction in May, leaving workers to suffer another cut in living standards. \u2022 Downing Street has said that Cameron is pushing for the extension of targeted European sanctions against Russia in response to its behaviour in Ukraine. As the Press Association reports, the EU has already introduced travel bans and asset freezes targeted at individual members of President Vladimir Putin's inner circle after Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea, and is preparing wider sectoral sanctions to be implemented if Moscow fails to de-escalate the stand-off with its neighbour. Downing Street said Cameron would use a gathering of the 28 EU leaders in Brussels tonight to argue for the extension of targeted sanctions and the continued discussion of potential wider economic measures. Cameron's official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: The EU has been working now for some time on a list of further possible measures. The prime minister is pretty clear that there is a good case for going further in terms of targeted sanctions. \u2022 Cameron has announced three new government appointments. They include Lord Ahmad, previously a whip, even though it was reported this morning that he had been overheard (by a Labour councillor) describing the reshuffle as \"chaos\" and the new Treasury minister Priti Patel as \"inexperienced\" and \"a PR girl\". \u2022 The UN human rights chief has criticised Britain's rush through parliament this week of the new emergency law on surveillance and data retention. \u2022 Miliband is planning to meet Barack Obama in Washington next week, it has emerged. \u2022 Michael Gove, the new chief whip, has lost his first vote in the Commons. Labour MPs staged a surprise vote on a 10-minute rule bill motion proposing that the Office for Budget Responsibility should be allowed to audit opposition spending plans. Labour won by 203 votes to 16. The vote will have no practical impact, but it is mildly embarrassing for Gove. UPDATE AT 3.20PM: The Conservative MP Christopher Pincher has been in touch to say he thinks it is a bit unfair to report that Michael Gove lost his first vote as chief whip. Fair enough. But if it was the government's line to abstain, why were 16 MPs voting against? Perhaps it would be more accurate to describe it as Gove's first backbench revolt. \u2022 Nick Clegg has mocked the Daily Mail for its sexist coverage of the women ministers being promoted yesterday. \u2022 Clegg has insisted the Liberal Democrats will keep the Britain government \"anchored firmly in the heart of the European Union\", after the new Conservative defence secretary said Cameron has appointed a Eurosceptic cabinet to match the mood of the country. This is what journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs on Twitter. For Cameron Here are people saying or implying that Cameron won. Draw And Sky's Joey Jones implies it was a draw. General comments I can't find anyone giving it to Miliband. But here are some general comments that are interesting. PMQs Verdict: The smoke is starting to clear. We now know rather more about what Harriet Harman did and did not say on LBC yesterday than we did at 12.13pm when the exchanges between David Cameron and Ed Miliband came to an end. Although I'm prepared to accept that what Harman said was theoretically ambiguous (see 12.42pm), no honest journalists would have written that up as a call for Labour to raise taxes on people on middle incomes because, when reporting politics, it is important to pay attention to what people mean as well as what they say, and it is fairly clear that Harman was just defending progressive taxation. So, in one sense, this is just a 30-minute fuss about nothing. But it is also indicative of exactly how the Conservatives intend to fight Labour between now and the general election; by running a classic \"Labour will raise your taxes\" scare. (For another good example, take a look again at the opening of the Queen's speech debate in June.) Miliband's problem is that he has not got a robust response and, despite what people tell pollsters about being willing to pay more to fund the NHS, the New Labour credo about it being impossible for a tax-raising party to win an election is probably a sound one. Deploying the Harman quote in his penultimate answer clearly enabled Cameron to throw Miliband off his stride and he ended quite powerfully. I try to judge PMQs by imagining what neutral observers would think at the end of the exchanges and at that point I think they would have given it to Cameron - even though goal-line technology (or the equivalent - see 12.42pm) subsequently revealed the existence of a bit of cheating. Earlier, though, Miliband was good, and his first question was particularly good. He correctly identified when Cameron was dodging the question about why Michael Gove was sacked, and wisely, having made the point about Gove, he did not labour the point, but instead moved on. Today Gove gave Miliband the chance for a good hit. But Gove's demotion means that he will no longer be such a valuable hate-figure for Labour, and the exchanges illustrated how, long-term, the removal of Gove does not help Labour. Overall, then, and knowing now what Harman actually said, I would say this will be remembered pretty much as a draw. Labour sources are accusing David Cameron of being \"deeply dishonest\" and \"lying\" about what Harriet Harman was saying on LBC. She was not advocating higher taxes for people on middle incomes, they say. On the Daily Politics Labour's Liz Kendall has just been asked about the Harman quote. Kendall said Harman was just defending progressive taxation. Those helpful people from CCHQ have now send out the Harriet Harman quote that David Cameron used earlier. It is from her new LBC phone in. Here is the full transcript. The Tories have highlighted one sentence in bold. Questioner: I would like to know what you are going to do to help the middle classes of England, Britain. I really do feel the middle class contribute the most and take out the least. I will be honest I am a staunch Conservative, hand on heart but if Labour came up with one policy that would genuinely help me out I would vote for them. Iain Dale: Like what? Questioner: Well my suggestion would be if I lost my job the government would pay, say I have been working for 2 years the government would match my wage for 3 months afterwards. Give me some security. Harriet Harman: Well I think that is a very interesting point actually Henry because sometimes people feel that they pay in a lot over a long period of time working hard but when they suddenly need unemployment benefit if they lose their job that actually it is nowhere near enough to actually make them feel that it was worth it for them to contribute. And one of the things that we are talking about is making a higher rate the longer you've worked to recognise the contributions you've paid in if you lose your job. But I would say Henry one of the things that I would argue that might, should probably make a really big difference to you is having a really good health service. Because you don't want to have to pay for health insurance.You don't want to have to pay to go private to get really good healthcare system. And I think that is not just for working class people it's for middle class people as well. And the same with education, you know, really good school system that helps people from lower income families and middle income families as well so I think that actually the idea that there are some things that help people on low incomes and other that help people on middle incomes. Yes I think people on middle incomes should contribute more through their taxes. But actually they need those public services like the transport system. It's a bit rambling, but it does seem as if Cameron was quoting Harman out of context. It looks more as if she was defending the status quo (ie, progressive taxation, which requires the rich to pay a higher rate of income tax than the poor -a system supported by all mainstream parties) rather than advocating a new tax for middle-income earners. But, of course, the actual wording is ambiguous, which is why Cameron was able to exploit it. Asked when he will publish his tax returns, Cameron repeats what Harriet Harman said about middle-income people paying more. The only party with a tax problem is Labour, he says. And that's it. I'll post a summary shortly. Richard Ottaway, a Conservative, asks about the assisted dying bill in the Lords tomorrow. Does Cameron agree that MPs should debate this too. Cameron says it is good a debate is being held. It will be worth reading it. He would be happy to have a debate here, he says. MPs can arranged for debates in the Commons. The new Commons leader, William Hague, is listening. But Cameron says, for himself, he would not want to move toward legalising euthanasia. Labour's Ian Lucas asks about specialist spinal cord injury beds. Why are these beds at Stoke Mandeville being used for patients without spinal injuries? Cameron says decisions like this are matters for particular trusts. Labour's Julie Elliott says the government has got it wrong on tuition fees. Cameron says record numbers are going to university, including from low-income backgrounds, despite what Labour predicted. The government is removing the cap on the numbers that can go to university. That is the aspiration society the government wants to build, he says. Anne Marie Morris, a Conservative, asks if Cameron agrees there should be a better funding formula for rural councils, like hers in Devon. Cameron says the government has announced road and rail schemes for the south west. He will look at the funding issue. Labour's Joan Walley asks if the Treasury will fund in full changes to the NHS in north Staffordshire. Cameron says he is following the situation in Staffordshire very closely. Changes there need to take place, he says. Cameron says it is \"striking\" that the US has 100,000 fracking wells dug, but Europe has only about 100. Fracking is vital for the future of our country, he says. Labour's Dan Jarvis asks Cameron if he will support the Lights Out campaign, encouraging people to turn lights out on 4 August to remember the centenary of the first world war. Cameron says he agrees. Another important event will be the reopening of the Imperial War Museum tomorrow. Labour's Pat McFadden asks what portfolio he hopes Lord Hill will get in Brussels. Cameron says every MP should pay tribute to Cathy Ashton for the work she did as the EU's foreign minister. There is now an opportunity for Britain to get an important portfolio, in the areas it cares about most, like the economy. Hill, like Ashton, was leader of the Lords before going to Brussels. Julian Smith, a Conservative, asks about today's small business bill. Cameron says the government wants to make Britain the best place to start a small business. Labour's Jack Straw asks if Cameron agrees that the attorney general should be independent, should defend the rule of law and should speak truth to power. Why was Dominic Grieve sacked? Cameron says it is vitally important that the attorney general gives unvarnished advice. But in government it is sometimes right to bring on new people. Andrew Jones, a Conservative, asks about rolling out super-fast broadband in Yorkshire. Cameron thanks Jones, and the people in Harrogate, for the warm welcome they gave him when he visited the Tour de France. Labour's Huw Irranca-Davies says taxpayers were robbed of \u00a31bn by the sale of the Royal Mail. Cameron says he disagrees. The government achieved the successful privatisation of the Royal Mail, he says. Cameron says he commends the bravery of everyone who has spoken out about their experience with eating disorders. Labour's Gareth Thomas asks Cameron if he welcomes the news that any woman not having equal pay will have their pay topped up with Tory funds. Cameron says he is happy to confirm that Lady Stowell, the new leader of the Lords, will do the same job as her male predecessor, and receive the same money. Snap PMQs Verdict: Miliband won the early exchanges, but the Harriet Harman quote - which may or may not have been taken out of context; I have no idea, because I have not seen the full thing - gave Cameron the advantage at the end. Miliband says Cameron has the worst record on living standards of any prime minister. Can Cameron confirm that average pay is down \u00a31,600 since the election, but that the top 1% took home an extra \u00a315bn because of the top rate tax cut. Cameron says Harriet Harman said yesterday people on middle-incomes should contribute more through their taxes. That is the squeezed middle. Labour should say who would pay more. The Tories would cut taxes, he says. Miliband says this is \"desperate stuff\". He has nothing to say about living standards. We have a cost of living standards we cannot deny, and a prime minister we can't believe. Cameron says in his party the leader reshuffles the cabinet; in Labour the shadow cabinet wants to reshuffle the leader. Miliband says he still does not know why Gove was sacked. This recovery is not benefitting more working people. Some 7m people in work are in poverty. Is the economy working for them? Camneron says employment is up by 254,000 this quarter. He quotes other figures. Since the election there are 1.8m more people in work. And long-term youth unemployment is lower than in 2010. It is \"disappointing\" pay is not rising faster. But he quotes the IFS as saying that it would be astonishing if living standards had not fallen because of the great recession. And Labour was to blame for that, he says. Miliband says Cameron is in his fifth year as prime minister. Many young people are living with their parents. And their living standards have fallen especially badly. Cameron says Labour announced yesterday it was their policy to increase taxes on middle-income people. Ed Miliband says he always said he would support the government when it does the right thing. So he congratulates him on getting rid of Michael Gove. Why did he demote him? Cameron says Sir George Young has been in the Commons for more than 40 years. And so when it came to replacing him, he wanted the best candidate. Miliband quotes what Cameron used to say about Gove: wanting him to carry on for many year. So why did he do it? Cameron says Gove achieve more academies, a record number of free schools, rising standards and reforms that will enjoy. Miliband will do anything to avoid talking about the economy, he says. Cameron says he is aware of the problems with the rail system in East Anglia. The transport department will give it its urgent attention. Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck asks about Cameron's commitment to equality, and asks why 75% of the cabinet are still male. Cameron says she is being \"churlish\". Labour's last cabinet had four full women members. His cabinet now has five. And, as for the Tory members of the cabinet, a third are women, he says. This is from the Daily Mirror's James Lyons. It's going to be a good day for Yorkshire at PMQs, apparently. PMQs starts in about 15 minutes. It is the last before the summer recess. And, with the unemployment figures out, it is likely to be dominated by the economy - the key electoral battleground. For David Cameron, the key point about the figures is that they show employment at a record high. And, for Ed Miliband, the key points is that wages are still rising by less than inflation. My colleague Phillip Inman has set this out in his story about the figures. Here's how it starts. A sharp rise in the number of jobs and a fall in unemployment could only lift average wages by a fraction in May, leaving workers to suffer another cut in living standards, according to official figures. Unemployment fell to 6.5% of the workforce and employment edged higher to another record of 30.6m, but a 0.7% rise in wages, excluding bonuses, was well short of the 1.5% May inflation rate. Including bonuses, wage growth was just 0.3%. Average wages have remained below inflation during the recovery of the last 18 months. Forecasters have predicted an imminent return to above-inflation rises in wages over the last year, only for each month's official figures to prove them wrong. A rise in inflation last month to 1.9% and the fall in total average wages from 0.8% to 0.3% appears to show the situation worsening. The Office for National Statistics argues that the cut in the 50p top rate of tax to 45p in 2013 triggered a shift in bonus payments that make comparisons with last year difficult. However, the median measure of average wages is only alleviated a little when bonuses are excluded and wage rises climb to 0.7%. And my colleague Graeme Wearden has more details in his business live blog. If you haven't already, do read the coverage of the reshuffle in today's Guardian. Guardian stories are always excellent, of course, but today's article - including the splash, Patrick Wintour's analysis of why Michael Gove was sacked, but not Iain Duncan Smith and Nicholas Watt's behind-the-scenes write-through - are especially good. As for the rest of the papers, here are three reshuffle articles I found particularly interesting. \u2022 Francis Elliott and Greg Hurst in the Times (paywall) say three figures - Lynton Crosby, the Tories' election guru, Craig Oliver, David Cameron's communications chief, and Ed Llewellyn, his chief of staff - were primarily behind the decision to demote Gove. Of the three, Mr Crosby posed the greatest threat. A senior figure in the Conservative's new party headquarters said that the Australian, while admiring Mr Gove's intellectual abilities as a \"think-tank on legs\", was dismayed by the flow of controversy from his department. In all the focus groups and surveys, Mr Gove achieved the unwanted double of being recognised and disliked by the public. One recent YouGov poll found that 57 per cent of the public could correctly identify him as education secretary, but that 55 per cent thought he was doing badly at the job. The picture that emerged of polling in marginal seats was said to be even starker, especially in areas with high numbers of public sector workers. By association, the education reforms that were once seen as an electoral asset were becoming \"toxic\", according to one senior Conservative. In private presentations, Mr Crosby again and again drew the contrast with Jeremy Hunt who has largely succeeded in calming health professionals inflamed by the NHS re-organisation. \"If we could clone Hunt and put him in education we would,\" said a Downing Street figure a month ago. \u2022 Daniel Finkestein in the Times (paywall) says the two sides of William Hague reflect two strains of thinking in the Conservative party. I have always felt that there are two William Hagues. One is the Rotherham William Hague. The Yorkshire Conservative politician, brilliant parliamentary debater, partisan party man, political hobbyist still fighting the municipal socialism of the 1970s. This Hague is at home with the nostalgia of the Conservative Party, loves party conferences and wants them always to be in Blackpool. This Hague is a parliamentary and political traditionalist, can't resist a robust political joke and is at one with the Tory activists he addressed when he was 16. Then there is the other William Hague, the Hague with a first from Oxford, who worked for the blue-riband management consultant McKinsey's and went to Insead, one of the world's top business schools. The Insead Hague is a cool pragmatist, so reliant on intellect rather than emotion that his team disguised its extent, as I did with his date trick ... There is the open, free-market, international Conservatism \u2014 Insead Toryism if you like \u2014 and there is a Rotherham Conservatism, protective of traditions and the nation state and existing institutions. They are both part of the Tory identity and always will be. Yet they are sometimes uneasy bedfellows. The date trick? Finkestein (who used to work for Hague when he was Tory leader) also reveals in his column that Hague has a remarkable mathematic talent. In an idle moment years ago in an Indian restaurant near Catterick garrison, I was eating a curry with the Tory leadership team when someone mentioned a date far in the future. \"A Monday,\" responded William Hague casually. \"A what?\" I asked incredulously. \"A Monday,\" he repeated. So I began to test him. March 26, 2044? \"A Friday.\" October 14, 2031? \"A Tuesday.\" I checked. He was correct. So I congratulated him and said: \"Just one more thing, William. Brilliant though the ability you have demonstrated might be, I want you to make me a promise. Never ever, ever do that trick in public. We're in enough trouble as it is.\" \u2022 Janan Ganesh in the Financial Times (subscription) assesses William Hague's record. On top of all this, [Hague] achieved the superhuman feat of charting a sane course between the zealous euroscepticism of his party and cold diplomatic realities. He, like Mr Cameron, wants to remain in a reformed EU. This policy is nebulous and will probably end in an existential rupture of the Tory party when its fanciful expectations are dashed. But given the torrential pressure applied by the eurosceptic movement to go much further much earlier, it is a serviceable holding position. The right has come to resent him as an ideological sellout, a man suspiciously at ease with Brussels summitry and the language of compromise. This says more about their stridency than any wishy-washiness on his part. They will appreciate his successor, Philip Hammond, until he too evinces the first symptoms of euro-pragmatism. And I can't cover the papers without including the Daily Mail, which has surpassed itself for sexism in its article about the women being promoted in the reshuffle. The Green MP Caroline Lucas thinks its hit an all-time low. And my colleague Roy Greenslade has denounced the coverage in a blog. Here's an extract. For example, McVey's image was \"analysed\" by Catherine Ostler, a former editor of Tatler and a journalist whose work I generally admire, in terms of her hair, bag, dress, shoes and - would you believe it? - legs. The other eight received similar treatment. This one was \"a little bit too Eighties air hostess\". Another wore \"sensible shoes\". A third was criticised for wearing \"a bold teal jacket\" two sizes too big for her. And so on and on... An accompanying piece, written by a man - political editor James Chapman - reported that McVey \"sashayed into Downing Street\" with \"her blonde mane thrown backwards as in a shampoo advert.\" I seem to recall reading this kind of stuff in the Daily Mirror in the 1950s. We, the people, have moved on. The Mail clearly hasn't. Three Tory ministers sacked in the reshuffle are going to be given knighthoods, Joe Murphy reveals in the Evening Standard. And Ken Clarke is to become a companion of honour. Two Conservative MPs are in line to be made Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. They are Alan Duncan, who left his post as International Development Minister, and Hugh Robertson, who was a Foreign Office Minister and former Olympics Minister. Oliver Heald, who was Solicitor General until Monday night's pre-shuffle cull of \"male and pale\" ministers, will get a knighthood. It is also emerging that veteran minister Kenneth Clarke, 74, is being chosen for one of the highest honours in the gift of the Queen, which is to become a Companion of Honour. \"Retweets are not necessarily endorsements\" is the usual rule of thumb on Twitter. It's a phrase that people often feel the need to post on their Twitter home page because, more often than not, retweets are actually endorsements. And it's not wholly unreasonably to assume that, at least to some extent, that applies in the case of this tweet from Sarah Vine, the Daily Mail columnist who is married to Michael Gove. It's a link to a Daily Mail column by Max Hastings, and the words are not Vine's but the headline over the article. Here's an extract. Most of the new front-bench is no better and no worse than most governments in an age when politics has become largely a displacement activity for people unqualified for top jobs anywhere else. But the removal of Michael Gove, standard-bearer for the most important reforms in British government this century, is worse than a crime. To borrow from the early 19th-century French politician Talleyrand, it is a folly, which must dishearten every right-thinking Conservative as much as it brings glee to the teachers' unions, enemies of learning. The Prime Minister has done a bad day's work, and will surely live to regret it. Nick Clegg was asked in an interview this morning if he thought the Eurosceptic slant of the reshuffle was taking Britain nearer to the EU exit door. He said the Tories were \"talking to each other\" over Europe, not to the country. I think the Conservatives are talking to each other rather than to the country, or even the rest of Europe, about Europe. What I want to see is a reformed European Union - more competitive, more open, less bureaucratic, more open trade \u2013 but with Britain always leading in Europe. If the Conservatives want to constantly change their own policy or their own stance or the way they talk about Europe, that is for them. This government, the coalition government, because of the Liberal Democrats in it, remained anchored in the centre ground, with Britain anchored firmly in the heart of the European Union. The unemployment figures are bound to come up at PMQs. The unemployment rate as fallen to 6.5%, its lowest level since 2008. My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering the figures, and the reaction, in detail on his business live blog. I'm sorry I've been out of action for a while. But I'm in the office now and all set. Yesterday we were told that, as chief whip, Michael Gove would also be doing the \"minister for the Today programme\" role from time to time. But this morning it was the new defence secretary, Michael Fallon, filling the 8.10 slot. He also gave an interview to Sky News. Here are the main points. \u2022 Fallon hinted that the Conservative manifesto would propose some kind of action on the European convention on human rights. He refused to say if it would call for Britain's withdrawal from the convention, but he said people were not happy with the status quo. We'll have to wait for the manifesto. But I think many people have been extremely frustrated by the process by which we're able to deport people who have no connection with this country, weren't born here, aren't citizens of this country, want to commit terrorist acts against this country and we've not been able to get rid of them. Now I think most people - and it's taken years, if you remember, to get rid of some of these very well-known figures - I think most people would want reform to make sure that we can deport quickly people who threaten our security and have got no right to be here. \u2022 He rejected suggestions that the reshuffle had made the government too Eurosceptic. I think the country is pretty Eurosceptic now. You saw that at the European elections. We don't want to see Europe going on as it has been going on, harmonising and centralising. We want Europe to be more competitive, to be creating jobs, to be giving young people opportunities to be competing against the fast-growing areas of the world, to be looking outwards, to be developing trade agreements with the rest of the world. \u2022 He defended the nomination of Lord Hill as Britain's European commissioner. Lord Hill has been leader of the House of Lords, a very important job in the government. Before that he's had experience in Downing Street. He's one of those really effective political operators, a little bit behind the scenes, I grant you, you may not have seen a lot of him on television recently, but that's not the job in the commission. You've got to work behind the scenes, you've got to be an operator, you've got to build alliances and build coalitions. There are 28 member states altogether, and he's a pretty skilful behind-the-scenes operator. And I think he'll do a great job for Britain. It's the last PMQs before the summer recess. Often that's an event that ends up with MPs behaving at their worst. And today, of course, they are still digesting the impact of the reshuffle. You can read the Guardian's main story about it here. Here's the agenda for the day. Morning: Final details of the reshuffle are due to be announced, with appointments to junior roles. 9.30am: Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, holds a press conference on hospitals in special measures. 9.30am: Unemployment figures are published. My colleague Graeme Wearden will be covering them on his business live blog. 12pm: David Cameron and Ed Miliband clash at PMQs. 2.15pm: Lin Homer, head of HM Revenue and Customs, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee. After 3pm: Peers start debating the second reading of the emergency data retention and investigatory powers bill. 4pm: Cameron arrives at Brussels for a mini-summit of EU leaders. I'm launching the blog now so that it is open for comments but, for family reasons, I'm not going to be in the office until about 10am, and so I won't start blogging properly until then. But if any big news breaks in the meantime, a colleague may take over. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm on @AndrewSparrow.",
