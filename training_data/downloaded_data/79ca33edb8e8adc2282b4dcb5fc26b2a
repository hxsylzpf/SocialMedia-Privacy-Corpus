  "content": "David Cameron's jokey, blokey interview with Christian O'Connell on Absolute Radio this morning is a good example of what can happen when politicians attempt to be down with the kids \u2013 or in this case, with the thirtysomethings. Amid a number of passable one-liners (similar to, if slighty more risqu\u00e9 than, those the Tory leader specialises in at PMQs) it was \u2013 unfortunately for him \u2013 his use of the word \"twat\" that made the news. Asked why he didn't use the social networking website Twitter, the Tory leader said: \"The trouble with Twitter, the instantness of it \u2013 too many twits might make a twat.\" He compounded the slip-up when commenting on the MPs' expenses scandal. \"The public are rightly, I think, pissed off \u2013 sorry, I can't say that in the morning \u2013 angry with politicians,\" he said. In the same interview, Cameron said he would be happy to decide the election with a game of scissors, paper, stone to end the waiting, although expressed his concern that Gordon Brown might wait until he had played before revealing his hand. He also revealed he would be BA Baracus if he was a member of the A-Team, answered questions on which end of the bath he sat at \u2013 not at the tap end, unless his wife insisted \u2013 and which song he would listen to if granted a last piece of music. The last question gave him a chance to once more espouse his love for the Killers and his previously derided penchant for Morrissey. The \"twat\" comment is unlikely to prove a serious setback to Cameron, but it does show the dangers of this kind of interview. Remember when the Tory leader was asked by Jonathan Ross whether he fantasised about Margaret Thatcher? However, the Absolute Radio team were full of admiration afterwards, with O'Connell tweeting: \"DC. What a top bloke.\" Another member of the team blogged that Brown had never replied to requests to come on the show, Cameron's one liner about Twitter was one \"Jimmy Carr would have been proud of\", and the only complaint about language so far had been from gbrown1099@hotmail.com. But the Tory leader's aides were in defensive mode afterwards, pointing out that \"twat\" was not a swear word under radio guidelines and that Cameron had apologised immediately after the second comment.",
