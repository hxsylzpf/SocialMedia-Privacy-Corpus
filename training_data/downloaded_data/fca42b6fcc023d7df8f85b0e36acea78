  "content": "The supermodel Naomi Campbell had \"schemed and manipulated her public reputation\" and must now \"face the consequences\", the high court heard yesterday. If she had suffered distress after the Mirror published an article headlined Naomi: I am a Drug Addict, it was \"wilfully and dishonestly exaggerated\" and had lasted \"no more than five minutes\", said Desmond Browne, QC, for the paper. Her hypocrisy and criminal behaviour meant she could not complain of exposure. Nor could she complain about her treatment at Narcotics Anonymous being exposed - since treatment for drug addiction carried \"all the social stigma of being caught skiing at Gstaad\", the barrister claimed. The QC's allegations came as he completed his closing speech on the fourth day of Ms Campbell's legal action against Mirror Group Newspapers. The model, 31, is suing the paper for invasion of privacy, breach of confidence and breach of the Data Protection Act in a case which could have wide-ranging implications for the issue of privacy. The Mirror claims the model has forfeited her right to privacy by divulging the most intimate details of her life in \"hundreds if not thousands\" of press interviews. And it argues it was in the public interest to expose her since she had consistently denied she had taken drugs. Yesterday, Mr Browne insisted: \"There is no stigma attached to attending Narcotics Anonymous. The stigma only attaches to the fact of drug addiction\". As the Mirror's editor Piers Morgan had claimed in his evidence, NA was regarded as a responsible form of treatment taken by many celebrities. Referring to a comment on drug addiction treatment by a Sunday Times journalist who had interviewed the model, he added: \"The point is made memorably by Mr [Cosmo] Landesman that 'it had all the social stigma of being caught skiing at Gstaad'.\" There could be no damages since there was no harm done in mentioning this. \"Except she has lost the secret she wanted to keep secret\", Mr Justice Morland remarked. The judge, who had appeared entranced as the model gave evidence, later gave a surprise indication he now viewed her less favourably, warning her barrister, as he began his closing speech: \"I am going to fire a shot across your bows: I did find Miss Campbell a most unreliable witness.\" But he also indicated that, while damages for the initial breach of confidence could be \"really quite small\", aggravated damages - due to subsequent, negative Mirror coverage - could be \"fairly substantial\". Such coverage included a piece by the Mirror columnist Sue Carroll in which she is likened to a \"chocolate soldier\", which the judge yesterday described as an \"extremely rude and offensive article\". He also cast doubt on Ms Carroll's evidence, commenting on her claim she would use the term in front of her Jamaican sister-in-law: \"I must say, I do find that evidence surprising\". Concluding, Mr Browne said: \"We say there was no question of her suffering substantial distress. Even if she was distressed by the exposure of her drug addiction it didn't last more than five minutes and she wasn't driven out of the country.\" Turning to the law, he said that while article eight of the new Human Rights Act - brought in to incorporate the European Convention of Human Rights - established a right to privacy, article 10 asserted the right to freedom of expression and section 12 stressed that courts should pay attention to the latter. \"If that seems inequitable, it is to emphasise the importance Strasbourg puts on freedom of expression\", he explained. \"If that were not the case, then the press would be nobbled in its role of public watchdog - and the role of public watchdog is equally applicable to tabloid as to serious newspapers.\" The QC added that, in passing the Human Rights Act and the Data Protection Act - legislation on which Ms Campbell's team are drawing - parliament had stressed the newspaper industry should work as \"a self-regulatory industry. \"Any ruling against this would set Parliament at nought.\" The case, which is expected to conclude today, continues.",
