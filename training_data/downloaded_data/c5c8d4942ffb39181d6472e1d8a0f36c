While feeding the gossip culture, this could make it even harder for celebrities to lead relatively normal lives when they are not \"on duty\", so to speak. It could also increase the risk that comes from the tiny proportion of celebrity stalkers that are far from normal themselves. Papture co-founder Amanda Gold says: \"Until now, gossip hungry fans would rely on magazines and celebrity news sites for their celebrity fix. But, with the launch of papture.com, celebrity journalism is in the hands of everyone. Now anyone with a smartphone or camera can become the paparazzi.\" And if you don't care much about celebrities, at least the apps provide some indication of the hotspots you might want to visit. \"When people choose a restaurant, bar or club to go to, it's often based on who has been there before. This is giving people access to the entertainment industry's little black book of the best places to go,\" Danny Hayward of Matrix Picture Agency, the company behind CelebAround, told the London Evening Standard. The paper gave examples: \"For instance, in the last week the app shows that Kate Moss ate at J Sheekey, rock band Kasabian were staying at the Sanctum Soho Hotel, while rapper Jay-Z went to Merah nightclub in Wells Street.\" There might be a problem if a lot of amapapzis turn up at once, which could be one reason why CelebAround delays its feed. Papture doesn't. But Gold, whose co-founder is her brother Edd, says: \"In contrast to competitors, who significantly delay their feed by at least twelve hours, Papture provides real-time celebrity sightings. Our current iPhone app already offers real-time sightings and our next version, which is launching imminently, will offer live celebrity sightings; and a push alert system where the phone will buzz/vibrate when a user is within 500m of a celebrity, or their favourite selected celebrities have been spotted.\" Another advantage, says Gold, is that the amateur snappers may be on the inside, while the pros are standing around outside. I asked Gold if this would create a potential hazard for celebrities, but she said: \"Within the game of celebrity there has alwaysbeen a trade-off; give up part of your personal life in exchange forbeing able to promote your latest products. For example, a wide range of celebrities are on Twitter to promote themselves, and in exchange they let fans see into their private lives. Papture just takes this concept into real life rather than through a computer/phone. \"Major celebrities are already followed by legions of fans wherever they go: Papture is unlikely to change this. Papture will be able to provide more fans with the information, but those who actually 'follow' a celebrity are likely to be there already!\" Whether these technology-driven developments can be stopped is another matter. Location-awareness is being driven by celebrity revelations on Twitter, by social networking apps such as Foursquare and Gowalla, and by the iPhone's inclusion of geo-location data in the photos that people upload to sites such as TwitPic and Flickr. And like real paps, some amateurs could see the lure of financial gain. Both Matrix and Papture get the right to sell the pictures that users upload, and to take a percentage of the profits.",
