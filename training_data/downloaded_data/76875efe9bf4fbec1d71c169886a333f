  "content": "The sanitation department of Manhattan's lower east side will never have a cleaner car park. A stocky, shaven-headed figure in a high-visibility orange vest spent much of yesterday sweeping up dust, leaves and litter in the yard of the scruffy municipal rubbish depot. He was good at it. But then Boy George had an audience; his every stroke was being watched and commented upon by a crowd of reporters, passersby, and a handful of very faithful fans. Wielding a broom and a bin, the 1980s pop star and one-time international style icon was tasting punishment, New York style, for wasting police time. The judge deemed sweeping the streets a suitable \"exercise in humiliation or in humility\", though initial indications suggested this was proving a challenge for the singer. \"You think you're better than me?\", he snapped at one reporter. \"Go home.\" For a man used to wooing dancefloor crowds until the small hours, the day began unpleasantly for Boy George as he reported for duty shortly before 7am. Wearing a dark sweatshirt, three-quarter length shorts and wraparound sunglasses, he was dispatched to a street near Brooklyn Bridge to begin cleaning garbage out of a gutter. Life on the open road did not last long - the singer-turned-DJ was instantly mobbed by such a large crowd of photographers that he barely had space to swing his brush. After sweeping dust into the lens of one television camera, he pointed out that the task was supposed to be service to the community: \"You're just making it a nightmare which just means it's for the media and not for me. It's just impractical having you fucking chasing me around. Fuck off. Go away.\" Little more than 10 minutes into the job, Boy George's predicament was alleviated as his supervisor deemed it too dangerous to continue. The pop star was ferried back to the local depot to complete his day's work on private property, with a mesh fence separating him from observers. Albert Durrell, deputy chief of Manhattan borough's sanitation department, said the attention was a problem: \"It wasn't so much because of the press. You can't really tell who's who. God forbid you might have some lunatic out there and I would be concerned for his safety. In fact, not just for his safety - for the safety of the citizens of New York.\" The former lead singer of Culture Club, whose hits include Karma Chameleon, is serving penance for an incident in 2004 in which he summoned police to his New York apartment to report a break-in. Officers found no sign of an intruder but they did stumble upon 13 bags of cocaine. The 45-year-old star, born George O'Dowd, insisted the drugs did not belong to him but were the result of a party at which he had not been present. In a plea bargain, narcotics charges were dropped in return for a $1,000 (\u00a3530) fine and litter-picking duties. Asked yesterday whether his client felt any remorse, Boy George's manager, Jeremy Pearce, said: \"I think he feels annoyed with himself for what he did - although it's not entirely clear what it was he did do.\" As the day wore on, Boy George's sweeping style became more fluid. Before long, he was able to fill his pan with detritus, pirouette and dispose of it into his portable bin without moving from the spot. Regulations allowed him two 15-minute breaks during the day, plus half an hour for lunch. Boy George remains a hero to a clique of fans who recall his brazen cross-dressing 1980s style and flamboyant rhythms. Joanne Joseph turned up to watch her hero's menial duties yesterday after rising before dawn to make the trip from Rhode Island to New York. \"He's gonna get through this - this isn't a big deal for him,\" she said. \"I saw him go through his problems in the 80s, he came back to be number one and he'll be number one again. I care about him deeply and I'm a fan no matter what.\"",
