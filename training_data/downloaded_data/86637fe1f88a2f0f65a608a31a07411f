  "content": "The millionaire Spanish owner of Hello! magazine yesterday said he was sorry for the upset caused to Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas after he published unauthorised pictures of their lavish wedding. But Eduardo Sanchez Junco accused the couple of overstating the extent of their distress in court last week. \"I think their attitude was a little bit exaggerated,\" he told the high court in London. Zeta-Jones, 33, described feeling \"violated\" by the paparazzi pictures printed in Hello! magazine after her wedding to Douglas, 58, at the Plaza Hotel in New York, in November 2000. Asked by Michael Tugendhat QC, counsel for the Douglases, whether he would now apologise, Mr Sanchez said through a translator: \"Obviously, in any way I have offended her, yes.\" But Mr Sanchez insisted that Hello! had always been respectful of the family. \"We've always treated them with affection before and after the wedding and I'm sorry that Mrs Douglas might be offended.\" He insisted, however, that the lawsuit was designed to protect the exclusivity of OK!'s deal rather than the Douglases' privacy. In evidence last week he claimed that the actors had offered the wedding deal to several publications, including Hello!, to maximise its worth. OK! paid \u00a31m. Yesterday, Mr Sanchez said: \"I still believe that the main reason we are here has been in defence of the interests of my competitor.\" OK!, he said, had \"plagiarised\" the style of Hello!, and he had to maintain his position in the market. OK! and the Douglases are claiming breach of confidence and invasion of privacy by Hello!, Mr Sanchez and his Uruguayan fixer, the Marquesa de Valera. The actors are seeking \u00a3500,000 in damages; OK! wants \u00a31.75m in compensation for loss of revenue. The case continues today.",
