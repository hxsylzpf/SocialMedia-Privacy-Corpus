  "content": "The News of the World expos\u00e9 of an alleged plot to kidnap Victoria Beckham was based largely on the unsupported testimony of a serial fantasist with a history of mental health problems. Last week the Crown Prosecution Service announced that all the charges relating to the kidnapping were to be dropped because the main witness, Florim Gashi, 27, was unreliable. The CPS reached this decision after learning that Gashi had been paid \u00a310,000 by the newspaper. But an Observer investigation has found that much of the evidence provided by Gashi had been fabricated and that other key elements had been engineered to support his version of events. Gashi had initially approached Mazher Mahmood, the News of the World's investigations editor, with a story about a gang selling a stolen jewelled turban, which Mahmood turned down. Gashi had previously sold two stories to Mahmood - the first about a fake passport scam and the second about drug-dealing traffic wardens. Gashi had been promised a sizeable payment in return and hoped to boost his earnings even more. Soon afterwards, in an apparently remarkable stroke of luck, Gashi hit the jackpot. He called Mahmood and explained that the same gang was planning to kidnap Victoria Beckham. The plans were at an advanced stage. One member of the gang had travelled to Italy to purchase a special 'knock-out' spray, a house in Brixton had been earmarked as the place where she would be held, while a trip to check out the Beckham home was also being planned. Gashi also told Mahmood that he had seen one gang member with a gun and that he had been asked to be the getaway driver. In reality, the 'gangsters' included Adrian Pasareanu, 28, a part-qualified doctor from Romania, and 18-year-old Alin Turcu, a fellow Romanian whose life revolved around clubbing. The pair remember Gashi as a boastful fantasist. Once Gashi told how he shot a man dead outside Battersea police station. 'They never took him seriously,' says Turcu's solicitor, Penny Muir. 'They just played along with him because he bought drinks and meals.' Mahmood was keen to pursue the story but, having already met the gang while posing as a buyer of the turban, was forced to rely on Gashi, fitting him with video recording equipment and asking him to obtain more evidence. Mahmood famously lured the Countess of Wessex into indiscretions about the Royal Family, but has also infiltrated many criminal gangs. By this time, the police had contacted Mahmood in a bid to recover the jewelled turban. Mahmood told them he was working on a story about a kidnap plot involving the same gang, which had access to guns, but he refused to name the potential victim or hand over any evidence. The police agreed to make their arrest on Saturday, 2 November. The timing was important because, once suspects are charged, newspapers cannot print details of their crimes. Arresting the suspects on a Saturday morning would give the paper a crucial window of opportunity. Mahmood only told the police whom the gang was planning to snatch at a briefing three hours before the first arrests were made. Soon afterwards, questions were being asked about Gashi's reliability. The story he had provided to Mahmood about drug-dealing traffic wardens had resulted in a file being sent to the CPS, but no charges were brought after it was concluded that Gashi had set the whole thing up. It also emerged that he had previous convictions for dishonesty and had received treatment for mental health problems. When it emerged that the same Florim Gashi was the informant on the Beckham case, alarm bells rang. In his own statements, Gashi had denied receiving any payment for any of his stories. In fact, he had been paid \u00a32,500 for the passport story, another \u00a32,500 for the traffic warden tale and \u00a35,000 for the Beckham story. Documents obtained by The Observer suggest Mahmood knew Gashi was misleading the police about his motivation. Close scrutiny of Gashi's recordings casts a new light on the story. Far from being an independent observer, it had been Gashi who first suggested the kidnap, picked the amount of the ransom and arranged a visit to the Beckham home. The Observer has also learnt that many parts of Gashi's testimony were fabricated. A key part of his story was supposed to have taken place on 23 October, when he claims Pasareanu and another member of the gang took him to central London. Once there, they met the rest of the gang, including Turcu. But Turcu could have proved that he was in France on the day in question. In short, Gashi used those around him to provide what he knew Mahmood wanted, so that he could guarantee a big payday. The two Romanians are now believed to be planning to take legal action against the News of the World. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the newspaper said that it was 'perplexed' at the decision to drop the case and that it stood by its original story.",
