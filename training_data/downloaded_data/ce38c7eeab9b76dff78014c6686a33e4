  "content": "Rarely, if ever, has St James's Palace issued such a strongly worded or emotive statement. It was a \"grotesque and totally unjustifiable\" invasion of privacy. It was \"unthinkable\" anyone should publish. And then, as if that did not fully convey the depth of their fury and disgust, the words: \"The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales.\" These were not merely the words of courtiers. These were heartfelt, and issued on the direct instructions of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. For William, who according to observers wore a face like thunder as the couple continued their far east tour on Friday, the incident must surely reignite his long simmering hatred for the paparazzi, whom he firmly believes contributed to the premature death of his mother. Diana the hunted, who was rarely able to step outside her Kensington Palace apartment without a lens being waved in her face, lived her too brief life in the glare of the paparazzi camera. As a young boy, William witnessed first hand her tears and frustration as photographers dogged her every step. It left an indelible mark on him that will probably never be erased. He knows there are no limits to such intrusive behaviour. Even while his mother was pregnant, she had no privacy. Tabloids followed her and Prince Charles on a private Caribbean holiday in 1982 where sneak pictures of a pregnant Diana were taken and splashed over newspapers. It was, the Queen said back then, \"the blackest day in the history of British journalism\". But, back then, no one could have foreseen the levels to which such intrusion would go; no one could have foreseen the events that would lead up to a Paris car crash, followed by photographers on motorbikes, on 31 August 1997. As a result, William is determined to protect the privacy of his wife. As one royal source said of the publication of the topless pictures: \"This incident turns the clock back 15 years.\" The duchess is not the first royal to appear topless in the media. Old pictures of Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, taken while she worked for Capital Radio, were obligingly published by the Sun just days before her wedding. Sarah Ferguson, the then estranged wife of the Duke of York, appeared topless and having a \"toe-job\" in the Mirror with her \"financial adviser\", the US businessman John Bryan in 1992. The previous year, the Sun had treated readers to naked pictures of \"Randy Andy\", the Duke of York. And the German tabloid Bild published pictures of a naked Prince of Wales on a balcony while on holiday near Avignon in 1994. \"His whole pride and joy is on display,\" enthused the French magazine Paris Match, which republished the pictures with the strapline \"magnifique\". Ever since William came of age, his aides have attempted to use persuasion rather than legal action to protect him. Throughout his years at St Andrews University, where he met his future wife Catherine Middleton, he was largely left alone in exchange for agreed interviews and photographs. On her 25th birthday, however, William was said to be \"absolutely furious\" as she ran the gauntlet of up to 30 photographers gathered outside her Chelsea flat. \"Prince William wants more than anything for the paparazzi to stop harassing her,\" said a Clarence House spokesman at the time. In the UK at least, persuasion seems to have worked with the agreement of editors. But, as this incident illustrates, the royal family's battle for privacy continues. And William, for one, will be determined his wife will not be forced to endure what his mother had to.",
