Enjoy just chatting in what appears to be a very nice environment @beverleyknight (Beverley Knight) hello guardian! i love to chat and actually interact with folk, esp the folk that gave me the life i lead. xxxxxx @tom_watson (Tom Watson MP) insight and knowledge, conversation and debate, friendship and fun. All the stuff you no longer find in newspapers. @tom_watson couldn't find the room to add 'except the Guardian' in the tweet :-) @courtneylover79 (Courtney Love) i like the fact that say, after 9 years plus of absolutely not speaking, within one tweet Navarro had me and Reznor saying \"Hey\"! (That's Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro and Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor)",
