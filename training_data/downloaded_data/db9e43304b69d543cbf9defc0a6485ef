  "content": "The CIA on Thursday baffled many of its watchers with a tweet written in Cyrillic, mystifying readers unlucky enough to never have taken a year of Russian in college and raising fears the account had been hacked, as a US military account was on Monday. But Russophones quickly corrected the worried masses by pointing out that the agency had simply quoted the poet and novelist Boris Pasternak, whose 1957 novel Doctor Zhivago the agency had a hand in disseminating throughout the Soviet bloc in the 1960s. \"I wrote this novel for it to be published and read,\" Pasternak's quotation reads, \"and that is still my only desire.\" A half-hour after sending out the Russian tweet, the agency rattled off a few messages about how in the 1950s and 1960s the CIA helped to publish a Russian-language edition of Doctor Zhivago, which the Soviet Union had banned for its \"anti-Soviet sentiments\". The novel spans the Russian civil war and early Soviet regimes, and has characters ranging from pro-tsar White soldiers to \"old Bolsheviks\" and the eponymous poet-doctor. It also a features a lengthy and operatic plot which was deemed by Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov to be \"a sorry thing, clumsy, trite and melodramatic, with stock situations, voluptuous lawyers, unbelievable girls, romantic robbers and trite coincidences\". But Nobel judges and CIA agents ate it up, respectively awarding Pasternak the literature prize in 1958 and helping to publish miniature editions that could be mailed into Russia by friends of the intelligentsia. A CIA memo from 1958 pronounced the work a \"piercing exposition of the effect of the Soviet system\" and an object of \"great propaganda value\", in part simply because the Soviets had banned it in the first place. While the CIA's tweet could be judged a coded message to a modern Kremlin that has recently cracked down on the press \u2013 banning profanity in art, forcing bloggers to register with the government and muzzling much of the independent press \u2013 the quote was most likely just a PR move by a spy agency eager to show off its 20th-century achievements and distract from the grim realities of its recent past. In April 2013, the intelligence agency declassified 99 documents pertaining to its efforts to get a Russian version of the book into the USSR, acceding to a freedom of information request from a journalist and academic who were co-writing a book about spies, Pasternak and propaganda.",
