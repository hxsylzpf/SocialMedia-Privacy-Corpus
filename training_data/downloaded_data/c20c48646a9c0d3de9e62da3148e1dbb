  "content": "When US investment bank Morgan Stanley sought to produce a report on teenagers' media habits, they naturally consulted an expert in the field: one of their own summer interns, 15-year-old Matthew Robson from London. His research paper was considered so ground-breaking (he says, for example, that teenagers think Twitter is pointless) that Morgan Stanley published it in full for the benefit of their media clients. Dozens of fund managers and chief executives apparently requested copies. But what do other young people think of Robson's revelations? My own personal research consultant (who insists on anonymity) may be nearly a year younger than Robson, but rest assured I walked no further than the folks at Morgan Stanley did to find him. Below, my no-less-scientific findings: Television Robson describes teenage viewing as erratic, claiming \"they will watch a particular show at a certain time for a number of weeks . . . but then they may watch no television for weeks after the programme has ended.\" My expert says: \"People don't go for weeks without watching telly.\" Gaming With consoles that connect to the internet, says Robson, online chatting between gamers is beginning to impact on mobile use: \"One can speak for free over the console and so a teenager would be unwilling to pay to use a phone.\" My consultant remains unconvinced: \"I don't know any teenagers who use their Xbox instead of a phone.\" The internet My insider concurs with Robson's assertion that \"many teenagers use YouTube to watch videos\" but disagrees with the idea that those videos are \"mainly anime\". \"It's mainly people humiliating themselves,\" he says. Newspapers Robson insists that \"No teenager that I know of regularly reads a newspaper.\" My own operative has ceased cooperating by this point, but thanks to Robson I feel able to offer my own conclusions safe in the knowledge that no teens will discover them here. Today's young persons rarely, if ever, pay for anything they can get for free. The big question then, is this: why do we care what they like?",
