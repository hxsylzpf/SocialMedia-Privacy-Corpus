  "content": "No, but it is part of a new wave of what's being called data portability, and that is going to change social networking. At present, the big social networking sites - Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, Orkut etc - operate on the walled-garden principle, which means that you have to do everything on their websites. This means that we have digital stuff all over the internet: pictures on Flickr, work contacts on LinkedIn, links to favourite bands on MySpace and hundreds of \"friends\" on Facebook. In addition to the social networking sites, there are also a squillion (or thereabouts) old-fashioned static web 1.0 sites, where the owner pumps out information that the visitor can't interact with. All of this adds up to a kind of online personality, but one that's fragmented. Friendfeed, a startup created by ex-Googlers, went some way to addressing that by providing an aggregator of what your friends are watching on YouTube, what they're listening to on last.fm, what pictures they've posted on Flickr. But you still have to go to Friendfeed to see all this stuff: it is a data silo. The next wave is data portability, and Google has come fashionably late to this party. It was beaten to it by Facebook and MySpace, who both announced last week that they are to allow their users to share their information with any other website - with Twitter, for example, or Flickr. With the new standards, you'll be able to synchronise lists of friends, status updates and share your stuff around the web. Google's approach is to create a set of tools for website owners that allow them to add social networking to their hitherto static sites. There's a good demonstration of how the gadgets will work at tinyurl.com/3jg45p. Essentially, you'll be able to take an off-the-shelf gadget - to allow users to sign up, post comments and photographs etc - customise it as you see fit and then have Google generate the code for you to add to your site. You, the site owner, get increased traffic as your site (hopefully) goes viral. Your visitors can link their stuff - posts, pictures etc - on your site back to their profiles on Facebook, MySpace, whatever. For Google, providing these tools mean that traffic to websites grows - and Google serves ads to websites. For Facebook and MySpace, data portability may mean that your stuff will wander outside their walled gardens, but they hope that you will choose their garden as the main place to plant your stuff. As Michael Arrington of Techcrunch noted: \"The reason these companies are rushing to get products out the door is because whoever is a player in this space is likely to control user data over the long run. If users don't have to put profile and friend information into multiple sites, they will gravitate towards one site that they identify with.\" (tinyurl.com/3eztau) It may look altruistic on the part of the big players, but your data is a goldmine for them.",
