The local newspaper, owned by Newsquest, a subsidiary of US media company Gannett, launched the service in mid 2014 and as of January has 1,265 subscribers across different threads. The title had an average daily print circulation of 12,773 in the first half of 2014 \u2013 a fall of 22.90% year-on-year. Its WhatsApp news service operates with a morning mail shot, containing links to stories chosen by the editorial staff, and in the evening with home time headlines containing links to the most read stories of the day. \"Proportionately, WhatsApp brings in a four or five times greater conversion rate to page views than our daily email bulletin, and it's six or seven times greater when compared to Twitter,\" says head of content, Jason Collie. \"The project has exceeded expectations both in the size of our audience and feedback from readers. \"When I launched it last year, I was thinking, if we have fewer than 300 subscribers by the end of the year it would be a failure and if we have 500 then I'd be pretty happy, so I'm absolutely blown away to have over 1,200.\" Collie adds: \"It's that directness of getting to people, getting a direct alert [on the user's phone when a message is received], that is key because you've got a greater chance of catching someone's attention and interest.\" The use of WhatsApp by news providers as a distribution channel is becoming increasingly popular with the BBC trialling it during the Indian elections in May last year and an Ebola news service in October. BuzzFeed has also used chat apps as a source for stories, turning to Whisper for anonymous confessions of American soldiers. Distributing content on WhatsApp can be a labour-intensive operation, as it can only be done on the single mobile phone that is connected to the account. However, after swapping his old HTC for an iPhone 5S and learning some useful shortcuts, Collie says he has got the hang of it. For the Oxford Mail, WhatsApp has been particularly useful in telling readers about traffic accidents and for creating threads that cover specific areas such as Oxford United Football Club and court cases, according to Collie. An example of this was the Jayden Parkinson murder trial \u2013 which took place throughout July last year, ending with the pregnant 17-year-old's killer being sentenced to life in prison \u2013 attracting about 100 subscribers. \"If there's a big event going on, then that's what people really want to use it for, they keep themselves updated along with the other news stories we have,\" Collie says. WhatsApp has more than 700 million monthly users with 30bn messages sent each day and has a global reach, with subscribers to the Oxford Mail WhatsApp living in six different continents. \"There's a core of people out there who really care about it and have made it their own,\" Collie said. \"They are always positive and supportive and that's one of the heartening things about it. On Christmas Day, I put out a message on the WhatsApp thread wishing the users a merry Christmas and thanking them for supporting the service this year and I got around 30 replies back. It doesn't sound like a lot but that's 30 odd people who have taken time out of their Christmas morning to message back and say thank you.\"",
