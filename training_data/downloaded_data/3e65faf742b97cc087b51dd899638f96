  "content": "Most of today's social media platforms allow users to project glossy, well-lit and edited versions of themselves to an extended group of acquaintances. Perfect selfies, latte art and #fitspo crowd out the more mundane nuts and bolts of life. Real-time formats, such as Facebook Live, Periscope and Meerkat, peel away a layer of artifice. The power of mobile live-streaming became all-too apparent when it was used by Diamond Reynolds to document the dying breaths of her boyfriend Philando Castile, who had been shot by a Minnesota police officer. It's also been harnessed by celebrities such as Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson for intimate interactions with fans. (Fortunately not too intimate.) A key challenge for Facebook Live and the rest of the live-streaming services, however, is that not everyone wants to broadcast their activities to hundreds of friends and acquaintances. It's something Vadim Lavrusik, the former product manager of Facebook Live, is all too aware of. \"It's raw and unfiltered, so it's really intimidating for a lot of people who associate it with live TV; they think they have to perform,\" explained the 30-year-old over a cup of Blue Bottle Coffee in San Francisco. \"A lot of people don't actually want to broadcast, but they would want to narrowcast with their closest social circle.\". It's that insight, gleaned from his time launching Facebook Live, that led Lavrusik to co-found Alively, a one-to-few video sharing platform, which debuts in the App Store today. Alively is a smartphone app that makes it easy to share live and recorded video with a small group of family members or friends. It's super simple to use. You open up the app, give your video a title and invite people from your contacts to watch (provided they have the app too). Those invited to watch receive a notification to join the stream and can add comments in real time. The person filming can also add and remove people while the recording is taking place. For those not wanting to stream live, Alively also makes it easy to share pre-recorded clips of any length. The videos are stored to the cloud, so they don't clog up the user's phone memory, and users can also upload any other clips they have stored on their device. Lavrusik, a former Mashable and New York Times journalist, says that if Instagram is the digital equivalent of the traditional family photo album, then he wants Alively to be your camcorder. \"People have traditionally kept home video for a very long time on cassette tapes. There's nothing out there that's like home video,\" he said. Lavrusik realized there was a need for a product like Alively when he shared a Facebook Live video of his two young sons playing in a paddling pool in his back yard naked. By that time he had a large Facebook audience of friends, acquaintances and followers (he currently has more than 200,000 followers of his profile), so a lot of people saw the broadcast. \"There were three comments from different friends telling me 'they're going to be so mad when they're older',\" he said. \"That's the problem with sharing with lots of people.\" The other problem Alively wants to address is how to send large video files to friends from your smartphone. Email typically has an upper limit on file size, while text messaging typically compresses files so they appear in lower resolution. It's a hurdle Lavrusik came up against when he wanted to share a five-minute video of his son's birthday party with his family. He ended up using Dropbox, but says that the \"little flicker of frustration\" was enough to show there was a gap in the market. The quality of the live video is noticeably good, thanks to Alively's patent-pending streaming technology which avoids lowering bitrate when there's a poor internet connection. Most other live video platforms, including Facebook Live, use the RTMP streaming protocol, which requires a continuous and strong connection to the internet otherwise the bitrate is lowered and the image becomes grainy. \"We're optimizing for quality of video because people are using this as a way to capture memories and moments. And when they look back on those memories and watch them, they want the quality to be good,\" Lavrusik said. Lavrusik says that In beta testing the app has been popular among high schoolers and young mothers. The former because they are typically more private than millennials, prefer to share video than text and typically have phones with a lower storage capacity. The latter tend to capture a lot of videos of their little darlings they want to share with their families. Alively is co-founded by Ray Lee and Vincent Tuscano, who had previously launched and sold a fan community engagement startup with Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King. The company is funded to the tune of $800,000 in seed investment from Greylock (through the Discovery Fund, which makes seed investments), SV Angel and Alex Ok, the founder of fashion brand Forever 21. SV Angel general partner Kevin Carter was drawn to the live sharing aspect of Alively. \"This could be the pixie dust that gets people interested and using the app, but there could be a lot more utility beneath that in some of the asynchronous use cases, such as storage,\" he said. Storage is an area where Alively could generate revenue, along the lines of a Dropbox or iCloud service. However, for now Lavrusik is focusing on making a product people want to use. The challenge for Alively, as with all sharing apps, will be changing people's behaviour. \"We live in a world now where if I want to send you a video or a picture we have 17 different ways \u2013 Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, iPhoto. We have so many ways and yet you get stuck,\" said Greylock's Josh Elman. \"It has to be five or ten times better to send video through here than any other format to really get people to switch and do it the whole time. It needs to create a behavior and a network.\" Elman believes that the rise of private messaging is a strong indicator that there's an appetite for sharing intimate moments with smaller groups of people. \"Getting feedback from five people who matter is better than feedback from 50 strangers.\" Lavrusik agrees. \"We want people to share everyday moments, not just the highlights. A lot of the time there will only be a few people who care about them.\"",
