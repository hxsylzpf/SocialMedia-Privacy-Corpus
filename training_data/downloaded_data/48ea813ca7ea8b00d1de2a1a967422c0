  "content": "The Queensland privacy commissioner has raised \"grave concerns\" about a local council's roll out of hundreds of listening devices for surveillance in public places, including that they may be a criminal breach of privacy laws. The commissioner, Philip Green, has also rejected a claim by the mayor of the Moreton Bay regional council that he endorsed the scheme as legal, saying \"it wasn't run by me\". The council, which takes in areas north of Brisbane, on Monday switched on new listening devices attached to its CCTV cameras, which number more than 330. Its mayor, Allan Sutherland, told Seven News that the privacy commissioner \"said that what we're doing isn't against the laws\". However, Green said it appeared the only notice his office had of the scheme came in a draft press release sent to them by the council last week and \"we haven't endorsed it any way\". \"I certainly have some grave concerns about this and whether it breaches both the Information Privacy Act and also the Invasion of Privacy Act in Queensland, which is enforced by the Queensland police service and the Department of Justice and attorney general,\" he told Guardian Australia. Green said the draft press release \"wasn't drawn to my attention, I wasn't in the office last week, and frankly, that's not the way to go about doing something like this\". \"Generally the public when they've heard the story have gone 'What?'\" he said. \"It wasn't run by me and certainly in no way have we approved the process or seen all the details. \"Frankly, in a post-[Edward] Snowden era, these things need to be properly debated before they're implemented.\" Prominent criminal solicitor Bill Potts has previously told the council he believes the listening devices, which provide detailed audio recordings of private conversations in public places, are a clear breach of section 43 of the Invasion of Privacy Act. \"In my view unless they received a specific ruling, a specific change in the legislation, then they are in fact in breach of the legislation,\" Potts told Seven News. Green said the council should have waited for \"a proper analysis before you buy the technology and start rolling it out\". \"Then we'd know how it runs and how it rolls and the exact parameters of security around it. \"[But] they just had a doorstop.\" \"Generally when something like this is deployed, world's best practice and the one that Europe is going to mandate in a year's time is that a privacy impact assessment be done and proper consultation be done on the rollout,\" he said. A privacy impact assessment would look at questions including whether \"the intrusion into people's lives is warranted, is it proportionate or commensurate, and is it lawful in the first place\". Green said there were issues around \"the security of the data and stopping the hackers from getting it, which is a live issue in the US and Australia right now\". There were also potential future legal issues around \"workplace surveillance\" because the devices were deployed in council libraries and other facilities were employee's private conversations would be recorded, he said. The state attorney general, Yvette D'Ath, was conducting a current separate review that may lead to the introduction of workplace surveillance laws as seen interstate, Green said. Sutherland told Seven News the council was not eavesdropping but recording the audio to supply to police who already sought CCTV for criminal investigations. \"We don't listen on a daily basis to conversations, this is as requested, if police come along and say can we have the footage,\" he said. The listening devices have been rolled out already in Caboolture, Burpengary, Redcliffe. Green said the mayor \"might be well-intended and it certainly seems like he is, but if he's the first one, do all 60 councils in the state do it? Do all the councils across the country do it? That's a lot of audio recordings, a lot of private conversations.\" Comment has been sought from Moreton Bay Regional Council.",
