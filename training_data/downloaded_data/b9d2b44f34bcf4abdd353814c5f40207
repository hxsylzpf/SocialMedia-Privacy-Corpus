  "content": "Milwaukee Bucks forward Charlie Villanueva loves Twitter. The player, known as CV31 on Twitter, is so keen to keep his loyal followers informed of his thoughts and whereabouts that he sent out a Tweet during half-time of the Bucks-Boston Celtics game on Sunday. \"In da locker room, snuck to post with my twitt. We're playing the Celtics, tie ball game at da half. Coach wants more toughness. I gotta step up, \" Villanueva tweeted. The forward apparently listened to his coach and ended up scoring 19 points during the win. But Villanueva's effort to stay connected prompted disappointment in with Bucks coach Scott Skiles who said the player can't use Twitter while games are taking place. \"We made a point to address Charlie and the team that it's nothing we ever want to happen again,\" Skiles said. Was it fair for the Bucks to ban Villanueva from Tweeting during games? Share your thoughts by sending us a response on our GuardianUS Twitter page.
