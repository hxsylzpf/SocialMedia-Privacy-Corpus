  "content": "It is an intriguing combination of two technologies in action. As the $100bn International Space Station, scheduled for completion over the next 12 months, circles the planet, its astronauts relay the wonders of living on board history's most expensive construction site by using Twitter to communicate with the world. Flight engineer Soichi Noguchi, a Japanese astronaut on board the station, and US engineer Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, have been particularly adept at using the microblogging service to send hundreds of pictures back to Earth via their accounts. The results provide a dramatic and highly accessible portfolio of images of life in space and of Earth when viewed from a height of 185 miles. Noguchi's efforts include photographs of the shuttle's interior as well as pictures of deserts, islands and ice floes on Earth. Both astronauts' efforts have gone down a treat with space watchers round the globe. \"Bellissima foto!\" responds one follower; \"Buena foto,\" states another. As Twitter messages make clear, it's the immediacy of the pictures that causes the real excitement. \"I've seen plenty of official space photos that were equally breathtaking, but there's something about getting them from Twitter that makes this feel more intimate,\" says one of them.",
