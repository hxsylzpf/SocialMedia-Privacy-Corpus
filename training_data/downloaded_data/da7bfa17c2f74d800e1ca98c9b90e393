  "content": "Within a week of visiting the world's only sloth orphanage in Costa Rica last year, Lucy Cooke had made a rough-and-ready 90-second clip that was being watched by more than 160,000 people a day. Her decision to \"go and shoot a bunch of sloths\" put her at the epicentre of online viral video. With her original footage still attracting thousands of eyeballs daily, Cooke is now in final talks with broadcasters about producing a full-length documentary. \"I posted the 90-second video on my Vimeo site and very quickly it was favourited [sic] and pushed by Vimeo staff,\" she explains. \"I then put the word out via my personal Facebook page and also my Amphibian Avenger Facebook and Twitter feeds. The video was then tweeted and retweeted by a few key friends who have a lot of fans.\" Cooke's clip really took off after being tweeted by Jonathan Ross and Stephen Fry.\"It was watched by 1 million people in the first 10 days,\" she says. \"The video has now been watched by over 2 million people \u2013 if you include YouTube and all the people who ripped it and posted it as their own work on YouTube and other sites.\" Cooke gained insight into marketing video last year at a workshop by the digital media organisation Crossover, which will host public workshops around the UK in the run-up to the Sheffield Doc/Fest in November. Cooke is just the kind of person that this year's competition, which is supported by MediaGuardian, is hoping to attract. Entries for the Digital Revolutions category open today. Says the Doc/Fest director, Heather Croall: \"This time we're taking the computer age into a new world. We're going to get people to put their video up on YouTube or Vimeo and really get creative in the digital landscape. As well as producing a great three-minute video, judges will be looking strongly at how film-makers have gone about engaging their audience and building a community around their film.\" BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, is providing a cash prize of \u00a310,000 to be won by a non-professional film-maker at Doc/Fest who can deliver more than just clever video editing. And Cooke's advice to this year's entrants? \"Choose a popular subject \u2013 look online at what videos and what subjects go viral,\" she says. \"My video is essentially strong, cute and funny animals cut to music \u2013 one of the most popular genres of viral. \"Look for internet sites which collect videos like yours and send them your link asking them to plug it. Definitely use Twitter and Facebook. Half the job is making something good, the other half is working the marketing of it.\" \u2022 To enter, go to sheffdocfest.com.
