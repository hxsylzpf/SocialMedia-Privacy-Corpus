  "content": "The Daily Mirror has apologised for printing the photograph that caused Prince William's girlfriend Kate Middleton to lodge her first complaint with the Press Complaints Commission, MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal. Richard Wallace, the editor of the Daily Mirror, today offered his sincere regret that the paper had \"got it wrong\". \"The Daily Mirror has always steered a sensible course in the use of photographs of Kate Middleton and other public figures,\" Mr Wallace said in a statement. \"On Thursday we published an innocuous picture of Ms Middleton walking down the street with a cup of coffee. \"It was taken by a freelance photographer in circumstances where we were later told she felt harassed. We got it wrong and we sincerely regret that.\" A paparazzo is thought to have taken the photograph as Ms Middleton, 25, was on her way to work. The prince's girlfriend then made the complaint via her lawyers, Harbottle &amp; Lewis, saying that she had been harassed as it was taken. The complaint represented a tougher stance on the part of Ms Middleton and her lawyers. Previously, they have relied on private appeals to newspaper editors. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
