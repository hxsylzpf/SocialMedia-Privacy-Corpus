  "content": "Thursday is a big day for retailer @johnlewisretail as the debut of its 2014 Christmas TV ad goes ballistic in the Twittersphere. Penguins, anyone? In a few hours there may be a sense of deja vu for the Virginian with the @johnlewis Twitter handle, when he wakes up and finds himself inundated with references to #montythepenguin. With 6,849 followers, the \"social liberal and atheist\" is already pretty popular, and given John Lewis's marketing director Craig Inglis follows him it looks like he's done pretty well out of the association. At the very least he's maintained a sense of humour about the whole thing, ending his Twitter profile with the statement \"not a retail store\".",
