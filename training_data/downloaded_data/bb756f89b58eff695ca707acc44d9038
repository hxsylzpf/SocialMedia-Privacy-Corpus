  "content": "If there were times when Bob Diamond felt that the whole world was against him, he need only have glanced at his phone for a quick fix of moral support. A Twitter account purporting to be that of his daughter Nell found itself the talk of the social networking site yesterday after she apparently sprang to his defence. Although there was nothing odd about her sweetly protective assertion \u2013 \"No one in the world I admire more than my dad. 16yrs building Barclays. Shame to see the mistakes of few tarnish the hard work of so many\" \u2013 another of the tweets, later deleted, was altogether more fighty. \"George Osborne and Ed Miliband you can go ahead and #HMD,\" it ran. Those unaccustomed to the HMD hashtag may wonder whether it stands for \"help my dad\", or perhaps \"honour Mr Diamond\". They will be disappointed. According to popular internet wisdom, it is an abbreviation of a less lofty imperative: hold my dick. Until afternoon, the account had looked on the bright side of the Barclays saga, even going so far as to retweet the odd joke, such as: \"Bob Diamond has been downgraded to Bob Diamante.\" Suggestions that the account was genuine were fuelled by some of the pictures posted on it. One showed Bob Diamond standing next to John Terry after Chelsea won the FA Cup in May. Another showed Diamond and his daughter apparently copying Jay-Z's diamond hand sign last November.",
