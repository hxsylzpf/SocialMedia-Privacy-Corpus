  "content": "\u2022 Despite hopes in the British games industry that the government could lend a helping hand to make it more competitive, the pre-budget report revealed that there will be no tax break for game developers. Will the Tories move in to try and grab gamer votes? \u2022 Nearly a month after the first reports broke that MySpace was in talks to buy imeem, a music/social networking service, the two announced a deal yesterday. How much? Suggestions of $1m have certainly made it sound like it was a fire sale by the smaller company's investors. \u2022 The latest episode of our Tech Weekly podcast is live, featuring interviews with Google UK's Matt Brittin - who discusses whether the search engine is stealing Rupert Murdoch's lunch - and MySpace Music's Courtney Holt, to explain the social network's new venture (which, incidentally, is what imeem has just become part of). Susi Weaser is joined by Vic Keegan and Mercedes Bunz for what is - would you believe - our 100th show. Listen now! You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
