  "content": "Is your fitness tracker playing up, constantly misreporting your heart rate and claiming you're burning wild amounts of fat? Bad news: it's probably broken. Or, good news: It might be working fine, and you're pregnant. That is good news, yes? It was for one user of Reddit, who posted on the site to find tech support for his wife's fitness tracker. Her Fitbit, Redditor YoungPTone wrote, was \"showing her heartbeat being consistently high over the last few days. \"Two days ago, a somewhat normal day, she logged 10 hours in the fat burning zone, which i would think to be impossible based on her activity level. Also, her calories burned do seem accurate. I would imagine if she was in the the fat burning zone she would burn a ton of calories, so its not lining up.\" Some Redditors dutifully responded with technical support, pointing out that the most recent update of the Fitbit's firmware made heart rate tracking \"inconsistent\"; a hard reset, performed by by plugging the device into power and holding down its button until it reboots, could fix that problem. But another Redditor focused on a different problem: the Fitbit's user. \"Has she experienced anything really stressful in the last few days or is it a possibility she is pregnant,\" asked Thatwasunpleasant. And sure enough, YoungPTone replied that \"pregnancy is a strong possibility\". \"I might be a dad, YIKES. now i gotta watch my own heart rate lol,\" he added. And a day later, he updated the thread with confirmation: \"I'm going to be a dad!\" Congratulations, YoungPTone and family.",
