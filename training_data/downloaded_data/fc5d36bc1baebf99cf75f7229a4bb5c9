  "content": "Twitter has confirmed Jack Dorsey as its new chief executive. Dorsey, currently the company's interim CEO, co-founded Twitter in 2007 and was its first CEO. He has served as the interim head of the firm for the past three months, after former boss Dick Costolo stepped down on 1 July. Alongside his appointment, the company also promoted Adam Bain, formerly the company's president of global revenue &amp; partnerships, to a chief operating officer role. Bain had been widely seen as the biggest competitor to Dorsey for the head position, but reportedly said he would only take it if Dorsey turned it down. Chris Sacca, a former Google exec, an investor in Twitter and the head of Lowercase Capital, said while he \"absolutely\" thought Adam Bain would make a great CEO, he saw the realignment as a partnership between the two men and not a choice between them. \"[R]ather than an either/or, it says everything about Jack and Adam that they worked out this unique way to continue their collaboration,\" Sacca said. \"Their strengths are entirely complementary and my confidence is high.\" Sacca has been a staunch proponent of Dorsey's throughout the interim period. \"Jack has a gift for seeing the future of the product and inspiring those on the team to make it happen,\" he said. \"His approach cuts through internal politics and focuses entirely on results. In his time as an interim CEO you have already seen Twitter's pace of execution accelerate and the core business improve. I have no doubt he is just getting started.\" Despite the announcement, Dorsey (who tweets as @jack) will remain the head of fast-growing mobile payments company Square, potentially setting up a conflict of interest for the co-founder of both companies. Twitter had previously said the CEO job would be a full-time position, which seemed to exclude Dorsey as long as he continued to run Square. He also sits on the board of Disney. In an SEC filing confirming the promotions, Twitter wrote: \"Mr. Dorsey was selected to serve on the board because of the perspective and experience he brings as one of Twitter's founders and as one of Twitter's largest stockholders, as well as his extensive experience with technology companies.\" Vivian Schiller, formerly the head of news for the popular site, said that it's important for the company to get out of limbo. \"This is a company where there will be a gigantic exhale \u2013 Twitter needs leadership,\" she told the Guardian. \"They've been stalled at this fork in the road for a while,\" said Schiller. \"The path is either to go deep, or to extend the product to compete with Facebook and Instagram. A CEO who's got the mandate and can provide marching orders for the entire organization is really needed. It's still a very challenging situation.\" Dorsey's return to the company he helped found has already had an effect on Twitter. In late September, news broke that the company was considering removing, or adding exceptions to, its long-standing policy limiting individual messages to 140 characters. The news was greeted with mixed feelings by users of the social network, with some arguing that any change would remove the aspect which makes it unique when compared to other networks such as Facebook. However, others pointed to the fact that users have been increasingly inventive in finding ways to circumvent the limit, such as posting links to text hosted elsewhere, screenshots of notetaking apps, or simply multi-tweet \"tweetstorms\" \u2013 a practice made popular by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. An unnamed Twitter employee told Re/Code that Dorsey's return was the impetus for reassessing the role of the character limit: \"Having Jack come in and say it's OK makes all the difference in the world.\" Dick Costolo, the former CEO of Twitter, is also stepping down from the board. The company is now advertising for a new board member, who will also replace Dorsey as chairman of the board.",
