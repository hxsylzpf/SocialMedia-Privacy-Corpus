  "content": "If you're not on Twitter, you might not have heard of Rob Delaney: the American comedian has no marked screen career and his forthcoming London gigs will be his first in the UK. But such is the strength of his online following that the entire run sold out before they were even made available to the general public. Within an hour of Delaney's tweeting a \"pre-sale booking code\" on Friday, all 900 tickets had been sold. Booking had been due to open on Monday. Delaney, who has 480,000 followers on the microblogging site, is lined up to play six performances over the course of a week at the Soho Theatre's downstairs cabaret bar in October. He has become the fastest-selling US act in the venue's history. On Wednesday, he added an additional gig at the Bloomsbury Theatre at 7pm on 5 October, for which only two restricted view seats remained when the Guardian called the box office. Social media has become an important tool for comedians, but few can match Delaney for impact. He had been a comedian for six years before starting his Twitter account in 2009. After more than 9,000 tweets, Delaney was named Funniest Person on Twitter at Comedy Central's second annual comedy awards, beating a list of nominees that included Steve Martin. He has filmed a Comedy Central pilot entitled @robdelaney and is currently writing a book for Random House. Delaney's advice for tweeters is to be spontaneous. \"Don't work too hard on a tweet,\" he said after winning the Comedy Central award.",
