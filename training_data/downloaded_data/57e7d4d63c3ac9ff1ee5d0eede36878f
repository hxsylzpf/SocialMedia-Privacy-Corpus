  "content": "For the record, here is yesterday's Sunday Times editorial, headlined \"NETANYAHU CARTOON: AN APOLOGY\". Last week we published, as we have almost every week since 1967, a cartoon by Gerald Scarfe. His works are brutal and bloody and his opinions are his own, not those of this newspaper. The Sunday Times has always understood and reported the legitimate security concerns of the state of Israel. It is one thing for a newspaper to attack and caricature a leader \u2014 and it is as legitimate to attack Israeli leaders in cartoons as anyone else. But it is another thing to reflect in a caricature, even unintentionally, historical iconography that is persecutory or anti-semitic. The image we published of Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, which appeared to show him revelling in the blood of Palestinians, crossed a line. Publication of the cartoon would have been a mistake on any day but the fact that last Sunday was Holocaust Memorial Day compounded the error. We realise that we caused grave offence, however unintended, which detracted from a day that marks one of the greatest evils in human history. The Sunday Times abhors anti-semitism and racism of any type and we would never set out to offend the Jewish people \u2014 or indeed any other ethnic or religious group. The publication of last week's cartoon was a very serious mistake. We apologise unreservedly. Here's a reminder of what the paper's temporary, acting editor, Martin Ivens, had to say in his first response to complaints, as quoted in the Jerusalem Post: \"This is a typically robust cartoon by Gerald Scarfe. It is aimed squarely at Mr Netanyahu and his policies, not at Israel, let alone at Jewish people. It appeared yesterday because Mr Netanyahu won the Israeli election last week.\" And here's what Ivens said after Rupert Murdoch had tweeted: \"Gerald Scarfe has never reflected the opinions of the Sunday Times. Nevertheless, we owe major apology for grotesque, offensive cartoon.\" \"You will know that the Sunday Times abhors anti-Semitism and would never set out to cause offence to the Jewish people - or any other ethnic or religious group. That was not the intention last Sunday. Everyone knows that Gerald Scarfe is consistently brutal and bloody in his depictions, but last weekend - by his own admission - he crossed a line.\" Sources: Sunday Times(paywall)/Jerusalem Post/BBC/Twitter",
