  "content": "William Hague yesterday promised to make councils take decisions in public and guaranteed a \"real\" freedom of information act if the Tories win the next election. Speaking to the Society of Editors' conference in Cardiff, the leader of the opposition tried to align the Conservatives as allies of the press, following the Labour government's public retrenchment from its pre-election pleges of \"open government\". Mr Hague attacked the Freedom of Information Act and the Local Government Act as examples of legislation that were systematically undermining press freedom. He told the audience he found it \"hugely ironic, though not in the least bit surprising, that a government that came to power promising a revolution in open government, and a sweeping Freedom of Information Act, has in reality succeeded in introducing new curbs on the press\". Mr Hague promised that under a Conservative government local councils would be allowed to choose their own structure, instead of the current \"cabinet-style\" system of government under which only \"key\" decisions had to be taken in the public eye. He also promised that under the Conservatives, an information commissioner and not ministers should have the final say over whether the release of a piece of information was in the public interest.",
