  "content": "Concern over Google's dominance in online advertising has prompted the US federal trade commission to investigate its $3.1bn (\u00a31.56bn) takeover of internet marketing firm DoubleClick. The purchase of DoubleClick, announced last month, is intended to give Google enhanced software, and stronger relationships with agencies seeking to place advertisements in strategically important positions on the web. Privacy campaigners say the tie-up poses risks to consumers, by allowing Google to track the online activity of individuals more closely. Industry rivals, including Microsoft, AT&amp;T and WPP, complain that it will give Google too much muscle in the online advertising market, worth $17bn last year in the US. The FTC declined to comment on the investigation, which was leaked to the US media. Google's senior corporate counsel, Dan Harrison, said: \"We are confident that, upon further review, the FTC will conclude that this acquisition poses no risk to competition and should be approved.\" He said \"numerous\" analysts and academics had determined that online advertising is a \"dynamic and evolving space\", and that rich competition would bring more relevant ads to consumers. DoubleClick is a specialist in targeting online advertisements; its ads reach an estimated 80% to 85% of internet users. The US Electronic Privacy Information Centre argues that adding Google's database of search terms to DoubleClick's expertise in discerning web users' commercial interests would allow the combined group to amass personal data. The centre points out that the FTC investigated DoubleClick for privacy breaches in 2000, producing an apology from the company. \"The acquisition of DoubleClick will permit Google to track both a person's internet searches and a person's website visits,\" said the centre. \"This could impact the privacy interests of 233m internet users in America, 314m internet users in Europe, and more than 1.1bn internet users around the world.\" Microsoft has objected to the tie-up on the grounds that it will combine the two largest advertising distributors on the internet. It lost in the auction for DoubleClick and instead bought aQuantive. Telecoms company AT&amp;T recently suggested that Google was seeking unfair dominance. Jim Cicconi, vice president for external affairs, said: \"If any one company gets a hammerlock on the online advertising space, as Google seems to be trying to do, that is worrisome.\" Sir Martin Sorrell, head of the advertising agency WPP, said that the deal \"clearly\" raised regulatory issues and data protection challenges.",
