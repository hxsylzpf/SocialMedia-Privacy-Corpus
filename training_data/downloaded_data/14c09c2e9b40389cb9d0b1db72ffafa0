  "content": "Jack Straw was in uncharacteristically poor form at Richard Thomas's valedictory event as information commissioner: his conference on Private data, Open government. His delivery was rather poor. More seriously, his message was mixed. He was caught between pride as the author of the Freedom of Information Act and embarrassment at its recent impact. The panel of MPs that followed the justice secretary, though individually rather ethical in their expenses, were similarly rather muted by the circumstances. That left the final panel, an eclectic mix of Shami Chakrabarti, Google's global privacy council Peter Fleischer, ACPO representative Ian Readhead, the RSA's Matthew Taylor and myself, a bit of space \u2013 though too little time \u2013 to get into the debate. We differed a good deal less than might have been expected. Put us all in a room together and you felt we could have come up with a decent set of principles for a way forward. It was not that clear that the MPs in the previous panel, Alan Beith, Michael Wills and Dominic Grieve would have been so successful. The event was a celebration of the six years of Richard Thomas's reign. As Michael Cross said today, Thomas has played a blinder and overseen a cultural revolution \u2013 the more effective for his quiet, if uncompromising, style. Freedom of information has been revealed to have real teeth. And data protection has emerged from the nerd's wilderness to a greater public understanding that if data can be collected, it can be lost and, if shared, it can be transferred far from its origins. Thomas's quote, \"Sleepwalking into a surveillance society\" was the kind of phrase that perfectly caught a powerful critique whose time had come. The discomfort of the government's secretary of state for justice was a pretty good legacy for a departing information commissioner. Poor Straw has had to admit that accuracy is not his strong suit: he had over-claimed council tax. But, the issue not accountancy: it is accountability. Freedom of information is a profoundly democratic concept \u2013 that is why it has fared so well in the United States. Politicians should not be worried that freedom of information has stripped them of credibility. Democracy is strong enough to survive. The successors of those who claimed for the cleaning of moats and swimming pools should remember that they are the public's servants, not their own masters. Thomas is shrewd enough to have left his successor, Christopher Graham, a three-year corporate plan. This stresses the educational and proselytising role that he has played so well. But we need more. The Data Protection Act dates from 1998, well before the development of the internet in its current form. It is entirely separate from freedom of information legislation \u2014 even though their integral link is recognised by a common commissioner. Wouldn't an open debate about a comprehensive information bill be a good project for an incoming government? Such legislation could set out integrated principles about private data and open government. It could apply to private and public bodies. It could restate the fundamental principle: your data belongs to you. If anyone else wants to assert ownership or control, they need informed consent or some pressing reason that it is necessary and proportionate. Any articulation of the demands of national security must acknowledge that privacy and liberty are an integral part of that security, not opposed to it. What is more, in the internet age, Britain's national legislation is hopeless. Even EU legislation is limited. We need to lead a debate about global standards which can be nationally implemented around the world. Had Facebook been successful in asserting its ownership to all data on its site \u2013 a proposition it quickly withdrew when the full consequences were recognised \u2014 then the impact would have been felt around the world. In the meantime, let us pay attention to some domestic detail. The government should build on its belated acknowledgement that its plans for an all-singing, all-dancing communications database were hopelessly na\u00efve and implicitly dangerous. Out should go the national identity register and identity cards. Out from the DNA database should go a much wider group of innocent people than Jacqui Smith currently currently. Contrary to Lord Acton's famous saying (and some current comment), power does not always corrupt. But it does tend to corrode respect for transparency, accountability and freedom of information. We need to take advantage of parliamentarians' current humility to argue for a new paradigm and a new culture that protects the private and makes transparent the public.",
