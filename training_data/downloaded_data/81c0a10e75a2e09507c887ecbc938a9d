  "content": "Labor's attempt to explore Julie Bishop's views on Vladimir Putin ran into an unexpected obstacle during Thursday's Senate estimates when a Liberal senator admitted he did not know what an emoji or \"a Buzzfeed\" was. Labor's trade spokeswoman, Penny Wong, was attempting to get to the bottom of what Bishop, the foreign minister, meant when she used a red-faced angry man emoji to represent Russia's president during an interview with Buzzfeed earlier this year. When Wong asked whether the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ever used emojis for diplomatic negotiations, the chairman of the committee, Liberal backbencher Chris Back, took issue. \"There's a bit of confusion, Senator Wong, as to what this term means,\" he said. The attorney general, George Brandis, helpfully weighed in, describing emojis as the smiley faces you sometimes get in texts. Fellow Liberal Michael Ronaldson said he was about to send some emojis to Wong, to which she replied: \"As long as they're not a heart, I'm all right.\" \"This being a ministry for the 21st century, this mode of communication is not unfamiliar to us,\" Brandis replied. \"I find the thumbs up and the thumbs down saves a lot of texting time,\" Ronaldson said. \"That's because you're a binary kind of guy,\" Wong replied. Wong pressed on with her line of questioning about the red-faced man symbol. \"If I get that from my little sister it usually means I've done something wrong,\" she said. \"It could be a reference to ideology,\" Brandis said, referring to communism's historic association with the colour red. \"It's plainly not an expression of our relationship with Russia.\" Back was still confused. \"I've never heard of what a Buzzfeed was until my staff informed me,\" he said. Bishop, who often uses emojis in her tweets, responded to Wong's questioning via social media. The foreign affairs department has 70 official Twitter accounts, with a total of 160,000 followers, department official Rob Tranter said. But the secretary, Peter Varghese, told estimates emojis were not an official mode of communication, and that social media guidelines had not explicitly outlined their use in department communication. \"It's an emoji-free zone?\" Wong asked. \"Indeed,\" Varghese responded. Wong then asked if the department had guidelines for the use of apps that send encrypted messages, such as Wikr, on devices provided by the department. Department official Tim Spackman said there were no specific prohibitions on their use. \"We do not get involved in any applications and do not provide those services,\" he said.",
