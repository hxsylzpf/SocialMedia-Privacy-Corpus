Not so wary is his bag-carrier, the Hon Ed Vaizey: the amiable, well-padded minister for culture, communications and the creative industries (party turn: a Simon Cowell impression) has retained such sarcastic campaign tweets as these: \"Clegg explains amnesty policy. Gang members would go straight. Right\"; \"Is Clegg cancelling trident upgrade or reviewing it? Totally unclear \u2026 Against it and reviewing it. That's clear then!\"; and \"Regional immigration [Lib Dem policy] is a barmy idea\". Let's hope the deputy PM is too busy to bear grudges. \u2712Monkey was quite looking forward to the start of the World Cup this week \u2013 that is until the Daily Express set out the dangers of watching the footy on the box. \"Football fever is sweeping the nation and medics are preparing for a rise in over excited football fans suffering heart attacks, strokes and other injuries,\" it warned. Particularly worrying are the chest injuries fans are liable to suffer from \"hugging a fellow fan\", cuts and bruises sustained when trying to punch the air and whacking the light instead, and back strain caused by \"slouching on a sofa for 90 minutes\". It's nothing compared to the blood pressure hazards suffered by some viewers watching the Express's owner Richard Desmond's TV offerings, we hear. Medic! \u2712Following the mention here last week of talk of a forthcoming Archers whodunit, odds are now available for \"the first character to be murdered\" from Paddy Power. Rejecting Monkey's Midsomer Murders-based idea that the victim is bound to be posh, the bookie offers the shortest odds on Paul (3-1) and Matt Crawford (4-1), the rival suitors of flush, perpetually sloshed Lillian Bellamy, herself rated a 7-1 shot. Two more possible Borsetshire Cain and Abels, Ed and William Grundy, are joint third on 6-1, with Jill Archer a puzzling 8-1 and characters notorious for their power to irritate oddly either given generous prices (Kenton, Jennifer, Pip) or not listed and so apparently available at better than 25-1 (Alastair, Helen, Ruth). No odds yet on the killer, weapon or location, though Monkey fancies Shula with a bridle in the stables. \u2712A nostalgic glimpse of the journalism of yesteryear came in a Max Hastings diatribe against Peter Mandelson in Friday's Mail, splendidly headlined A Bad, Bad Man. After Hastings's political team on the Evening Standard had told him they believed Mandelson had borrowed money from Geoffrey Robinson to buy a house, he was rung by the minister and \"offered a personal assurance that the story was untrue\". Hastings then \"told our political editor that every cabinet minister has the right to have his private word accepted, and kept the story out of print\". A few weeks later, the story hit the front pages, and Mandelson rang again, hoping \"to convince you I am not a crook\", but this time found a furious Hastings no longer willing to assume he was a gentleman. No doubt the scoop-deprived political editor was cross too. \u2712Feelings about Mandelson were no more affectionate at last week's Media Society dinner for Melvyn Bragg. Lord (Chris) Smith, the former culture secretary, recalled that Bragg had rallied arts grandees on his behalf, when machiavellian Mandelson \"decided to get my job, as a means of getting back in the cabinet, and stories started appearing about how deeply disappointed the prime minister was in the job I was doing\". \u2712Will the Times titles gain a greater ad yield from their paywall, the latest issue of Campaign magazine asks leading media buyers in a yes/no format that usually reliably produces at least one answer on either side. Not this time: two nos, and two maybes.",
