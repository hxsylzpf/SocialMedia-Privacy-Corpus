Filed in the Supreme Court in New York's Allegany County last month, the lawsuit details how Paul Ceglia signed a contract with Facebook in April 2003 to design and develop the website TheFacebook.com for an agreed $1,000 (\u00a3665) fee and a 50% stake in the site. The contract stipulated, Ceglia claims, a further 1% stake for each day until the site was finished on 4 February 2004. Facebook is valued at an estimated $6.5bn, so an 84% share would be worth around $5.46bn. Following Ceglia's lawsuit, acting New York Supreme Court justice Thomas Brown issued a temporary restraining order that blocks Facebook from transfering assets.

The case has now transferred to a federal court and Facebook is trying to have it annulled. Facebook dimissed the case as \"frivolous\" and \"outlandish\", said it will fight it vigorously and pointed out that a lawsuit over a contract broken in 2003 is \"almost certainly barred\" by the statute of limitation. There are a number of reasons that success for Ceglia sounds unlikely \u2013 not least waiting until the site reaches 500 million global users before bringing his case, waiting until the outcome of the (successful) Winklevoss claim and the rather bizarre sidenote that a restraining order was granted against him in 2009 by an attorney who alleged Ceglia had defrauded customers of his wood-pellet fuel business to the tune of $200,000. But imagine, for a minute, that Ceglia succeeded, and moved in to take 84% of Facebook. We might have a new entrant in the MediaGuardian 100...",
