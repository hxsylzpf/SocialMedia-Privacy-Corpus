  "content": "I've just caught up with last week's Radio 4 Law in Action in which its presenter, Joshua Rozenberg, discovered at first hand the problems photographers are facing because of the misuse of section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000. It begins - as you can hear on the iPlayer replay - with Rozenberg accompanying photographer Grant Smith, an architectural photographer, as he takes pictures of a building in the City of London. A \"building manager\", accompanied by \"a burly security guard\", emerge to tell them they have no permission to take pictures and warns them that the police will be called. Yet they are being videoed throughout on the company's wall-mounted CCTV. The ever polite Rozenberg, as he explains on his blog, \"made an excuse and left.\" \"I have managed to reach the age of 60 without troubling the police over any more than a couple of minor motoring matters,\" he wrote. \"Did I really want my name linked to anti-terrorist searches on a police computer somewhere?\" Rozenberg later discovered in an interview with the City's assistant police commissioner Frank Armstrong that they were not breaking the law, and that the police have no powers to stop people taking pictures or filming. However, they do have a right to view the images or the film. In the programme, Rozenberg explores the fine line between allowing the public the freedom to photograph with the need to protect London's financial centre from terrorist attack. Along the way he also considers the wide misunderstandings about the Data Protection Act, the problems facing people who are photographed by the police, and the rights of people to protect their privacy from photographers (including those from Google). Finally, there's a brief look at the possibility of libel law reform. Source: Rozenberg blog Hat tip: Judith Townend",
