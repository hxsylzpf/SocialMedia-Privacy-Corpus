  "content": "Kanye West has offered to redesign Instagram, suggesting that it would be \"a simple task\" for him to beautify the popular photo app. Speaking at a seminar at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, West cited the success of his instagrammed wedding kiss with Kim Kardashian, which is already the most-liked photo in the history of the app. \"The world as a whole is fucking ugly,\" West said on Tuesday, during an appearance at the festival. \"The internet as a whole is fucking ugly, too.\" West said he asked Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom: \"Why don't you let us redo Instagram? Now, you know, Instagram is nice. It's nice looking \u2013 I'm not knocking it. But in general, everyone spends all of their time looking at their screens or their phones. And just as a simple task, we could clean that up.\" West apparently considers himself a bit of an Instagram expert. Although he doesn't have a public account, he follows Kardashian's posts and took an active role in refining the couple's famous photo clinch. \"Can you imagine telling someone [like Kim], who wants to just instagram a photo, who's then number-one person on Instagram, 'We need to work on the colour of the flower wall?'\" he said. \"[But] the fact that the number-one most-liked [photo] has a kind of aesthetic was a win for what the mission is, which is raising the palette.\" West said he worked on the photo for four days. Celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz allegedly \"pulled out of the wedding\" on the eve of the event, leaving the rapper to figure out how to make his wedding snaps \"look like Annie Leibovitz\". \"The flowers were off-colour, and stuff like that,\" West said. West has previously described himself as the \"Steve [Jobs] of internet, downtown, fashion [and] culture\". He has now claimed to be one of just three musicians, along with Black Eye Peas member Will.I.am and Ryan Leslie, who \"cares\" enough to be creative director at a major company. And not just any company: unlike Jay Z, who inked a deal to release his latest album with Samsung, West says he will never settle for less than \"No 1\". \"Throughout my entire life, because of how my parents raised me, I have to work with the No 1 \u2013 Jay Z, Kim, Obama,\" West said, quashing the rumour that he and Jay Z are fighting. He also suggested that, one day, the world might be \"saved by design\": \"Because what is the most vulgar thing someone could do? Kill someone. Good taste is the opposite of that.\" West is currently working with producer Rick Rubin on the \"second half\" of Yeezus, expected later this year.",
