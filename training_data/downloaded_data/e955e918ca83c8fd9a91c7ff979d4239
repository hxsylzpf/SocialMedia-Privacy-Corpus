  "content": "US cable company Comcast has bought the website Plaxo as part of a strategy to bring social networking into the mainstream. The value of the deal was not disclosed, but industry blogs have been predicting a sale since January and estimate Plaxo was sold for between $150m and $170m. Plaxo offers an extensive online address book as well as a sister social networking site called Pulse and claims 50 million user accounts and 1.5 million regular unique users each month. Comcast, the biggest cable firm in the US, plans to integrate Plaxo's online social networking services with its own subscriber base of 24.2 million customers through comcast.net, the film site Fandango and Fancast, an entertainment site. Plaxo said the two firms were creating a roadmap to \"socially enable the media experience\" through Comcast's TV and phone services, as well as online. Video-sharing is central to Comcast's plan, which will combine its distribution infrastructure with Plaxo's multiplatform networking technology. \"Together, we intend to deliver on a vision of making social media a natural part of the lives of regular people, not just early adopters,\" said Plaxo. \"You should be able to securely post family photos online in Pulse, and have them viewable by any of your family members, whether they are online, at work, on their mobile device, or in their living room watching TV. \"And you should be able to discover new shows to watch, based on what your friends and co-workers have recommended.\" Plaxo said it had already worked with Comcast in the past year on two address book projects for the cable company's services and that the collaboration had helped increase its user base. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
