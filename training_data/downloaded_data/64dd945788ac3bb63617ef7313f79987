  "content": "Heather Brooke is a force of nature in journalism. She instinctively knows the enemy: power, with its attendant bureaucracy closing ranks to keep secrets safe. She knocked it flat as she first prised out the details of MPs' expenses. Now, laptop in hand, she sets out to explore and exploit the wonders of the worldwide web; a place where information can roam infinitely free, the great modern battlefield for reporters, governments, lawyers. She pushes forward, explaining and deploying the new gambits of evolving technology. But even the formidable Ms Brooke learns complex things as she researches along, finding kindred community spirits among hackers from Iceland to California. And the most complex thing of all is the man who dominates the action: the incredible (and incredibly annoying) Julian Assange. Brooke hasn't set out to write just another inside account of the WikiLeaks saga: this is a melange of anecdote, imagination and experience designed to open our eyes to the possibilities of digital change. But Assange, rumpled, tetchy, inspirational, often objectionable, keeps barging in right at the heart of that experience. In the beginning, encountering him at a conference in Norway, Brooke sees only the inspiration. \"The UK is the worst liberal democracy in the world,\" he proclaims. \"It's never been through a revolution so it's still a feudal state.\" Its laws were made for the benefit of the aristocracy. Now they're made for the new lords, \"the political elite\". Meat and drink to a reporter who already thinks that, and wants to blow the house down. She's focused (with the help of an Icelandic MP) on making Reykjavik an information haven on tax haven lines. She's hunting for a hero. Julian, the lord of all hacking, welcomes her to his universe. WikiLeaks, a brave deed in a closed world, is gearing up for its great unloading of 250,000 assorted American secrets. But can you just dump tons of such stuff on the web? Freedom to publish en masse also means freedom to miss the story or the point. Maybe Assange needs a paper like the Guardian to sift, choose and make safe the most important tales? Maybe recruiting other traditional print outlets \u2013 say Der Spiegel and the New York Times \u2013 can keep the legal elite at bay? It's when Brooke, a close observer and occasional participant in this exercise, has to work in contact with Assange day by day that doubt creeps in. No picnic; indeed, at the end, a dog's dinner. One climactic meeting with Assange sees him attacking her for supposedly seeking to sabotage his enterprise. \"It seemed to me he was just furious about losing control of the cables [and] I'm sure the Pentagon felt exactly the same about him.\" Suddenly the freedom fighters need watching, too. How do you make freedom's ideals fit for purpose in the midst of profound digital revolution? You can have basic ideals, fundamental attitudes. Brooke despises the men in suits oiling in to shut down the free flow of information, and she represents good journalism when she does. Real journalism isn't fitting in, bending the knee, chasing gongs, falling silent. Real journalism is rough trade in the greatest public interest of the lot: truth that those who want to make the effort can discover for themselves. But watch the devils of detail come sneaking through, throwing smoke bombs. Brooke self-evidently loves the burgeoning global community of hackers: men in jeans, not suits; voices of dissent, not conformity. But where does authority of some kind fit in? \"Exemptions for the disclosure of official information must be for two reasons only: where it is in the public interest (not the nation's interest) or to prevent actual (not imagined) harm.\" All of that with a bias towards publication, and an \"independent appeals organisation\". Which, of course, raises every kind of difficult question. Did the original, carefully sanitised cables from the Afghan front line cause any of the actual harm the Pentagon and tame politicians alleged? Has the latter-day Assange dump of hundreds of thousands more produced a bloodier actuality? Who can decide between public and national interest except judges, men in wigs? Who appoints \"independent\" appeals tribunals except the same people who appoint independent police complaints commissioners? And, while we're pondering the imponderables, define the difference between good hacking and bad hacking in a book that casts a leery eye over Google and the rest of the big boys, who can eat any trace of your privacy before breakfast, but doesn't contain one solitary mention of the accursed M word, Murdoch. Loads of questions at the close, then: loads more to set any thoughtful reader's mind whirling. Brooke's third journey of a book doesn't pretend to offer last words, but it's vivid and honest about its own contradictions, a solid, sentient contribution. Her starter for 10 more, perhaps?",
