Christopher Graham, who is investigating whether the 98 companies have breached data protection laws, has written to Keith Vaz, chair of the home affairs select committee, as he prepares to publish the list on Monday in the face of opposition from police investigating a handful of the firms and individuals involved. Graham said in a statement on Friday: \"It's not clever to start a criminal investigation by publishing the names of everyone and everything you're investigating. That's why we've stated we're not publishing the list at this stage, and why I've written to Keith Vaz MP to urge similar patience on the part of his select committee.\" Vaz has repeatedly asked the Serious Organised Crime Agency \u2013 which compiled the list from an investigation into four rogue private detectives \u2013 to make it public. Soca and the Metropolitan police \u2013 who are investigating nine of the firms involved \u2013 have told MPs they are against publication because it could prejudice the investigations. As Vaz prepared to publish next week, Graham added his voice to the police objections. Graham \u2013 it is understood \u2013 said in a letter on Thursday to Vaz that publication would be unhelpful to his investigation. The chair of the Commons committee gave Soca an ultimatum this week that they must publish the list by Monday or he would do so. He said the committee had taken legal advice and felt publication was the right thing to do. Five of the firms identified on the list are under investigation by the Metropolitan police's Operation Tuleta, which is investigating computer hacking and other breaches of privacy laws. It emerged on Friday that another four companies are being investigated by detectives within the Met as part of other criminal investigations. The names of these nine companies will be redacted from any publication next week. In a letter on Friday to Vaz, Trevor Pearce, director general of Soca, said he was still against publication despite being issued with an ultimatum by Vaz. \"As you know, Soca produced and provided the client list to the committee in accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines on the provision and handling of sensitive information in confidence to select committees,\" he said. \"You confirmed on 15 July that the committee would treat the list as confidential. I remain firmly of the view that publishing the list of clients would affect ongoing investigations and enquiries.\" He said that the fluid nature of investigations meant that those named on the list might be drawn into other criminal investigations. To date five of the firms are being investigated by Operation Tuleta and since July another four firms and individuals who were on the original list crossed over into other Metropolitan police investigations. \"The confidential material as presented to and agreed with you should remain confidential,\" said Pearce. The information commissioner's letter to Vaz is said to be strongly worded. Graham said his primary reasons for objecting to publication were that it would be unhelpful to his new investigation into the firms. It is understood that many of the companies and individuals identified by Soca as having used the services of the rogue investigators, who were jailed last year for illegally accessing private data, are not aware that they have been named as clients. \"It is not helpful to have everyone who is under investigation alerted to that fact so publicly,\" said a source. The companies were clients of the four private investigators who were jailed last year after a Soca investigation into illegal blagging of information about private individuals. They were identified in 2008 during a Soca investigation known as Operation Millipede. On Monday, Graham said he had begun an inquiry into potential breaches of privacy law by the companies, after being handed the list by Soca last week. Graham's investigation will examine whether the firms broke the Data Protection Act. The information commissioner can bring criminal prosecutions or take action in the civil courts, with fines of up to \u00a3500,000 for data protection breaches. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 September 2013 to remove the title of Sir from Christopher Graham's name in the standfirst.",
