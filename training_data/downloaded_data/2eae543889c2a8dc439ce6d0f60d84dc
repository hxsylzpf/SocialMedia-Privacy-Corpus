  "content": "The Daily Mail sacked a journalist for unauthorised use of an outside agent to obtain people's personal information, the paper's editor, Paul Dacre, confirmed to MPs today. Dacre said the unnamed journalist was dismissed for defying a Daily Mail ban on the use of such agents, prompted by a report from the information commissioner. \"We let someone go recently,\" Dacre told the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee's inquiry into media standards, privacy and libel. The Daily Mail banned reporters from using outside agents who can supply personal information about celebrities and other newsworthy figures after a 2006 report from the information commissioner put it top of a league table of newspapers whose journalists had paid a private detective to illegally obtain information. Dacre said that, after this report, the Daily Mail banned the use of such outside agents except in cases of overwhelming public interest. Journalists could only contact them with written permission of Daily Mail executives, which had not occurred in the case of the reporter who was dismissed. Dacre said that the Press Complaints Commission code of practice was written into Daily Mail journalists' contracts. After the information commissioner's 2006 report, the paper conducted seminars for staff on data protection, as well as distributing updated guidance notes issued by the PCC, he added. However, Dacre was unable to defend the Daily Mail today against a charge by the Labour MP Paul Farrelly that the paper had revealed the location of the village to which Elizabeth Fritzl, daughter of convicted Austrian rapist Josef Fritzl, had been repatriated. \"I don't know the circumstances,\" he said, promising to investigate the matter and write to the committee with a response. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
