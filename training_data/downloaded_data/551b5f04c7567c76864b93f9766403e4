However, by the time the executive chairman Michael Grade's presentation ended, the overriding imperative to save \u00a3155m this year had left Online stripped of all but two core operations. Even though most of ITV Online's businesses were declared profitable, the division is now resigned to losing Friends Reunited and the business directory service Scoot, while also closing down ITV Play, ITV Local and the price comparison site Price Terrier. Understandably, most attention has focused on Friends Reunited, once the UK's eighth most popular online presence and still responsible for half the portfolio's revenue (\u00a318m a year). Short on profit It's a situation that Ben McOwen Wilson, director of Online, has to make the best of. \"ITV Online was set up to take ideas and identify opportunities for ITV to take our ownership of brands, available airtime or cross-promotional power and turn them into business ideas and drive them to profitability,\" he explains. \"A number of our businesses are at different stages and some were clearly more nascent than others on their path to profitability.\" Friends Reunited was the UK's first social networking site, and the clear market leader when ITV bought it for \u00a3120m in 2005. However, after Facebook and MySpace launched with free registration, it stuck to a paid subscription model for three more years. Despite a peak of 5.5 million users after the relaunch last July, comScore now shows it languishing at 1.7 million UK users in December \u2013 a 20% slide year on year. McOwen Wilson disputes both statistics and any criticism of squandering such a sizeable head start. \"I don't accept the charge that ITV didn't see social networking coming. Friends made its money providing a payment barrier around access to real personal data, but after Facebook people were prepared to put personal data online \u2013 sometimes naively large amounts \u2013 on a real-name basis; that was a \u2026 social shift that took everybody by surprise.\" Yet Friends Reunited lost the plot long before ITV took control. Spin\u2013off services \u2013 Genes Reunited and Friends Reunited Dating \u2013 appeared in 2003 and, while now profitable, proved a distraction to what the managing director of Friends Reunited, Jonathan Clark, called the core site's \"relatively shallow, infrequent use\". Surely more could have been done to inspire users to visit more often or remain longer? \"I think that's probably right,\" concedes McOwen Wilson, \"and it was perhaps a failure of focusing on profitability rather than growth. But will Facebook or YouTube ever be profitable? As a user it may be great or cool or doing everything you want it to do; as an investor they're legitimate questions. Friends always had to exploit a different subsection of the population. Facebook tends to be about telling the story of one's immediate life, what I was doing at 11.50 or 12.15. Friends is more like the round robin letters you send out at Christmas, and that's how it's always been.\" The decision has been made to sell \"when the time is right\" and the question is how much can ITV recoup from what Grade once described as its \"undersung jewel in the crown\". McOwen Wilson remains confident a buyer will be found at \"well north of \u00a360m\", one of the more bullish estimates of its current value. He is also cherry-picking key components of the database to sell off individually. \"The reason for selling is to do with the need to get cash into ITV, and an asset that is considered non-core but profitable is a readily identifiable source of cash \u2026 We're also selling around five core components of data and add-ons that advertisers can buy back \u2013 and in a market where CPT [costs per thousand for user data] on Facebook are sub-five cents, some of the Friends inventory is in the \u00a32-\u00a33 level.\" ITV Online has two priorities, one of which is itv.com, now the UK's fifth most popular entertainment site, according to comScore. \"The trick this year will be to maintain the growth trajectory we've been on,\" says McOwen Wilson. \"But we're delivering 12m-15m video views per month on itv.com, which is well ahead of expectation. If I'd said before we could get 20% of a terrestrial audience online they'd never have believed me \u2013 but the reality is that's where we are for some shows and we fully intend to grow that number.\" Wave goodbye However, improving broadcast content may be a hard trick to pull off, with one well-placed insider claiming that staff morale is \"dismal\" and half of itv.com's content team is either being laid off or looking for alternative employment. \"itv.com is the only solid part of the business and has shown great growth and profit,\" claims the source. \"And yet, they've just demonstrated it's not important to update the website as much as possible. Why would you want to mess with that? I don't know and nobody's bothered to tell us.\" McOwen Wilson denies such claims, saying that while Online is shouldering its share of cutbacks, they are restricted to businesses being sold or closed down. He also believes that, despite Kangaroo's \u00a38m demise, recent deals with BT Vision and Virgin Media means even the BBC's video-on-demand platform is in his sights. \"There are days I look enviously at the BBC having 74 people working on iPlayer, compared to the two we've got and I wish I'd spent \u00a3136m getting ours out of the box the way they did. But look at the all-time top 25 clips on YouTube UK \u2013 eight of them were originally broadcast on ITV. Have we perfectly worked out how to make it all work? No, we've just scratched the surface \u2013 but that's the exciting bit.\"",
