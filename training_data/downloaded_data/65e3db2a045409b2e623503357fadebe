  "content": "[Update: the headline of this story has been altered to stress that the posted user data is NOT from PlayStation Network.] In another difficult weekend for Sony, the company has admitted that the PlayStation Network is likely to remain switched off for several more days. It has also been forced to take action after another security breach, which saw the stolen details of 2,500 sweepstakes contestants being published on a website. In a message posted on the Sony blog on Saturday, the company stated: We're still working to confirm the security of the network infrastructure, as well as working with a variety of outside entities to confirm with them of the security of the system. Verifying the system security is vital for the process of restoration. Additional comprehensive system checks and testing are still required, and we must complete that process before bringing the systems online. PlayStation Network is the online service that lets console users take part in mutltiplayer games, as well as chat and download videos. Two weeks ago, Sony discovered that hackers had infiltrated one of the network's backend servers, potentially gaining access to the credit card details of 77 million users. At a press event in Tokyo last week, Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Kaz Hirai promised that the service would be online within six days. However, in the latest blog message, Nick Caplin, the head of communications at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe wrote, \"when we held the press conference in Japan last week, based on what we knew, we expected to have the services online within a week. We were unaware of the extent of the attack on Sony Online Entertainment servers, and we are taking this opportunity to conduct further testing of the incredibly complex system.\" Also on Saturday, Reuters reported that hackers had accessed the names and partial addresses (but no credit card details) of 2500 people who entered a Sony sweepstake in 2001. When the details were discovered, Sony shutdown the website where they had been posted. \"The website was out of date and inactive when discovered as part of the continued attacks on Sony,\" the company stated. The combined news of the delay and another set of leaked details will try the patience of PlayStation gamers who have been without the online service for 16 days. Sony has promised a 'welcome back' package, comprising of a month's membership to the premium PlayStation Plus service, as well as a selection of free games, but has provided no new timeline for a service re-start. What most gamers now want is a chance to play the the likes of Call of Duty and Killzone against their friends around the world.",
