  "content": "If you check your email today and note that a certain Aaron Sorkin wants to add you as a friend on Facebook, make sure you respond positively - he may just want to make you a star. For Sorkin, the writer of the West Wing, is in talks to pen Facebook: the Movie, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Ok, that might not be the name that eventually makes it into cinemas, but you get the idea. The film will focus on the founders of the social networking site, which sprang into life in February 2004 as the brainchild of Harvard students Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. Sorkin opened his own account on Facebook yesterday in order to break the news. \"I understand there are a few other people using Facebook pages under my name - which I find more flattering than creepy - but this is me,\" he wrote. \"I don't know how I can prove that but feel free to test me. \"I figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what Facebook is, so I've started this page. (Actually it was started by my researcher, Ian Reichbach, because my grandmother has more internet savvy than I do and she's been dead for 33 years.)\" Sorkin also asked Facebook members to send him any interesting stories they might have about the site. However, when guardian.co.uk/film tried to add him as our friend this morning his page seemed to be set to private, so we're guessing he has to add you. Or maybe he just doesn't like us. Zuckerberg and co initially set up the site to cater only to Harvard students, before opening it up to anyone studying at any Ivy League institution, then anyone studying in the US and Canada, and, eventually, to the general public. The site currently has more than 100 million users across the globe. The owners have stood firm in the face of numerous offers for the site, in stark contrast to the proprietors of MySpace, who sold to Rupert Murdoch's News International in July 2005 for $580m (\u00a3315m). If the film proves a success, watch out for MyMovie and ... ahem ... Bebo Movie, coming to a cineplex near you soon.",
