  "content": "A man featured in a BBC documentary series about paedophilia has gone to the high court to prevent the broadcaster from identifying him, claiming he will be at risk of physical attack. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons and must only be referred to as \"A\", is making an emergency application before Mr Justice Ouseley in London before the second part of the series is screened on Thursday on BBC2. His action is being contested by the BBC. His counsel, Mr Keir Starmer, said the claimant had pleaded guilty to offences involving the possession and distribution of pornographic pictures of children last year and was placed under a three year community rehabilitation order with a condition of treatment. \"We say there is a real risk of physical attack if his name and image are shown together, along with adverse comment from police officers about the leniency of his sentence,\" Mr Starmer told the judge. The man, who was \"not a notorious offender\" and had no previous convictions, would feature in the programme for three minutes. The primary issue was the risk of attack, said his counsel, but there was also an \"element of frustration to the rehabilitation programme\". There was no suggestion that his case should not be featured in the programme, but the application was about \"the way in which his name... and his image are juxtaposed\". His image had not been disclosed previously. The series at the centre of the legal action, The Hunt For Britain's Paedophiles, follows the work of the Metropolitan Police paedophile unit and chronicles the efforts of detectives to track down some of the worst offenders. The documentary team was given unprecedented access to the unit and the series is drawn from 12,000 hours of material. Among the investigations featured is Operation Doorknock, which led to members of a paedophile ring being sentenced at the Old Bailey recently for offences stretching back 20 years. The BBC is to put its case to the judge this afternoon.",
