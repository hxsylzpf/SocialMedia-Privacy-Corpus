  "content": "Last night provided a new cast of horrible \u2013 but at the same time strangely beautiful \u2013 characters, handily revealed through the filters of Instagram. Here are our favourites: Beyonc\u00e9 We're not sure Bey got the concept of Halloween quite right here \u2013 judging by this pic, she's dressed as an angel, and could be about to go on stage to sing Halo. That's the trouble with being a global superstar \u2013 you can dress up any night of the year. Heidi Klum Prosthetics and a walking stick? Dressing as an old woman is unexpected from Klum (and there have been some accusations of ageism). With her track record, she could do the Mean Girls-approved lingerie look on Halloween and no one would bat an eyelid. Zooey Deschanel Reality alert! Zooey made this herself \u2013 just look at the scissor work: the purple tights snipped off to be footless, crooked skirt and yellow flats that don't quite match, probably found under the bed. Still, she's be best Batman we've seen since Christian Bale. The Dark Knight truly has risen again. Kelly Oxford If a zombie had a hipster makeover, she might look like this. Add tortoiseshell glasses, a retro hairstyle and fluffy jumper and it's like the undead are trying to pass as normal. A note on the makeup \u2013 black stripes under the cheekbones enhances bone structure. Top marks. Milla Jovovich Victorian gothic is a good look for Milla. Black curls, drips of blood on virginial lace and spider-leg eyelashes makes her look like an overgrown child \u2013 the kind that haunts houses. Spooky, menacing but beautiful \u2013 it's the holy grail of Halloween style. Kate Moss Yes, you read that heading right \u2013 this is one of the world's most recognisable faces, done up Beetlejuice style and almost unrecognisable. (It was posted by her friend and hair stylist, Sam McKnight.) Look in the eyes, though, and it's definately Miss Moss. Ghoulish but nice.",
