  "content": "Extreme caution needs to be taken when considering the extension of state surveillance powers (The all-seeing state, October 8). The home affairs committee's recent report into the issue called for a principle of data minimisation. We concluded that while we do not currently live in a surveillance society, the government needs to ensure that information gathering is targeted and then wiped, and not collected just because it's possible. Britain does not practice data-mining and should never be allowed to do so; the greater risk of intrusion comes from mistakes, and the theft and loss of personal information. The Home Office needs to be able to tell the public that their data will be completely safe before the national ID card scheme is rolled out for all. There are around 500,000 mistakes on the DNA database. Before the information the state takes is extended, there needs to be a major clean-up and a full-scale review of future processes. Keith Vaz MP Chairman, home affairs committee",
