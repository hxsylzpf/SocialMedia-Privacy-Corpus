Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, in a post published on his personal profile page on Friday morning, called for a rejection of \"extremists trying to silence the voices and opinions of everyone else around the world\". \"I won't let that happen on Facebook,\" he wrote. \"I'm committed to building a service where you can speak freely without fear of violence. \"My thoughts are with the victims, their families, the people of France and the people all over the world who choose to share their views and ideas, even when that takes courage.\" Zuckerberg also revealed he had received death threats two years ago in response to content depicting the prophet Muhammad on the social networking site. \"An extremist in Pakistan fought to have me sentenced to death because Facebook refused to ban content about Muhammad that offended him. \"We stood up for this because different voices \u2013 even if they're sometimes offensive \u2013 can make the world a better and more interesting place,\" he wrote. More than 188,000 people have so far \"liked\" the post, which has been shared more than 16,000 times. Meanwhile, Google has a black ribbon on its homepage and has pledged \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3195,000) via the Digital Press Fund to support the magazine. Surviving journalists at the publication have vowed to publish an issue of the magazine next week, but with a much larger than normal print run of 1m copies. Apple has updated its French website to include a banner with the words \"Je Suis Charlie\" (I am Charlie). The phrase has become a defiant slogan and show of solidarity after the Paris atrocities, and the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie is trending on Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr. In 2010 Apple banned an app by Pulitzer prize-winning political cartoonist Mark Fiore from its iTunes store, citing its terms of services forbid the lampooning of public figures. The company reversed its decision after criticism from free-speech campaigners. Media companies have also come together to support Charlie Hebdo, including the Guardian Media Group which has donated \u00a3100,000. It is expected Le Monde, France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions and Radio France will do similar.",
