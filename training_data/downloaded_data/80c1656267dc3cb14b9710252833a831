  "content": "When Australia's federal parliament sits I write a live blog which regularly attracts more than 1,000 comments from readers. A goodly portion of these comments relate to my professional deficiencies, or to the deficiencies of mainstream media journalism. Some of these observations are fair, some are the rhetorical equivalent of paint stripper, some are indecipherable. Once journalists and columnists had the luxury of the mute button. We could style ourselves as priests in the pulpit, delivering sermons without fear of interruption. Some of my tribe, having spent their formative professional years polishing and perfecting the daily projection of God-like grandeur, still peddle righteous certainties. But journalistic righteousness is a brittle business. It could only work when the reader lacked the tools to talk back. Now readers' pent up frustration with our collective vanity and hubris bounces around the internet, unchecked and unshackled by the professional strictures journalists are supposed to adhere to: accuracy, fairness, the studious avoidance of defamation. It's all pretty bracing. Periodically I read well-intentioned laments from colleagues about the great contemporary burden of the comments thread, as if this is something we don't deserve. I understand these laments, but with the greatest respect, they fundamentally miss the point. The conversation between journalist and reader has changed. It has changed forever. And for all its discomforts and challenges, I'm convinced the act of changing the conversation will actually save journalism from itself. Take my own experience of my own thread. Writing a live blog is a punishing business. It starts early. It finishes late. In between starting and ending I generally write more than 8,000 words and file at least every 10 minutes for as long as the story requires. Something as simple as going to the bathroom or making a call takes considerable logistical planning. As a human being, it would be delightful to think this service was valued by the audience, and of course it is by many readers. But the critics are a vital part of the daily conversation. To be told what you are producing is not that valuable, that you could be doing it better, that you are a symbol of the deficiencies of your profession, is actually exactly what journalists need to hear to ensure we don't lapse into smugness, or fall in love with the sound of our own voices. Set aside the monomaniacal trolling, which is more useless and empty than our worst excesses, or the abuse, which is sometimes plain weird, and the cynical and reflexive commentary about journalistic deficiencies designed to be a crowd pleaser rather than generate genuine insight \u2013 looking through what I'd group together as 'the gratuitous' \u2013 sharp audience feedback enlightens. It can tell you instantly when you are assuming too much knowledge, when you've failed to nail your point in an accessible way, when you've momentarily forgotten who the Greens deputy leader is (as happened this week), when you've missed an essential point or development, when you are tedious, when you've missed the important Senate hearing in room 2R1. It can also give you an opportunity not to be the narcissistic fool many readers assume you are. Listening is a simple act of atonement, and a statement of humility \u2013 and given the atrocities and abuses we periodically dish up to the readers, the audience deserves it. There's another rich dividend of the new rules of engagement between writers and readers. This dividend is twofold. If you are prepared to show respect, I think you are also entitled to ask for some respect in return. I'm not waiting for my daily mission to be set by the audience, I'm quite clear in my objectives, I don't collapse under the weight of negative feedback or feel like I need to engage in an act of performance piety to appease or please the reader. I'm quite comfortable standing my ground, and some of that comfort and confidence derives from sustained engagement with the audience. The second dividend is the proximity of the people I work for. My audience is no longer an abstract commodity, far removed from me and and my daily work. It is right beside me, keeping me company, urging me to ask the questions they can't ask, wanting me to better, demanding relentlessly that I work for them. And that's just fine with me. This piece was amended on 11 September 2015 to clarify that the writer blogs on Australian politics.",
