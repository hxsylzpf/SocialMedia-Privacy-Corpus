  "content": "Tessa Jowell has given a cautious welcome to moves by the new chairman of the press complaints commission to improve the regulation of newspapers. Sir Christopher Meyer issued an eight-point plan last month in response to criticism of the PCC, but the culture secretary said in a Guardian interview that she wanted to see words turned into actions. \"He's accepted all bar my proposal for appeals, but let's see. I'm glad with the progress that's been made so far, but I'd like to see the good intention translated into action and impact,\" said Ms Jowell. Last month Sir Christopher said the PCC would appoint an internal figure to review the commission's decisions, a step short of a full \"appeal\" process. He also suggested appointing an extra lay member to the PCC. He accepted that self-regulation had \"jagged edges and imperfections\" but was far more preferable than state regulation or privacy laws. In her interview, Ms Jowell sought to reassure the critics of the communications bill who fear that newspaper proprietors such as Rupert Murdoch would have too much influence if they are allowed to buy Channel Five. If Five changed hands, she said the new media regulator Ofcom would be asked to toughen up the cross promotion code. \"We would certainly get Ofcom to look at what are already tough cross promotion rules. Their toughness is not understood, I think. Anyway, what's Murdoch going to cross promote on Channel Five? Is it Sky to Channel Five? \"Already he could buy advertising space on Channel Five for his newspapers in the same way that the Daily Mail could. But excessive cross promotion would be caught both by the code which we would ask Ofcom to strengthen if we thought necessary, and secondly would be caught by the competition authorities.\" Five would incur greater public service broadcasting obligations if its audience share increased or it changed ownership, she said. Ofcom would also introduce a nominated news provider system for Five, in which its news provider would have to pass a quality and impartiality threshold. Ms Jowell also sought to address the concerns of those who fear that foreign ownership of Five or ITV would result in television screens being flooded with cheap foreign imports, saying strict quotas would protect British programmes. She added: \"We should not discount the good taste and discernment of viewers. People won't watch rubbish and the advertisers won't pay for it.\" As a whole, Ms Jowell said, the bill would balance the economic liberalisation with a greater degree of content regulation. \"We will probably have a content regime that is tougher than anywhere else in Europe if not anywhere else in the world,\" she said.",
