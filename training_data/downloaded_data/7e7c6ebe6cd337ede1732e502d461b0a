  "content": "Richard Desmond, owner of the Daily Express and Daily Star, has declared he is \"very pleased\" with his decision to quit the body that regulates newspapers in Britain, branding the Press Complaints Commission \"an old boys' club\". At the same time, he put the boot into Paul Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail, claiming he was \"immoral\" and \"hypocritical\" about the PCC. He told a parliamentary select committee looking at libel and privacy law that he was \"not proud\" that the commission has taken him to task over the last two years, but said the number of lapses had been few and far between. Last week, the Leveson inquiry heard how Desmond's Express Newspapers paid \u00a3550,000 to Gerry and Kate McCann for more than 100 libellous articles in its four titles, including one in the Daily Star saying they had sold their missing child to pay debts. \"We're not proud that we've had seven cases in two years,\" said Desmond. \"I think this PCC is an old boys' club, and it's certainly been very ineffective, and I'm very pleased at what we did last January, that we pulled out.\" he said. He told MPs and peers that the newspaper industry would be better served if editors were not involved in regulation. \"Let's not have editors of newspapers who sit in a little cabal and, when it's their turn, that editor withdraws and gets discussed behind his back by competitors,\" Desmond said. \"It would work better if the people on that committee were not the same people who were working as day-to-day editors and executives on rival newspapers.\" The newspaper proprietor quit the PCC earlier this year. He said he was in favour of self-regulation but without the make-up of the PCC commission, which has 17 members \u2013 10 lay and seven serving editors. Desmond added that the Daily Mail's lack of coverage of the phone-hacking scandal was \"hypocritical\" and that Dacre was \"absolutely wrong\" to say recently that celebrities stories were part and parcel of the every day. His attack on Dacre comes just weeks after the editor in chief of the Daily Mail described the Express's decision to leave the PCC as \"a body blow to the commission\". Dacre also questioned the \"Blair government\" decision that \"Desmond, the businessman who'd made his money from porn, was a fit and proper person to own a newspaper\". Dacre told the Leveson seminar in October that commercially adroit newspapers use great skills to \"leaven their papers with sensation, exclusive pictures, scandal, celebrity gossip and dramatic human stories\" but still devoted considerable space to serious news.",
