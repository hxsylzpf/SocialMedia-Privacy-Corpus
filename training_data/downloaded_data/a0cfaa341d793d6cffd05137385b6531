  "content": "Yes, it is beyond worrisome that a bug this big existed for so long. But the discovery of Heartbleed \u2013 a truly mind-boggling flaw in OpenSSL, the widely used web security technology run on open-source code \u2013 led to one of the most rapid responses I've ever seen in the encryption world. We're not nearly finished repairing this gaping hole in our online safety, with potentially hundreds of thousands of email accounts and sites relying on a secure connection exposed to Heartbleed. And, yes, the National Security Agency probably knew about it before you did. But still, thousands of sites have moved quickly to mitigate at least some of the immediate damage. So why is everyone pointing fingers at the beleaguered developers of OpenSSL? Because someone should have found this programming error two years ago? Sure, but don't blame this tiny team of volunteers; go change your password (but only if your favorite sites have been updated). These aren't just some lazy coders letting your bank account login leak into the online slipstream; they're heroes, who have worked tirelessly during the past few years on software that can be freely downloaded and modified, that brings online safety, at a low cost, to all of us. And, seriously, there are only like 17 of them. The last thing we want to do, as some fear-mongers have suggested this week amidst 'the worst thing to happen to the internet', is turn over our communications infrastructure from open-source software to for-profit companies that want to extract cash from the ecosystem. The more eyes we have on open programming instructions, the more likely someone will find a bug. But free and open-source shops like OpenSSL can't afford more eyes. There are vital components of our vast online identities that rely on a handful of volunteers who have gotten anywhere near enough financial and in-kind support from the rest of us who use their tools. The first thing we should do is pay our heroic techies of modern-day privacy. Speaking of which, some future Edward Snowden will have to tell us whether the NSA found the Heartbleed flaw before researchers at Google and a Microsoft and Facebook-backed security company independently found it in recent days. But given how vital encryption is to online safety, we have to assume that the best and best-funded minds in online surveillance and hacking have been relentlessly probing OpenSSL over the years of its existence. If the NSA has known about Heartbleed for a long time \u2013 or even a short time \u2013 then the surveillance-staters have possessed a kind a skeleton key to entire swaths of the internet. Part of the NSA's mission, supposedly, is to protect us from things like this very bug. But it's clear, based on the Snowden revelations, that the government's concern for our individual privacy and security takes a distant back seat to its ability to spy on anyone and everyone. So don't be surprised to learn someday that the NSA and/or other western security agencies have been exploiting Heartbleed at home and abroad without bothering to alert us. Nor, for that matter, should you be shocked to learn at some point that well-heeled criminal cyber-gangs or the Chinese government's talented hackers spotted the bug before white-hat hackers revealed it. We need to create and maintain more of our valuable collective projects like OpenSSL, no matter what the spies and black-hats do. I'd like to see major tech companies and commercial interests \u2013 Google and Wells Fargo, among many others \u2013 donate cash and programming talent to these open-source security projects. The major philanthropies should also get involved, given how vital it has become to preserve an open internet for social and political purposes. Ideally, government agencies \u2013 at least the ones we can trust more than not \u2013 should be involved, too. As the trusted cryptographer Matthew Green told Farhad Manjoo of the New York Times: \"If we could get $500,000 kicked back to OpenSSL and teams like it, maybe this kind of thing won't happen again.\" Of course, projects like OpenSSL need more than development help. There's code scrutiny, to ensure that the absolutely critical stuff gets amply supported and vetted. The business community, foundations and government need to find organized ways to provide that as well, and the government actually gave OpenSSL a major blessing several years ago when it granted what's called Federal Information Processing Standards (or Fips) certification to the software. But as Green noted in 2012, the Fips process doesn't really assure code quality. So maybe we've escaped a cyber-Chernobyl. But let's not get reactionary; let's let the coders get our backs.",
