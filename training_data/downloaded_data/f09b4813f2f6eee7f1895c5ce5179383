  "content": "The Sunday Mirror is to launch a new magazine called Notebook boasting a strapline slogan: \"A lot of what you fancy...\" The first issue, with Cheryl Cole on the cover, will be published on 9 June. It replaces the paper's 10-year-old Celebs on Sunday magazine. Two of the columnists are Radio 1's Sara Cox and a former member of the TV's Dragons' Den series, Hilary Devey, who will play agony aunt. The magazine will also be available as a standalone paid-for app as well as having its own dedicated Pinterest board. Editor Mel Brodie says: \"Notebook is a celebration of the everyday extraordinary woman and will provide her with all the information, however diverse, that will keep her in the know. \"If you like, we're the Pinterest of print and we see Notebook as the must-have bible to modern day living.\" Paula Scott, publishing director for Trinity Mirror's national titles, said of the demise of Celebs on Sunday: \"The hunger for weekly celebrity news is diminishing.\" Really? I sincerely hope so, but I'm not sure she is right about that. And I can't help noticing the celebrity cover, Paula! Source: Trinity Mirror",
