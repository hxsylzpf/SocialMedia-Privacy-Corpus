She may have been a little late on the action, but soon after her @HillaryClinton profile was unlocked and verified on the site she had built up a following in the tens of thousands. Her own list of people to follow was somewhat more limited, reaching to four. And of them, all had a familial ring. Bill Clinton was there, as was daughter Chelsea. Rounding out the quartet was the Clinton Foundation and CGI, the Clinton Global Initiative. \"Does @Twitter have a family share plan?\" asked former president Bill, following his wife's debut. As to that tricky first tweet, Hillary name-checked the founders of the Texts from Hillary blog, further referencing the meme by choosing for her profile picture the photograph of herself in dark glasses that inspired it. Thanks for the inspiration @asmith83 &amp; @sllambe - I'll take it from here... #tweetsfromhillary \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 10, 2013 \"Welcome Mom!\" Chelsea responded. And that, pretty much, was that. The motivation behind the belated entrance on Twitter has yet to be explained. Clinton certainly has more time on her hands since stepping away from the relentless travelling that comes with being Secretary of State. No doubt some will suggest that this has meaning in the context of whether she will run as a candidate in the 2016 presidential race. The clever money seems to be on Clinton mounting a campaign. If so, she will be a formidable candidate \u2013 one with broad support amongst both the party base and Democrats on Capitol Hill. In a further tidbit to those Clinton-watchers eager for any sign of a run, the former first lady signed off the biography on her profile (in full: \"Wife, mom, lawyer, women &amp; kids advocate, FLOAR, FLOTUS, US Senator, SecState, author, dog owner, hair icon, pantsuit aficionado, glass ceiling cracker\") with an enigmatic \"TBD...\" [to be decided] A self-knowing wink perhaps. But then again it would have been too much to expect a campaign manifesto confined to just 140 characters.",
