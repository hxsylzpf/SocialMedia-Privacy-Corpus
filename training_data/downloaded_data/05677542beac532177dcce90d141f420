The vigilance that publishers will have to show to weed out such messages may leave them open to defamation actions because they will be forced by the new law to deny themselves a very important defence. The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act was brought in to crack down on sectarian songs, chants and abuse at football matches, but also applies to such messages posted on the net. It came into force on 1 March and there is concern in the media in Scotland, and further afield, about how they are to comply with the law on communications. Scottish minister for community safety and legal affairs, Roseanna Cunningham, said: \"We listened to Scotland's police and prosecutors when they told us they needed greater powers to take a hard line on sectarianism at football and threats of harm being posted on the internet. These new laws make it very clear that religious hatred will no longer be tolerated and there should be no mistake that those who promote sectarianism will feel the full force of the law.\" Jock Brown, a consultant at the law firm Brodies, said: \"I am saying to people that there needs to be much more scrutiny. \"I think in the first instance the crown will be interested in the authors of the material. But if it's lying there for a while and it says something offensive then I think they will come after the publishers.\" Brown said a delay in removal of offensive material of as little as 24 hours could get a publisher into trouble, but how strict an attitude the crown takes will be shown in the cases they bring in the coming weeks and months. The act also applies to people or organisations based outside Scotland, as Brown explained: \"For instance Celtic and Rangers have a lot of fans in Dublin and Belfast and if one of them commits an offence before the travel to a game, or on the ferry over, they can be prosecuted here.\" The law would also apply to Twitter and Facebook if they allowed offensive material to remain on their sites, as it would to any publishers based in England. The practicalities of getting them into a Scottish court might be more onerous, but nonetheless the threat is there and it would not be the first time that an English publisher has been up in a Scottish court because of ignorance of the law. At present many ISPs, newspapers and websites operate light-touch moderation. They do not pre-moderate messages and only remove a message if it is flagged up to them and it is either illegal, or contravenes their own policies for content. Removing material as promptly as the new law appears to require is going to require intense moderation of sites, or else pre-moderation of message boards, building in delays which many users used to immediate posting would find unacceptably slow. By not scrutinisng messages before they are posted publishers retain a defence against an action for defamation (in Scotland there is no distinction between libel and slander \u2013 it's all defamation) called innocent dissemination. In essence this means that those providing forums for debate on the web cannot be sued because they do not know the content of specific messages on their boards. They become liable if that content is flagged up to them and they fail to act upon that warning in a timely manner. Brown said defendant lawyers would fight hard to retain the defence of innocent dissemination against defamation, a civil matter, when the new law is concerned with criminal activity. However, it is easy to see claimant lawyers arguing the reverse and that monitoring for sectarian hatred makes publishers aware of all content, including that which is defamatory. The problem is that even the most basic attention to such messages can make you aware of their content as a publisher and therefore fully liable for them from the point they go up on your site. In one case, even correcting spelling and grammar of posts that appeared on a post meant that the blog publisher could not claim innocent dissemination as a defence. Brown said: \"I commend the Scottish government for applying their minds to this issue, but it's created a minefield.\" Cunningham said: \"The majority of Scots, 91%, supported tougher action to tackle sectarianism. I am under no illusion, this legislation will not be the one-stop solution to all our problems and that is why I recently announced \u00a39m over the next three years to continue work to tackle sectarianism across society. Attitudes change over time and this marks the beginning of the end of the shame that has blighted our glorious game for too long.\" A Scottish government spokesperson said: \"Any behaviour covered by the 'Threatening Communications' offence on a website or message board is likely to already be an offence under the Communications Act 2003. The most significant difference with the 2012 act is that such behaviour will now attract a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine rather than only six months. \"The offence covers threats of severe injury or threats intended to incite religious hatred and websites already weeding out threats of this nature have no reason to be concerned.\" David Banks is a media law consultant and legal author",
