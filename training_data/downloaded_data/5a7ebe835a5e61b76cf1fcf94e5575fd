  "content": "Mark Thompson, director general of the BBC, told the eG8 internet forum in Paris on Wednesday that the corporation realised the importance of adapting to the internet age in the 1990s. Thompson was addressing a session on how traditional businesses have reinvented themselves for the computer age at the forum held on the eve of the G8 economic summit in Deauville on Thursday and Friday. \"We realised it could be a great opportunity for us to do what we were invented to do, which was to bring great, credible news to the world and make great educational content for children. In particular [we realised] that the barriers for entry were going to break down,\" he said. \"For the media [the internet] is a globalising, democratising moment when you can get your message to the world.\" He added that the BBC had the \"privilege of large amounts of public money\". \"With it comes a lot of duties ... but we also have a duty to innovate and from the 1990s we started trying to be quite brave, innovative and experimenting by trying things out.\" He said early successes with the web provided \"an impetus within the BBC for more experimentation and, from that, change\". Thompson added that social media was an enormous source of new ideas, including programmes, and had \"created a new relationship\" with viewers and customers. \"In our business, word of mouth is critical and in that the social media is an extremely powerful tool.\" The forum has seen a clash between those who seek to regulate the internet and \"digital ecosphere\" \u2013 mainly governments \u2013 and those who believe it should be left to its own devices. On the opening day of the eG8 event on Tuesday the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, warned against monopoly control, copyright breaches and intrusions into personal privacy on the internet. However, David Cameron, the prime minister, is expected to resist calls for international regulation of the internet when the G8 summit convenes later this week. Earlier on Wednesday, Lawrence Lessig, a professor at Harvard's law school, rejected what he described as \"moralising\" from those seeking greater regulation of the internet, saying they were often bowing to vested interests. \"It is completely fair to be sceptical of the answers modern democratic governments come up with,\" he added. Vested interests, which he called incumbents, were interested in profit. Governments should be interested in the public good, which he suggested meant non-intervention. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
