  "content": "Now we come to the space where people played, interacted and disputed. Whether patents or selfies, there was controversy and absorption to be had everywhere. Pewdiepie Twerking and rubbing yourself with a foam finger at award shows may whip up controversy and millions of YouTube views, but the real king of the video streaming platform is a Swedish 24-year-old who films himself playing video games. Miley Cyrus only managed to stay on top of the YouTube chart for a month before PewDiePie \u2013 the alter ego of Felix Kjellberg \u2013 regained the throne. With more than 15 million subscribers and more than 200m views most months, it looks likely to remain one of the most popular channels in 2014 \u2013 its only constant challenger being the Turkish music industry channel M\u00dc-YAP. Pierre Omidyar Not content with raking in billions of dollars from his online auction site, the founder of eBay decided to plough $250m into setting up a news organisation. Inspired, he suggested, by the revelations published by Glenn Greenwald from the Snowden disclosures, he recruited Greenwald. He's putting about the same amount in as Jeff Bezos paid for the Washington Post. Shall we come back in five years and see which one is more famous? Pinterest Create boards for different categories and pin pictures to the boards. A way to store online images that you love, or just to appreciate photography. And also a way for a company with no perceptible revenues to raise huge amounts of cash at startling valuations - wouldn't you pin a $38bn valuation to your wall? Prison Architect Want to run a jail? Of course you do! That's why you're gagging to play Prison Architect. It's pretty hard to disagree that you want to play something based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. We can't remember where in the Maslow's pyramid it is that building and managing a jail comes \u2013 somewhere between Serco and G4S, we think \u2013 but it's a radical idea that is sure to be popular in at least some boardrooms. \u2022 Prison Architect \u2013 the game that asks, what's it like to run a jail? PS4 Sony introduced a games console. It's called the PlayStation 4 \u2013 a name which surprised almost nobody, given that its previous consoles were the PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3. It sold a million of them in a weekend, neatly refuting the idea that nobody was interested in games consoles any more, and 2.1m in its first two weeks \u2013 including 250,000 in the UK. Andrew House, chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment, gave a helicopter view of progress in December, suggesting that any supply constraints will ease in spring and more games will become available.  Quantified self movement The \"quantified self\" \u2013 AKA, in the words of writer and editor Paul Carr, \"vanity metrics\" \u2013 began in California, naturally, so that beautiful people could measure just how much more beautiful the number of steps they had taken were making them. There are plenty of opportunities though to do more, for example in real-time health tracking, game mechanics, and other fields. For some, the ability to publish what they've done is one of the biggest attractions of quantified self apps. Some, such as cycling, have become social so that people can race against others in different locations.  Quip With tablets becoming a Big Thing, what people have been looking for more and more is a word processor that is born on a tablet \u2013 not a cut-down desktop idea, but something designed with touch control from the start. Quip is a collaborative word processor that looks more like a chat app so that you can see the thread of edits and changes by other people who are working on a document with you. After all, why should a document that will never be printed pretend to be a sheet of paper? Raspberry Pi Reigniting interest in coding and providing a platform for all sorts of projects, hacks and learning opportunities, the Raspberry Pi captured the imagination of children and adults alike, selling more than 2m computers by the end of November. A British success story.  (Google) Reader In killing the popular (among its users) social RSS reader from 1 July, Google reminded people that even if a service it offers is deeply loved by users, if it doesn't generate advertising revenue or in some other way fit into its aim of gathering more information about users, then it's going to get a ride in the boot up into the mountains. Reader was an RSS reader that also let you share links with other people, so that you could get some idea of what was popular. Journalists in particular found it useful. But many groups found its social aspect, which had been almost accidental in its development, essential. Google instead tried to fold the sharing elements of Google Reader into Google+.  Reader turned out to have a staff of roughly zero, but probably around 12m users \u2013 almost all of whom migrated to Feedly. In March, Buzzfeed noted that \"Google Reader still drives far more traffic than Google+\". This may still be true even with Reader gone. For some small blogs, though, having Reader as an avenue through which they could be exposed to a wider audience was crucial. Without it, smaller voices have less chance of being heard.  Resogun All hail the PlayStation 4! If you like that sort of thing, anyway. Key launch titles included Resogun, which was free for subscribers to the PlayStation Plus online gaming service. We thought it looked like a bit of a \"flashy retro shooter\", but it quickly rose in everyone's estimations to become a game of the year: \"an old-fashioned arcade shooter that reinvents Armageddon as a frantic cascade of beautiful particle effects\", in the words of Nathan Ditum. Rockstar There's a long backstory to this one. In summer 2011, Google (paired with Intel) lost a four-day 20-round auction for the patent portfolio of bankrupt Canadian telecoms company Nortel. Its final bid was $4.4bn; the winners \u2013 a consortium called \"Rockstar BidCo\", consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Sony, BlackBerry and Ericsson \u2013 bid $4.5bn. Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt later said the price had been \"too high\", though Google then rushed to buy Motorola Mobility \u2013 with its giant patent portfolio \u2013 for $12.5bn in August. Apple and the others set up a company called Rockstar to administer the ownership of the patents. In principle, Rockstar is a \"non-practising entity\" (NPE) \u2013 AKA a \"patent troll\" \u2013 since it doesn't make anything, just asserts rights over its patents. Patent trolls are very unpopular in the US. Everything went quiet with Rockstar until at the end of October 2013, when it filed lawsuits in the Eastern District of Texas (which is notoriously patent-holder-friendly) against Google, Samsung, Huawei and HTC. Google is accused by Rockstar of infringing search technologies on a patent filed in 1997 \u2013 before the search company was founded \u2013 and on six other patents; it's seeking damages and royalties. The other lawsuits accuse the handset companies of infringing patents relating to mobile phones. In response, Google has filed a countersuit trying to move the case to California and asking a judge to dismiss the claims. Quite how this will end up is anyone's guess: the cases are bound to take years, but if Rockstar wins it could put a nasty dent in the profitability of smaller Android handset companies \u2013 and if Google ends up paying a per-search tithe to an Apple-owned company, relations between the two will be more strained than ever.  Ross Ulbricht Ulbricht is a 29-year-old San Franscican, whose housemates knew him as a currency trader going by the name of \"Josh\". They knew he was a quiet loner, who cooked steak dinners for himself and spent independence day at home, but none of them expected the FBI to turn up one day and arrest Ulbricht, charging him with running Silk Road, the biggest online drugs marketplace the world has ever seen. Ulbricht says he is \"not excessively concerned\" about the future. Key to any case will be whether the FBI can tie him to ownership or operation of the site \u2013 the location still remains a mystery, hidden as it was through the obfuscation of the Tor network. The FBI also seized a large and very valuable stash of Bitcoins which it said were being used by Silk Road. Rovio The Finnish company is famous enough to have featured obliquely in Armando Iannucci's satire on the US politics, Veep (when Selma Meyer visits Helsinki and is given a giant Angry Bird clock). From there it's only a short step to landing in Hollywood, which is where the company \u2013 or at least some idea around it \u2013 seems to be headed. Well, it worked for Moshi Monsters, which is entertaining popcorn-guzzling children as you read this, so why not something involving flightless catapulted birds demolishing loosely-built structures housing pigs? (There's been a mildly successful version, we recall, with a wolf instead of the birds, though we think the script might need some redrafting \u2013 the ending wasn't so favourable.) If Aardman gets the gig, they could reuse some of the Plasticine from Chicken Run. Win-win. Satoshi Nakamoto Nobody knows who she or he is, nor even whether s/he is a single person or a group (though the latter seems unlikely). The pseudonymous Japanese name is a fake. But that is the given name of the inventor of Bitcoin, one of the Guardian's ten people of 2013. The New Yorker suggested it might be a Finnish researcher, Vili Lehdonvirta, at the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology. He laughed and denied it. The writer then suggested that Michael Clear, an Irish researcher, might be. He denied it too. Fast Company magazine pointed out that a patent filed in August 2008 by Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry seemed to have some similarities to Bitcoin's technologies; all three have denied being Nakamoto. It's widely believed that Nakamoto has a huge hoard of Bitcoins created back at the currency's dawn, which could now be cashed in for vast amounts. But again, there's no proof. All we have is Nakamoto's original 2008 paper \u2013 and Bitcoin.  Self-driving cars There's been lots of hubbub about self-driving cars \u2013 which seem simple in principle, but are actually very hard to do in practice (how do you avoid suicidal pedestrians, whose fault is it if there's an accident, how do you allow for changing roads if it works off a downloaded map, what if your internet access dies, what if the computer crashes, and so on). Yes, we've had self-driving aircraft for ages, but traffic at ground level is a lot less predictable than that at 30,000ft.  Google is best-known for touting the idea, but it turns out (as a long New Yorker article pointed out) that lots of vehicle manufacturers are working on the same idea \u2013 though they're thinking of assisting the driver, not replacing the driver, for all sorts of reasons. Meanwhile, Milton Keynes could be getting driverless \"pod cars\" as soon as 2017, according to business secretary Vince Cable. Under the \u00a31.5m project, they'll share pathways with pedestrians and \"have sensors to avoid collisions\" to cover the one-mile gap from the shopping centre to the rail station. (Business hint: this may be a good time to set up an accident law firm in Milton Keynes. You know how clumsy pedestrians can be.) Selfies 2013 is undoubtedly the year of the selfie; it found its way into the Oxford Dictionaries Online in August and was then named the Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year last month. (Note: \"Oxford Dictionaries Online\" is emphatically not the same thing as the Oxford English Dictionary, aka OED.) Some notable selfies this year? That time Beyonc\u00e9 agreed to pose in a selfie (while performing) \u2013 oh, and that other time that three world leaders decided to snap a selfie at Nelson Mandela's memorial. The question is: are selfies a pointer to our need to verify ourselves among the sea of incoming media showing the faces of others which threatens to inundate our own identity, or an indication of a growing narcissism and self-absorption to the exclusion of outward reality? Answers on the back of a philosophy student, please.  Next instalment tomorrow",
