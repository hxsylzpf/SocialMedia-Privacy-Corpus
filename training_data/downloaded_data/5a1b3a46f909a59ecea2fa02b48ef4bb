  "content": "#JustSaying, but when we first hailed Twitter in 2007, many doubters were withering about another electronic outlet for compulsive communicators \u2013 with a 140-character limit to guarantee they could relay nothing tastier than what they'd had for breakfast. But UK tweeters \u2013 and there are now 10 million \u2013 have since discovered myriad ways in which less is more. \"There's a plane in the Hudson\", with a link to the photo, really was all that needed to be said when that occurred. Brevity brings the speed that allowed @ReallyVirtual to unwittingly scoop the US president by reporting on the raid that killed Bin Laden. @MarsPhoenix has sent bite-sized missives, in both words and binary, straight from the red planet. If pithy news is better, then pithy views are best. After all, even a truly winning line \u2013 \"2b or not 2b, that is the question\" \u2013 can leave 106 characters spare. Best of all, the 165 words of a third leader suddenly feels big enough to bathe in.",
