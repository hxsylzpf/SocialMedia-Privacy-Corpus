  "content": "Data, data, data. There's loads of it out there and more coming your way as governments open their statistics vaults around the world. First the US with data.gov, then Australia and New Zealand followed suit. Now it's the UK's turn with data.gov.uk. And that's in addition to the cities and US states that have made government data available too: London launched very recently - you can get the full set of links for government data sites around the world here. Ever since the government appointed Sir Tim Berners-Lee as its open data Czar (working with Prof Nigel Shadbolt from Southampton University) it was obvious the issue was going to be big for the government, but what does it mean for you? You now have tens of sites around the world providing you access, but how do you find them? Well, this is now the place. To coincide with the launch of data.gov.uk, we have created the ultimate gateway to world government data. At World Government Data you can: \u2022 Search government data sites from the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and London (this comes under United Kingdom, if you want to browse) in one place and download the data (more sites to come) \u2022 Help us find the best dataset by ranking them \u2022 Collect similar datasets together from around the world \u2022 Browse all datasets by each country It's all been put together with the help of developer Ben Firshman and is the culmination of our year-long project to make data widely available to everyone. And, even better, we have an API available. Even though all of these government data sites have enormous quantities of data, they are not in the same formats. What we have done is put them into a unified form, meaning developers have the opportunity to write applications that compare data between different countries. If you want the data in Atom or JSON just change the \"/search\" to \"/search.atom\" or \"/search.json\" in the url. There will be full documentation on this soon. Watch this space. The whole project is only going to increase in size and scope. As Ben Fry has said: \"This is only going one way: there is no trend towards less data\" Can you do something with this data? \u2022 Go straight to our World Government Data search \u2022 Gallery: the full list of government data sites \u2022 Gallery: the top 10 best visualisations and apps Flickr Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our Flickr group or mail us at datastore@guardian.co.uk \u2022 Get the A-Z of data \u2022 More at the Datastore directory \u2022 Follow us on Twitter",
