  "content": "The Giving Summit hosted by the Cabinet Office in May was scaled down in the face of the tax rebate cap furore. A month later the government released its update to the giving white paper with very little fanfare. There was no mention of the tax U-turn, despite it being the most high-profile story about giving since the white paper. The update showcased a wide range of current and future actions making giving easier, more compelling, and more present \u2013 particularly if you spend much time online. Fundraising income fell by \u00a370m in 2009/10 for the top 500 charities, with the top 20 raising 40% of the total. Whether in big chunks from a few organisations, or in small amounts from a lot of people, donor income is a great way to get unrestricted funding. Impetus Trust funds small charities because we believe they are where innovation happens. Funding is long-term and unrestricted because we believe that's how charities grow strategically and sustainably. More small charities need this type of funding \u2013 and increasing public donations is one way to get it. But when most donations currently go to the charities with the resources to ask, how can small charities ensure that they are not missing out. The first step for a charity building a fundraising strategy is to take it seriously. This isn't work you can do in half an hour at the end of the day. It's a strategic decision, which needs trustees on board as well as staff. Adding it to the workload of a colleague without acknowledging the scale of the task will demoralise them. If you've always focused on grant funding, or earned income, and you don't realistically have the capacity to resource another income strategy, then don't risk taking focus away from the funding that currently keeps you going. If you think you do have the resources, you need to articulate the reasons why people should give you their money. If you don't know your organisation's theory of change, now is the time to sit down and work it out. Hone your elevator pitch. If you've been putting off getting to grips with outcome measurement, this is your opportunity to put that right. Fundraising without evidence that you make a difference is a non-starter. Even if all you've got at the moment are case studies and anecdotes, start using them. This is the most important work you'll do. The new Inspiring Impact website can show you what's out there to help. The white paper update says that an \"effective use of technology by charities is essential to growth in giving\". Your website is crucial to fundraising, not just in terms of its content, but in the opportunities it offers people to give. You need to drive people to your site, and that means using social media, as well as newsletters and traditional marketing. Understanding Facebook and Twitter will take time, effort, and resources. Social media is useful for networking and campaigning, as well as fundraising, so the investment will pay off. This report from the Institute for Philanthropy is a great starting point, and NFPtweetup the next step. The internet is giving rise to potentially game-changing funding innovations. The Innovation in Giving Fund is growing a range of initiatives which could replace traditional micro donations in a way that makes it easier for small charities to get some of the money. Be proactive and get in touch with newcomers like timto.co.uk, givey.co.uk, pennies.org.uk and localgiving.com. Technology is giving all charities a new and powerful voice, but there is a danger that those who can already shout loudest will benefit the most. That's bad for innovation, bad for communities and bad for the public who deserve an informed choice about where they donate their money. The government is on the right track, but when it comes to measuring success, it is crucial that they don't just look at the total amount given. A successful giving strategy will see donor-giving increasingly benefit charities of all sizes, and will see small charities not shut out, but enabled to unlock this useful funding.
