  "content": "Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty and one of the six advisers to Lord Justice Leveson, has moved to lift confusion about her stance on the report, saying she supported an independent press regulator but believed it would be possible for a judge to determine whether the new regulator was fulfilling its goals. Chakrabarti said she agreed with Leveson's plan for a new press regulator and for his recommendation that the board be independent of current editors, owners and politicians. \"No statute is needed to create such a body,\" she wrote on the Liberty website. She said that while Leveson had proposed an independent body such as Ofcom should determine whether the regulator was compliant with its goals, Liberty \"would rather leave the question of whether the tests are met to the courts and not involve a quango which is ultimately appointed by politicians\". She added: \"Ethical publishers who set up, join and comply with such an independent body should be rewarded in the context of costs and damages in any court action that they nonetheless face.\" Her chief disagreement was with a fallback mooted by Lord Leveson to introduce statutory regulation of the newspaper industry if the press resolutely refused to embrace better self -regulation. She wrote: \"It is this alternative that Liberty cannot support and which would in our view, breach article 10 of the ECHR [European convention on human rights] and Human Rights Act. As this last-ditch alternative is not even a recommendation of the report, it is misleading to suggest that Liberty or its director is in any way dropping a 'bombshell' on the lord justice's report, not least as this position was clearly footnoted in it.\"",
