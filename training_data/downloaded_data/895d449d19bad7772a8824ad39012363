The latest data shows that shares in Facebook are changing hands for up to $76 each, more than double their value at the start of this year. While Facebook is still privately held, shareholders are able to sell the company's stock through \"secondary market\" trading. By buying at these prices, some investors are calculating that Facebook is worth more than eBay or Dell, or nearly twice as much as Yahoo!. Secondary market trading can artificially inflate the value of a private company, as the relative scarcity of its shares may encourage a buyer to overpay. But with founder Mark Zuckerberg thought to be planning to float Facebook in the next couple of years, there is already strong interest in what would be the tech sector's biggest IPO since Google went public six years ago. Facebook is expected to earn around $1.285bn (\u00a3824m) of advertising revenue this year, a figure that is tipped to rise sharply to $1.76bn in 2011. It is thought to be profitable, although there is limited information given it is a private company. David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect, predicted last week that it would be simple for the company to increase profitability, but believes that Zuckerberg is still focused on growth. Technology and internet companies tend to be valued on relatively high \"multiples\" \u2013 the ratio of their market capitalisation to their annual earnings. Apple, for example, was worth $219bn when Wall Street closed last night and is expected to deliver profits of nearly $13bn in 2010. That gives Apple a price-to-earnings ratio of around 17x based on this year's performance. Yahoo has a p/e ratio of almost 22x, while Google's p/e ratio is 19.5x. Facebook's phenomenal growth to date, and the challenge of converting its popularity into revenue, means it is harder to assess the company on these metrics. It attracted its 500 millionth user last month, giving it an unparalleled wealth of social networking activity. It is also benefiting from the smartphone boom \u2013 communications regulator Ofcom reported last week that 45% of all mobile internet use in the UK was spent on Facebook. However, it has repeatedly faced criticism over privacy issues, and users may resist efforts to \"mine\" their personal information so it can be used to drive revenue growth. In 2007, Facebook sold a 1.6% stake to Microsoft for $240m, a deal that valued the whole social networking firm at $15bn. This was after Zuckerberg had rejected a $1bn takeover offer from Yahoo!. He also reportedly rebuffed Microsoft's efforts to buy the whole company. An IPO might not happen until 2012, and some technology analysts believe there is still time for Zuckerberg to receive an offer he cannot refuse. \"If I was on the board of either Microsoft or Apple, I would seriously consider bidding for Facebook,\" said Richard Holway, chairman of TechMarketView. He believes that Facebook, along with Apple, are the two companies that will define the path of the technology and internet sectors through the next few years, and this could encourage another tech giant to swoop. \"Microsoft could used Facebook as a portal for all their cloud services. They could include MS Office, and a prominent Bing search box,\" Holway suggested. \"Apple popularised the app, and Facebook is the most used app of all. Both Facebook and Apple apps bypass Google main revenue stream \u2013 sponsored search. Google is the company with the most to fear right now.\" How the tech giants measure up (market capitalisation based on last night's closing prices) Apple: $219bn Microsoft: $208bn IBM: $157bn Google: $143bn Cisco: $120bn Intel: $102bn Hewlett-Packard: $89bn eBay: $30bn Dell: $22bn Yahoo: $18bn",
