  "content": "Overnight, Twitter flew past the 10bn tweet milestone, according to the GigaTweet site, which tracks the microblogging service. It has taken more than three years to get there. However, Twitter's rapid growth means that the next 10bn should be knocked off in 203 days. GigaTweet, an independent project, graphs the number of tweets per hour and per day, as well as showing the grand total. Twitter also monitors its own progress and in a blog post last month announced that: Folks were tweeting 5,000 times a day in 2007. By 2008, that number was 300,000, and by 2009 it had grown to 2.5 million per day. Tweets grew 1,400% last year to 35 million per day. Today, we are seeing 50 million tweets per day \u2014 that's an average of 600 tweets per second. The system is not hard to track, because Tweets are numbered. You can see tweet 9,999,999,999 by Rafaela Marques from Brazil, who may now get some unexpected attention. Sadly, you can't see the 10 billionth because it was from a user who protects his or her tweets. Either way, this is going to lead to some very long numbers indeed, assuming Twitter survives another 10 or 20 years. It's also going to consume quite a lot of disk space if Twitter keeps all the tweets. Twitter's numbers are, of course, still relatively small compared to the sort of traffic hitting really popular sites such as YouTube and Facebook. Windows Live Messenger runs around 10bn \"tweets\" per day.",
