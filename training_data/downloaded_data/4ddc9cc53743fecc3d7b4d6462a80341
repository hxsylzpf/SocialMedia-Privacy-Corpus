  "content": "Max Mosley, outraged subject of a tabloid expos\u00e9, demands strict enforcement of the code of conduct devised by editors and administered by the Press Complaints Commission (Rules for the press are there. They just need enforcement, 28 November). I'm no choirboy, but I believe Max and I are singing from the same hymn sheet. As a former tabloid editor I have outraged, offended and occasionally hurt both guilty and innocent in pursuit of truth in the public interest. I have, admittedly, done the same in search of titillation. But I never broke the law, nor knowingly allowed those who worked for me to engage in criminal activity. Mosley calls for a separation of powers: a star-chamber-style Press Complaints Commission with \"the power to fine, also to order an immediate correction (specifying position, prominence and wording)\", and a panel of independent adjudicators able to investigate without waiting for complaints from the public. He wants to expand the role of the adjudicators to offer advice \"to an editor who was unsure about the legitimacy of his story\". Adjudicators, he suggests, \"would need knowledge of the law and journalism. Such people do exist, for example the academics who teach journalism in our universities\". I suggested something similar in the August issue of Press Gazette, pointing out that existing law is adequate and eager to punish criminal acts such as hacking, and that the self-regulating PCC is heavily skewed in favour of lay members who easily outvote their journalist counterparts. It is essential that major national newspapers and magazines submit to the authority of the PCC. Currently, publications within Richard Desmond's organisation \u2013 the Express and Star newspapers and Northern &amp; Shell magazines \u2013 neither contribute funding to the self-regulatory body nor recognise judgments of the PCC. Neither does Private Eye. Exemptions cannot be allowed. As to the separation of pursuit and punishment, I recommended the industry establish a pre-press counsel (PPC) of respected elders of journalism to confidentially vet \"borderline illicit\" methods proposed in any newspaper investigation prior to publication. There were, I submitted, men and women from all sides of the industry qualified and capable of sitting in pre-judgment of their peers. My choices? Ian Hargreaves, former Independent editor and now a professor of journalism in Cardiff; prominent media lawyer Mark Stephens; Rosie Boycott (editorships included the Independent and Daily Express); and Roy Greenslade, once editor of the Daily Mirror and now press commentator for the Guardian. Advice from such experienced and unimpeachably confidential advisers before publication offers a carrot-and-stick approach: prior consultation could be presented to a subsequent PCC inquiry as evidence of due care in pursuit of the public interest, while failure to consult the PPC, or a refusal to heed its warnings, would negate a newspaper's subsequent right to plead a public interest defence. Post-Leveson, the remedies sought by Max Mosley and a shamed popular media might not be a million miles apart.",
