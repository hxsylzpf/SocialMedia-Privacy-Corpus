One or two women query the idea that speaking out is the right strategy, arguing that the most efficient way of dealing with bullies is to ignore them. The implication here, of course, is that \"speaking out\" is the problem. No, actually. Speaking out is not the problem. However, since women do speak out about misogynistic abuse with great regularity, changing nothing, it might be time to accept that speaking out is not the solution, either. It doesn't take a great analytical talent to parse the insults directed at Beard and conclude that their general thrust is against the idea that she has intelligence and status, and in favour of the idea that she is wrong not to do her best to look as attractive and sexually available as possible. In other words, these critics would prefer Beard, and no doubt all women, to be concerned only with valuing themselves as the passive objects of their possible sexual attention. It's not a giant leap to assume that, were the men doling out this abuse living in satisfying relationships, they wouldn't be hunkered over the web, superimposing vulvas on to the noses of historians and sharing it with like-minded chums on a website designed for the purpose. These men are surely intensely dissatisfied with themselves and their lives, and blame women for it. It's easy to see why they would. Many women subscribe to the idea that feminism has transformed their lives and opportunities. I do myself. However, I also believe the influence of feminism on contemporary society is overstated. There are two unfortunate consequences. One is that many women have an inflated view of the practical efficacy of feminism, and continue to place uncritical hope in it. Another is that many men have a similarly inflated view, and see feminism, and the women who seem to have benefited richly from it, as the focus of their angry feelings of failure and rejection. Feminism's main benefit to women, I suggest, has been psychological. Women's lives today are so very different to those of women in the past, largely as a consequence of technological and economic change. Feminism has given women confidence and support in adjusting to those changes. It has also had a positive influence on shaping the detail of those changes. But it didn't, for the most part, actually cause them. Beard is a don at Cambridge. Before 1948, that wasn't allowed. Sure, feminism played a huge role in gaining equal access to education for women. But so did a growing and intensifying economic shift in Britain, away from manual labour to intellectual labour. Likewise, that move away from manual labour resulted in fewer men having jobs that made huge physical demands on them, demands that made it seem sensible that they should be untroubled by any expectation of domestic contribution. It's one thing to have dinner on the table for a man who is drained and exhausted by a long and arduous shift in a shipyard, but quite another if that man has spent the day working in the shop down the road from the shop you work in yourself. (Because, of course, mothers started going out to work in great numbers, at exactly the same time not only as feminism, but also at the same time as their husbands started losing that tiring but relatively well-paid work in heavy industry.) Yet, just as women are a bit too fond of thanking feminism for a service economy that seeks to employ educated women, sometimes men are too fond of blaming it for the same thing. These men think that if women hadn't insisted on equality and independence, they'd still have their well-paid jobs \u2013 and their wives would be at home warming their slippers and making sure the menfolk weren't too troubled by the babies that were an inevitable result of the sex-on-demand they deserved as breadwinners. That's a powerful delusion. It's also part of why pornography became mainstream as this societal change filtered through. It's not just male fantasies about what sex should be like that are flattered, it's fantasies about what life as a whole should be like. Hence, the \"Page 3 girl\" is often defended as a way of giving well-paid work to young women who don't have other opportunities. She's really in the pages of the Sun to comfort men who share some views with the men who go on the web actively to denigrate women. But this defence of her choices is also an acknowledgement that many women, like many men, still don't have much choice \u2013 and where they can choose, often make choices that feminism doesn't approve of. Even its most ardent supporters will admit feminism has helped middle-class women the most. No wonder. For middle-class women, there was a door to push at, with middle-class men on the other side keen to open it just a crack and let some female graduates through the door to be their secretaries or managers. Big opportunities for intellectual work in the professions actually existed, so could be fought for. Part-time, low-paid work for women was always there, as long as women didn't let it interfere with looking after their husbands and their kids. With men on the hunt for the same sort of work, wages and conditions were depressed yet further. Now, when an idealised nuclear household is expected to contain two adults without much earning power, and with childcare costs so high, it's not surprising that so many women choose, or are left, to go it alone. At the other end of the spectrum, dual-income professionals have played havoc with the property market. Economically, feminism can only achieve for women the opportunities the system can provide. As I say, it has done a marvellous job in supporting women who have the skills to grasp those opportunities. Middle-class men, though? They had that stuff already. And though so many saw the inherent fairness of feminist arguments, they set up no networks that helped men to manage change, and developed no ideology of solidarity with other men, however imperfect. A lot of men simply fought a rearguard action to hang on to the best of what they already had. Powerful men generally succeeded. Dispossessed men often failed. And if they wanted to turn their anger on women, not on the men who'd been at the top of the heap all along, pulling the strings \u2013 well, bingo. Deflection. So much the better for the kingpins. Many men who have been hurt by the technological and economic change that feminism helped women to thrive in, see only that they don't have fancy jobs, while women do \u2013 women who complain that they still don't have enough. All these men have is time, paradoxically gifted to them by the advance of the technologies that helped to make them obsolete as workers and as fathers. They hunch over those technologies \u2013 their tellies, their computers \u2013 and spew hate at women, unable to see that the destructive force that has beaten them down is generally referred to not as \"women\" but as \"growth\" and \"progress\". Time to speak out? Definitely. But we need to say a great deal more than: \"This is horrible. Poor us.\"",
