Police official Jung Suk-hwa said the technology giant breached South Korean telecommunication laws with its illegal data capture, which the company admitted to in May 2010. South Korea becomes the latest country to find Google in breach of its privacy laws, others include the UK, Canada, Australia and Spain. It was not immediately clear whether Seoul would choose to prosecute Google, with the police authority saying only that the investigation would be concluded by the end of January. Google is facing investigations in more than 20 countries around the world after admitting to mistakenly collecting sensitive information from unsecured Wi-Fi networks with its Street View mapping cars. A string of code in the production systems of Street View cars allowed Google to retrieve and store information about the networks' location, names and Media Access Control (MAC) addresses on wireless networks that were not password protected. The Korean National Police Agency (KNPA) analysed data on computer hard drives seized in an August raid on Google's South Korean headquarters in Seoul. Google said it was \"profoundly sorry\" for mistakenly collecting the so-called \"payload\" data and vowed to continue to cooperate with South Korean authorities. \"As soon as we realised what had happened, we stopped collecting all Wi-Fi data from our Street View cars and immediately informed the authorities,\" Google's Korean arm said. \"We have been cooperating with the Korean communications commission and the police, and will continue to do so. Our ultimate objective remains to delete the data consistent with our legal obligations and in consultation with the appropriate authorities.\" Google completed its deletion of the sensitive data collected from UK Wi-Fi networks last month, after being found in breach of the Data Protection Act by the Information Commissioner's Office.",
