  "content": "Do whistleblowers make you cheer, or feel queasy? Edward Snowden, author of the latest cyber-leak, is a cogent critic of the hysteria into which the \"war on terror\" has led US (and by association British) governments. But on whose authority does he reveal state secrets? Is he not a traitor, a turncoat, a tool of terror? Snowden is no agent of a foreign power. He is no conscientious objector, no deserting soldier. He is a contractor who came across what he regards as hypocrisy on the part of those who claim to defend freedom but are in fact curbing it. Like such predecessors as Bradley Manning, Clive Ponting and Daniel Ellsberg, he was telling his own countrymen how far their rulers have departed from the liberties they claimed to defend. The mass gathering and storage by Washington (and we assume London) of every citizen's electronic communication \u2013 \"we hack everyone, everywhere\" is the motto \u2013 has handed Osama bin Laden his last great coup. The Prism programme shows how far militant Islam's crazy bid to undermine western values can succeed, when democracy hands securocrats unlimited money and unconstrained power. The US and Britain today are as invulnerable to military conquest as ever in history. They are secure. They may be threatened by the bombs of terrorists and criminals but that is no \"existential\" threat. Yet because paranoia is the classic ally of power, counter-terrorism has inflated its enemies and thereby itself into an industry of cold-war proportions. Governments always claim such intrusions are \"within the law\". But as we saw after 9/11, it defines the law. \"We collect significant information on bad guys, but only bad guys,\" said the White House. The British foreign secretary, William Hague, claims \"the law-abiding citizen has nothing to fear.\" It is the cliche of the police state throughout history. Snowden tells us to greet it with a hollow laugh. Such whistleblowers are vital antidotes to the surveillance that the jihadist know is their best confidence-sapping weapon. Making westerners lose trust in their own government is the first step in undermining liberal vigilance and tolerance. Those who cry \"better safe than free\" will end up being neither. Those who want to bring Snowden to justice are the true \"useful idiots\" of the next Osama bin Laden.",
