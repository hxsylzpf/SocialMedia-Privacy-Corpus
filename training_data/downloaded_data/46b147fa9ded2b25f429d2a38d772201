In December 1999 a Mirror article by reporter Gary Jones quoted verbatim extracts from records kept on Brady at Ashworth secure hospital, where he is being treated. Brady was on hunger strike at the time in protest at being moved to a different ward. Journalist Robin Ackroyd, who acted as a go-between in leaking the documents, revealed his identity in the paper today following the House of Lords decision. The case raises important issues of privacy and the media but Mr Satchwell said Brady had relinquished his rights to privacy. \"Journalists and editors respect people's privacy but there's a huge difference between ordinary people's rights to privacy and those of the famous or infamous,\" he said. \"In this case it's a matter of infamy plus the fact that there were serious questions that needed to be asked about the running of the secure hospital.\" Paraphrasing the judgment given by Lord Denning in the thalidomide case, Mr Satchwell added: \"In essence, there's no confidence or privacy in iniquity.\" \"Any disclosure of a journalist's sources does have a chilling effect on the freedom of the press,\" admitted Lord Woolf. However, the Ashworth case was exceptional, said Lord Woolf. Medical records were always confidential and this was even more important in the case of the database at Ashworth. \"The care of patients at Ashworth is fraught with difficulty and danger,\" Lord Woolf said.",
