Less than two months later, with the publication of the Pollard report on 19 December, it was announced he would not be returning to the BBC2 news programme. Fast forward nearly four months, to April 2013, and new director general Tony Hall reveals that the interviews for the job will take place \"shortly\". Well, you don't want to hurry these things. Maybe this week, eh? \u2712John Witherow may only be acting editor at the Times but he is already squaring up to Daily Telegraph chief Tony \"Totty Shots\" Gallagher's eagerness to run photos of female celebs on the flimsiest pretexts \u2013 although Witherow seemingly differs in being as keen on brunettes as blondes. Last week saw Towie types on Monday, the star of The Bridge on Tuesday, Beyonc\u00e9 on Wednesday, Pippa Middleton and Joss Stone on Thursday, and the Duchess of Cambridge (just as she did in the Telegraph) gracing the front page on Friday. After the Mail-mimicking \"Daily Mailygraph\", are we seeing the emergence of the Teletimes? \u2712Missing from the various press awards is one for the best single issue, a title that might well have been seized by Wednesday's Daily Mail. On the front page, a headline that set the news agenda until the weekend (Vile Product of Welfare UK), and compelled both George Osborne and David Cameron to dance obediently to Paul Dacre's tune; and inside the regular \"Dacre's Delight\" double-spread made naughtier than ever: not just the usual unknown models or readers in scanties or swimwear, but 18 images of Petronella Wyatt, Mail writer and former Boris Johnson mistress. In each one, adroitly tapping readers' nostalgia, she was in 1950s-style underwear. \u2712Hacks at the Independent clearly fancy themselves as on-screen stars on publisher Evgeny Lebedev's new local TV station, London Live. Eighty of the paper's editorial staff have responded to a call for those interested in a screen test with London Live station chief Stefano Hatfield. He will hold auditions for Sindy, Indy and Evening Standard hopefuls in a fortnight. No news on whether he intends to evaluate the candidates from a swivel chair. \u2712 Few BBC online news stories will have been read with as much quiet glee internally as last week's embarrassing incident for Rob Wilson, when the Tory MP (intending to link to Guido Fawkes's blog) accidentally tweeted a link to a hardcore porn site. As Wilson has been bombarding the Beeb with questions (who knew what, when?) about the Savile scandal, considerable restraint was clearly required of those who had to answer them, to avoid succumbing to the temptation to fire off a series of missives to Wilson demanding an explanation \u2712\"Vogue editor admits Devil Wears Prada fashion-world stereotypes mostly true\" should have been the 'shock' headline on a Friday Telegraph piece by Alexandra Shulman, in which she explained why organising a Vogue festival has its unique challenges. \"The choice of flowers on stage, for example, is the subject of substantial negotiation \u2013 some speakers are very specific about which blooms company they are prepared to share the podium with.\" Specific types of scented candles are requested for guests' dressing rooms. And, with tweeters' smartphones incessantly snapping speakers, \"arrangements on stage have to take account of 'best sides'.\" Just like the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International TV festival, really. \u2712 Prancing before the snappers in his bizarre first-day photo-call, Lord Hall appeared to be trying out celebrity-style signature poses: Usain Bolt, John Travolta, Simon Rattle, Frankie Howerd... But the official DG pose that emerged from the process \u2013 it accompanies Hall's credo on the BBC's press website - shows his hands enigmatically forming a triangle with rounded sides. Is it a tree, a \"One BBC\" symbol, a Gareth Bale heart sign badly done? Could it be meant to suggest that, ahem, the Beeb's future is female? Or is he warning us that things could very well go pear-shaped? \u2712 Mip TV's 50th birthday is celebrated in Broadcast with a feast of anecdotes from veteran Croisette-goers, of which the best may be a \"rumour has it\" tale about Simon Cowell: it's said he ordered his Cannes-bound helicopter to \"turn around and head back to London when he realised that ITV Studios Global Entertainment's party to celebrate Red or Black? was being held on the beach - something that would ruin his Cuban heels\". \u2712 Hacks hoping for some relaxing Easter holiday fun for their children at a Cartoonito screening had a rude awakening. Sportacus, star of Cartoonito's LazyTown - aka former European champion gymnast Magnus Scheving - jetted in from Iceland to the launch in London and surprised the kids by somersaulting into the room. After getting them to try out some of his athletic skills, Sportacus - who has biceps the size of a small country - turned the tables on the parents. The husband of Daily Mirror TV editor Nicola Methven had to do some ballet, while What's On TV deputy features editor Nick Cannon had to compete against Sportacus doing one-handed, one-legged press-ups. Krytpon Factor for hacks, anyone?",
