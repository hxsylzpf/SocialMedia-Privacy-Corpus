Now we want to know what your all time favourite Harry Potter quote is. Tell us by emailing childrens.books@theguardian.com and we'll post as many as we can on this blog, or share on Twitter @GdnChildrensBks.

We'll be celebrating on the site of course (we've got various tricks up our sleeves) but until then you can register to download a Harry Potter Book Night kit. Also Check out the new Harry Potter covers by Jonny Duddle! Your favourite quotes Cameron \"If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals\" \u2013 Sirius Black. Aris 'It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities' \u2013 Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I believe this quote applies so much to our society and to humanity, that's why it's spot on and the best quote in my opinion throughout the whole series. If I had to choose a close second it would be: 'Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love' \u2013 Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Naomi \"Dobby never meant to kill. Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure\" \u2013 from the film of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Hannah \"Harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: having received its tribute of blood the archway reopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave and Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy sea water that filled the crevice in the cliff. 'It's going to be all right, sir,' Harry said over and over again, more worried by Dumbledore's silence than he had been by his weakened voice. 'We're nearly there\u2026 I can Apparate us both back\u2026 don't worry\u2026' 'I am not worried, Harry,' said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. 'I am with you.'\" From Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Natasha \"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love.\" From Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Madeleine \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!\" \u2013 Dumbledore at the Great Feast in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. thedauntlessbookthief 'It is our choices, Harry, that show us who we really are, far more than our abilities' - Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Charlotte 1. Harry: Yes Snape: Yes, Sir Harry: There's no need to call me 'sir', Professor. 2. Luna: You're just as sane as I am Julien From Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: \"Well, hello, Peter,\" said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him. \"Long time, no see.\" bunkbedbobby My favourite quote from Harry Potter is \" You're a wizard, Harry\".
