  "content": "Facebook helped the UK online display advertising market grow by more than a quarter to almost \u00a31bn last year. The Internet Advertising Bureau's annual report, compiled with PricewaterhouseCoopers, attributed a 27.5% year-on-year surge in online display advertising to \u00a3945m to advertisers moving into social media. In total the UK ad market grew by 12.8% year on year in 2010 to pass \u00a34bn for the first time, with \u00a31 in every \u00a34 spent on marketing and advertising by British companies now spent online. According to industry sources, Facebook UK made about \u00a3100m in ad revenue last year. The IAB said that the spend on social media accounted for 14%, or \u00a3132m, of the online display advertising market \u2013 a year-on-year rise of 200%. In 2009 the online display advertising market was worth \u00a3709m, meaning growth last year of \u00a3236m or 33%, but the IAB has stripped out \"new media entrants\" in the online display sector to give a like-for-like growth figure of 27.5%. The online display market also benefited from the rise of video advertising, which almost doubled to \u00a354m. Online display now accounts for 23% of all internet advertising. Advertisers' appetite for social media reduced the proportion of the total \u00a34bn internet ad spend going to paid-for search \u2013 effectively money spent on Google \u2013 from 61% to 57%. The paid-for search market grew by 8% year on year to \u00a32.35bn. To put this in perspective, the total UK TV ad market was worth about \u00a33.5bn last year. However, TV advertising bounced back strongly from the 2009 recession, with 15% year-on-year growth in 2010, outstripping the growth rate for internet advertising for the first time since it was first measured more than a decade ago. Bucking the trend seen in print advertising, the online classified market grew 9.7% year-on-year in 2010 to \u00a3751m. Mobile advertising grew 116% to \u00a383m. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
