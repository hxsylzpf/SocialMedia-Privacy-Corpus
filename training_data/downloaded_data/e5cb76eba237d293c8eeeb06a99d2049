What began in 2006 as a mission to expand its reach soon attracted a firestorm of criticism and concern over Google's dedication to freedom of information. Officially, the company said it saw its entry into the Chinese market as a way to bring more freedom of information and expression to the country, and that offering Chinese citizens access to more data \u2013 even when that data was censored \u2013 was still a significant improvement. But critics and human rights campaigners were worried that the company was ditching its commitments to freedom of expression in favour of cashing in on a lucrative new market. \"Google's statements about respecting online privacy are the height of hypocrisy in view of its strategy in China,\" said Reporters Without Borders at the time, adding that Google's collusion meant that China was \"becoming more and more isolated from the outside world\". Google, which has the phrase \"don't be evil\" as its corporate motto, had been keen to press home that it would not make an immediate profit from launching in the Chinese market, but few doubted it had the potential to turn the country into its next cash cow. In terms of the sheer volume of users alone, China is now the world's biggest presence on the internet, overtaking the United States in 2008 with well over 300 million web users. The business opportunity was compelling, particularly as Google had already ceded ground to US rivals such as Microsoft and Yahoo, which had started making significant inroads into the Chinese market with their own ventures. Faced with their apparent successes, Google chose to launch in co-operation with Beijing. In fact, as part of its deal with the Chinese government, searches conducted on google.cn did not completely screen out controversial subjects such as Tiananmen Square or the Falun Gong. Instead, users were presented with results that, when censored, simply led nowhere or failed to load. That ensured that the site would always be available to users in China, and put the job of enforcing the filtering on to Google, rather than leaving it to the so-called Great Fire Wall. Despite what many saw as a golden opportunity, however, Google failed to displace its rivals. After millions pumped into operations, and constant, draining negotiations with Beijing, the company still lags behind the homegrown Chinese search engine, Baidu.com, which also censors its results on government orders. While Google's share of the Chinese market is around 29%, according to local analysts, it is still a far cry from the UK. Google's founders have admitted that the decision to launch a censored index had severely damaged its reputation. \"On a business level, that decision to censor \u2026 was a net negative,\" co-founder Sergey Brin told the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2007. His partner, Larry Page, has regularly rejected calls for the company to close down its Chinese operation. \"We always consider what to do,\" he has said. \"But I don't think we should be making decisions based on too much perception.\"",
