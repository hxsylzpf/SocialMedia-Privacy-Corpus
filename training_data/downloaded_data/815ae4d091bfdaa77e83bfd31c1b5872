  "content": "A relative of a Scottish holidaymaker who was crushed to death on an escalator in Rome has complained to the press watchdog about a picture on the front page of the Daily Record, which appeared to show the dead woman's body. A spokesman for the Press Complaints Commission confirmed it had received a complaint under clause five of its code of practice, which covers intrusion into grief and shock. The picture - which showed the moving walkway where Professor Sally Baldwin died and what looked like the blurred remains of her body - appeared on the front of the Daily Record on Wednesday October 29. The same picture appeared inside Scottish editions of the Daily Mail and the Sun, while the Scottish Mirror used a slightly different picture on its fcover. \"We take the use of pictures such as this extremely seriously in relation to any offence that may be caused,\" said a spokesman for the Record. \"There's no body in clear view in the shot and after lengthy and careful consideration we decided to run with it,\" he added. Professor Baldwin, the Lanarkshire-born former director of the social policy unit at York University, was on holiday with her ex-husband and a friend when an escalator collapsed at Rome's Tiburtina station, trapping her in its wheels. Her former husband and friend were both later treated at a local hospital for shock. Clause five of the PCC code stipulates publication must be handled sensitively in cases involving personal grief and shock. The Sun and the Daily Mirror prompted a near-record number of complaints to the PCC when they published shocking pictures of Marc-Vivien Foe, the former Manchester City footballer player who collapsed and died on a French football pitch in July. The PCC is unable to investigate third-party complaints but said at the time that if a member of Foe's family wanted to bring a complaint against the newspapers, they could do so under clause five. However, Foe's family did not complain about the pictures. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857",
