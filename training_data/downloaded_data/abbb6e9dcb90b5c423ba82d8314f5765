Her 90-minute performance yesterday in the high court case against Hello! magazine has been thoroughly derided in today's front pages. The Sun branded her a \"pathetic whinger\" while the Mirror said she was little more than a crying baby. \"Pathetic Zeta squeals like a baby about privacy after flogging wedding for \u00a31m,\" said the Mirror, which attached a baby's soother to her mouth in a front page picture. The Sun was in just as unforgiving mood. \"Get real, Zeta,\" warned the paper's leader column, which was scornful of Zeta Jones's claim that she was \"violated\" by the appearance of six unauthorised photos in Hello!. \"Violated? By pictures of her feeding Michael Douglas and him feeding her wedding cake? Ask a rape victim what being violated means, Catherine. You should stop whinging and start counting your blessings,\" it continued. From the tone of today's tabloid coverage, it is clear that the newspapers themselves also feel under scrutiny in this court action, which legal experts predict could have a severe impact on press freedom in the UK. It will test whether the human rights convention, which was incorporated into British law in October 2000, can establish de facto privacy laws in the UK for the first time. The Voice of the Mirror had no time for Zeta Jones' claims that poor quality pictures of her eating that appeared in Hello! are a world apart from the official wedding snaps she sold to OK! magazine for \u00a31m. \"Has there ever been a more pompous, over-inflated, egocentric couple? Outraged because a magazine carries a picture of her eating.\" \"Would they like to spend their days as hermits, away from prying media eyes? Hardly, there are no million pound cheques in that,\" the tabloid mocked. Zeta Jones' admission to the court that \u00a31m was \"not that much\" caught the eye of most of the papers, both tabloid and broadsheet. And unsurprisingly there was little sympathy for her claim that wealth is relative. The Times, the Telegraph and the Mail relegated the story to the inside pages - covering Europe's split over Iraq instead. The Mail poked fun at her claim that money wasn't an issue while also highlighting Hello!'s accusation that the Hollywood couple were pursuing a ridiculous claim. For a sub-heading it highlighted Hello! lawyer's claim yesterday: \"Your suffering is trivial in comparison with victims of accidents.\" Of the tabloids only the Daily Express and the Daily Star covered yesterday's court action in a sympathetic light. The Express splashed with the headline \"Zeta: Happiest day of our lives was ruined by Hello!\". The paper has a clear vested interest - its owner Richard Desmond also owns OK! magazine, whose \u00a31m exclusive rights to the official Zeta Jones and Douglas wedding photos was scuppered by the Hello! spoiler. In her witness statement, Zeta Jones claimed her bad experience with the British tabloid press was part of the reason she decided to move to the US in 1996.",
