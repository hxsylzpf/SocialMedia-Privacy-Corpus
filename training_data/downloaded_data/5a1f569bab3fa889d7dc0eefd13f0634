  "content": "Internet auction site eBay is facing an investigation over claims it is breaking data protection laws. Britain's privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, is looking into complaints that eBay is passing personal details on to third parties, as well as claims that it deliberately prevents users from removing their details from its system. Under the 1998 Data Protection Act companies are legally required to allow people to delete such information. The accusations are being pursued by lobby group Privacy International. The ICO last night confirmed it was examining whether eBay had breached the act. \"We have received a complaint from Privacy International which we are now looking into,\" said a spokeswoman. \"The Information Commissioner's Office takes breaches of people's privacy very seriously and we are contacting eBay about this.\" If the ICO proceeds to a formal investigation eBay could face prosecution and a hefty fine or be forced to change its data protection policies. When contacted for comment, eBay said its members were free to delete their accounts, and that it only shared user information with law enforcement agencies. \"eBay takes the safety and privacy of its users very seriously,\" the company, which has more than 10 million users in the UK, said in a statement. Privacy campaigners believe companies should help individuals retain control of their own data, as well as making it clear how it is being used. \"The right to delete our information is central to personal security and privacy,\" said Simon Davies, director of Privacy International. \"If we have unwanted accounts spread around the internet the possibility of identity theft is greatly magnified.\" The group says other major websites retain data in the same way, though it has so far only filed a formal complaint about eBay. \"It is intentionally a tough target,\" said Mr Davies. \"There are other companies we could go for, but we would like to establish best practice.\" User information is shared by eBay with third parties as part of a programme to identify counterfeit material for sale. That scheme is believed to have more than 10,000 members, but it is not clear what criteria are used to share the information. The ICO will look at what details are being shared and who has access to it.",
