  "content": "LinkedIn has fired the starting pistol on what is expected to be a race to market by social networking websites this year, as the contact-building service announced an initial public offering in New York which could value the business at up to $3bn (\u00a31.9bn). The flotation, expected to value founder Reid Hoffman's $21.4% stake at up to $642m, is thought likely to happen within the next few months and will involve the sale of at least $175m of new shares as well as the disposal of some existing stock by LinkedIn's current investors. It will be eagerly watched by rival social networking operations. Facebook, with a $50bn valuation and more than 500m users, is the highest profile candidate. However, Twitter, Skype, communal gaming site Zynga, and Groupon, a service allowing consumers to pool their purchasing power to negotiate discounts for bulk-buying, are among a host of others. Rory Maher, an analyst with Hudson Square Research in New York, said: \"As the first of the major social networking IPOs, people are going to be watching this pretty closely. Facebook has definitely escalated people's interest in the sector.\" Josh Bernoff, senior vice-president of Forrester Research, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said: \"If the LinkedIn IPO goes well there will be a flurry of other social networking IPOs. This will be the first time we'll get a real look at the economics of a social network. It will set the standard for how social networks like Facebook will be evaluated by public markets.\" LinkedIn is growing at breakneck speed, almost doubling its membership to more than 90 million users last year in 200 countries. Speaking about the relative merits of LinkedIn and Facebook at an Internet conference in San Francisco in November, chief executive Jeff Weiner said the secret to LinkedIn's long-term success would be that people like to keep their professional and private lives separate. \"While many of us in college probably were at parties having a good time, I don't know that many of us would look forward to having a prospective employer have access to pictures of those events,\" Weiner said. While LinkedIn could not compete with Facebook in terms of the number of users \u2013 and the frequency with which they use that service \u2013 the company might find it easier to \"monetise\" its offering, Maher said. Many LinkedIn users had large disposable incomes to start with and may be more prepared to pay for a service that could financially reward them with a higher-paying job or lucrative business contract, in turn making the site attractive to advertisers, Maher said. LinkedIn inched into profit in the first nine months of 2010, recording a $10m surplus, as revenues more than doubled to $161.4m. It offers a free service allowing members to create personal profiles emphasising their business qualifications, but makes its money through a premium subscription service, costing up to \u00a363 a month, which gives members a greater level of contact with potential business contacts and employers and offers up its database to help users locate the people they need.",
