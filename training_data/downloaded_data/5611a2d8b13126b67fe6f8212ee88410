  "content": "As opportunities go, Ello \u2013 the new social network de jour \u2013 is in a very good position. It's growing fast (38,000 new sign-ups per hour at the last statistics release), it has the right crowd on its side (young, busy, creative types) and it has a huge competitor that few currently trust and indeed like (pun intended). It's success however is by no means guaranteed. Ello is a simple social network with a lot of promise \u2013 as so many early networks do \u2013 because things are wrong with existing options so anything different looks appealing. Ello's simple navigation, product-lite approach and design aesthetic has super-charged its sign-up among a flighty and \"what's next\" led group \u2013 however it is the manifesto that has many \u2013 and brands especially - questioning Ello's long-term potential. \"Advertisers buy your data so they can show you more ads. You are the product that's bought and sold.\" The manifesto Ello has set out is bold and reads somewhat like a disenfranchised rant that many can rally behind in this big-brand data-led world we live in. Ello does plan to sell access to features in the future to create cash flow and yet as networks go, it is idealistic in its approach to revenue (although there is precedent for success). However, and this is a key point with a network of this ilk, initial engagement is high and seeing similar after sign-up usage rates (20% after seven days) as Twitter. Ello does indeed appear to be \"holding its own\" (for now at least) per data analytics firm RJMetrics. The issue for brands is scale. While it's all well and good to have a popular network, if your message cannot scale quickly, the return on investment will be time rich and results poor depending on the strategy. So what's the play for businesses then? Create a real-world, ground-level influencer relations strategy Currently celebrities haven't been heralded on Ello (like previous networks), which is interesting. This is a key opportunity for brands to identify real-world cultural influencers that can be used in future projects. While finding these people can be tricky it is possible with the correct criteria, and early moves could see good gains for brands in the long and short term. Increase search engine rankings There are multiple SEO-friendly areas of Ello that other sites shut off (or Google shuts off) \u2013 so a simple strategy (where you simply post to other properties) could be useful to brands \u2013 although interaction is recommended due to the current state of the network. Create an 'early-adopter' affiliate network This is unlikely to win you any friends over at Ello, the potential for a good affiliate network of relevant people to spread your messages is high. While deployment of such a network can be fraught with risk \u2013 spammers, talent networks and other similar collectives will undoubtedly have already started signing people up \u2013 why not you? Ello is in embryonic stages and getting in on the ground floor is a sensible idea for most brands looking to protect branding concerns. But beyond this, Ello could become time wasting and a liability for brands where potentially negative reception could be higher than average because of the audience. Ultimately it is \u2013 as with any network (new or old), the respect equation (right message x right time x right people) that many brands will again fail at solving. Tread carefully and have a reason for being there \u2013 reposting brandfill won't fly with this crowd. Paul Armstrong runs HERE/FORTH. You can follow him on Twitter @paul__armstrong.
