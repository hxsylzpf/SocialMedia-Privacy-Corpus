One photograph of the wedding couple was released on the day of the ceremony in November 2000. The picture, distributed by Associated Press, was sent to all publications except the Sun, the Daily Mail, the News of the World, the Daily Sport and OK!, the last of which had already struck an exclusive \u00a31m deal with the couple for wedding pictures. Mr Douglas told the judge, Mr Justice Lindsay, he and his wife owed the newspapers in question no favours and added he had a right to a private life as a human being. The couple appeared in court today seeking \u00a3500,000 in damages from Hello! over the magazine's publication of six unauthorised pictures of their wedding. \"We didn't feel we owed [these newspapers] anything when they'd been so nasty to me and my wife,\" said Mr Douglas. \"If a magazine or newspaper has written something highly offensive then we do not have an obligation to play ball with them. \"There are certain principles that people have to stand on. I'm not running for public office, I'm a private citizen and so is my wife. \"As a courtesy we extended this photo to everyone we could and we had a short list of people we felt we didn't want to extend that courtesy to.\" James Price QC, representing Hello!, suggested the newspapers were being punished for breaching the Douglases' privacy in the past. \"I'm entitled as a human being to have a private life - there are moments within the privacy of my house or where I rent a private room to have a private wedding,\" Mr Douglas said. \"I totally accept there are a number of public occasions when my wife and I will have photos appear in a number of publications.\" Tabloid interest in her private life was part of the reason Ms Zeta Jones left the UK to live and work in America, the film actress claimed in her witness statement. \"I first became aware of the intrusiveness of the media in 1991 when I worked on The Darling Buds of May. After only one episode of that series had been broadcast, I had become a recognisable celebrity and for the first time in my life people approached me in the street to ask for my autograph,\" she said. \"Initially, I was delighted, not realising how intrusive such attention would become. However, this recognition soon began to cause me increasing distress as I realised that whatever I was doing off screen was considered far more important than what I was doing on screen.\" \"Very quickly it felt as if every aspect of my private and personal life was becoming the subject of media interest. I regularly found details of my private life in the tabloids and on occasions had to face a barrage of photographers and journalists outside my house.\" \"I eventually decided that I needed to have a new start and I moved to the United States in 1996. My bad experience with the British tabloid press was part of the reason why I decided to make the move.\" However, Ms Zeta Jones added: \"I have been fortunate in that, unlike some other women in the public eye, none of my ex-boyfriends has ever sold his story to the newspapers.\"",
