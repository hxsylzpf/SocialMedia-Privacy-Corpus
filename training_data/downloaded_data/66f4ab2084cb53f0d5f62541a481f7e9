Aisha Ali-Khan, 32, has been charged with one count of encouraging misconduct in a public office and encouraging obtaining of personal data without consent on or about 24 August 2012, the Metropolitan police said. A Met police officer based in the counter-terrorism unit S015, Detective Inspector Afiz Khan, known as Alfie, was also charged with two related counts of misconduct in a public office and four counts of data-protection offences between May and September 2012. In a statement, the Met said: \"The arrests come as a result of an investigation by the Directorate of Professional Standards into a complaint from a member of the public, with regard to the actions of the officer based within specialist operations. \"One charge in relation to DI Khan of data-protection offences is related to allegations made by the complainant; the other charges are as a result of information that has been identified as part of the investigation. Both are bailed to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 14  August.\" In October last year, Galloway made allegations against Ali-Khan and the detective, writing an open letter to the home secretary, Theresa May, accusing the pair of carrying out a \"dirty tricks\" operation against him in his constituency \"using police facilities and resources\". He accused Ali-Khan of being an \"agent\" of the Metropolitan police working in Khan's counter-terrorism unit, SO15. It was, he said, \"a direct attack on not just me but on democracy\". A friend of Ali-Khan said on Thursday that the charges were unrelated to Galloway's claim that she had acted as a Met police spy. The friend denied that the charges had anything to do with Galloway himself. Galloway said: \"I complained to the Met about what I believed were the illicit activities of my then secretary and the counter-terrorism officer she claims is her husband. I will have much more to say when the case eventually comes to court.\" Ali-Khan told the Guardian last year that she was married to 46-year-old Khan. The pair showed this newspaper the nikah (marriage) certificate granted to a couple after an Islamic wedding ceremony. She listed Khan as her spouse on the security clearance questionnaire she filled in to gain a parliamentary pass when she began her job in April, after Galloway's sensational win for Respect in the Bradford West byelection. She said she was the victim of a smear campaign and claimed some men in Bradford's Respect party hated the fact that she was a Muslim woman who did not wear a hijab: \"The atmosphere around Respect was so hostile to women. I was seen as an outspoken, opinionated woman who had ideas, who made things happen, who organised events and the guys didn't like it at all.\" On 2 May, Ali-Khan was also arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation, along with another man from Bradford who had once been a member of the Respect party. After an investigation the pair were released without charge. Ali-Khan said on Thursday that she had been advised not to comment.",
