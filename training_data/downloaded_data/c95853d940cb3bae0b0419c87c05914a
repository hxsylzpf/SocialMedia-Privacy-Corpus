  "content": "Lawyers for David and Victoria Beckham will today return to the high court to begin legal proceedings for breach of confidence against their former nanny Abbie Gibson. The couple decided to take action after Ms Gibson sold her story to the News of the World for an estimated \u00a3300,000. Lawyers for the Beckhams failed on Saturday in a bid to get a high court injunction against the 27-year-old nanny, claiming that she was in breach of a confidentiality contract. They argued that the contract had included an obligation not to speak about the Beckhams' private lives, but the judge hearing their application, Mr Justice Langley, ruled that the newspaper could publish. Beckham this week talked about his distress over fresh speculation about his relationship with 31-year-old former Spice Girl Victoria. \"I find it quite amazing, unbelievable,\" he said. \"When you invite someone into your home to look after your children, your most precious possessions, you have to trust them. I can't say much more because there is a legal process.\" The England football captain said he planned to continue playing for Real Madrid until the end of his contract with the club. \"My family are very happy in Madrid, my house is lovely, the children are very happy and my wife is very happy,\" he said. Beckham said: \"I was brought up to treat women well and with respect, I know that if I didn't my mum would be the first to tell me off.\" The couple are also taking action against the News of the World, although today's hearing before Mr Justice Eady - listed as Beckham and another v Gibson - does not involve the newspaper. It is understood that during today's proceedings lawyers for the couple will seek an injunction against Ms Gibson. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
