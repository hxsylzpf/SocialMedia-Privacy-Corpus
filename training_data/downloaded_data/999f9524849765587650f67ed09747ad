  "content": "Nick Denton's Gawker Media group of irreverent blogs has been forced to turn serious after its user database with 1.5m usernames and passwords were hacked and details of Denton's own logins to sensitive systems were released. A hacking group calling itself \"Gnosis\" claimed responsibility, For users, the logins would only have been applied to make comments, rather than containing sensitive data such as credit card details. That may explain why many used scarily easy-to-remember strings including \"password\" and \"qwerty\" (found on the top left line of British-layout keyboards - though harder to do on, say, a French or German layout). The details were released on a 500MB file on the file-sharing system Bittorrent which also apparently contained source code for the Gawker content management system, implying that the breakin went deep into the system. Gnosis also warned that it will continue its attacks. FTP logins, staff passwords and chats were included in the file. Gawker is suspected to have been targeted because it was dismissive about the online forum 4Chan, whose /b/ group is the source of many people involved in the Anonymous group, which has been aiming in the past week at companies reckoned to have failed to support Wikileaks. A number of the leaked chat transcripts included disparaging chats about 4Chan, suggesting that is why Gawker was targeted. The company said in a posting on its site that while the passwords had been encrypted, simple ones will be vulnerable to a dictionary attack. That would in turn mean that people who have used the same password and email on other sites such as webmail systems - Hotmail, Yahoo or Google's Gmail - could be vulnerable to identity theft. The company said passwords on other sites should be changed if they were the same as the ones stored by Gawker Media. \"We're deeply embarrassed by this breach,\" a posting on gawker.com said following the hack. \"We should not be in the position of relying on the goodwill of the hackers who identified the weakness in our systems.\" Gawker hasn't said how the hackers got in. It briefly stopped publishing new content to its sites, which include Gawker, Gizmodo, Lifehacker and Jezebel, after the hack. In an FAQ published on Lifehacker it noted that people who logged in via Facebook Connect need not worry, and admitted that it is not possible at present to delete accounts with Gawker. Rich Mogull, chief executive of Securosis, a security company based in Phoenix, Arizona, suggested that the attack is \"kind of a juvenile thing. It's like spray-painting.\" Such attacks are very common and difficult to stop, as long as the hackers have enough time to try to breach the system, he said. \"If someone is determined and knowledgeable, you can't keep them out,\" he said. The attacks probably are unrelated to recent cyberspace attacks over the WikiLeaks site's release of classified government documents, but Gawker could have angered some of the same people, Mogull said.",
