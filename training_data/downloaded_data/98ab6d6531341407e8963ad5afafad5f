  "content": "Once you have your uni place in the bag, you'll probably feel hugely excited \u2013 and a bit scared. But there are tons of ways to prepare that will help to ease your very normal worries about meeting people, knowing where to go and what to expect. First, think about visiting the uni again. If you phone ahead and ask permission, you'll often be able to see your new halls or even your room, but otherwise it's a chance for you to walk around campus and get your bearings before freshers' week. During the summer holidays, you'll probably receive a freshers' pack in the post. Read it thoroughly, since it will contain forms that you'll need to send back, as well as useful info about what to bring, and opportunities to meet people. Many unis run a \"parenting\" scheme, where freshers are paired up with second-year students doing the same course. If you're offered this opportunity, use it, and get in touch with your college \"mum\" or \"dad\" in advance to ask any questions. Facebook (www.facebook.com) is another great way to meet people. Most student unions set up \"Freshers at xx Uni 2009\" groups, so do a group search for that. Writing a wall post with your name, subject and halls will spawn lots of befriending opportunities. If you can't find an established Facebook group, set up your own \u2013 people will soon join. Another website with lots of coursemate-meeting potential is the chat forum www.thestudentroom.co.uk. Check out your uni's website, too: there will usually be a \"future students\" section with options such as instant chat, or blogs, like at Imperial College's website: www3.imperial.ac.uk/campus_life/studentblogs. Ian and Rebecca's story Ian Robinson, 22, from Derby, is studying management with banking and finance at the University of Bangor. Rebecca Sutterby, 22, from Chelmsford, started her course in psychology with clinical health at the same time. Both logged on to Facebook to tackle pre-uni jitters \u2013 and are still friends today. Robinson says: \"As I'd been travelling for a couple of years, I was older than most freshers, and I was concerned I might not fit in.\" He noticed Sutterby was the same age as him and the two made contact. During freshers' week, they were both too busy to get together, but the following week they arranged to meet, and they became close friends. \"We see each other regularly,\" says Sutterby. \"Ian often comes round for dinner or we meet up and go out places.\" Robinson says: \"It really helps to know that within all those new people there is a friendly face.\"Lucy Tobin's book for students, A Guide to Uni Life: The one-stop guide to what university life is really like (Trotman) is available now for \u00a39.99",
