  "content": "Is it true that short words wreck our brains? So says Ralph Fiennes. Can we say that if we spend our lives not using long words, we will end up not being as clever as Fiennes? First off: no one knows, no one can know. It might be fun or it might be a tease to make a guess like this, but in truth, no one knows what words do, because words don't \"do\" or \"act\". It's our minds and bodies that \"do\" things and words and texts are a part of the doing, woven into the doing. This may be seamless, but that's no excuse to say that words act. Purely on their own, words are inert splashes of ink, sound waves, blips on a screen and the like. Our minds perceive these and make meaning and our minds are part of living in the real world. I think Fiennes has lapsed into that old error of thinking that the real world is made by words. Has he got a point about Shakespeare? I would guess not. When I was a boy, Shakespeare was no more a mass art form than it is now. In fact, a case could be made that with film, TV and mass schooling till 16, Shakespeare is more read, more known than before. I've worked with young people doing Shakespeare and I find that after a short while they get it. As one drama teacher working in schools told me: \"When we do Shakespeare, it seems like it's the quickest way to get to the 'big stuff' \u2013 love, death, hate, power, rich, poor \u2013 all that.\" To be fair, though, Fiennes's comments come after meeting young people in the context of his work \u2013 which I greatly respect, by the way. (The English Patient is in my top 10, and much of that is down to him.) Sorry, I digress. Let us return to our sheep, as Voltaire put it. Fiennes's comments are a response to what he has seen and heard. What we should ask here, though, is if he embarked on his work with a bias against young people and the way they talk, or if this was really something he learned about them on the day and over time as he worked with them. We can't rid ourselves of bias, but we can build into our minds a crap spotter, a kind of third eye that checks what we do, how we think and what we say on matters such as this. Put it this way, it's so easy to make big statements about the decline and fall of the human race, to bemoan the state of youth, and this fits neatly into a wider story of a downward rush to chaos, which can only be checked by a return to old values. The odd thing here is that the appeal to go backwards nearly always means a plea for staying put, a vote for the status quo. There are plenty of ways to resist change and this is just one of them. My hunch is that such talk is a way of hiding the fact that some older people think that the world isn't in a good state, yet they had some part in making it. This proves, they think, that the status quo is good and nothing must change. (Written with words of one or two syllables, apart from the word \"syllable\" used here.)",
