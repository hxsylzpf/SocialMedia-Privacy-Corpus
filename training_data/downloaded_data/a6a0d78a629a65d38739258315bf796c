  "content": "The State of the Union is an event steeped in tradition and protocol. Everything from who attends (and who doesn't) to how the president enters the room is part of a long-established ritual. But there were a few very notable differences in Barack Obama's speech on Tuesday \u2013 in rhetoric and theatrics alike \u2013 that made observers take note, and left social media alight. Some very important words made a big Washington debut \u2026 For the first time, the words \"transgender\", \"lesbian\" and \"bisexual\" were uttered during a State of the Union address. Obama earned praise on social media from progressives and the LGBT community, including writer and activist Janet Mock: \u2026 while others were omitted: Social media got the official spotlight \u2026 Traditionally, news outlets and journalists are provided with the full text of the president's speech shortly before the main event, leaving it to the media \u2013 and the White House's long reveal \u2013 to tease bits of the address to the public. \"This year,\" the White House announced a whole 13 minutes earlier than usual, \"we change that.\" The White House released the full text as prepared for delivery on Medium, allowing the general public to get an early glimpse as part of \"continuing efforts to reach a wide online audience and give people a range of ways to consume the speech\". Obama's latest foray into Twitter co-founder Ev Williams's publishing platform may or not be part of what has been dubbed his \"Millennials Appreciation Tour\", but the White House showed no signs of stopping. \u2026 Instagram and all: The president also gave the photo-sharing service a shout-out when he praised astronaut Scott Kelly, who would be spending a year on the International Space Station. Obama, apparently a fan of space selfies, urged Kelly to post plenty of pictures. Oh, and Obama finally said 'the State of the Union is strong' While variations on the phrase have been deployed by presidents so often at this event as to become cliche long ago, a \"senior official\" confirmed that Obama himself had never actually uttered the words until his penultimate address. His words had also never been live-translated \u2026 in emojis:",
