She replaces former Hello! editor Phil Hall as one of seven editorial members of the press complaints commission. The PCC's acting chairman, Professor Robert Pinker, said: \"The fascinating cocktail of privacy issues that the commission has constantly to ponder grows ever more complex. \"Many of Britain's magazines find themselves at the sharp end of it, day in day out - and it is therefore excellent news that Jane Ennis should be joining us to represent the important voice of magazines and periodicals on the commission. \"She has a fascinating background in the magazine sector which ideally suits her to our work - not just in privacy but across the whole range of ethical issues with which we deal.\" Professor Pinker thanked Hall - who also served on the commission in his capacity as editor of the News of the World - for his \"Trojan contribution\" to the PCC. The PCC is coming under intense scrutiny from a Commons culture committee inquiry into media intrusion. However, the inquiry is focusing on ordinary people, rather than the celebrities featured in Ennis' magazine. \"I am delighted to join the commission at this important juncture in its history, when debates about its effectiveness and service to the public are again centre stage,\" said Ennis. \"The PCC has a crucial job to do in balancing the rights of individuals to privacy with the often conflicting rights of freedom of expression and the public's right to know. I look forward greatly to playing my part in that and ensuring that, above all, the PCC continues to provide a first class service to members of the public,\" she added. Now is the market leader at newsstands in the competitive celebrity weekly market, with an average circulation of 630,000 in the second half of 2002, according to the latest official ABC figures. The PCC also ruled today that a local newspaper journalist who interviewed a 10-year-old boy was wrong not to seek the consent of his mother. The mother of the child complained that a journalist from the Welwyn and Hatfield Times who interviewed her son after he appeared in a television programme, had only spoken to her partner, who was not the boy's legal guardian. Her complaint was upheld.",
