Skills and tools we feel confident using for banking, shopping and generally organising our private lives may play no part in our jobs. There are lots of reasons for this \u2013 some are cultural, some technical, and some just a matter of confidence. But we want civil servants to be as digital in their careers as they are the rest of the time. It isn't always easy to know where to start or which are the right tools for the job. So the Government Digital Service (GDS) has been talking to colleagues in all departments to identify what works best for different tasks. As a result, we've compiled a roundup of some great tools that are freely available on the web. These tools vary from those that help you manage projects and arrange events, to others that enable you to share large files, or schedule a meeting \u2013 in other words, relatively simple but essential things. These tools aren't whizzy, next-generation glimpses into the future. They are already being used \u2013 and have been for some time \u2013 by civil servants across government. How Whitehall is using open source digital tools The Cabinet Office is using Eventbrite and SurveyMonkey to organise and evaluate events. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office uses Twitter to provide emergency alerts to Brits in a crisis. The Ministry of Defence is using Twitter and LinkedIn to engage with estate users \u2013 MoD and civilian \u2013 around defined geographical areas on the Defence training estate, piloting the work around Salisbury Plain. The Department of Health has access to all the listed tools and actively encourages staff to use them. Eventbrite will soon be their tool of choice for organising internal events, as well as most of their public ones. Recently, they used SurveyMonkey to ask what they needed on their new intranet \u2013 and more than 10% of staff responded through it. SurveyMonkey is also used throughout the Department for International Development. Users find it a simple and intuitive way to construct a survey. Previous survey designs are available to help you frame questions; staff can respond easily; and the results can be gathered and viewed from the moment completed responses start to come in. Results can then be presented in a variety of formats for sharing and re-use. At the Department for Education, content uploads to GOV.UK are organised with Trello. They say both Google Drive and Trello mean they can easily share information with colleagues, whether working in the office or from home; and keep track of the numerous tasks involved in the bigger digital transition project. Google docs mean they can dispense with the reliance on single shared spreadsheets to plan tasks and monitor completed work; while, with Trello, users can manage assignments to each editor, so everybody instantly knows what task they have been allocated, what they need to do, and when deadlines fall. The list goes on. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has been combining social media with open policymaking. It has used Twitter to raise awareness of an initiative to encourage views from outside government on proposals to simplify environmental regulations and the reporting of essential environmental and farming information. This will make it cheaper for businesses and others to comply with regulations and achieve strong environmental standards. Another public facing application, using social media to engage and inform service users, is the Driving Standards Agency Facebook page of advice, reminders, hints, tips and news for learner drivers. As an indication of the potential of these tools, the prime minister's influencer page on LinkedIn has over 840,000 followers. We know some people will have difficulty using these tools on government IT. If that's the case, tell us so we can fix it \u2013 and learn by doing.
