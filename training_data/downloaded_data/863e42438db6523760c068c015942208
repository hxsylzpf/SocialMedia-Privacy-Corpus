  "content": "Name: Facebook status. Age: About 10 years old. Appearance: Constantly updating. My Facebook status is: \"I am not in the Facebook.\" So what are you talking about? I am talking about people's increasing unwillingness to put their relationship status up on Facebook. Were they doing that? It sounds awful. Yes, until recently, it was the rite of passage for millennials. Having \"the discussion\" no longer meant the one about having sex, but whether to change your online category from \"single\" to \"in a relationship\". Oh, nightmare digital world with your ceaseless promulgation of life as a series of binary choices! Umm \u2026 yeah. Where is the nuance, the subtlety, the opportunity to reflect the infinite gradations of love, of human feeling? How may we still trace the ever-shifting sands of sentiment? You can LIKE and DISLIKE stuff. To put it in terms you may understand, that makes me :( But there's no need. People are going off it. A recent and openly unscientific poll by Buzzfeed \u2013 ?? It's a US internet news media company. Don't worry about it. :) Anyway, this poll has found that more and more people are deeming that publicly proclaiming yourself single or otherwise is somewhere between cheesy and plain weird. :) :) :) LIKE! I thought you would. Are there any facts, figures or statistics on which to hang my hat of happiness? Ah, you're back. Well, yes \u2013 about 40% of twentysomethings now prefer not to post details of their amorous affiliations (you're infecting me with polysyllabitis) online. May we hope that this betokens a loosening of the vice-like grip of the Zuckerbergian claw round the hearts and minds of his generation? By the success or otherwise of his recently announced, and potentially 30-million strong book club, we shall know more. Or maybe he will tempt people with more options for classification. A new \"Satisfying mere genital curiosity together\" button at one end, perhaps, and a Heathcliffian \"I cannot live without my life, I cannot die without my soul!\" option at the other. Liminal times, my friend, liminal times. Do say: \"Love is in the air, every time I look around.\" Don't say: \"Desultorily porking each other while we wait for new Sherlock.\"",
