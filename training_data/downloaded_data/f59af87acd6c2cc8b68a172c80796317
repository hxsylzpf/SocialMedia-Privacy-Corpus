  "content": "This year the \"why I should be allowed a private life\" sports trophy goes to Lord Triesman, the now former chairman of the Football Association. Last weekend, the Mail on Sunday reported he told his ex-assistant and friend that there was \"some evidence\" the Spanish football authorities were trying to bribe referees and sought Russian help to do so. Triesman has resigned from the FA and as head of England's bid to host the World Cup in 2018. But should he have to? I can understand why people go football crazy, football mad. However, we need to inject some rationality into the furores that follow \"careless talk\" said in private by important people. It's supposed to be a liberal age. As Triesman said, \"Those comments were never intended to be taken seriously, as indeed is the case with many private conversations.\" Even if you don't believe him, is it \"entirely right\" that he should resign, as sports minister Hugh Robertson has said of the Labour peer? The link between a private action and dismissal from a public role is not obviously right, if we consider that private talk is in a less serious category than public talk. Was it a case of unjustifiable media \"entrapment\"? On the BBC website one commentator condemned it as a \"honey trap\"; others said newspapers should \"publish the truth\". At caughtoffside.com, a Mr Neutral writes that entrapment claims are somewhat \"pointless\" if you make \"shocking claims\". In the chatroom at Sky Sports, one football fan echoes many by claiming it was an attempt by the newspaper to \"wreck our bid\". That view could certainly gain wider currency with today's news that Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker has quit his football column for the Mail on Sunday, citing his backing for England's World Cup in 2018. Yet, the Mail on Sunday didn't entrap Triesman. They printed the secretly recorded tapes of his private conversation given to them by Melissa Jacobs, his former private secretary, as well as her kiss-and-tell story. A more accurate description of events is that Triesman was betrayed, rather than entrapped. It's easy to blame the crazy state of football for this mess. Unfortunately, cultural flabbiness is a feature of British life. Triesman is right. His words were considered out of context. These days, people are identified with their work even if they've clocked off for the evening. What somebody says out of hours is considered as noteworthy as if they've stated the words as part of their job in a public forum. It doesn't mean what public figures say has no importance. But our current, relativist culture miscalculates the degree and nature of the importance. The antidote is to reassert the need to distinguish between how we judge private life compared to public life. Triesman may or may not have told the truth about various overseas football authorities. The important thing is he did this in private, an arena of life where it's hard to tell if somebody is telling the truth, lying, trying to impress, ranting, testing somebody's gullibility, making a joke or is just drunk. If we don't defend this private-public cultural line, we're scoring an own goal.",
