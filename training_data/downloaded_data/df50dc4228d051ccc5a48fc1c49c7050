  "content": "The data protection act (DPA) is one of the most misunderstood pieces of legislation. Journalists are often hobbled by it because people, either in ignorance or out of wilfulness, trot it out in order to avoid disclosing information, often of the most mundane kind. The latest example of DPA madness was highlighted by the experience of a Surrey Comet reporter at Kingston county court, as reported by HoldTheFrontPage. Rachael Burford dared to ask a court official for the name of the judge in a case she was covering only to be told that her inquiry was \"against data protection\". She reported this to her office, so assistant editor Ross Logan called the official, the court manager, and received a similar reply. Sanity arrived once the paper asked the ministry of justice to intervene and the judge was finally identified as Sarah King. Evidently, she was unaware of the attempt to conceal her identity. Logan is quoted by HoldTheFrontPage as saying: \"Although the court manager was very polite, it was worrying that they did not understand the law or the need for open justice\". Quite. The newspaper made no reference to the incident when reporting the case itself but it did, of course, include judge King's name. Source/hat tip: HoldTheFrontPage",
