  "content": "Neil Wallis, the editor of the Sunday People, has hailed today's court decision to allow his newspaper to publish a \"kiss and tell\" story as an \"historic victory\" for press freedom. Describing the decision as a landmark ruling, Wallis said the decision would help dispel fears of a creeping privacy law. \"Lord Woolf has said there is no privacy law. This is tremendously important, not just for the tabloid media, but for the broadsheets and broadcasters as well,\" he said. \"This man has spent \u00a3200,000 to hide the fact that he is a cheating rat.\" The subject of the People's story, a married Premiership footballer, faces being named after an appeal court judge overturned an earlier court order preventing the newspaper from identifying him. Delivering his judgement today, Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, said that to grant an injunction \"would be an unjustified interference with the freedom of the press\". \"Once it is accepted that the freedom of the press should prevail, then the form of reporting in the press is not a matter for the courts but for the press council and the customers of the newspaper concerned,\" he added The footballer who won the original injunction against the paper has been given three weeks' grace to convince the House of Lords that it should hear his case that confidentiality laws apply to affairs outside marriage. But Wallis said he was \"confident\" the Lords would not grant him leave to appeal. High court judge Mr Justice Jack ruled last September that the laws of confidentiality could apply to relationships outside marriage and barred the Sunday People from publishing the story. The newspaper today appealed against the order, allowing the interviews with the footballer's former lovers - one a lap dancer he met in a club and the other a nursery teacher who claims he used his wealth, fame and position to seduce her - to be published. \"If you're rich or famous or a celebrity, you have de facto made yourself available to the media,\" Wallis said of today's judgment. \"This lays down for the first time that freedom of expression is at least as important as privacy,\" said Wallis after the judgment was handed down. \"Two people have rights in relationships,\" he said of the footballer and the two women he was involved with. \"Simply because this man is married, because it suits his own ends, doesn't mean he can choose to gag,\" he said. \"One of the most shocking things about [Lord Justice Jack's previous ruling] was to say that morality does not matter any more.\" Today's ruling will also have implications for model Naomi Campbell's case against the Mirror newspaper. Mr Justice Morland, the judge in the high profile privacy case, deferred his judgement until the end of March to enable him to take today's decision into account.",
