  "content": "The cosy world of BBC1's popular crime drama New Tricks has been shattered by a four-letter row involving a writer and director on the show after one of its stars described it as \"bland\". Amanda Redman said the show, about to return for its ninth series, had become \"more bland\" and the characters \"not as anarchic as they used to be, which I think is a huge shame\". Her co-star, Alun Armstrong, in a cast interview with the Radio Times, said it was \"about time Amanda's character got her leg over. I don't know. Maybe the writers have become more concerned with the investigation\". He added that the cast \"put a lot into making the scripts work. If we felt that a story didn't work, or that bits of the story could be improved, then \u2013 if the writer wasn't around \u2013 we would set about rewriting it ourselves\". Writer/director Julian Simpson, whose other credits include Doctor Who and Spooks, took to Twitter to vent his frustration, tweeting: \"I was going to be writing today, instead I'm just going to hand the actors a pad and pen. I wish I'd learned this 15 years ago.\" Simpson wrote: \"A New Tricks I wrote and directed airs on Monday. I can tell you EXACTLY how much of it the actors wrote: not a fucking comma ... I also wrote and directed episode 10 of the new series. How much did the cast change? Are we sensing a pattern here...? \"As has been widely reported, 2 #NewTricks cast members are leaving next series. Guess who's writing their exit eps... *finger guns*.\" Redman, who plays Det Supt Sandra Pullman, will leave the show next year with another of its stars, James Bolam, due to exit at the beginning of the new run. Simpson also tweeted that for his \"presumably considerable, sins I've written 8 episodes of New Tricks; all without the help of any Equity members\". He added: \"Worth saying that I get on phenomenally well with the New Tricks cast. Just don't appreciate actors speaking out of turn and they know that.\" Armstrong said of the drama's directors: \"We have never tolerated anybody \u2013 and we've had the odd one \u2013 who will come on to the set and say, 'You will do this' or 'You won't say that'. \"They get short shrift or there's an almighty battle until they're forced to collaborate.\" Simpson went on: \"Just read the full #newtricks piece in the RT. Apparently they push the directors around too. Double win for me.\" Dennis Waterman, who also stars in the show, told Radio Times: \"I don't think it has become just another police procedural, but there was a danger. \"It's partly because of dealing with cold cases. We're always talking about history and some writers \u2013 not all of them \u2013 can go on and on about that, repeating themselves. \"You have to remind yourself that people aren't as stupid as writers think. But that's the way things are going in the industry. \"Basically,\" he added, referring to the success of Danish TV dramas such as The Killing and Borgen, \"we all want to move to Copenhagen to get to do some really extraordinary television.\"",
