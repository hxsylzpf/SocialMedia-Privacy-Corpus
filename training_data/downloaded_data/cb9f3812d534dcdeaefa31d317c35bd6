MTVu, which broadcasts to roughly 750 universities in the U.S., is working with local listing site and ad net Zvents on the project, which is now available for colleges such as University of Texas at Austin, Northwestern University, and University of Pennsylvania. This back-to-school effort follows Fox's attempt to attract college students online by streaming the premiere of two of its anticipated shows \"Fringe\" and season opener of \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\" online at the same time as the shows are broadcast on TV. As Reuters says, MTVu has been pretty successful on its broadcast side lately, but that interest has not transferred to its online offerings. The Viacom (NYSE: VIA) network hopes to get generate further interest in its listings network by aligning with individual college newspapers. Also, MTVu is considering publishing a print version of the campus guides as well.
