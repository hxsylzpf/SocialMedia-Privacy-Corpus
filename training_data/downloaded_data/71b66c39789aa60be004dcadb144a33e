  "content": "Gary McKinnon, the computer hacker facing extradition to the US, who suffers from Asperger's syndrome, yesterday won the right for a full judicial review after the high court ruled that the home secretary had failed to give proper consideration to evidence of his mental condition. Lord Justice Maurice Kay and Mr Justice Simon granted a full judicial review in respect of the possible effect of incarceration on someone in McKinnon's vulnerable medical condition. The court had heard that McKinnon might become suicidal in a US jail. The court set a full hearing for March. McKinnon's lawyer, Karen Todner, said: \"No UK court has yet considered the impact on Gary in light of his medical condition.\" McKinnon, 42, who faces charges of hacking into the US defence and Nasa computers and leaving messages such as \"your security is crap\", was not present in court but his mother, Janis Sharp, expressed her delight. \"We are overjoyed that the British courts have shown sense and compassion,\" said Sharp. \"We have always been outraged by the Home Office's decision to have him extradited to stand trial in a foreign land where he would face an out of proportion sentence for what is essentially a crime of eccentricity.\" She added: \"Perhaps now that Obama is in power in America our world might become a more compassionate place.\" The court had considered written evidence from Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, an expert on Asperger's syndrome, that if McKinnon was jailed in the US there was a risk he would attempt to take his life. The court also saw evidence from the National Autistic Society, whose chief executive, Mark Lever, said: \"We believe that the extradition, and a possible maximum security prison sentence, would be inappropriate and very damaging for anyone affected by Asperger's syndrome.\" Edward Fitzgerald QC had argued that sending McKinnon to a US high security jail in his medical condition amounted to \"inhuman and degrading treatment\" in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Fitzgerald also argued that Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, had failed to seek an assurance from the US that McKinnon would be repatriated to serve his sentence in the UK if he received a jail term. The director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, is also considering whether McKinnon should be tried in the UK. Last month McKinnon's lawyers wrote to the DPP with a signed affidavit indicating that he would plead guilty under the Misuse of Computers Act. The DPP is considering this option and will make a decision by the middle of February. McKinnon first hacked into the computers in 2001 from a flat in north London, in search of evidence of UFOs.",
