  "content": "The Daily Mirror has been criticised for publishing a photograph of JK Rowling's home after the Harry Potter author claimed it could pose a security risk. The Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint from Rowling after the Mirror published a picture of her home and the name of the road it was on. Lawyers for the best-selling author said the paper had published sufficient information to identify the exact location of the property, in breach of the PCC code. Rowling had, they said, previously been subject to security threats at her homes. The Mirror argued that the address was already in the public domain before it published the photograph on July 14. It said the name of the road had already been published in another newspaper, and that the electoral register and Land Registry identified the complainant as the owner. But the PCC ruled that the photograph and caption \"contained sufficient information to identify the exact location of the property\", in breach of its rules on privacy. It said the Mirror had not demonstrated that the information was sufficiently in the public domain to justify its publication. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
