  "content": "The press complaints commission has upheld a complaint against OK! magazine by the author JK Rowling, the creator of the Harry Potter books. The author complained to the press watchdog after photographs of her and her eight-year-old daughter on a private beach in Mauritius were published in the magazine. She complained the photographs were a breach of her privacy. Rowling, a fierce defender of her privacy, argued that the use of long lens photography to obtain the photographs was in breach of the PCC privacy code. The photographs also breached the PCC code's provisions on the children of famous people. OK! is reported to have apologised formally to the author in a letter. The PCC code has been subject to different interpretations over whether a beach is a place where famous people can have a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\". This judgement is in sharp contrast to a ruling earlier this year that the Daily Mail had not breached the privacy of newsreader Anna Ford, who complained after being photographed on a beach with her former partner, astronaut David Scott. Ford appealed after her complaint was rejected, but failed to get the courts to overturn the PCC's original decision.",
