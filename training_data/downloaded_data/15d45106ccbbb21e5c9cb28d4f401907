Darren Powell, Jason Drain and Paul Clear ridiculed an asylum seeker who swallowed the nail clippers on Christmas Day in a series of Facebook posts. \"Merry Christmas all. One of these jokers just swallowed a pair of nail clippers. RALMFAO. A Christmas I shall not easily forget,\" Powell posted in his publicly accessible profile. RALMFAO stands for \"rolling around laughing my freaking ass off\". A number of other G4S officers \"liked\" the post, and Manus staff continued to joke about the incident. \"I want to be his escort to the shitter when he passes them,\" posted Jason Drain, another employee at the centre. \"Lol so he has finally realised the food is shit,\" posted Paul Clear, who was also a G4S employee. Powell replied in a later post that \"Docs think it may take up to a month\" for the asylum seeker to pass the clippers. G4S launched an investigation after Guardian Australia raised the posts with the Immigration Department. Drain has since posted on Facebook that he was sacked, but G4S would not confirm the circumstances of the other two employees' departures. \"G4S has concluded its investigation into allegations of misuse of social media platforms by some personnel based at the Manus Island offshore processing centre,\" G4S said in a statement. \"We found that a small number of personnel had directly or indirectly breached our strict policies on duty of care and social media use by commenting on a serious self-harm issue on their personal Facebook accounts. The actions of these individuals are completely unacceptable to G4S and have been dealt with swiftly. \"The individuals who were found to have breached our policies will no longer be employed by G4S.\" The statement also said G4S would continue to review its training programs and monitor social media. The Australian navy has also launched an investigation into inappropriate social media use by its personnel, after Fairfax media reported on links to racist Facebook groups.",
