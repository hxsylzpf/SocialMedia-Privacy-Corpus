  "content": "A high court judge today granted an order giving Maxine Carr lifelong anonymity, saying it was \"necessary to protect life and limb and psychological health\". Mr Justice Eady agreed to an indefinite extension of an existing order, which protects Carr's new identity by banning publication of any details about where she lives or the nature of her work. But the judge said that if her circumstances changed the media could seek to have the order overturned. \"I am satisfied that the only effective means of discharging the court's protective duty is to grant the injunction in the terms sought. It is necessary to protect life and limb and psychological health,\" he said, adding that \"it is right to emphasise that there is always a right if the circumstances change for the media or any interested party to apply to the court at short notice for a discharge or variation of the order\". Carr's QC, Edward Fitzgerald, said earlier that there was an \"overwhelming case\" for making the injunction \"against the world at large\". Mr Fitzgerald said such an order was \"amply justified\" on the grounds laid down in the previous cases of child killers Jon Venables and Robert Thompson and Mary Bell, where similar permanent injunctions had been granted. \"There is a real and significant risk of injury or of worse - killing - if the injunction is not granted,\" he said. 'Publications have already infringed terms of injunction' Mr Fitzgerald said the right of the press and the public to know matters of legitimate public concern was recognised. But he said the court had \"ample evidence\" of the extent to which the press had taken advantage of its freedom. \"In our view, certain publications have published matters which do infringe the express terms of the injunction. \"Those matters have been drawn to the attention of the attorney general and they will be dealt with by the attorney general in due course. \"The press have clearly felt free to publish many matters about her - most of them have been untrue. \"She has not been in a position to defend herself against the many allegations that have been made without sacrificing the protection of the limited anonymity granted to her on which the protection of her life and limb depend. \"The truth or otherwise of many of the allegations is in fact immaterial to the decision which the court has to take as to whether to grant an injunction. \"But, we do say that the tone and content of much of what has been published does increase the risk both of physical attack and of harassment. \"And indeed, when one sees the remarks made on internet chatrooms, one sees them being linked to particular unfounded allegations that have been made in the press.\" Mr Justice Eady granted a temporary order last May, ruling that Carr's identity needed to be kept secret for her own safety following her release on probation after serving half of a 42-month sentence. He said the order was \"necessary and proportionate\" as there was \"clear evidence\" of danger to her life and physical wellbeing. At that hearing the Sun and the News of the World, together with the Mirror Group, argued in court that the injunction went too far in banning even the soliciting of information about Carr. The media did not contest today's application. Carr, 27, was convicted in December 2003 of conspiring to pervert the course of justice with her former boyfriend Ian Huntley, who killed schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. She provided a false alibi for Huntley by lying to police about her whereabouts on the weekend in August 2002 when the 10-year-olds were murdered. The case for the injunction was backed by the Home Office, the Probation Service and Humberside Police. The attorney general was notified of the nature of the injunction and did not oppose it. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
