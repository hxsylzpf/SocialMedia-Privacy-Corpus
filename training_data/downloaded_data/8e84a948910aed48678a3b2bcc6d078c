  "content": "As someone who works from home, I consider getting up and getting dressed in the morning the pinnacle of achievement. Getting up without an urgent need to is a herculean task. I have been known to get round this tricky problem by, on occasion, working from bed. And often I get up but somehow fail to get dressed. Yesterday my neighbour asked me to help him move a heavy picture, and I had to go outside in the street in my pyjamas. To be fair, he could see me working in my window, and my top half was dressed \u2013 like a newsreader. If you have similarly low standards for human achievement, then it's probably best not to watch the video of the Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, at Tsinghua University in Beijing, conducting an entire question-and-answer session in Mandarin. Not only will you probably not understand any of it, but you may find that it fills you with an incandescent yet impotent fury. Zuckerberg is unquestionably one of life's high achievers. At just 30 years old, he's worth billions. Moreover, he seems like a nice guy: he donates money to charity; he's married \u2013 to a medical school graduate, Priscilla Chan; and he wears casual grey T-shirts that complement his goofy grin well. So far, so good. We are, after all, striving to be the best possible versions of ourselves. We want to have successful careers, happy families and great friendships. We want to go running at 6am every morning and file our tax return on time. And yet some people take it so much further: starting companies, writing books, winning awards, marrying George Clooney. These high achievers plague us throughout our life. They are there at school and university \u2013 sporty, well-rounded types, winning prizes and plaudits, juggling extracurricular activities and still coming top of the class. They excel in the workplace, too, and that's where our cultural obsession with these showoffs really comes into its own. Business publications are jam-packed full of articles telling us mere mortals about the common traits these amazing beings supposedly share, such as \"How to be a super-achiever: the 10 qualities that matter\" (\"devotion to the day-to-day struggle\", apparently \u2013 it sounds awful). Technology companies in particular are where these overachievers often lurk. There's Sheryl Sandberg, once a vice-president at Google, now chief operating officer at Facebook. Sandberg famously advised women to \"lean in\" to their careers. Great advice, but somewhat tiring. Leaning back \u2013 preferably in a horizontal position on the couch \u2013 is simply more comfortable. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, reportedly gets up at 4.30am. Scores of other executives claim to be early birds, because, thanks to technology, turning over and going back to sleep isn't an option. The tyranny of email and a 24/7 working culture means that voracious workaholics need never switch off \u2013 apart from when they're exercising, that is. And if you think checking your emails while on the on the treadmill is overachieving, think again. To really impress you need to channel the example of Google's co-founder Sergey Brin. Well known for arriving at meetings via rollerblades, Brin is also keen on acrobatics, kiteboating and jumping out of helicopters. How do we know this? Because he posts pictures of his high-adrenaline stunts on his Google+ page. It's not enough to be a high achiever \u2013 you must also brag about it on social media, too. And that's the nub of the problem. People such as Zuckerberg make us feel inadequate because through hearing about their achievements we start to believe the myth that we could be like them. We begin to feel that somehow we too could win a Nobel prize, if only we got up a bit earlier. The only thing standing between us and huge success is our own lack of devotion to the struggle. But the truth is that we can't all be high achievers. Work as hard as you like. Get up at 6am and go running, if you must. But you'll probably never set up a billion-pound company, find a cure for cancer or write a Pulitzer prize-winning novel. Sometimes just getting through the day is enough of a triumph. That's not to say you shouldn't try. A little bit of self-improvement doesn't hurt, after all. Zuckerberg is notorious for setting himself an annual personal challenge, including wearing a tie to work every day (2009), only eating animals that he has killed himself (2011), meeting a new person outside of Facebook every day (2013) and writing a daily thank-you note (2014). I reckon I could do one of those. Perhaps the first one. And yes, I would still be wearing my pyjama bottoms.",
