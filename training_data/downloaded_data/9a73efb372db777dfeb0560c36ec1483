  "content": "Associated Newspapers executive Peter Wright has written directly to Conservative MPs urging them to read the Daily Mail investigation into an assessor for the Leveson inquiry before they consider radical reforms to press regulation. Wright, the former Mail on Sunday editor, sent a letter to all Tory MPs along with a copy of the Daily Mail edition that devoted 12 pages to an investigation into Sir David Bell and what it described as his \"incestuous network of political, business and financial links\". Wright's letter forms part of the intensive lobbying by those for and against a stricter regime governing the newspaper industry ahead of Lord Justice Leveson's report, to be published next Thursday, offering recommendations on the future of press regulation. In the letter, dated 16 November, seen by MediaGuardian, Wright told MPs: \"I am taking the liberty of enclosing a copy of last Friday's Daily Mail. In case you missed it due to last week's recess, it contains a special investigation into the links between Leveson inquiry assessor Sir David Bell, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism behind the defaming of Lord McAlpine, and the various vociferous lobby groups calling for statutory regulation of the press. \"I fully understand you will have your own views on the issues surrounding press regulation. All I would hope is that, with Lord Justice Leveson's report now imminent, you find time to read this investigation, and give it some consideration before deciding your response.\" The letter is likely to be seen by some MPs as a warning sign that those who do voice support for statutory regulations will be put under renewed scrutiny by some newspaper groups. Wright said: \"As the letter says, bearing in mind the Commons recess, we wanted to make sure they [MPs] had had a chance to read our investigation.\" The Daily Mail special investigation \u2013 splashed on the front page and across five double-page spreads inside last Friday's paper, as well as being the subject of the leader column \u2013 claimed to raise \"serious questions about the impact Bell's had on the inquiry's neutrality\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
