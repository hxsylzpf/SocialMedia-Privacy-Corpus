It is also not new and I hope after this tragic period of young people taking their life that the government will now increase the time in the curriculum for developing self-belief and understanding and acceptance of who we are. The massive mental upheaval to disclose harsh irrational comments from others to people who dearly care for you, and the instant arrangements to meet up through modern media, mask our inability to manage emotion and desire. The power of talking in-person/signing, and listening and sharing is the skill needed more than anything, and possibly it is overlooked. Alice Tims Rickmanswoth, Hertfordshire \u2022 At 76, the angst about Twitter et al is incomprehensible. Ten years ago they did not exist and children were a lot safer. The trolls write ghastly things, but would you know them in real life? Why do people read them online? Why do people need mythical friends? It seems so very sad to older people.
