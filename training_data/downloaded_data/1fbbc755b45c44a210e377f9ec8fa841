  "content": "The 2011 census awareness campaign has launched, aimed at preparing citizens for the nationwide snapshot. The national census, administered in England and Wales by the Office for National Statistics, was introduced in 1801 and is carried out every decade. But if cabinet office minister Francis Maude gets his way, 27 March could well be the last census day in British history. Maude has argued that the exercise \u2013 projected to cost \u00a3482m this year \u2013 is inefficent and advocates using databases held by a variety of agencies, including credit-checking firms. Others criticise the census as an intrusive breach of privacy and say a large number of people do not take it seriously (nearly 400,000 declared themselves Jedi in 2001). Some have also threatened to boycott this year's census after it was revealed that arms firm Lockheed Martin had been contracted to run it. In the face of criticism, the ONS census director, Glen Watson, has defended it as \"a bedrock of information for the next 10 years\". Do you believe the census is outmoded, or an institution worth defending? Will you be filling it in or risking the \u00a31,000 fine? Or do you have any ideas on a more efficient way of capturing a national portrait?",
