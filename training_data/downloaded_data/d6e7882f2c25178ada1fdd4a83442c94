  "content": "On Saturday, the Pope joined Instagram. Although he's late to the party \u2013 and a bit rude not to follow anyone (even Barack Obama follows 12 people) \u2013 he must be doing something right, because within an hour of signing up his holiness had attracted 10,000 followers. He now has 1.5 million. That said, his five posts so far are a little pedestrian. Here's what we would do to help liven things up. Add a holy hashtag Quite Basic, but a safe opener. Quoting Rihanna is a nice touch, seeing as you've got a global reach. Hashtags are a bit passe, but something like #pray4me might have zhushed it up.

It's just the crucifix; it's a bit obvious. You know what we would have done? Subbed in Raphael's Transfiguration and done a face swap with Moses. Hone your technical skills Breaking through the fourth wall is a nice touch if your MO is \"connecting with followers\". Little tip: touch the screen so you're actually in focus, and get the guy with the camera to shift the lens up a bit so you lose the iPad and keep the top of the zucchetto in shot. Think of your brand Colour blocking! Synecdoche! Swag ring! Someone's employed a social media manager. Don't prang out because you didn't get many likes, it's good for the brand (always think of the brand). Why so serious? Bit emo, mate.",
