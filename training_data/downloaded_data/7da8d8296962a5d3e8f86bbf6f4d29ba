  "content": "Is this journalism, or has it become a game? The injunction brouhaha is certainly enjoyable enough. Those who work in the media know who has taken out injunctions, some of which are particularly super, and they can tell their friends (though you shouldn't), print knowing diary stories, tweet from anonymised accounts. Those who are in possession of the names can all feel terribly clever \u2013 and cleverer still when trying to break the boundaries, as Louise Bagshawe MP did when she almost blurted one out on Have I Got News For You. Underlying all this there is little regard for principle. It remains the case that the vast majority of gagging orders are granted to keep information about affairs or other sexual indiscretions out of the papers. In truth, the public interest is so thin in revealing them that most of the time press lawyers have abandoned making public interest arguments for disclosure \u2013 rather resorting to Article 10 of the European Convention that gives people the right to \"freedom of expression\", without acknowledging that one person's freedom is circumscribed when it impinges on another's. As you learn more about each case, often the arguments become more complex. Take the Imogen Thomas affair: Justice Eady last week said it \"appeared strongly to suggest that the claimant [the anonymous footballer] was being blackmailed\". That is a serious point (though Thomas denies blackmail). Meanwhile, one argument advanced for learning more about Sir Fred Goodwin's alleged affair is that it may have distracted him from running the bank (if only sex was so time-consuming). But if a newspaper did have reason to believe this supposed relationship materially affected the governance of RBS, it would be open to it to go back to the judge and ask for the gagging order to be lifted. Injunctions are not set in stone; they can be challenged where there are valid arguments put before a judge as to why. In this maelstrom, politicians do their best to look busy. There is talk of new legislation, although walking out of the European Convention on Human Rights would be no trivial task. Or new guidance to favour Article 10 over the privacy Article 8, which is a nice thought, but not actually in the convention. Or maybe it's time for a British Bill of Rights, setting out the British people's sovereign right to read about who's slept with who, coupled with the right of anybody who has shagged a celeb to sell their story. Yet, and this is the irony, there are examples of injunctions, and the use of privacy law that disturb. Recently, an injunction arrived at the Belfast printing press of the Sunday Life, preventing the paper publishing current photographs of Francis Ferris \u2013 a convicted murderer released under licence \u2013 who had been seen earlier this year in the company of Ken Callaghan, a murderer and rapist on day release. The two men were with a female prison officer and her infant son (relevant because Ferris has convictions for child abuse), and the revelation was so serious that Callaghan's day release was ended. Significantly, Callaghan already enjoys the protection of a similar injunction, preventing the publication of unpixelated photographs because Mr Justice Stephens held in 2009 he had a \"residuum of privacy\" because the hostility engendered by the tone of newspaper articles would have led to \"disruption of his home, his private life and family connections\". The newspaper argues that the public have a right to see up-to-date pictures of killers released on licence or day release prisoners where there are questions over conduct. Unlike the killers of James Bulger, none of the men involved in this instance were minors at the time of their offence. Anyway, so much for the serious bit. Seeing as it is so much easier, and more fun, to play the superinjunction game \u2013 let's go back to sex.",
