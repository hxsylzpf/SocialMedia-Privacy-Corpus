Ben Phillips, who has has 1.3m followers on the platform which allows users to upload six-second clips, told the Guardian: \"It's like losing photo albums in a house fire.\" Phillips, from Bridgend in South Wales, is hoping Vine can restore his posts. Just a year ago, he was working in his mum's shoe shop \u2013 now, he can be paid as much as \u00a312,000 to feature products in his Vines. \"I'm really not bothered about the business, it's about the memories from the last year. I know it's the internet, but those Vines represent a journey over the last year. We're just hoping they're recoverable.\" After he was profiled by BuzzFeed and Newsbeat last week about being able to make a living from Vine, his account appears to have been hacked. Phillips told the Guardian he first noticed something was wrong on Sunday. He said: \"I had a couple of followers messaging me, asking me where a Vine had gone and I thought \u2013 what Vine? What's this? \"Then I looked and they'd all been deleted, every single one. I don't know how hacking works, but I found it really weird because they'd even gone and deleted my profile picture.\" The 22-year-old said he has contacted Vine to ask for help, but may well have to start all over again if the problem can't be resolved. The Guardian has contacted Vine to ask for their take on the situation \u2013 we have yet to receive a response. His Vine stardom began after he started making Vines with his then-girlfriend's three-year-old son Harley, who featured in a Ford advert Phillips was paid \u00a312,000 to make. After he and Harley's mother broke up, he rebranded and began making Vines on his own. He has also branched out to other social networks, including Facebook, where his page has reached 500,000 likes. His videos feature him playing pranks on people in and around Cardiff. If Vine isn't able to recover the videos, Phillips has said he may upload 10 of his favourites and start all over again. He added: \"But right now, I don't want to touch it until I know for sure we can't get the posts back.\" Vine has become the home to numerous social media stars who are adept at creating witty content in just six seconds, and often branch out to Snapchat and other platforms like YouTube . Many of Vine's biggest stars have been approached by brands to create short advertorial clips.",
