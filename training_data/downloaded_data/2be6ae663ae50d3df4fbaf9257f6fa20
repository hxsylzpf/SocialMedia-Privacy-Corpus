  "content": "Before joining Twitter, the prime minister, David Cameron, once opined that \"too many Tweets might make a twat\". Following his most recent tweet on the benefits cap that comes into action on Monday, he may be inclined to revisit the ribald advice. On Monday morning, Cameron tweeted his support for the changes and the minister spearheading them, Iain Duncan Smith, writing: But his eagle-eyed followers were quicker than the prime minister to realise that the Twitter account @IDS_MP is, in fact, a parody account of the work and pensions secretary \u2013 and one with which Cameron may not be keen to ally himself. Pronouncements include: The @IDS_MP account has also tweeted some thoughts on recent proposals to increase MPs' wages: And, ever the solutions man, he also had advice for those wishing to keep cool in the hot weather: He added that the Tories had done their bit to help keep the nation cool: But if Cameron, or at least his office, is likely to be pink of cheek at the mistake, @IDS_MP was enjoying his moment in the sun.
