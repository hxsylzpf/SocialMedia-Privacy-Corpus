  "content": "The sons of a woman who died without leaving anyone her iPad password have accused Apple of behaving coldly towards their family. Anthea Grant died earlier this year, and named her sons Patrick and Josh as the executors of her will. When they realised that they could not access the device without a password, they approached Apple hoping that it would unlock it for them. The company demanded a death certificate, a copy of the will and finally a court order to gain access to the iPad, apparently citing a privacy law. Under its terms and conditions, Apple states: \"Any rights to your Apple ID or content within your account terminate upon your death.\" Have you made arrangements for your online life to be closed down after you die? Would you be happy for loved ones to have access to your computer or tablet, and to see your internet history and social media sites? Would you be happy for your social media accounts to stay online, as a place where your friends and family could remember you, or would you want to wipe as much information as possible from the internet before you go? Tell us what plans you have in place for your online presence when you die.",
