  "content": "The Hunger Games actor Jennifer Lawrence, who was recently the victim of a nude photo hacking scandal, has said she is not active on social media and never will be. In an interview with BBC Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, Lawrence was asked by a fan: \"Why don't you have Twitter and will you ever get it?\" To which the star emphatically and quickly answered: \"I will never get Twitter.\" Sitting alongside her co-stars Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson, she elaborated: \"I'm not very good on phones or technology. I can not really keep up with emails, so the idea of Twitter is so unthinkable to me. I don't really understand what it is, it's this weird enigma that people talk about. And it's fine, I respect that, but no, I will never get a Twitter. \"And if you ever see a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram that says it's me; it most certainly is not\". After Grimshaw commented that this was the most serious answer any of the cast members had given all interview, Lawrence said: \"I had that one locked and loaded \u2026 it's because the internet has scorned so much that I feel like it's like, that girl in high school, that I'm like: 'oh you wanna talk about her? Yeah I'll do that. I'm gonna take my hoops off, I'm ready to go'.\" In September, Lawrence was one of the celebrities caught up in widespread hacking incident \u2013 the so-called Fappening \u2013 which resulted in leaked nude photographs of, among others, Rihanna and Kate Upton. Breaking her silence on the leak in November, she said it was \"not a scandal\", but a \"sex crime\". \"It is a sexual violation. It's disgusting. The law needs to be changed, and we need to change. That's why these web sites are responsible. Just the fact that somebody can be sexually exploited and violated, and the first thought that crosses somebody's mind is to make a profit from it. \"It's so beyond me. I just can't imagine being that detached from humanity. I can't imagine being that thoughtless and careless and so empty inside\", she told Vanity Fair. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I is the penultimate installment of the Hunger Games film franchise, based on the wildly popular books by Suzanne Collins about a dystopian world.",
