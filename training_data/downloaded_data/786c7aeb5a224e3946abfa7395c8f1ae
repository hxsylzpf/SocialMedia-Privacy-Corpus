They tweeted: Excited to bring the world premiere of the world's 1st web ballet this weekend. Take a look how it was created youtube.com/user/DiabloBal\u2026 #dance \u2014 DiabloBallet (@DiabloBallet) February 28, 2013 Using the hashtag #DiabloWebBallet, the California-based dance company invited people to take part in creating their first social-media crowdsourced production by suggesting storyline ideas, emotions and moves. At this point I hasten to underline that the claim of \"world's first web ballet\" is theirs, not mine, but who ever did it first I do think it's an interesting way for a company to use their growing online community of fans and dancers. Diablo received more than 100 tweets and Facebook messages, which choreographer Robert Dekkers sifted through. They included: #diablowebballet the story of the Dodo Bird, birds who can't fly and became extinct \u2014 Jonathan Mangosing (@MangoJMango) January 16, 2013 @diabloballet Feel of piece: Deliberately ironic #DiabloWebBallet \u2014 Blondie (@BlondieBallet) February 7, 2013 @diabloballet #DiabloWebBallet Everyone picks an era but what if you have a dancer from every era and integrate them all together.

Dekker picked seven winning suggestions to work into his piece, which has been renamed Flight of the Dodo. Other artforms experiment with social-media collaborations too. At any one time (I estimate) there are a billion stories being written on Twitter, one line at a time, by various people. This week it's the turn of #Litrostory. Then there's China Mi\u00e9ville at the Edinburgh world writers' conference, who embraced the idea that an author's fans would one day edit a newly published book and then repost it online with some bits added and other bits taken away, creating a \"blurring of boundaries between writers, books and readers, self-publishing: the fan-fication of fiction\". Flight of the Dodo opens on 1 March \u2013 and I'm looking forward to reading what people think of the finished result \u2013 but what do you think of crowdsourced art? Does it add a new angle to the work and result in something more creative? Or is it a bad idea? Over to you.",
