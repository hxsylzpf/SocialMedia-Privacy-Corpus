  "content": "\"It has caused me some embarrassment\" \u2013 that's how Rob Wilson, the Conservative MP for Reading East, has described having accidentally tweeted a link to a hardcore porn site. Wilson (no relation) intended to send his followers to a story about benefit cuts on political blogger Guido Fawkes's website order-order.com, but thanks to a \"technical hitch\", as the Conservatives put it \u2013 apparently a number was missing from the shortened link provided by Tory HQ \u2013 he instead sent them to an website draped with women wearing strangely small bikinis. I feel Wilson's pain. The parallel isn't exact \u2013 I was much more stupid \u2013 but in 2002 I too accidentally sent readers of this website to a hardcore porn site. I was at the time working on the women's desk at the Guardian. These were sumptuous days, pre-austerity; I think there were four or five of us producing perhaps four print pages a week. Anyway for a time I was tasked, probably by myself, with writing a column called Sidelines in G2's women's section. Under my stewardship, I think I am safe in saying, it was the worst column ever to appear in the Guardian: naive, giggly, silly and madly overwritten. If I'd been 12, you might have forgiven it, but I wasn't. Anyway, the depths of my hindsight-horror surround a column I wrote on female ejaculation in January 2002. The subject had come up in an episode of Sex and the City, which back then was HOT. So \u2013 *did* female ejaculation really exist? I decided to find out on the internet. I am guessing \u2013 this being early doors for G2 and the internet \u2013 by \"Yahoo-ing\" it. Up came lots of links! I clicked on a site, and watched as a woman ejaculated. It did exist! When I wrote up the column, I duly included the link to the website I'd found, although I am not at all sure that I understood either what a link was, or whether I was including it. In fact I bet I didn't. What I didn't do was (a) explore the website, to see what else might be on it, and (b) remember that my story would be \"uploaded\" on to our website, where it would exist \u2013 with a live link from the Guardian to what is an extremely graphic pornographic site, without even a warning page \u2013 for ever and ever. Or until today actually, when someone kindly killed the link for me. Like Mr Wilson, I'm embarrassed \u2013 but I suspect I'm not alone. What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever linked to inadvertently on Twitter? Or email you've sent to the wrong person? Or post you didn't mean to make public on Facebook?
