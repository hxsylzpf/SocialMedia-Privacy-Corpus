  "content": "Until recently, I was a Twitter refusenik. I've been on Facebook five years and built up a nice array of friends, family, colleagues and acquaintances. I'm also on LinkedIn and several online forums. Who needs Twitter? Who has time? There are only so many hours in the day and if you're not careful, attending to your social media presence can become a full-time job \u2013 an easy hole to fall into when you're self-employed and working from home. That virtual watercooler becomes a day-long watering hole. But as a freelance journalist, I've become increasingly aware I need to be on Twitter. My articles are being tweeted - which I'm obviously delighted about - but I'm not there to follow up. It feels ... rude, almost. If people are talking about me, shouldn't I join in? Also, editors want you to have a Twitter presence. For some, it's now more important than a blog or website (I have those too). So I signed up and eagerly embraced Twitter over a wet weekend. I followed everyone I thought would be interesting. I clicked \"follow\" on all the suggestions the site threw at me. As fast as I clicked follow, more names followed back. I thought this was the right thing to do. Follow loads and hope some follow back. After all, from the way the BBC goes on about it, you'd think Twitter was the internet. Keen to see how well I was getting on with my tweeting, retweeting, following and, slowly, gathering followers, I clicked a link in a friend's tweet that promised to show me how many people had looked at my profile. Aaaargh. As soon as I did, I realised it was a big mistake. That click took me to another site and the penny dropped - it was spam. I'd been had. I felt annoyed at having allowed my ego to be so easily tempted but, hey, we're all human. (Apart from the Twitterbots, obviously.) Twitter didn't think I was though. My account was suspended and I had to log back in typing letters to prove I was a person rather than a spambot. I did, and my account reappeared. Phew. An hour later, it was suspended again, this time with no chance to prove I was human. Twitter (or some robot inside) had decided I was spamming. I appealed - referee! The online appeals form forces you to type your name beneath the signoff \"With love\" - which I'm sure would make George Orwell smirk in his grave.  Nearly a week later I received an email from Twitter support saying they were sure my problem had now been resolved and they were closing my case! Hang on a minute ... no, it hadn't been resolved. Please reopen my ticket, I asked them. It felt like begging. Most undignified. But that's what worries me about Twitter. You kind of have to be there. So if you transgress in some way, that's it. You're off the site. And you can't explain. So your followers may think badly of you which, if you're using it for professional reasons as I am, could have devastating consequences. I read the rules, but it took a Twitter veteran to point out where I'd gone wrong - yes, clicking on \"who looked at my profile\" was a mistake, but I'd also followed hundreds of people in a very short space of time. This made me look like a spammer. I felt like the kid kept in at school while everyone else goes out for ice cream. While I waited for Twitter to get round to my appeal, I registered with another version of my name, but of course had to start all over again. Twitter have now told me they are unsuspending my former account. Great. So I've gone from being a Twitter refusenik to now having two Twitter accounts. And you can't merge them, as others have discovered. Well, you can, but not directly. Still, better two accounts than none, I suppose. And it does show that Twitter is trying to stop the spambots that plague social media sites. It also indicates that the appeals system works (eventually). But if you're new to Twitter, or thinking of giving it a go, beware of where you click. And don't follow too many too quickly. Laura Marcus is on Twitter, slightly older and wiser. And she's much more careful where she clicks.",
