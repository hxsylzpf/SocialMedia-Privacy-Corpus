  "content": "Today's extract from the updated edition of The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial* is by a media academic, Tim Crook, who argues that British journalism is now under unprecedented attack. He argues that the Leveson inquiry, police investigation and overall criticism means that the well-worn phrase, \"the chilling effect\", is proving inadequate to describe the current situation in which laws are already being interpreted by judges to the detriment of press freedom... There is a civil war going on in journalism. It is right against left, broadsheet against tabloid, middle class against working class, broadcast/multi-media against newspaper/online. Journalists and lawyers are accusing each other of committing criminal offences, civil wrongs and professional misconduct. There is no evidence of any consensus or unanimity on what should be done. Academics, including the rather crudely named \"hackademics\", media pressure groups, and the journalists' trade union, NUJ, actually advocate statutory involvement in print/online journalism regulation and a statutorily enforceable \"right to reply\". These measures are to be found in former Warsaw Pact countries struggling to re-arrange fig-leaves over their totalitarian past, failed post-colonial dictatorships and countries with post-second world war civil law jurisdictions culturally arranged to cover-up collaboration with the holocaust and Nazi occupation. The Leveson inquiry is costing more than the Chilcot inquiry, dealing perhaps with a higher scale of human violation and harm, and investigating a decision by this country's government to go to war with deaths and grief far beyond anything caused by a journalist's mobile phone snooping or private investigator's computer hack. Chilcot never dispatched section 21 orders with interrogative questionnaires demanding answers on pain of contempt prosecution. The counsel for \"media victims\", David Sherborne, made it very clear: 'The press is on trial here, and not simply in this room but also out there in the court of public opinion\". The need to reform inquiry rules In his closing address, Jonathan Caplan QC for the Daily Mail group, raised the issue of there being \"no right for core participants to cross-examine witnesses who make serious allegations against them\" \u2013 a matter for reform of the statute and rules. He also highlighted the fact that one of Leveson's six assessors was \"a founder, director and trustee of the Media Standards Trust, a core participant... and also a member of the Hacked Off campaign, which are both critics of popular journalism, but you were not given any assessor from the popular press.\" [Crook goes on to consider in some detail the various laws that affect journalism, such as libel, and the relatively recent outlawing of other news-gathering methods, such as phone-hacking, blagging, doorstepping and paying public officials. Then he moves on to discuss privacy actions] Privacy in the UK is a new restriction on media conduct and content. The English judiciary decided to take control of the definition of public interest in terms of a hierarchy where priority and discretion would be exercised for broadsheet and public service media running serious and somewhat boring stories at the top, and tabloid media gossiping and exposing the tawdry though entertaining private lives of celebrity at the bottom. The judiciary also imported European civil law concepts of private zone of interaction, personal autonomy, equating honour, identity, dignity and respect with reputation through the power line of the 1998 human rights act and European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) case law. It is the English judiciary that is deciding that the betrayal of human relationships through infidelity and consumption of the sex industries \u2013 middle and upper-class exploitation of working class personal dignity \u2013 is not in \"the public interest.\" It is the judges who are deciding what is \"a reasonable expectation of privacy.\" The power and control is now determined by a privatised legal profession chasing the profits of privacy litigation with charges 140 times greater than the European average and judges who conceive of privacy as a cube of ice that has to be kept in the freezer of prior restraint. In the USA, not only is there a public interest threshold to be met on an entitlement to claim for breach of privacy, it is also a tort that is only available post-publication. Countries with a process of secret prior restraint to publication are, and can never be, true democracies. The existence of such legal facility is the mark of an authoritarian state infrastructure of information control and censorship. The ethical and legal wrongs of Hackgate happened with a backdrop of the English judiciary turning a developing media respect to the right for privacy into a notorious censorship law prohibiting the publication of truth through secret injunction, with injunctions imposed on the very existence of an injunction (the super-injunction). The tide is inundating the popular newspaper market competing to serve its consumers, otherwise known as \"the common people\", with stories that were water-tight and proofed in the winning of a defendant's burden of truth by securing the evidence to justify libel; only to discover that the law of privacy has holed them below the water line. The new chilling effect This is the new chilling effect \u2013 the prohibition on the publication of truth through secret court order on moral issues and matters that public opinion survey might well regard as matters of public debate and interest. And, very slowly, a minority of concerned voices in the superior broadsheet media, who always considered themselves culturally and morally superior to their scallywag brothers and sisters in the tabloids, are becoming aware of the boomerang. Injunctions favouring the multi-national Trafigura, notorious former Bank of Scotland Chief Executive Fred Goodwin, controversial footballer Ryan Giggs and self-confessed sex addicted American golfer Tiger Woods hardly engender much public confidence in the ability of her majesty's courts to make rulings \"in the public interest.\" The public debate about statutorily establishing and defining a public interest may be missing the point about comparative media jurisprudence. The closer the power and determination of public interest is in the control of state officials and legislative, executive or judicial bodies, the closer we are to jurisdictions in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. Far too many potential news-gathering criminal offences have no \"public interest\" defences; thus leaving decisions on whether to prosecute or not with a state- appointed government prosecuting official (the director of public prosecutions). It may well be a sociological paradox that is difficult for the bourgeois broadsheet-hugging intelligentsia to accept, but the News of the World, over 168 years, fought for and spoke for the battered and proud working class who washed the doorsteps of their \"slums\" clean every morning, loyally paid their pounds, shillings and pence to the man from the PRU, migrated from servile back-breaking service in the rich peoples' town and country houses to the new jobs as clerks, telephone girls, shop assistants and managers, ribbon road factory workers in heavy and light industries and sought social mobility in wider education and the promise of lower and middle class home ownership. The equalising 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s of the 20th century have been replaced by inequality, narrowing opportunity, decline of meritocracy and rise of the super and ugly rich celebrocracy, avoiding taxes and concentrating their wealth in off-shore havens. The real cesspit of nihilist ethicism is the City world of casino banking and finance where people work the least for the most and destroy and corrupt the wider economy. Perhaps the NoW helped engender a little fear in the world of over-indulgent and undeserving rich and emotionally cut them down to size as well as exposing sexual corruption, exploitation and social hypocrisy. What was published was notoriously pompous, tawdry, salacious and wretched. Perhaps it poached more than its fair share of other people's dignity. But in \"draining the swamp\" of those who insult with intrusive truth to power, we may well have lost more than a few nasty alligators, snakes and piranhas in the journalistic Street of Shame.
