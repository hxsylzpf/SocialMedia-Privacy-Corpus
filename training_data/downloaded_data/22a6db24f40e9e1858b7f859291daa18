  "content": "Rupert Murdoch has taken to Twitter to claim the UK general election \"explodes the myth of social media power\". Just in case readers are left in doubt about what did sway the result, the Sun and Times owner says it is a \"great time\" for the \"competitive free press\". (Presumably he means the newspapers that overwhelmingly chose to back the Tories, with no interference from their proprietors.) Murdoch also praised David Cameron's \"surprisingly good\" new cabinet: Monkey notes that new culture secretary John Whittingdale makes Murdoch's list. Presumably he has forgiven the MP for being summoned to appear in front of his select committee, which the mogul claimed was the \"most humble day of my life\".",
