  "content": "Welsh politics and the EU referendum doesn't sound like the most fun thing to be talking about on a Friday afternoon. Yet a vandalised Vote Leave sign in mid-Wales is doing the rounds this week, leading to an unlikely mock-campaign for a third candidate in the EU referendum. It all started with this post from Conservative campaigner Felix Aubel, who was very angry to find a Vote Leave sign in Brongest, Ceredigion had been vandalised to read \"Vote Beaver\": At the risk of ruining the joke, people thought it was funny for several reasons: 1) Why couldn't the vandals think of anything better than beaver? 2) How unhappy someone can be about a sign that reads \"vote beaver\" 3) The fashion-forward shorts-shirt combination 4) #VoteBeaver seems like a good enough campaign to get behind When we originally unearthed this post (full disclaimer, the author of this article was extremely excited about it), it was mostly amusing a section of Welsh Twitter, who were already familiar with Aubel and his campaigning. \"Right, hands up who vandalised Felix's poster?\" \"Can't decide whether we should be in or out of the EU? Vote Beaver.\" Aubel is a colourful and well-known character in Welsh politics and has stood for parliament many times, but has yet to be elected. The Welsh minister also stood as the Conservative assembly candidate for Ceredigion in the recent assembly elections. By Friday, campaign #VoteBeaver had been covered by a few national newspapers and Scottish Twitter were getting involved: Inevitably, someone set up a Twitter account: How does Aubel feel about his unlikely star turn as a Welsh political meme? Well, if his following posts are anything to go by, he is delighted with the publicity. \"Thank you so much to everyone who has advertised the damage of the vandalism of one of #VoteLeave's posters in Ceredigion.\" The Guardian has contacted Aubel for comment.",
