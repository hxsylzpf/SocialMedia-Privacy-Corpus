According to McGregor, who worked in Labor's Melbourne headquarters for the duration of the Australian campaign, was credited for Barack Obama's successful 2012 social media campaign, and who will be working for the British Labour party in 2015, Labor used digital media in a more personal and informal way to interact with its supporters. \"Labor and the Liberals are doing two quite different things, in a similar way to how the Democrats and the Republicans did digital campaigning differently in the US,\" he said in an interview with Guardian Australia. \"We were trying to mobilise our supporters, we were trying to include them in the campaign, so you saw video briefings from George [George Wright, ALP national secretary], talking people through which seats we were focussed on, how they could be involved in the campaign, why we wanted them to be involved in the campaign \u2026 It was a systematic attempt to include supporters and mobilise them.\" The Liberals, he argued, \"used digital more as a broadcast tool. If you look at their emails, for example, they were very much [about saying] here are all our policies and this is why you should like them.\" Kevin Rudd's use of Twitter, Facebook and other social media predates Labor's attempts to beef up its digital campaigning and is a personal strategy of the former prime minister, who boasts almost 1.4m Twitter followers. But, according to McGregor, his use of social media fits the same pattern. \"The shaving-cut selfie is easy to dismiss, but the [former] PM used it to engage \u2026 and that is how he uses social media. In the car on the way out of the Rooty Hill debate he spent 20 minutes taking questions on Twitter,\" he said. McGregor said that because Labor was heavily outspent on paid television advertising it had to try to use social media to help bridge the gap, but he conceded the Coalition's social media offerings were \"slick\". On Facebook, Tony Abbott's \"likes\" soared 556% during the campaign, from 39,418 to 258,628, compared with Rudd's, which increased 36% from 93,402 to 127,476. Most of Abbott's posts were messages and pictures about his campaign and policy information. Liberal Party director Brian Loughnane said he believed the Liberals \"comprehensively won all the social media platforms throughout the election campaign\". He did not dispute that the Liberals' emphasis was on provision of information. \"Central to the success of our social media strategy was our focus to continually provide engaging and factual content for Australians to comment on and share with their friends. By constantly delivering new and engaging content we significantly increased our Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, website and email subscription followings and reached a greater number of Australians,\" he said. Labor also used Youtube extensively, including the video extract of Rudd's passionate defence of same-sex marriage during his appearance on the ABC's Q &amp; A program, which has been viewed 2.7m times. And, according to McGregor, Labor was very successful in using social media to find new volunteers and raise donations. \"We raised as much on day one of the campaign as we did in the entirety of 2010 from online contributions, and in this campaign small donations given online were the single biggest source of funds,\" he said. \"We had 10,000 people volunteer online to do offline activity, phone calls, door knocks, etc., because of online engagement. Those kind of things make a big difference.\" Labor frontbencher Tony Burke said on Tuesday that Labor had earned $800,000 from small donations during the campaign, with an average donation of $64, and the grassroots engagement had been on a scale \"we've never had before\". McGregor conceded the Coalition didn't gift Labor the same kinds of opportunities to create the devastating responses that earned him the title \"digital attack dog\" during Obama's campaign against Mitt Romney. \"Tony Abbott ran a very disciplined campaign. There wasn't the scale of gaffes and missteps that you saw from the Romney campaign in 2012,\" he said. But he said Labor tried to exploit the \"poor policy\" and the mistakes the Coalition did make. The \"Abbott's internet\" ad \u2013 asking people on the street around the world about the Coalition broadband plan \u2013 got almost 1m views and became the most viewed video of the campaign. Labor was also quick to put together an interactive timeline of the Coalition's short-lived \"poorly worded\" internet filter policy, which won top billing on Reddit Australia. Rudd, like Obama, did an AMA (ask me anything) session on Reddit. And Abbott seemed to be pitching for the \"victory image\" like the Obama's \"four more years\" picture of his embrace with Michelle, when Loughnane emailed to supporters on Sunday an image entitled \"the moment\". \"Shortly before 9pm last night I had the great privilege of informing Tony Abbott that he was in a position to command a majority of seats in the House of Representatives,\" he informed them, although the accompanying image of the men didn't quite have the power of the Obama shot, which became the most viral photograph in the world. However successful Labor might have been in getting donations and enthusing volunteers through its online campaign, the election delivered it a decisive defeat. Labor lost 15 seats in the lower house.",
