  "content": "In Syria, people are forced to become garbage men instead of famous pop stars, according to a new web series that explains complicated concepts to children. The YouTube-sponsored series is inspired by a popular subsection on Reddit where users can post questions they want explained to them as though they were five years old. Reddit premiered three videos on Monday inspired by the site's Explain It Like I'm Five (ELI5) subsection. In the videos, actors explain things including the crisis in Syria and existentialism (\"Are there any rules that your parents have that you think are silly at all?\") to actual children. And while no one was chanting \"Give me back my glue!\" during the Arab spring, one youngster in the video is able to grasp that in Syria: \"There's a mean president.\" Another child suggests that Bashar al-Assad \"needs a beautiful woman and to get married to stop all these shenanigans\". Quite. What is the smartest thing a child has told you? Do children understand things better than your adult friends? And does childhood innocence sometimes make for the best answers? Tell us in the comments below.",
