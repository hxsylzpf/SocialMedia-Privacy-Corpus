  "content": "In an ordinary year \u2013 one not marked by Britain's double-dip, the euro crisis and a possible change of guard in Washington \u2013 the collapse in Facebook's stock would be one of the biggest business stories around. Its shares slumped to $19.01 on Friday afternoon, making them worth almost exactly half the $38 they were sold at in the company's listing this May \u2013 less a flotation, you might think, than a belly-flop. There's more to this than social-media schadenfreude: this is about insiders profiting at the expense of outsiders. Mark Zuckerberg and senior staffers at Facebook have been able to cash out of stock they bought ultra-cheap before flotation. Morgan Stanley and other underwriters will have made a mint on the deal. And Wall Street traders who jumped ship early will also have done well. The losers are small investors who bought shares at a vastly inflated price \u2013 and those saving for their retirement in a pension fund. Those small-time savers will have handed over millions to an elite of financiers and tech executives. There has to be a better way of organising flotations. When Google joined the stock market in 2004, it held a \"Dutch auction\", inviting investors to bid for stock at whatever price they thought fair. It has drawbacks, but such a system prevents a bunch of Wall Street insiders getting in on a stock early, then dumping it. It's just one option worth exploring in the wake of the Facebook flop; because this tale isn't about one company's Icarus-like descent, but an entire rotten system.",
