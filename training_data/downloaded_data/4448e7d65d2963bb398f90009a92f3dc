The White House announced an executive order to encourage information-sharing between the private sector and the government ahead of Obama's cybersecurity summit at Stanford University. About 1,000 people are expected to attend the meeting, including Apple's chief executive officer Tim Cook and top cybersecurity officials from Google, Facebook and Yahoo who have been pushing back on terrorism cooperation, as well as executives from credit card companies and utility companies that have been busy expressing frustration over consumer protection. \"[I]t's going to bring everybody together \u2013 industry, tech companies, law enforcement, consumer and privacy advocates, law professors who are specialists in the field, as well as students \u2013 to make sure that we work through these issues in a public, transparent fashion,\" Obama said, announcing the summit last month. Other than Cook, however, there will be a notable shortage of major US tech company leaders at the summit, being held at the alma mater of many of Silicon Valley's top innovators. Facebook chairman and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Larry Page and Eric Schmidt and Yahoo's Marissa Mayer declined invitations to attend, according to the companies. Tech firms are still smarting from the revelations of National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden and have clashed with Obama over their ability to publicly report on government surveillance requests. More recently, as Apple and others roll out consumer protections in their software, many companies have become concerned about the administration's policy on encryption techniques used to protect customer information. Last year, FBI director James Comey said encryption \"threatens to lead us all to a very, very dark place\". Obama plans to outline what he hopes will become a closer working relationship with companies to fend off digital threats as cybersecurity becomes an increasing priority for his administration and the US intelligence community. \"All industry sectors and types of businesses face cybersecurity risks,\" Jeff Zients, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Thursday on a conference call with reporters. \"Cybersecurity is not just a cost of doing business. It's the cost of staying in business.\" The executive order follows in the wake of the Sony hacking scandal. That attack, which the White House pinned on North Korea, compromised the personal details of 47,000 people and released a series of highly embarrassing emails from the company's top executives. Sony's hack was preceded by attacks on Home Depot and Target that compromised millions of people's credit cards and other personal information. A security breach at Anthem, the US's second largest health insurer, was revealed this month. It has exposed the names, social security numbers and other information of 80m people. Privacy advocates and cyber-threat watchers questioned the link to Pyongyang, and were expected to push back on Friday about Obama's information-sharing plan. The executive order encourages the development of \"information sharing and analysis organizations\" (ISAOs) that will act as focal points for private sector companies to share information with each other and government, \"across a region or in response to a specific emerging cyber threat\". The White House moved to address what will undoubtedly be one of the major concerns of the new order \u2013 privacy. The new framework will include \"strong protections for privacy and civil liberties\", according to the White House. Private sector ISAOs will agree to abide by a common set of voluntary standards, which will include privacy protections. Agencies collaborating with ISAOs \"will coordinate their activities with their senior agency officials for privacy and civil liberties and ensure that appropriate protections for privacy and civil liberties are in place,\" the White House said.",
