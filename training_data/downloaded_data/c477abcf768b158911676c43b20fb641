  "content": "Rupert Murdoch may not have been on Twitter for long but he already has 195,897 followers, and probably more by the time you read this. But the media magnate follows just 19 users. And six of them are related to his own companies, such as The Sun, The Times, New York Post, Wall Street Journal, Fox News and his US iPad outlet, The Daily. He also follows the cutting edge All Things D, which specialises in reporting on digital innovation and startup companies. And he reveals his political taste with Ricochet, a forum for right-of-centre thinkers. That leaves a select 11 individuals. Some are fairly predictable, such as Bill Gates, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey \u200fand Britain's favourite TV entrepreneur Lord (Alan) Sugar. More surprising perhaps is the Afghan media owner Saad Mohseni, who runs the MOBY Group. The celebrated New York University economist Nouriel Roubini makes the list, as does a single politician - Republican majority leader in Congress, Eric Cantor. Actors Jim Carrey and Steve Martin are there alongside the hugely popular American TV presenter Ryan Seacrest. Only two journalists make the list: WSJ columnist Peggy Noonan and CNN international correspondent Mohammed Jamjoom. And, yes, since you ask, I am coping with the rejection as best I can.",
