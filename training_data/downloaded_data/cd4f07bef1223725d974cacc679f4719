  "content": "Visual imagery is the currency of arts and culture. From the visceral and affecting first moment you lay eyes on a real life El-Salahi, to that sensory slap round the face you get from witnessing an hour-long session from Hofesh Shechter, the eyes really are the window to the soul \u2026 and artistic appreciation. Of course, not everything cultural is visual, but when you think about all those paintings, sculptures, artefacts and performances, what better way for a venue to show it off than to parade it via an image. Why use words to describe a particular piece, when a picture paints a thousand of them? Not to mention what's going on out of frame or behind the scenes in your organisation \u2013 audiences love a backstory. Instagram and Pinterest are two of the most popular tools to choose from when thinking about socially spreading imagery online. Not only do they have their own communities, but large ones at that: Instagram recently revealed it has more than 150 million monthly active users; Pinterest meanwhile was estimated to have 70 million active users in July 2013. That's a huge potential audience to engage. But how? We want to host an online discussion to answer just that, and any other question you might have about image-sharing social networks \u2013 Snapchat for example, which sees more daily photos exchanged than Facebook. It's a social media surgery, if you will, for arts and cultural organisations. So join us from noon on Tuesday 26 November to talk image sharing in the arts.
