  "content": "That great British tradition \u2013 privacy \u2013 is now only really defended by the European Union. Yesterday's important House of Lords debate on civil liberties and electronic surveillance highlighted two areas in which the EU has stepped into the gaping hole left by the UK government. In December, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that retaining the DNA of the innocent breached article eight of the human rights convention. Britain urgently needs a debate on DNA retention as public discourse on the topic has been sidetracked by a \"for it or against it\" tone. The debate should focus on why it is retained, how and with what safeguards. These protections are key. Firstly, the regulation of private sector data collection and storage needs to be tightened; and secondly, the increasingly porous boundaries between public and private data need to be clarified. Europe stepped into the breach when the European Commissionlaunched infringement proceedings against the UK for failing to regulate the internet advertising company Phorm. Although public controversy surrounding the technology company has centred on BT's secret trials of its system in 2006; the real issue is that Phorm's innovations, which would allow internet service providers to track customers, exist in a legal grey area. Shockingly, freedom of information requests have just revealed that the Home Office was consulting Phorm on whether the government's interpretation of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act was an analysis that suited Phorm. It also asked if Phorm wanted to amend the interpretation. Yesterday the counter-terrorism minister Lord West would not comment on these revelations. Perhaps this is because the Home Office would like to utilise similar technologies themselves. The second real danger for privacy is the sharing of information between databases and between the public and private sector. The dangerously permissive proposals for data sharing in the coroners and justice bill, which have now been withdrawn, would have allowed information sharing between data controllers in public bodies and the private sector. These blurred boundaries between the public and private sectors made news this week with the revelation that the Department of Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform gave the energy company E.ON secret police information regarding the peaceful protest at Kingsnorth power station. It is one thing for the police to gather intelligence about a demonstration. It is quite another for the government to be able to access that information and then leak it to a private company. This leak is yet another example of why the public shouldn't trust the government with its private data. Currently the rules for data storage and access to data are being dealt with separately. The government thinks that this approach is logical. However while it may be rational, it is not reasonable. It is like asking someone to put their valuables in a safe without telling them who's got the key. The problem at the moment is that the government is intent on cutting a copy of that key for just about everybody. Until it understands that personal data is valuable, we shouldn't trust the key holder.",
