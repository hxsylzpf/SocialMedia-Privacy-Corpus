  "content": "The Human Rights act was passed 10 years ago but did not come into operation for 18 months, whilst training courses were held for those who would be involved in its implementation. Unfortunately, there were no courses for tabloid newspaper editors, who ever since have misunderstood it. For example, the editor of the Daily Mail is apparently unaware that two of his most precious free speech rights \u2013 to protect his sources and to advance a public interest defence when sued for libel \u2013 have come about entirely through judicial interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights. They would never have been granted by parliament, full of MPs anxious to cash their libel winnings and to unmask sources for unfavourable stories. It is a matter of record \u2013 and it should be a matter of grave concern \u2013 that under both Conservative and Labour governments over the past quarter century, far more gains in freedom have come about through judges applying the European Convention than through the actions of MPs. Over this period, most attempts to diminish liberty have emanated from governments and comparatively few from the courts. Mr Dacre's attack on Justice Eady for developing a privacy law would more sensibly be directed at his fellow editors and proprietors who have for the last half century pretended to parliament and their readers that voluntary self-regulation through a toothless Press Council and then a gumless Press Complaints Commission could protect this valued human right. His complaint about the Max Moseley judgment should be directed to the editor of News of the World, who betrayed the cause of press freedom by failing to appeal it. The appeal court could well have held that Justice Eady's approach was in fact mistaken. He said that Article 8 offers a broad protection to \"autonomy, dignity and self-esteem\". But the drafters of this Article decided that it should not protect honour or reputation: it was narrowly defined as a right to \"respect for private and family life, home and correspondence\" \u2013 words that hardly cover Mr Moseley's pre-occupations. What the media have failed to report about the Human Rights act is the fact that the main beneficiaries are law abiding citizens who have been treated unfairly by bureaucrats. It has been particularly helpful in providing a better quality of life for the vulnerable: mental patients, children, the homeless and the aged. The Audit Commission review concluded that its operation has led to better government and better public services \u2013 it has encouraged \"new thinking\" and assisted decision makers \"to see seemingly intractable problems in a new light\". It may however, be time to move on. The European Convention, although drafted by British lawyers, is still Eurocentric: there is, for example, no protection for trial by jury (because Napoleon abolished them). There is no reference to the economic and social rights that may be necessary in the coming recession. Britain has made a greater contribution to liberty than any other country, as the current exhibition at the British Library emphasises. It is time that we expressed our rights in the language of Milton and Shakespeare, in precedents we find from the Levellers, John Wilkes, and Tom Paine, and in a remarkable declaration drafted in 1939 by HG Wells, JB Priestly, and AA Milne from Pooh Corner. Then, even editors of the tabloids might understand them.",
