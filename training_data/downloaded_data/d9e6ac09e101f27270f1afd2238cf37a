Google was ordered to remove almost 100 online articles from its search results by Spain's data protection authority (DPA) earlier this year. The articles, some of which appeared in official gazettes, were subject to privacy complaints by their subjects. The US technology giant vowed to fight Spain's demand in a Madrid court, warning that it would have a \"profound, chilling effect\" on freedom of expression. The case will now be referred to the European court of justice, which will offer guidance on whether Spain's demands comply with European law \u2013 potentially setting a controversial precedent for internet publishing in the country. Peter Barron, Google's head of European external relations, welcomed the development. \"We're pleased that the court is considering asking guidance from Europe's top court on whether Spain's DPA has overridden European law,\" he said. \"It shows that key issues are at stake. We believe that European law rightly holds the publisher of material responsible for its content. \"Requiring intermediaries like search engines to censor material published by others would have a profound, chilling effect on free expression without protecting people's privacy.\" The Spanish authority argues that bringing an injunction against search engines such as Google is the only way to block access to sensitive material online, as newspapers can legally refuse to comply with more informal requests. However, Google argues that the privacy complaints should be levelled at the publisher of the article, rather than search portal which helps people find it. Cases covering five disputed articles reached the Madrid magistrates' court in January. Those cases will now be considered by Luxembourg's European court of justice, with the remaining 80-odd articles to be resolved at a later date. Spain's demands follow a growing public debate in the country and elsewhere in mainland Europe about \"the right to be forgotten\" \u2013 or the right for people to delete their internet \"data trails\". Complaints from the Spanish public about their representation online have jumped 75% year on year, the country's privacy regulator said in June last year.",
