  "content": "A high court judge has criticised the publishers of the Sun, Daily Mirror and Daily Mail for putting forward weak public interest arguments to attempt to overturn a gagging order brought by Sir Fred Goodwin. Mr Justice Tugendhat was also critical of the fact that the newspaper groups had rushed to get the injunction overturned last Thursday \u2013 it had been in place since 9 March \u2013 and not allowed Goodwin, the former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, time to prepare a response. Last week the high court partially lifted a gagging order brought by Goodwin to allow publication of his name in relation to an alleged extra-marital affair. However, Tugendhat said that details of the alleged relationship and the name of the woman said to be involved, who also worked at RBS, should remain under a privacy injunction. In the full text of his high court judgment on the attempt to get the injunction lifted, published on Monday, Tugendhat is critical of the public interest arguments put forward by the publishers' legal team. The legal challenge was led by News Group Newspapers (NGN), the News International subsidiary that publishes the Sun. NGN was joined in its high court bid to remove the injunction on public interest grounds by Mirror Group Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mirror; and Associated Newspapers, home to titles including the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. Tugendhat was also critical of the \"short notice\" the newspaper groups gave the court and Goodwin of their bid to get the injunction scrapped. \"It is a further requirement of justice that the court should not make a finding adverse to a person in circumstances where that person has been given no warning of the case which is advanced against him or her,\" he said. \"Sir Frederick Goodwin and the lady had had no opportunity to respond to the case in court.\" NGN's argument, put forward by Richard Spearman QC, was that the fact that Lord Stoneham had effectively made the Goodwin injunction public in the Lords meant it was in the public interest to publish all information about the story, \"including names, the duration of the relationship and information about her job, but excluding sexual and salacious details and information about the lady's family\". Tugendhat said that he asked NGN's legal counsel if anonymity orders given on 1 March and 9 March should also have been lifted without giving the woman any notice that the publisher was asking the court to do so. \"Surprisingly, NGN was itself surprised by this question, and was unprepared to answer it,\" he added. \"After taking instructions, Mr Spearman stated that NGN accepts that the lady should have an opportunity [to] make representations to the court before any variation is made to the injunction which affects her or her family.\" Andrew Caldecott QC, representing Associated Newspapers, put forward a case based on an argument raised by Stoneham under parliamentary privilege that there was public interest in the alleged relationship because there could have been a breach of RBS's corporate governance policies. Caldecott put forward several pages of the bank's code of conduct on integrity matters to back up his argument. \"But that was all he produced,\" said Tugendhat. \"Courts of law act on evidence, and only on evidence. The court cannot act on speculation. He said that [Associated Newspapers] has no evidence that anyone was asked about a possible breach of corporate governance.\" Tugendhat said that the cases \"would have been weak\" even if Goodwin and the woman had been given \"proper notice of it in advance\". He said that if NGN or \"any other person\" wanted to try such a tactic in the future they needed to \"have given proper notice of their intentions\". \"I repeat that the orders of 1 March and 9 March did not prevent anyone from carrying out any investigation or from giving information to the FSA (Financial Services Authority) or any other person responsible for investigating the affairs of RBS\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
