  "content": "Google's tribulations in China have failed to knock the internet giant from its perch as the world's most powerful brand, according to a report. WPP-owned research company Millward Brown puts Google at number one in its annual top 100 global brand power list for the fourth year running, with a 14% year-on-year increase in its value to $114bn (\u00a375bn), despite the fact it has effectively pulled out of China over censorship issues. However, Facebook once again failed to make even the top 100 on the Millward Brown list. Despite the incessant hype around Facebook and its potential market valuation, The Brandz report gave Facebook a brand value of just $5.5bn, Peter Walshe, director at Millward Brown, explained that despite having an exceptionally strong brand the company had a long way to go to prove its financial clout. The report, which balances brand power with financial performance, bumped the Apple juggernaut up three places to third slot with a 32% year-on-year increase in brand value to $83bn. The phenomenal popularity of the iPhone, along with the hype surrounding the iPad, sent Apple's share price to a record high earlier this month as profits jumped 90% in the first quarter. Mobile phone manufacturer Nokia was the biggest faller in the top 100, with brand value down 58% year on year, thanks to a massive slip in share price as it fell behind rivals such as Apple in the smartphone market. Other notable movers in this year's list include Toyota, which has been hammered by a mass recall of vehicles, and sees its brand value fall 27%. Auction website eBay's brand value fell 28% year on year thanks to problems with the US business and competition from Amazon Marketplace. At first glance the appearance at number seven of Marlboro, which as a tobacco company faces extreme limitations on brand marketing in many western countries, seems bizarre. But the company has risen three places and seen its brand value rise 15% to $57bn thanks to emerging markets. \"The company is doing very well in the BRIC markets [Brazil, Russia, India and China] which has more than offset the decline in other markets,\" said Walshe. The biggest riser in the list was Samsung, with an 80% increase year on year in brand value, thanks to innovations in divisions including mobile phones and the growth in demand for HD and 3D technology. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
