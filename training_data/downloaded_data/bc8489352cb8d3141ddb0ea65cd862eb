  "content": "Naomi Campbell's lawyers today called for a \"wider and more dynamic\" approach to the law of confidence to prevent newspapers from publishing information such as the details of celebrities' treatment for drug addiction. Andrew Caldecott QC, for Campbell, suggested to the House of Lords that the court of appeal viewed the model's attendance at Narcotic Anonymous through the eyes of newspaper readers when it ruled that the Daily Mirror was justified in publishing details of her treatment. \"A wider and more dynamic approach [to the law of confidence] is now required,\" said Mr Caldecott. Mr Justice Morland had adopted just such an approach when he originally awarded Campbell \u00a33,500 in damages for breach of confidence and under the Data Protection Act in March 2002, Mr Caldecott said. That judgment was overturned by the court of appeal in October 2002. \"It seems that part of the explanation is that the court of appeal looked at the Narcotics Anonymous treatments as a reader would look at them. There's definitely a flavour of looking at them from the readers' end of the telescope rather than Ms Campbell's,\" Mr Caldecott said. He argued that Narcotics Anonymous meetings should be considered in the same way as medical treatment and kept confidential. \"Probably three of the main ills of contemporary society are alcoholism, drug addiction and depression. Therapy is a very efficient way of treating them,\" he said. Ms Campbell's doctor supported her attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings, he added. Mr Caldecott said: \"One core element of most religious systems is the importance of the redemptive element. Ms Campbell had clearly failed in this area of her life. We say the law should be sensitive to someone who is trying to redeem the situation.\" Ms Campbell is not claiming in her appeal that the Mirror was wrong to report the fact that she had taken drugs, or that she was receiving treatment for drug addiction. However, she is contesting that the paper breached her confidence by publishing details of that treatment. Desmond Browne QC, for the Mirror, said his clients were not attempting to challenge the law of confidence insofar as it relates to health issues. Nor was it any part of the Mirror's case that non-medical complimentary therapy should be distinguished from medical treatment, he said. However, the Mirror did not consider that the fact Campbell was receiving treatment from Narcotics Anonymous could be equated with the publication of clinical details, Mr Brown said. Mr Caldecott described Mr Justice Morland, the judge who originally found in Ms Campbell's favour, as \"a very experienced trial judge\". He questioned whether it was right for the court of appeal to overturn the judge's ruling of March 27, 2002. Five law lords - Lords Nicholls, Hoffmann, Hope, Carswell and Lady Hale - must decide whether the Mirror's publication of details of Ms Campbell's treatment, and a photograph of her leaving a treatment session, constituted a breach of confidence and or an invasion of privacy. On October 14 2002, the court of appeal led by Lord Phillips, master of the rolls, said the extra detail of Campbell's treatment and the accompanying photographs were \"a legitimate, if not essential, part of the journalistic package designed to demonstrate that Ms Campbell had been deceiving the public when she said she did not take drugs\". Ms Campbell, who said she felt \"shocked, angry, betrayed and violated,\" by the Mirror's article of February 2001, described the court of appeal's decision as \"harsh\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
