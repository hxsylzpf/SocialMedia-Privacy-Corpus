  "content": "The publisher of the Times of India wants its journalists to convert their personal social media accounts into company ones and, in order to do so, has asked them to reveal their Facebook and Twitter passwords. Bennett Coleman &amp; Co (BCCL) \u2014 India's largest media conglomerate - was forced to amend its original demands after protests from journalists. It had told staff they must sign contracts agreeing that management could continue to post updates on their personal accounts even after they had left the company. It also prohibited staff from posting news links on their own accounts. According to BCCL memos leaked to Quartz India, these demands were amended when journalists \"sought further clarification\" after receiving the initial demands on 14 August. This resulted in BCCL executive Satyan Gajwani tweeting that \"major changes\" to its policy were being put in place. But the publisher maintains that all of its journalists must create company user accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Google+ and that their \"handles\" must include their own names suffixed with the brand they work for. The memo states: \"The company would prefer that users maintain a single account, to keep a genuine and honest approach to the consumer at large, and frankly, because it's easier to manage. But it's up to you to decide what you prefer. If you prefer to keep separate accounts, please inform your brand representative of your personal accounts' usernames. But it will be in YOUR interest to keep one user account.\" BCCL has stepped back, however, from demanding access to the passwords of personal accounts. Apart from the Times of India, the contracts affect staff on other BCCL titles, such as Economic Times, Navbharat Times and Mumbai Mirror. The memo does concede that matters may change due to the evolving nature of social media: \"As social media evolves, this policy too will evolve and basis feedback and interaction, we will continue to refine it.\" Sources: Quartz India: (1) and (2)",
