  "content": "A lonely penguin is hoping to find a mate through the social networking website MySpace. On her MySpace profile page, Roxy the rockhopper says she is looking for \"dating and serious relationships\" with \"a male rockhopper with good feathers\" who \"must be part of the European breeding programme\". Her interests are listed as \"hopping, diving, eating fish, pecking, sunbathing, swimming\" and her favourite films include Happy Feet and Chicken Run. Roxy, who has been living in London zoo for a year after moving from Whipsnade where she fell out with her fellow penguins, is one of a declining number of rockhoppers. The species, which is naturally found around the sub-Antarctic islands, is threatened by pollution and degradation of its habitat and is listed as vulnerable on the endangered creaturesred list of the International Union for Nature and Natural Resources. The penguins get their name from the hopping movement they use to move between rocks. Although Roxy shares an enclosure at London zoo with 31 South African black-footed penguins, she has yet to find a mate and the zoo is hoping to fix her up through the European breeding programme. A spokeswoman for the zoo said the Myspace profile was \"a bit of fun, but it's also about raising awareness of breeding and conservation programmes around the world\". Roxy's listing has so far attracted 10 friends, including a penguin from Antarctica, but the hunt for a new mate continues.",
