  "content": "The News of the World phone-hacking scandal is evidence that the Press Complaints Commission needs the power to fine errant newspapers, the chairman of the body which funds the watchdog has said. Lord Black, chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, told the Leveson inquiry on Wednesday that he was historically opposed to fines for newspapers. But he said the hacking affair convinced him that the PCC needed urgent reform and new powers. \"It took a scandal like that to show us we needed a new body to enforce the editors' code of practice,\" he added. \"I certainly now believe that some form of fining system would be appropriate ... It's [phone hacking] that has led me to a change of view ... That is the most obvious example of why urgent reform of the system is needed.\" Black gave evidence the day after the inquiry heard the new chairman of the PCC unveil his plans for a bolstered regulator. Lord Hunt, who took over as chairman of the PCC late last year, told the inquiry that a new press regulation body should have the power to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by newspapers, as well as the power to impose fines and sign binding contracts with publishers. Black, who is also an executive director of Telegraph Media Group, admitted he was \"surprised\" that the industry had formed a consensus around a reformed PCC with beefed-up powers. He added that some of the proposals could be \"potentially painful\" for the regional press. But he told the inquiry that the industry needs \"radical proposals\" for change to stave off the threat of statutory regulation. Asked by Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, whether the industry had coalesced around the proposals through a fear of something worse, Lord Black said: \"If there isn't change to the regulatory regime ... the threat of statute is there. [The appetite for change] is a combination of both of those.\" Lord Justice Leveson urged Black to solidify some of the ideas proposed by the commission, saying that \"time is of the essence\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
