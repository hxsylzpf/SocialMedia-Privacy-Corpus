  "content": "Ed Miliband is demanding that Lord Rothermere mount an inquiry into the practices and culture of his flagship newspapers, arguing that an apology made by the peer after a Mail on Sunday reporter intruded on a private Miliband family memorial service did not go far enough. Rothermere sent a private letter to Miliband on Thursday night in which he expressed regret at the episode \u2013 but rejected claims that the incident reflected a wider problem of culture and ethics at the Mail on Sunday and Daily Mail, which have been aggressively demonising the Labour leader over the past fortnight. Labour officials said the apology from Rothermere was \"an important step\", but noted that the letter made no reference to the controversial article published by the Daily Mail on Saturday in which the newspaper characterised Miliband's Marxist academic father, Ralph, as \"the man who hated Britain\". Stoking the row, a Labour spokesman said Miliband still believed the culture and practices of the two papers needed addressing and, until they were, \"many people will continue to believe that these newspapers are not upholding the values and decency of the British people\". Miliband had dragged Rothermere into the debate after the Labour leader wrote to the proprietor, suggesting that \"a common line of decency\" had been breached when the Mail on Sunday's reporter gatecrashed a memorial service for his uncle on Wednesday on the 29th floor of Guy's hospital in London. Earlier in the day, the Mail on Sunday's editor, Geordie Greig, who had been seen as a candidate to one day succeed Paul Dacre on the Daily Mail, had issued his own unreserved apology for the intrusion. Two journalists, Jo Knowsley and Amy Iggulden, are understood to have been suspended. But if Rothermere had granted the request for an inquiry, it would have amounted to a vote of no confidence in Dacre, the Daily Mail's long-serving editor, who is known for a tough and sometimes pugnacious approach. Dacre also acts as editor in chief at the two titles. Privately, reporters were astonished that Greig moved to blame his reporters so quickly and believe that part of the job of a highly paid editor is to \"take the flak for the team\" and deal with the matter behind closed doors. On Thursday night, Miliband gave an extensive interview to LabourList. He said: \"I want to know how these practices are allowed to happen. Not on the basis of being 'one rogue reporter' or 'one rogue editor', but what is it about the culture and practice of the organisation that makes these kind of things acceptable? \"Because the decisions made by an individual in an organisation are shaped by the culture and practice of an organisation.\" Earlier in the day, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, intervened to defend Miliband. \"It seems to me that if anyone excels in denigrating and often vilifying a lot about modern Britain, it's the Daily Mail,\" Clegg said. \"They don't like working mothers, they don't like the BBC, they don't like members of the royal family, they don't like teachers, they don't like the English football team \u2013 the list goes on.\" The circumstances leading up to Rothermere's letter are also thought to reflect tensions at the top of the newspaper group. It is understood that following Labour complaints on Wednesday night, Greig was full of remorse about the intrusion at the memorial service, saying he had not known about the actions of his reporters. Yet in a conversation with Miliband on Thursday morning, no apology was offered, and instead, as if he was reading from a legal letter, Greig instead justified the story, adding that the reporter had identified herself. Some Labour sources concluded that Dacre \u2013 whose relationship with Greig is often described as tense \u2013 had imposed a tougher line overnight but this has been strongly denied by the Daily Mail [see footnote]. Following the fruitless conversation with Greig, Miliband wrote directly to Rothermere setting out the episode at the memorial service. He published the letter just before 11.45am on Thursday. Within 90 minutes, Greig issued a full apology and promised an investigation, adding it had been a \"terrible lapse of judgment. I unreservedly apologise for a reporter intruding into a private memorial service for a relative of Ed Miliband,\" Greig said. \"The reporter was sent without my knowledge; it was a decision which was wrong. I would further like to apologise to members of the family and friends attending the service for this deplorable intrusion.\" The Mail on Sunday journalist arrived at the memorial service held at Guy's hospital for Miliband's uncle, Professor Harry Keen, a distinguished doctor who died this year. She is understood to have twice accosted distressed family members to ask them to comment on the Ralph Miliband controversy. They refused to do so. Labour sources said the memorial service was a private event and it is understood the reporter learned about it from a Facebook page. In his letter to Rothermere, who inherited the Mail titles in 1998, Miliband wrote: \"My wider family, who are not in public life, feel understandably appalled and shocked that this can have happened. Sending a reporter to my late uncle's memorial crosses a line of common decency.\" Labour officials were grateful for Greig's apology, but stressed Miliband in his letter had proposed that Rothermere conduct an investigation into \"who is responsible for the culture and practices of these newspapers which jar so badly with the values of your readers\". Some Labour officials believe the Mail titles operate under a bullying culture in which some reporters feel forced to put pursuit of a story before ethics. Labour also wants, if possible, to expose before the election any newspaper efforts to portray Miliband as somehow apart from mainstream British culture. Miliband declined to refer the matter to the Press Complaints Commission. Labour described it as a toothless tiger, not least because Dacre was chairman of the editor's code of practice committee, which sets standards for journalists. Last night the issue was discussed on BBC1's Question Time. The Huffington Post's Mehdi Hasan was applauded by the audience when he asked who hated Britain more: Ralph Miliband, who he noted served in the Royal Navy during the second world war, or the \"immigrant-bashing, woman-hating, Muslim-smearing, NHS-undermining, gay-bashing Daily Mail\". He also contrasted the newspaper's founder, Lord Rothermere, whom he accused of siding with the Nazis before the conflict, with Ralph Miliband. The Daily Mail columnist Quentin Letts attacked his sister paper for sending a journalist to the memorial service, calling it \"clearly indefensible\". But he was derided by the audience when he claimed the Mail was \"outside the political village\".The PCC's chairman, Lord Hunt, issued a statement saying he was deeply concerned by the episode. The PCC said there had been 726 complaints from the public about the Daily Mail's original article. The Conservative chairman of the culture select committee, John Whittingdale, also said the intrusion at the memorial service was a clear breach of the code. The dispute comes by coincidence days before a crucial meeting of the privy council, before which ministers will decide whether to accept a royal charter enshrining the press industry's version of self-regulation. The meeting could reject the industry's version and then seal the one proposed by parliament, an outcome most newspaper groups strongly oppose. It is generally agreed that the behaviour of the Mail on Sunday reporter would breach basic elements of press ethics code drawn up under either royal charter. Lord Justice Leveson, the judge who chaired the inquiry into press ethics, is also due to appear in front of two parliamentary select committees next week. Alastair Campbell, the former press secretary to Tony Blair, accused Dacre of being \"a bully and a coward\", adding: \"He hates anyone who gets in the way of his rather warped and twisted view of the world.\" If he had an ounce of decency, he said, Dacre would retire to his Scottish estate with his \u00a315m pension. An online petition had garnered more than 30,000 signatures calling on Dacre to defend the role of the Mail in the UK's national debate. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2013. The Daily Mail strongly denies that Greig's stance \"changed overnight under pressure from Dacre\".",
