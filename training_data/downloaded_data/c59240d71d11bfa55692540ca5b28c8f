  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission has criticised the Newcastle Evening Chronicle for failing to respect the confidentiality of a source. In its ruling, the PCC said the Chronicle committed an \"obvious and unnecessary breach of the [PCC] code\", having failed to adhere to a basic principle of journalism. The commission's ruling comes after a rare complaint under Clause 14 (confidential sources) of the code - which refers to journalists' \"moral obligation\" to protect confidential sources of information. A complaint came from a former employee of the Rural Payments Agency, a government body which had been criticised in the newspaper. The complainant had emailed the paper to share some of her own experiences at the agency. A reporter from the newspaper then forwarded the email, including the complainant's details, to the RPA for comment. The complainant argued that the code had therefore been breached as she had been identified to her former employer as a source of information. Accepting that this was a serious error, the Chronicle apologised. The reporter, who was a trainee, was formally disciplined and the paper offered to apologise again to the complainant, in a private letter or in print. But the complainant was not satisfied with the newspaper's attempts to resolve the matter, and also objected to the length of time the newspaper had taken to deal with her complaint. While it welcomed the Chronicle's apology, the PCC believes this was an \"obvious and unnecessary breach of the code\", as the newspaper had failed to adhere to a basic principle of journalism. The complaint was therefore upheld. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
