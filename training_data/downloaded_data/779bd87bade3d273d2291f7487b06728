  "content": "Hats off to the quick-thinking person who posted the above on UK Uncut's Facebook page, before dawn, following the screening of the London Olympics opening ceremony. I'm sure it will make Danny Boyle smile. And maybe this re-write of the song Danny Boy will also delight him. It's by those incorrigible kings of pastiche, the Corrigan Brothers, the Irish band that brought us There's no one as Irish as Barack Obama. Why not sing this aloud in your office now? Oh Danny Boyle your ceremony was awesome So rich, dynamic and alive To see James Bond call up to the Palace And take the Queen out for her first sky dive Olympic Rings forged magically before us Their angry sparkle lit the London Night As Mary Poppins clung to her umbrella Oh Danny Boyle, Oh Danny Boyle you got it right The belching chimneys of industrial history The celebration of the NHS Johnny Rotten singing with the Pistols The passion of the women's suffragettes A story told with poignancy and humour From printing press right up to internet So take a bow , deservedly it's due for Oh Danny Boyle, it was as good as it could get Sources: Facebook/Corrigan Brothers",
