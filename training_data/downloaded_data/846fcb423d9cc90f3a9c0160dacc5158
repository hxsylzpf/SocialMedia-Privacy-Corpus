Carphone Warehouse said names, addresses, date of birth information and bank details of 2.4 million customers \u2013 and 90,000 customer credit cards \u2013 \"may also have been accessed\" in an attack on Wednesday. Beyond brick and mortar stores selling mobile phones, plans and accessories the company also operates OneStopPhoneShop.co.uk, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk, while providing services to TalkTalk Mobile, Talk Mobile and its own recently launched iD mobile network An Ico spokesman said: \"We have been made aware of this incident at the Carphone Warehouse and are making enquiries.\" Carphone Warehouse informed Ico of the breach late last week and Scotland Yard on Sunday. The police said Sunday that it has yet to receive a formal report of a criminal offence, while the National Crime Agency would not confirm whether it was to open an investigation. Carphone Warehouse, now part of Dixons Carphone following last year's \u00a33.7bn merger, began alerting customers via email on Saturday and took down affected websites. Around 480,000 of the 2.4 million customers affected by the breach are TalkTalk Mobile customers and 1.9m were customers of Carphone Warehouse directly. Security experts are urging customers affected by the breach to change their passwords and make sure that they are not used for other services such as email addresses or online banking. \"Carphone Warehouse is said to be getting in touch with customers who need to notify their bank and credit card company, but don't be fooled by emails or phone calls pretending to be them,\" warned Tony Neate, chief executive of Government-backed web security initiative Get Safe Online. \"There will always be more cyber criminals looking to exploit the situation and trick you into sharing information a legitimate company would never ask for.\" An Ico spokesman added: \"Any time personal data is lost there can be a risk of identity theft. There are measures you can take to guard against identity theft, for instance being vigilant around items on your credit card statements or checking your credit ratings.\" \u2022 Harvest of Facebook user data prompts calls for tighter privacy settings \u2022 Seven things security experts do to keep safe online",
