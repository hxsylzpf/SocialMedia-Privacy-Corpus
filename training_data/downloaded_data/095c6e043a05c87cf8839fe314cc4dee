  "content": "A Remembrance Day service will be held on Twitter on Friday and Sunday, using 140 characters for readings, hymns, the last post, the names of those who gave their lives and contributions from veterans. The project, run by a group of Methodists, is aimed at bringing together traditional elements of prayer and worship with a digital approach for people who cannot attend a service or would not normally do so. It is thought to be the first time a remembrance service has been held on the micro-blogging site. James Thomas, who thought of Tweet Remembrance, said: \"I came up with the idea on Wednesday night. I wondered if there was going to be a two-minute silence on Twitter and then thought, why not have an entire service on there? \"It's a chance to engage with people who would otherwise not be, for whatever reason. Not everyone is able to go to a church and it's an alternative to watching it on television. It's also just to see if it works.\" The two services, which start at 10.15 and observe the silence at 11.11, are ecumenical and organisers say everyone is welcome to take part. Tweet Remembrance appears on Twitter as @Poppy_Tweet. Rev Joanne Cox is the Methodist minister providing the sermon.",
