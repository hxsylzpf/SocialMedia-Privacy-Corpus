  "content": "Lord Wakeham, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, today claimed the regulator had \"changed the entire culture of British newspapers and magazines\". In a report marking the body's 10th anniversary, Lord Wakeham said: \"Ten years ago, I doubt there were very many editors who stopped themselves to ask 'Can we get away with it?' - because they knew they could. \"Today, the application and observance of the code are very much a part of the culture of every newsroom and editorial office.\" The code of practice was tightened after the death of Princess Diana three-and-a- half years ago. Guidelines on long-lens photography banned the paparazzi from private property, including restaurants and churches. New controls on doorstepping were also introduced, stopping hordes of journalists (and particularly TV cameras) camping at private addresses in the hope of getting an interview. Lord Wakeham said in his report that \"huge advances\" had been made in the protection of privacy. He claimed the PCC had proved \"self regulation is a key manifestation of freedom of expression\" and put paid to clamours for statutory regulation of the press. He added: \"There are no serious commentators now who believe statutory controls are either desirable or practical.\" Lord Wakeham contrasted the perception of the press and regulation today with the controversial situation at the beginning of the 1990s. At that time, David Mellor claimed the popular press were \"drinking in the last chance saloon\". Mr Mellor, then the \"minister of fun\" at the Department of Heritage, made the remarks following a report in 1993 carried out by Sir David Calcutt. He threatened to introduce a statutory body if press self-regulation did not lead to a marked improvement in standards of accuracy and privacy. Lord Wakeham's remarks come the day before the PCC throws a party for newspaper executives and hundreds of celebrities the press has clashed with over the last 10 years. Prince William will be the star turn at the bash, accompanied by his father and Camilla Parker Bowles. It will be the young prince's first official engagement since he turned 18. At the party, he will be seen in the company of Mrs Parker Bowles in public for the first time - a measure of the power of the PCC.
