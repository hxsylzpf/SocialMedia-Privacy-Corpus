Confronting thousands of furious 1D fans, Townshend said that despite a broad resemblance between Best Song Ever and Baba O'Riley, the Who have no intention to pursue One Direction for plagiarism. \"I like the single [and] I like One Direction,\" Townshend said in yesterday's statement. \"The chords I used and the chords they used are the same three chords we've all been using in basic pop music since Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran and Chuck Berry made it clear that fancy chords don't mean great music \u2013 not always. [Even] I'm still writing songs that sound like Baba O'Riley \u2013 or I'm trying to!\" Townshend's comments followed a rumour circulating on social media \u2013 whose origin is unclear \u2013 that the Who were trying to \"delete\" Best Song Ever from either YouTube or singles chart consideration due to its similarities with their 1971 classic. Accordingly, #donttouchbestsongever began to trend worldwide on Twitter. \"Do you even known who you are messing with?\" wrote one fan. \"HOW DARE U ... I'LL KILL UR FIRST BORN,\" proposed another. At the end of June, One Direction obsessives managed to break the record for Vevo's most-watched video in a single day, absorbing Best Song Ever's Baba O'Riley-like intro more than 12.3m times. Reading on mobile? Watch the Who video here For his part, Townshend seems grateful for the attention. \"One Direction are in my business, with a million fans, and I'm happy to think they may have been influenced a little bit by the Who,\" he wrote. \"I'm just relieved they're all not wearing boiler suits and Doc Martens, or Union Jack jackets.\" Townshend also compared One Direction's (w)homage with a recent discussion with Randy Bachman, former frontman for the Guess Who. \"[Randy] told me that he not only copied Baba O'Riley for [Bachman-Turner Overdrive's] hit You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet, but he even called his band after us. Why would I not be happy about this kind of tribute?\" One Direction's third album is expected later this year.",
