  "content": "Lord Justice Leveson today said that he was not on a \"great witch-hunt\" against newspapers and journalism with his inquiry into phone hacking and media standards. Leveson made his remarks during the inquiry on Thursday, in an exchange with former Independent editor Ian Hargreaves, now a journalism professor at Cardiff University. Hargreaves told Leveson that a \"huge amount of reflection\" goes on among his students, about their future employment prospects and the ethical decisions they have to make. The judge said he felt it was important to send a message out to the industry because of the way the inquiry was \"being portrayed\". \"I am not on a great witch-hunt. I really am not. I am anxious to find out what has gone wrong in an industry in which there is an enormous amount that goes absolutely right. I can't emphasis that enough,\" said Leveson. He added that the tabloid press do \"an enormously valuable job\". \"We want to celebrate all that is good about every aspect about the print media,\" he said. \"I'm not seeking in any sense to beat down the mass market or tabloid press. They do an enormously valuable job. The problem is going to be to try and find a line and an approach so we can remove what some people consider to be a problem in our output.\" After being told that the ethics on so-called \"broadsheets\", \"red-top\" and \"mid-market\" papers were different, Leveson queried whether the process in news gathering was not the same across all national newspapers. Leveson made his interjection after Hargreaves, also a former director of BBC news and current affairs, had explained the dilemmas facing his students. He said about one ten journalism graduates have ended up on tabloid newspapers, but this was only about \"six newspapers in a world of proliferating media\". Hargreaves referred to the recent testimony of former Daily Star reporter Richard Peppiatt, who told Leveson his news editor was fully aware that a particular story was \"cock and bull\", and claimed the paper was \"not a truth-seeking enterprise\". He said he tells students faced with ethical dilemmas: \"If you are working in a place you regard as personally and morally unacceptable you are working in the wrong place for you, but try and get out on the right terms.\" Hargreaves, one of seven academics giving evidence at the inquiry on Thursday, added that \"a lot of journalists are very happy, it's a great job\". Hargreaves also told Leveson that the highly competitive nature of the national newspaper market, which other witnesses have suggested could be a cause of the much-criticised practices being scrutinised by the inquiry, was a positive thing for UK journalism. \"The pursuit of competitive position is a very important driving force, look at any market where you don't have that \u2013 you have pretty weedy journalism,\" he said. Leveson also heard from a former foreign correspondent and author that libel damages do not affect how newspapers behave. Brian Cathcart, professor of journalism at Kingston University and a founder of the Hacked Off group that campaigned for a public inquiry into illegal information-gathering by the press, told the hearing that damages payouts in libel cases were not enough to deter some newsroom cultures. He said the amount newspapers paid out to Bristol landlord Christopher Jefferies earlier this year for the libellous allegations made against him following the murder of Joanna Yeates should be considered in relation to the benefits the case brought to the papers. \"He sued eight newspapers \u2013 and you heard [from Jefferies] how he was monstered \u2013 and they paid, the legal gossip is, something less than \u00a3500,000 between them,\" Cathcart said. \"They had a field day with his life over a quiet week. On average it cost them \u00a320k a day \u2014 that's good business. It sounds like Chris Jefferies has had justice but it doesn't affect how newspapers are likely to proceed in the future.\" Cathcart, who has spent 30 years in journalism going from the Reuters news agency to Independent on Sunday deputy editor, said Kate and Gerry McCann had had a similar experience \"in slow motion\". \"Suing might get your headline, but it's not forcing the newspaper industry to change the way they behave in any way,\" he added. Julian Petley, a journalism professor at Brunel University, said \"tabloid shouldn't be a dirty word\", but added that editors of the so-called \"ethically minded papers\" should stop \"making common cause with the papers that brought this inquiry into being\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
