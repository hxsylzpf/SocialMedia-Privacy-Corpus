Initial investigations suggest that the hackers could have links with, or be based in, St Petersburg, Russia. Microsoft, already embroiled in a legal battle with the US government, said it is working with the FBI and law enforcement authorities to trace the source of \"a deplorable act of computer espionage\". Steve Ballmer, the chief executive, confirmed that hackers gained access to the source codes - which include the software for products such as the Windows operating system - but insisted they had not tampered with them. \"They did in fact access the source codes,\" Mr Ballmer said during a meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. \"You bet this is an issue of great importance. I can also assure you that we know that there has been no compromise of the integrity of the source codes, that it has not been tampered with in any way.\" The company said consumer, business and government computers running Microsoft software should be safe. \"We're still trying to figure out how it happened,\" another spokesman said. The break-in raises fears that companies may be facing greater threats from hackers with a commercial mission than those bound on merely committing mischief. The break-in also raises fears of a \"mole\" within Microsoft. Members of Microsoft's security team apparently found that passwords used to transfer the source code behind Microsoft's software were being sent from the company's computer network headquarters in Redmond, Washington state, to an email address in St Petersburg. The hackers are believed to have had access to the company's software codes for as long as three months.",
