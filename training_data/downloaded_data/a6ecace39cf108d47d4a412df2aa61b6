  "content": "The family of Jade Goody has won a \u00a335,000 payout from the People and photo agency Newspics, after taking out an invasion of privacy action over pictures published by the red-top of the former Big Brother star's burial. Trinity Mirror's Sunday title ran pictures of the private burial on its front page and in an eight-page pullout supplement called \"funeral tribute\" on 5 April. Atkins Thomson, the law firm representing Goody's family, today settled the privacy action against Mirror Group Newspapers, the Trinity Mirror subsidiary that publishes the People, and Newspics. In a consent order approved by the high court the two companies have agreed to pay Goody's family \u00a335,000 in damages as well as covering legal costs. It was not disclosed how the payout is split between the two companies. An agreement has also been put in place to guarantee that neither MGN nor Newspics will \"publish, republish, syndicate, use or disseminate any of the photographs of the private burial or any similar photographs in the future\". Shots used included an aerial photograph of the family gathered at the burial. MGN has also written to the family accepting that \"they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of such photographs and apologised for the distress caused\". Atkins Thomson said that all other newspapers respected the request not to publish images of the actual burial \u2013 made specifically by agents representing Goody. \"Jade Goody's close family, her mother Jackiey Budden, her grandparents John and Sylvia Caddock, her aunt and uncle Angela and Trevor Cox, and her cousins Lee and Danny Andrews, have today settled their privacy action against MGN Limited and the photo agency Newspics Limited in respect of photographs that were taken of the private burial of Jade on 4th April,\" said a statement from law firm Atkins Thomson. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
