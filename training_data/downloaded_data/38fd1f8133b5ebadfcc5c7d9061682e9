  "content": "David Beckham has won a victory against intrustion into his private life after a London-based picture agency agreed to pay substantial damages for taking photographs of him on a hotel balcony in his underpants. Big Pictures agreed to pay out after one of its photographers snapped the England captain last week in strict violation of Press Complaints Commission guidelines that ban photographing celebrities on private property. Beckham was outraged when the pictures were splashed across the front pages of the Sun and the Star. The FA, which excluded photographers from both papers from a pre-match press conference on Friday, has written to the papers demanding similar damages and printed apologies. It has also written to celebrity magazines Heat and Closer warning them not to use the pictures in this week's editions and warned newspapers that the players' wives and girlfriends are also off limits. \"We've sent out a clear message that we will not tolerate this sort of action. Paragraph three of the PCC guidelines clearly states that pictures should not be taken when the subject has a reasonable expectation of privacy,\" said an FA spokesman. While the Sun and the Star have yet to reply to the FA, the spokesman said the association was in discussions with both papers. \"We are in talks about securing and apology and an acceptance they made a mistake,\" he said. If the Sun and Star do not reply then the FA could report them to the PCC. However, sources in the England camp said such a move was unlikely during Euro 2004. \"It's unimaginable that the FA will want to engage in a civil war with the press while England are still in the championships,\" he said. The pictures of Beckham in his underpants were taken by a paparazzo on a road near the England team hotel. Because there is a 500m exclusion zone around the hotel and a further 500m zone patrolled by police the photographer is thought to have used a 600mm lens with a doubler to further increase its range. The PCC bans the use of such snaps. It was under these rules that Radio 1 DJ Sara Cox sued the People after it published eight pictures of her and her husband sunbathing naked on a private beach on their honeymoon in October 2001. Cox sued under article eight of the Human Rights Act and picked up \u00a330,000 in damages without the case reaching court. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
