  "content": "Q: What do Cyberspace and Cranford have in common? A: Both are places capable of being driven wild by rumour. Viewers of the landmark BBC1 series will recall how the most trivial aside could instantly be transformed into an incontrovertible fact. When it was rumoured that the railway would be coming to Cranford, for example, Eileen Atkins exclaimed with horror that this meant that the Irish were coming, and promptly expired at the prospect. I was reminded of this while listening to the chatter of the blogosphere on Thursday night. The context is obsessive interest in the aftermath of Microsoft's abortive bid for Yahoo!. What will happen next? The excitement is understandable because there's a lot going on. Carl Icahn, a legendary troublemaker for corporate boards, has been buying shares in Yahoo! and preparing to replace the company's board with his own stooges - who would presumably negotiate a deal with Microsoft. Yahoo! and Google have been talking about extending the experiment whereby Google did some of Yahoo!'s searching for it. And so on. It's difficult to be sure what triggered Thursday's hysteria but my money is on a report by a former Microsoftie, John Furrier, who claimed on his blog: 'The Yahoo! and Microsoft teams are bunkered down in a Palo Alto hotel hammering out the final stages of a transaction that will have Microsoft picking up the Yahoo! search business. Word is that this deal will be done this week. While this is not surprising, it does bring to question the motives and plans of Microsoft.' Actually, it made this columnist question the sanity of Microsoft bosses. Why would they enter into such a complex transaction just for a bit of a company that they hitherto wished to swallow whole? But since Microsoft is the Darth Vader of the computing business, the default assumption is that it must be Up To Something. Mr Furrier, for one, was in no doubt. 'Microsoft's intentions are clear,' he declared. 'Buy the search business from Yahoo! and take that team and go spend at least $20bn for Facebook. Integrating the search team at Yahoo! with Facebook [creates] a formidable army to take on Google. What a move ... Yahoo! gets everyone off their back, Microsoft gets a credible position in search and buys Facebook to compete with Google. The price: about $45bn.' Hang on. I know Microsoft has had a 5 per cent stake in Facebook for a while, but this is what philosophers call a speculative leap. No matter. Where Microsoft is concerned, conspiracy theories run deep. Robert Scoble, a prominent (and excitable) blogger, immediately made the heroic leap. Microsoft's cunning strategy, he reasoned, would explain why Facebook continues to exclude Google's search engine from trawling its pages. 'These two moves,' he writes, 'would change everything and explain why Facebook is working overtime to keep Google from importing anything.' Having made the speculative leap, Mr Scoble then goes straight to a spot of extravagant extrapolation. 'This is a fight for the web,' he burbles. 'We all just crawled inside a box that locks Google out ... This has created huge value for Microsoft and has handed Steve Ballmer an internet strategy which brings Microsoft from last place to first in less than a week. Boom! Now Microsoft/Yahoo! search will have access to huge swaths of internet info that Google will not.' What's interesting is the speed with which a house of cards can be assembled on the basis of a rumour of talks between two companies. One can perhaps forgive Mr Scoble because he usually writes while on the move and is a valuable guide to Silicon Valley goings-on, but what are we to make of the more august commentators of Harvard Business Publishing, who purport to offer a more elevated view? Here is a post by one of their contributors, Umair Haque, under the headline 'The Microsoft vs Google endgame'. 'Today,' he writes, 'something really interesting happened. Both Google and Microsoft are poised to make dramatic strategic moves. But the moves are polar opposites. According to a rumour, Microsoft is to acquire Yahoo!'s search business as well as Facebook, and lock both down, to better take on Google. And Google is letting third parties access one of its most valuable assets: its ad network. 'So what's really going on here? Microsoft is poised to shift from open to closed. Google is making exactly the opposite move: shifting from closed to open.' Profound, eh? Give me the hysterical ladies of Cranford any day.",
