When kids join Club Penguin, they adopt an animated penguin as their online alter ego, or avatar. The penguins can chat or play games with one another or collect coins to buy trinkets at in-world shops. Although it's been around for less than two years, Club Penguin has become enormously popular. The site attracts nearly 5 million visitors a month and 700,000 kids have become paying members. A subscription - $57.95 (\u00a328) for 12 months - provides an array of benefits, such as the ability to customise the appearance of your penguin, decorate your penguin's igloo and be the first to enter new areas within the site. Compared to Club Penguin, Second Life - the much-hyped virtual world aimed at adults - is something of a ghost town. It has managed to attract only about 95,000 paid subscribers so far, a fraction of Club Penguin's. In fact, all of the most popular virtual worlds are geared to kids and teenagers. The venerable Habbo Hotel, originally launched in Finland in 2000, attracts 7 million visitors a month, Sweden's Stardoll attracts 5 million, Webkinz and Neopets attract around 4 million each, and Gaia Online reports nearly 3 million monthly visitors. Such high and rapidly growing traffic levels are spurring big investments in kid worlds from venture capitalists, and they're the reason that Disney is happily doling out hundreds of millions of dollars to the three Canadian men who created Club Penguin. \"Kids are starting to go to the internet first,\" explained the company's CEO, Robert Iger, announcing the deal. \"So it is important for us to operate in that space.\" Clearly, there are big commercial rewards to be had by enticing children to spend a lot of time exploring virtual worlds. What's less clear, though, is the long-term effect on the kids themselves. In one sense, the virtual worlds are simply the latest versions of the make-believe games that children have always played, with online avatars taking the place of dolls and action figures. Some experts argue that hanging out online is just another benign form of play, and a few suggest that it may actually help speed the socialisation process through which children learn to interact with others. They point out, as well, that virtual play helps youngsters become skilled users of computers and the internet. But there are reasons for concern. The hours that kids spend in front of computer screens, moving and conversing through keystrokes and mouse clicks, are hours they don't spend engaged with the physical world, talking and playing with real people and real things. Some authorities in child development wonder how effectively socialisation can occur when a child is sitting alone in front of a monitor. \"If kids are involved with things that keep them from playing with other kids, or keep them from being involved with physical activity, then it's too much,\" Richard Gallagher, a child psychologist at New York University, recently told a reporter from Newsday. He worries, in particular, that the meticulously designed and programmed virtual worlds will rob children of the imagination required to engage in unstructured, open-ended play with their friends. He also warns that the intent of the commercial sites is less about socialisation and more about turning \"younger and younger kids [into] consumers and the targets of advertising\". The fact is that even as it's becoming routine for children to spend hours in virtual worlds every day, we don't yet know whether it will help or hinder them in becoming happy, productive adults. With Club Penguin and its like, we're undertaking a massive experiment in child development, and it will be a long time before we learn the results. \u00b7 Nicholas Carr's next book will be The Big Switch.
