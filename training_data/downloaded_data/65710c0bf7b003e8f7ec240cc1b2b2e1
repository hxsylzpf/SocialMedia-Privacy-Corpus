  "content": "The Twitterati have been busy parsing the new coalition government's first press conference, held in the sunlit garden of Downing Street. Of course, there is the substance of the coalition deal to discuss, but first impressions matter \u2013 and much of the comment so far has been on the body language, tone and, yes, even the gags of the Cameron-Clegg show. But the big question is who does this new double act remind you of? Here are a few of the Tweets: @ jameskirkup: Oh god. The country is now being run by two characters from a Richard Curtis film. @ CharlieBeckett: Christ - they are turning into Morecambe and Wise. Or is it Ant and Dec. Or Alias Smith and Jones? @ j_freedland: What is it that this double act reminds me of? Fry and Laurie? Jeeves and Wooster? @ martinkettle: This press conference is almost as skittish as Charles and Di together before they got married @ krishgm: Or was it Keith Harris and Orville? But who do you think are the antecedents of this new duo on the stage of British political theatre?",
