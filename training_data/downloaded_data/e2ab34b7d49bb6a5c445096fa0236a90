  "content": "Brad Greenspan, the man behind MySpace.com, has labelled News Corporation's acquisition of the social networking website as \"one of the largest mergers and acquisitions scandals in US history\". Mr Greenspan, who made $47m out of the sale in 2005, is calling for a federal investigation, alleging that shareholders were \"bilked\" out of tens of billions of dollars. The nub of the allegations are that the $580m News Corp paid for MySpace.com was extremely cheap and that executives involved in the deal knew the site could be worth as much as $20bn within a few years. Mr Greenspan, who was chairman and chief executive of MySpace.com's original parent company, Intermix Media, before being ousted in 2003, has published his grievances online in a document called The MySpace Report. \"For the first time the public can read what took place behind the scenes and how shareholders were blatantly misled into voting for a quick and unfair sale to News Corp,\" he said in a statement on freemyspace.com. \"Deliberate steps were taken to withhold and manipulate information; money was improperly gained and laws were broken. I expect as the authorities get their arms around what happened that this transaction will be unwound and MySpace will be independent.\" He is calling for an investigation by the securities and exchange commission, the US justice department and the senate committee on finance into the deal. Mr Greenspan has levelled allegations of insider trading and options manipulation, where he quotes email exchanges that purport to show how Intermix engineered a quick, cheap sale to News Corp. He claims that Intermix's executives failed to tell shareholders how MySpace's ad impressions and revenue were climbing, growing 35% month on month. He also claims they didn't seek a fresh valuation - analysts are now saying the social networking website's tremendous growth mean it could be worth $15bn-$20bn in just a few years - to reflect this double-digit growth. In February, Mr Greenspan filed a lawsuit against Intermix and venturer capitalist firm VantagePoint Venture Partners in Los Angeles county superior court. The complaint claims that News Corp acquired Intermix as the result of an unfair process and at an unfair price that did not reflect its growth and prospects. \"It's unfortunate that Mr Greenspan continues to issue press releases complaining about a deal that many industry experts initially believed was a risk for News Corp to take,\" Julie Henderson, a spokeswoman for Fox Interactive Media, News Corp's digital arm, told the LA Times. \"We've strategically built this business since the acquisition and are just now beginning to realise real financial value. This is simply a case of sour grapes making for loud complaints.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
