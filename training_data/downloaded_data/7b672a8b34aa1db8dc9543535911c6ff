  "content": "UK consumers lost more money to online fraud than those of any other country in the world in 2012 - overtaking the US to move into first place - according to cyber security experts RSA. Figures from its Anti-Fraud Command Centre (AFCC) give UK losses of \u00a3405.8m in 2012, obtained from almost 250,000 phishing attacks. This marked a 25% increase on 2011, while US losses declined by 19%. Canadians lost the third highest amount, while India was in fourth place, up from 8th. South Africa completes the top five - it is worth noting that all of these countries have a significant English speaking population. Separate analysis by Detica - BAE Systems' data intelligence subsidiary - and the Cabinet Office estimates that the UK loses an annual total of \u00a327bn to cybercrime - of which \u00a321bn is from businesses - based on the most likely case. Detica also provides estimates of the costs of cybercrime to consumers, based on data from CIFAS, the UK's Fraud Prevention Service. Its total figure of \u00a33.1bn has a broader scope than that of RSA, as it includes sources such as identity theft in addition to phishing attacks. \u00a330m of the total is ascribed to 'scareware' and fake antivirus packages - both of which rely on shock tactics to convince consumers to buy unnecessary software. Estimates of the cost of cybercrime are notorious for exaggeration and poor sourcing, but the figures presented here can be viewed with more trust than most. RSA's figures are based on attacks detected and dealt with by its AFCC and are calculated using a value of $300 per attack - the average from over 500,000 incidents tackled in the AFCC's eight years of operation. Detica's totals are aggregations based on separate analysis of 25 industrial sectors and follow consultation with five British government agencies including the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the Police Central E-crime Unit. UK cardholders are better protected than their cross-atlantic counterparts as a result of the wider adoption of chip-and-pin technology and other forms of two factor authentication (2FA). 2FA - or multi-factor authentication - is the process by which an individual is required to provide knowledge (such as a PIN), possession (such as a card) and, increasingly, some inherent information (such as a fingerprint), in order to complete a transaction. Despite this, Limor Kessem, Technical Lead of Knowledge Delivery at RSA, believes they are targeted for a number of reasons. \"It's just worth it. Most fraudsters are from countries where the currency is way, way lower\", she said. \"The problem with the UK is that more people use the internet, more people have technology.\" 84.7% of the UK public have used the internet at least once, according to the latest statistics on internet penetration in the UK, released last week by the Office for National Statistics. In the US this figure is just 77.9%, and the UK leads the world for mobile internet access, where an increasing proportion of malware is being targeted. Online fraudsters also often require access to 'insiders', residents in the country of their target who can physically impersonate them if attendance at a bank is required as part of the process of a crime. \"It's partly because of the accent. You have to sound like a local if you really want to make sure the transaction goes through\", said Kessem. Among the methods an insider might use to be able to carry out in-branch impersonation are distraction theft - simply stealing a card at an ATM - or tricking someone into revealing their card and PIN by posing as a telephone salesperson, both of which were highlighted in a 2012 UK Cards Association report on payment fraud.
