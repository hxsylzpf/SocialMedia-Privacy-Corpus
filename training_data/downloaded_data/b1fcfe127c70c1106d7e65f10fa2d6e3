  "content": "St Andrews University today categorically rejected the claim by Ardent Productions that its film crew had been given permission to film at the campus. The university also said the television crew lied about what it was filming. When members of the team were approached by university staff, who were suspicious they were \"stalking\" Prince William, the film-makers claimed they were shooting a documentary about tourism. In a statement released at 11am, Prince Edward's company insisted its crew was not spying on the young prince. \"At no time did Ardent attempt to film Prince William and the TV crew's presence at St Andrews had been cleared by the university press office,\" said the company's chairman, Malcolm Cockren. But the university spokesman, Niall Scott, said: \"We did not invite Ardent to film beyond Sunday. To suggest it was encouraged to stay on is categorically not true.\" Representatives of the media had been documenting the 19-year-old prince's first week at university. The two-man Ardent film crew, along with all the other journalists, were asked to leave St Andrews on Sunday. However, at noon yesterday the duo was spotted outside university buildings on North Street. When approached they refused to move. Mr Scott said: \"They made contact with our office on Monday to ask whether they could film. They were told they could not and that was the last we heard of them - until midday yesterday. \"We made a gentle approach. Our stance is to give people a choice and to ask them if they would like to observe the agreement that had been made. \"The media has readily subscribed to the agreement and we warned them they were putting themselves in a position where they would be cast as the villains of the piece. \"They made it quite clear they weren't going to stop. They basically said, 'You can't stop us'. \"When we asked who they were, they wouldn't give their names. They told us they were making a film about tourism and they were filming the golf course and historic buildings,\" Mr Scott added. The pair's reluctance to identify themselves prompted Mr Scott to ask them who had commissioned their film. \"They refused to say but they assured us whoever had commissioned them would get in touch,\" he said. \"Some hours later, a gentleman arrived from Ardent. He was very upfront and told us who they were. But they were still filming at 5.30pm yesterday,\" Mr Scott explained. The conflicting stories will fuel the row between Prince Edward and Prince Charles and could spell the end of Ardent Productions. Prince Edward founded the company in 1993 and boldly claimed it would become an industry leader within seven years. However, Ardent has been accused of trading on its royal connections. The film crew in Scotland was working on a documentary called The A-Z of Royalty, which has been sold to the E! Entertainment Network in the US.",
