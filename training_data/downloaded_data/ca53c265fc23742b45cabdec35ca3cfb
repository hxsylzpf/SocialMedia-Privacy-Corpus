  "content": "Here's one message the Press Complaints Commission didn't send to editors. \"Mr and Mrs Thomas Cruise of Los Angeles, New York and Iceland have asked us to ask you to respect their privacy at a difficult time in their married lives. They ask that there shall be no pictures taken of their six-year-old daughter Suri, no speculation about their religious beliefs and no unfounded analysis of their marital difficulties (if any); and no bad jokes. The PCC is happy to pass on their concerns.\" Now, scanning the PCC's code on privacy, harassment and the pursuit of kids, you may wonder why no such request was made or transmitted. Surely we must expect nothing less \u2013 and frown at flagrant transgressions by the Guardian, Times and Telegraph, as well as all the usual suspects? TMZ, Hollywood's most proactive celebrity website, broke the news. It was followed up instantly by American TV, American papers (including the saintly New York Times) and countless other internet outlets \u2013 a great tide of reporting and speculation gone global in seconds. And, crucially, it broke no privacy laws \u2013 because the US doesn't apply them to public figures, broadly defined \u2013 nor any industry codes of conduct, because the US doesn't have them. Privacy, in short, is a European sort of thing. So are superintending bodies in PCC vein. Can you have privacy in one continent, let alone one country, these days? We used to call that the Tiger Woods question; but now, renamed, it's the Suri Cruise dilemma.",
