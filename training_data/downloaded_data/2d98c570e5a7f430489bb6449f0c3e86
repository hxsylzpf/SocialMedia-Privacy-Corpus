  "content": "Evan Spiegel is not a happy man. Snapchat's chief executive is furious, in fact, after some previously-unreported acquisitions and future business plans were splashed all over the tech blogosphere this week, after being leaked as part of the Sony Pictures hack. In an internal memo, Spiegel gave his response to the stories, and later tweeted a screenshot of the memo out for wider airing: \"I've been feeling a lot of things since our business plans were made public last night. Definitely angry. Definitely devastated. I felt like I was going to cry all morning, so I went on a walk and thought through a couple of things. I even ran into one of my high school design teachers. She gave me a huge hug. I really needed it.\" Much of the memo was about the importance of secrecy for a startup like Snapchat, with Spiegel going on to say he felt that the company had been \"violated and exposed\" by the reports based on the Sony leaks. The memo was also an instructive insight into how he views the media: \"It's not fair that the people who try to build us up and break us down get a glimpse of who we really are,\" wrote Spiegel. So, is it? There's a view that writing articles based on leaked Sony emails is not that different from writing articles based on hacked voicemails \u2013 see Brad Pitt's arguments on that. There's another view that once documents are in the public domain \u2013 in this case, the hackers have placed them there \u2013 they are fair game for reporting. TechCrunch journalist Josh Constine argued in favour of this: It's about ethics in technology journalism! So what do you think: should private emails released as part of a hack attack be fair game for technology reporters \u2013 or, indeed, reporters in any industry? The comments section is open for your views. What else is worth discussing in the technology world today? Some more links to chew on: No offline viewing for Netflix Sorry, folks: you won't be watching House of Cards without a decent Wi-Fi connection any time soon. Netflix's Cliff Edwards told TechRadar that offline downloads are a \"short term fix for a bigger problem\" of constant, reliable broadband connectivity. I'd be interested to know whether licensing restrictions are a factor here too. Reddit bans users for sharing Sony leaks Reddit has banned a number of accounts, and closed one subreddit, for sharing information released as part of the Sony Pictures leaks. \"So one has to wonder: where was that rule when Reddit users were posting nude photographs stolen from celebrities' smartphones without repercussions?\" asks PandoDaily. BuzzFeed boss talks technology The Verge has a really interesting interview with BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti about how his company has evolved: from blending content and technology, to the role played by standalone mobile apps, to whether the company is increasingly competing with Facebook, not just using it to get stories out. Apple makes VAT changes for apps in Europe From January, VAT will be charged on iOS apps according to rates in each individual European country, rather than the same flate rate across the continent. Which, at least, means that next time a British chancellor changes the VAT rate, we get to describe it as a \"Candy Crush tax\". Possibly. What else?
