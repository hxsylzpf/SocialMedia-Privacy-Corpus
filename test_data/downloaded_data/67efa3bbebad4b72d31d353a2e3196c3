  "content": "The fragile system of press self-regulation was presented with the biggest test of its chequered history yesterday when MPs laid down a challenging case for fundamental reform. In a report that was unexpectedly conciliatory in tone, but potentially explosive in effect, the Commons media select committee called on the government to review the case for a thought-out privacy law before judges made it up \"on the hoof\". Gerald Kaufman, the committee chairman, declared his support for the principle of self-regulation, but said the press complaints commission needed to \"smarten up\". The committee's report called for a system of fines for errant publications, recommended front-page retractions and said repeatedly that recalcitrant editors who sit on the PCC should face a \"three strikes and you're out\" sanction. It said a privacy law was required, as well as the self-regulatory process, to address the complications raised by the Human Rights Act: unless parliament acted, more cases such as that brought by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas against Hello! magazine would lead to a de facto privacy code. As expected, the government reiterated its opposition to a privacy law, but said there was \"room for improvement\" in the PCC's work. Piers Morgan, editor of the Mirror, had characterised his appearance before the committee earlier this year as a \"ritual bollocking\". But for the most part yesterday, editors decided to digest the MPs' conclusions in private. Besides the privacy law proposal, the most contentious item was the plan for a system of fines. The committee said complainants needed to feel serious breaches would be punished, and recommended a series of fixed penalties. Adjudications against editors should be published in more prominent positions, it said, and all should be trailed in summary on the front page. The MPs printed a league table of worst-offending papers between 1991, when the PCC was formed, and 2000: the Sun had most complaints upheld, followed by the News of the World and Mail on Sunday. The Guardian was bottom. While the text of the report was reticent, individuals on the committee were more outspoken at the launch of the report to the media yesterday. Chris Bryant said the PCC had shown itself to be \"tooth less\", and had been \"mealy-mouthed\" in response to the News of the World's involvement in the failed case against five men accused of plotting to kidnap Victoria Beckham. Derek Wyatt appeared to suggest that rule-breaking newspapers should be prevented from publishing for a day. But he was quickly slapped down by his committee colleagues. The government will consider the report before issuing a formal response. Tessa Jowell, culture secretary, said: \"The government continues to believe self-regulation is the best regulatory system. That does not mean there is no room for improvement.\" Sir Christopher Meyer, chairman of the PCC, conceded the body was not perfect, but said it worked better than any alternative.",
