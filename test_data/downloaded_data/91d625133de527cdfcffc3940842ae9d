  "content": "Members of the US Olympics team have used Twitter to protest against airtight rules against unofficial sponsors and ambush marketers in the London Games. Athletes posted tweets in what appeared to be a co-ordinated move using the hashtags #Rule40 and #wedemandchange. They were protesting against the restrictions imposed by the International Olympic Committee's Rule 40, which prevents athletes promoting non-Olympic sponsors. Rule 40 was born from a long-standing guideline meant to ensure that athletes were clearly identified as amateurs; however, as the years went on, those amateur athletes became professionals, and the price tag for the Olympics grew higher. Athletes say this rule is out of date, and some, like Sanya Richards-Ross, a track athlete sponsored by Nike, go further by saying athletes should be compensated for their time in London. \"I just believe that the Olympic ideal and the Olympic reality are now different,\" said Richards-Ross in a news conference Monday. \"I've been very fortunate to do very well around the Olympics, but so many of my peers struggle in the sport, and I think it's unjust that they're not being considered, that athletes are not part of the conversation.\" Organizers say representing non-partners \"undermines the exclusivity that organising committees and/or [national Olympics committees] can offer official Games and team sponsors, without whose investment the Games could not happen.\" After all, sponsors like Adidas contribute handsomely to help pay down the $17.25bn it's going to cost London. Nick Symmonds, a middle distance track runner with Team USA, was one of those who joined the protest. Symmonds, who counts rival Nike among his sponsors, feels frozen out. \"These sponsors have done absolutely nothing to help me be the athlete I am today,\" Symmonds told the Guardian on Tuesday. \"For years my sponsors \u2026 have helped me train and compete and now they are made to feel unwelcome. This is not right.\" Nike, for its part, made headlines last week with a YouTube video as a tongue-in-cheek jab at the exclusive rights to London 2012. The video showed unknown athletes competing in lesser-known locales: London, Ohio, and Little London, Jamaica, to be exact: For Symmonds, \"literally hundreds of thousands of dollars\" in coaches, equipment and travel over the years were covered by sponsors, so not being able to tweet a picture of his Nike spikes means the rules are going a bit too far. \"It very clearly violates the rights of the athletes.\" Tell us: Should athletes be compensated for their time at the Olympics? Here are a few thoughts so far: . . . Leave yours in the comments below or by tweeting to @GuardianUS.",
