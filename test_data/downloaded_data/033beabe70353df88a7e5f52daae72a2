Former Daily Record editor Peter Cox claimed last month he had been chosen to conduct the first major interview with the prince, to be pooled among Scottish newspapers. However, Cox is now out of a job and the interview, accompanied by photographs of Prince William practising his golf swing and kicking a rugby ball around on a beach, went instead to PA's Peter Archer to be pooled among all newspapers. Prince William agreed to give the interview largely to thank the Scottish media for allowing him to pursue his studies at St Andrews University without unwarranted press intrusion. \"I'm able to lead a near normal life because of a combination of reasons,\" said the prince. \"The media have been very good considering, I'm sure, how tantalising it is having me up here, and the people of St Andrews and the students themselves have been so supportive. So, basically, I feel very comfortable.\" However, he expressed fears that after he leaves the Fife coastal town reporters will arrive in search of stories. \"I'm slightly concerned that when I leave here the media could have a tendency to look into what I've done,\" he said. \"I'm just hoping they won't go round trying to do that. If they do, I think the people of St Andrews will be my greatest allies.\" The prince also talked to Archer about his love for Africa, his preference for cider over beer and he confirmed press reports at the time that suggested he was unhappy in his first year at university. However, he shied away from discussing his future plans or his social life. Lord Wakeham, the former chairman of the press complaints commission, was responsible for negotiating a deal between St James's Palace and the press, who agreed to leave the prince alone while was is in full time education in return for occasional access. Guy Black, the director of the PCC, and his predecessor Mark Bolland, who went on to become Prince Charles' deputy private secretary, have devoted considerable time and effort to supporting this agreement. However, some editors have recently complained the palace had not kept its side of the bargain. Giving evidence to the recent parliamentary inquiry into privacy and media intrusion, the News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, complained the palace had provided very little material, particularly to the Sunday papers. His remarks, made in March, came immediately after the News of the World published pictures of the prince dressed in jeans and a baseball cap and carrying shopping bags through the streets of St Andrews. Earlier this month three newspapers, including the Mail on Sunday and the News of the World, published paparazzi shots of the prince having his feet massaged by a female friend at a rugby tournament. The pictures prompted a complaint from Prince Charles's private press secretary, Sir Michael Peat. \"I'm concerned that, if a paparazzi market for photographs and stories of William at St Andrews is encouraged, the resulting fear of constant press intrusion will seriously affect the way in which Prince William is able to live and study at university,\" said Sir Michael in a statement to PA. Bruce Waddell, previously the editor of the Scottish Sun, replaced Cox as the editor of the Daily Record after St James's Palace made it clear he had not been selected to interview Prince William, even though he had boasted about the scoop in public.",
