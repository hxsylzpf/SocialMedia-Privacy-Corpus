  "content": "Just a few short years ago, the three fundamental types of media \u2013 paid (advertising), earned (social and PR) and owned (content) \u2013 coexisted peacefully. Each stayed, so to speak, in its own room. More recently in the house of marketing, the walls are falling and media types are converging. What type of media are Facebook and Twitter: paid, owned or earned? The answer, of course, is a resounding \"yes, all of the above\". This holds true for other new forms of media as well. \u2022 Native advertising? Paid + owned \u2022 A promoted tweet or Facebook post? Earned + paid \u2022 Engaging an influencer to blog on behalf of your brand, then promote that post on social media? Paid + earned + owned Paid, owned, and earned media? It's all just media. Ads, blog posts, social interactions \u2013 either they are fun or interesting (or entertaining, or engaging, or helpful, etc), or they are not, determining the level of consumer interest and engagement. And either the brand behind these multiple forms of media is recognisable to consumers as they flit from screen to screen, channel to channel and device to device, or it is not. With no consistency of voice and tone, or look and feel, a brand will rapidly lose its identity and meaning in a converged, multi-screen, multimedia landscape. At the core of converged media \u2013 of all media \u2013 is content. Content is the atomic particle of all digital marketing. Everything. There is no owned media without content. There is no social media without content. And there is no paid media without content. And there is certainly no media-media, as in actual digital publications, without content. When you search, you are searching for content. Even email marketing, once the darling of the digital arsenal but now relegated to wallpaper status (yet still critically important) is a container for \u2026 you guessed it: content. This essential and central role is why the term \"content marketing\" has risen to the fore in recent years. It is not only the nucleus of all media, but the content marketing part is what, in sophisticated marketing organisations, increasingly dominates media and marketing in the converged media environment. Advertising used to dominate messaging because it dominated spend. Paid media is expensive. Now, our research indicates that marketers are floating owned media \u2013 content \u2013 into a variety of channels. They iterate, optimise, and wait to see what resonates in social and other earned channels. Only then do they invest in paid media, using content (ie. creative) derived from this process. The process is not linear but cyclical, one of constant measurement and optimisation. This newly converged media workflow has caused companies to re-examine hierarchies between marketing types, and then erase them. Intel blended their various media teams into a single operation. \"Why does this make sense?,\" asked the company's former vice president of marketing strategy. \"We were having similar conversations across teams. The role of communities is not exclusive to the social space. Our paid media partners are looking for ways to drive engagement and conversation in ways previously unheard of. Our social partners are open in an exciting way to new product ideas and testing. The idea of 'test and learn' has never been so real.\" A solid content strategy is essential and central to all media initiatives: paid, owned and earned. Without content, brands cannot achieve earned media at scale. Earned media amplifies messaging, builds word of mouth and buzz, spreads awareness, and with increasing frequency produces ideas that become the core of creative advertising strategy.
