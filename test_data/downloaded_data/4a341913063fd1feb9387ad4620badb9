Two marches, one from Kennington Park, south London, and another from Caledonian Road, north London, made their way through the centre of the city chanting 'stop the knives, save lives' as onlookers applauded. Relatives of Damilola Taylor, killed in 2000, and Ben Kinsella, stabbed to death this year, took part in 'The People's March' started on Facebook by two London women. A video message from the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, was met with jeers and shouts of 'Off!' Brown told the marchers that the current penalties for using a weapon sent a message 'to every young person carrying a knife that there would be no excuses and no exceptions'. Barry Mizzen, father of Jimmy, 16, who was stabbed earlier this year at a south London bakery, said: 'I'm encouraged by the fact there are so many people here raising awareness of the issue.' On the eve of the march, a man named locally as Lucan Gordon, 23, was stabbed to death outside the Brixton Sports and Social Club, south London. Friends laying flowers said the victim, nicknamed 'Swiggy' and originally from Jamaica, had celebrated his birthday the day before he was killed.",
