Simone Grice plunged 45m (150ft) and was found clinging to her mobile phone and clutching a ragdoll she had cherished since early childhood. Grice, from Redruth in Cornwall, had recently begun to be tutored at home because her school attendance had become so poor. But the inquest in Camborne heard that she may have used the computer supplied to access social network sites to arrange to meet older men. On 13 July 2009, Simone walked 300m from her family home to a road bridge and jumped to her death. Simone's mother, Linda Grice, told the inquest: \"During the day she had been happy but then she went out in the evening and came back totally different. \"She kept saying she was in pain and seemed in shock and upset. She looked like she had experienced something she couldn't live with any more. She told me to ring the police and a doctor but then said don't, so I gave her a sandwich and she went upstairs. She would not explain to me what was wrong. \"Later I went upstairs and her keys were on the bed but she was gone. She didn't normally do that. She sometimes got depressed and once told me she didn't want to live any more.\" Simone's mother claimed bullying pushed her daughter into a \"dark place\". Grice said: \"She was vulnerable because of the bullying in the neighbourhood. And it was severe bullying. It is physically and mentally draining to be bullied by a whole neighbourhood. It wasn't a short space of time when this was happening; we even rang the police.\" A statement Simone's father, David Grice, gave to police, which was read to the inquest, said youths would regularly visit their home and shout abuse. \"She said she was being picked on and bullied at school. We had lots of trouble with local children knocking on the door. They called us freaks and threatened to beat us up. She was disturbed by the children.\" Simone's social worker, Jennifer Pentecost, described how the teenager withdrew into herself because of the treatment she said had been meted out by fellow pupils. In a statement read to the inquest, Pentecost said: \"She [Simone] told me she refused to attend school because she had been bullied. She was very shy and self-conscious. She never made eye contact with staff or other pupils. \"She wore her hair in her face and often had a lot of time off school and it was hard to re-engage her. I went to visit her once and she just sat there with her head in her hands, screaming. She refused to return to school because she had been bullied and perked up when she started not going to school.\" The inquest heard that she may have used the computer supplied for home tutoring to contact older men. Robert Gasson, the head of the Not School project, told the hearing it would have been possible for Simone to access chat rooms without teachers knowing. He said: \"If she had looked at porn sites that would have flagged up to us. The issue of using social networks has been reviewed and changes have been made. There is now cybernanny software preventing the use of social networks. We also monitor usage every two weeks of each of our pupils and make home visits every three months.\" Barbara Sykes told the inquest her niece had been dumped by her boyfriend after she admitted meeting an older man for sex. Sykes claimed Simone met another man through a social network site who would give her money and have sex with her. She added: \"She was incredibly fragile and vulnerable. She was in dire need of support and counselling, a support network she didn't have.\" Text messages Simone sent and received on the day she died were read out in court. One, from somebody called Jay, read: \"I have a major problem at 8 this morning 2 police came they are watching me and my car. If I'm seen with you I will be locked up. Plz don't call again.\" The hearing is expected to conclude today.",
