  "content": "Rounding off a retro-tastic (mental note: never use that phrase again) few days, Eidos' casual gaming arm, Eidos New Media has released a Facebook version of classic C64 shooter, Gridrunner. Launched through the company's Gimme5games site, Gridrunner ++ is an updated version of Jeff Minter's old gem, featuring updated psychedelic visuals - if I'm not very much mistaken this originally appeared as a mobile game a couple of years ago. Facebook fanatics can get the game here, but there's also an online version here. Commodore 64 fans are now spoiled for choice when it comes to nostalgic gaming platforms. An iPod version of Paradroid must be in the works now surely?",
