  "content": "Most employees would be horrified if they knew that bosses were sifting through their emails. Hence the outrage at Harvard University, where central administrators secretly searched the email accounts of 16 deans of school, looking for information on a leak to the media about a cheating scandal. To what extent employers can justify accessing their employees' digital records remains a controversial issue.

Do you know if your employer has access to your emails? Have you read your workplace's privacy policy? Ever been asked to share a password? Do you self-censor at work \u2013 or do you openly discuss personal matters via your work email or instant messaging services such as Google's Gchat? Tell us in the comments below.",
