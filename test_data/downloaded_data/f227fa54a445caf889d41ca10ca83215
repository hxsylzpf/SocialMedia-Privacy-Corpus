  "content": "A British man labelled one of the world's most dangerous hackers yesterday railed against the UK's computer crime laws. Gary McKinnon, who faces extradition to the US after being accused of breaking into the Pentagon's computer system, said that Britain's laws on cybercrime were \"ridiculous\" and in desperate need of change. \"They need completely revamping,\" he told the Infosecurity Europe conference in London. \"Maybe we should scrap them all and start over again.\" Computer crime and internet fraud no longer come under the remit of centralised police investigators, with responsibility for cases falling to individual forces and local police stations. Britain's specialist cybercrime task force, the NHTCU, was folded into the new Serious Organised Crime Agency earlier this month. Mr McKinnon said that few police officers could be expected to understand the nature of computer crime, let alone successfully investigate it. \"It takes half and hour to report a stolen mobile phone. I hate to think what it's like to report computer crime,\" he said. Bob Ayers, an internet security expert with Chatham House, said that legislators might consider better training for investigators before they update the legal system. \"We need more effective people in the Crown Prosecution Service,\" he said. \"Before we start adding more statutes, we need better investigators.\" Mr McKinnon has been fighting extradition to the US by arguing that he could be punished under severe military procedure. Judges at Bow Street magistrates court have asked US prosecutors to guarantee that Mr McKinnon will not be subject to military trial, which could deny him the right to legal representation and see him detained at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Mr McKinnon is accused of hacking into computers belonging to the Pentagon, Nasa and the US army and navy, operating under the name Solo. In an interview with the Guardian last year, Mr McKinnon said he believed the US government was hiding evidence of UFOs. The charges include one incident - shortly after the attacks on September 11 2001 - which brought down a network of 300 computers at the Earle naval weapons station. Another raid apparently left 2,000 government machines in Washington inoperable. A ruling on the extradition is due on May 10.",
