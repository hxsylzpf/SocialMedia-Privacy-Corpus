  "content": "I managed to ignore Facebook for ages, then rapidly passed through phases of bemusement, cynicism and disdain before finally succumbing to the will of the herd. I've now got a profile, a photo (not actually of me), some magnetic words (left in a jumble) and a bookshelf (still empty). I haven't listed my favourite music or my work history because maintaining a Facebook profile is a task so dull, I'd rather pick fleas off the cat. But then along comes Dogbook - an application with over 35,000 users. Dogbook allows you to upload pictures of your pooch and reveal your dog's favourite parks and activities. If you live in the US or Canada, you can even search for dogs living nearby. Now, I like dogs. A lot. I've got two very cherished canines and I don't mind admitting it. What I don't want anybody to know, ever, is that I have spent far too many hours watching dogs being cute (getting stuck in catflaps, wearing batwings, snoring, that sort of thing) - courtesy of that other popular internet time-waster, YouTube. My secret remains guilty because I am aware that gushing about your darling dear dogs is not generally considered appropriate behaviour in intelligent adult company. In this age of irony, sentiment carries the ultimate stigma. Clearly not everyone is afflicted by this cuteness cringe. Certainly not Geoffrey Roche and his son Alex, the two Canadians who unleashed Dogbook and its sister application, Catbook, onto the world. Nor the owners of Harry, a long-haired dachshund from Southend-on-Sea, who has 49 pictures on his Dogbook profile. Harry likes yoghurt and digging and he has 25 friends. Dogbook is silly, obviously, but it's no more inane than many other Facebook applications. If you're going to waste time with Water Fight, for instance, which allows you to squirt virtual water at your friends, you might as well be posting messages such as \"I like Playing. Sleeping. Annoying the old dogs. Sleeping. Playing. Sleeping. Also lots of eating,\" as one chocolate labrador from Illinois has done. What's the harm in flaunting my adorable dogs, or even exposing them to a spot of public anthropomorphism? Perhaps they'll be more effective social networkers than me. With the right contacts, they may even end up with a lucrative career. So I've rummaged round for a sweet photo and set Tosca up with her very own Dogbook profile. She's a thoughtful hound with a passion for sport and a keen interest in countryside issues. So far, her profile reads, \"Tosca has no friends ... yet.\" I hope this Dogbook business doesn't end up with canine self-esteem issues.",
