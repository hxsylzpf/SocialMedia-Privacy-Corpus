  "content": "It is perhaps the most British of scandals. But claims of baking sabotage rocked the Great British Bake Off on Wednesday evening after Iain Watters became the latest contestant to be sent home, following a meltdown where he threw his molten baked alaska in the bin. Hundreds took to social media after the 31-year-old was dismissed by judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry for failing to present a dessert, with many declaring their decision unfair. Others claimed the Northern Irish construction engineer had been the victim of sabotage after fellow contestant Diana Beard had apparently removed his pudding from the freezer and left it to defrost. The barrage of online outrage from the British public prompted Bake Off presenter Sue Perkins to jump to Beard's defence on Twitter. \"Iain's alaska was out of the freezer for 40 secs,\" she wrote. \"That's it. No sabotage. 40 secs of normal temp would NOT be enough to reduce it to liquid.\" She added: \"All getting a little inflamed for my liking. Am off. This is a show about CAKES. Please, let's save the ire for real stuff.\" On Twitter #justiceforiain, #bringiainback, #bingate, poor Iain and baked alaska were all trending for most of the evening. \"How can you take somebody's ice cream out of the freezer? Not only should she be eliminated for that, she should also be arrested,\" wrote Daz Gale, while another user tweeted: \"Justice for Iain and a thousand lashes for the ice cream melting super-villain Diana.\" Others taking out their frustration included children's writer Alex T Smith, who wrote: \"Diana should have publicly apologised and not just stood there polishing her bloody WI badge and whistling.\" Radio DJ Pete Allison echoed his sentiments, saying: \"You can shove your meringue swan up your arse, Diana.\" Hollywood also waded into the debate, defending his and Berry's decision to eliminate Watters. \"At the end of the day Mary &amp; I need something to judge, it's not about melted ice cream but about what's presented to us,\" he wrote. \"I'm glad Mary's not on Twitter this would upset her.\" Beard, 70, claimed \"it didn't happen like that\" as she spoke to Free Radio on Thursday morning. Blaming bad editing, she said that Watters' cake \"was not out of the freezer for more than 40 seconds\" and assured viewers he does not blame her for the incident. She got some backing from last year's Bake Off finalist Ruby Tandoh, who wrote: \"Let's just agree that apart from (probs) a few over-zealous hockey tackles at school, Diana's likely never done a nasty thing in her life.\" And Watters himself said: \"Guys no hard feelings now. Diana is a top lady and all us tent bakers are great pals. Can't wait to tune into the rest of the series.\" This is not the first time claims of baking espionage have rocked the BBC show. Last year one contestant, Howard Middleton, became the victim of an apparent accidental custard theft in the Bake Off kitchen. \u2022 A technical error meant that an early version of this story went online with words missing. This has been amended, as has an incorrect reference to Ruby Tandoh as winner of last year's competition.",
