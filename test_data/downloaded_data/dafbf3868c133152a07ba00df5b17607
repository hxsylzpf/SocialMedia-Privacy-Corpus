  "content": "Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) is making a big move into social games, with the purchase of fast-growing social game developer Playdom for up to $763.2m. The deal includes a \"total consideration\" of $563.2m, in addition to a performance-linked earn-out of up to $200m. In a release Disney says that by buying Playdom it \"will strengthen its already-robust digital gaming portfolio, acquire a first-rate management team and provide consumers new ways to interact with the company on popular social networks like Facebook and MySpace\". The company hints that it will now be bringing its \"characters, stories and brands\" to games on social networks. Photo by CarbonNYC on Flickr. Some rights reserved By acquiring Playdom, Disney will also be getting an existing portfolio of popular social games, which includes Mobsters, the top title on MySpace (NSDQ: NWS). Over the last year, Playdom has been rapidly expanding its lineup of titles through the acquisition of eight gaming startups. It now ranks as the top social game developer on MySpace and the fourth largest on Facebook. The company, which is profitable, said late last year that its sales were near an annual run rate of $50m. The deal price represents a big return for Playdom's investors, who had put $73m into the company since last November. Just last month, Playdom had raised $33m in an add-on to its first round. That round included an investment by Disney venture arm Steamboat Ventures. Other backers included New Enterprise Associates, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Norwest Venture Partners. The acquisition shows just how quickly the valuations of social game startups are soaring. The last major acquisition in the space was last fall when Electronic Arts paid $275m in cash and up to $100m in earnouts for Playfish, which had 60 million monthly active players of its titles at that time. Playdom, by contrast, claims only 38 million monthly active users. Playdom chief executive John Pleasants, the former Electronic Arts (NSDQ: ERTS) chief operating officer who Playdom hired away last fall, is joining Disney Interactive Media Group as an executive vice president and as general manager of Playdom. He will report to Disney Interactive Media Group president Steve Wadsworth.",
