Since the July 2005 Tube bombings in London, we've grown used to news organisations using amateur photography and video of major news events. Now the wisdom of the crowd is becoming a source for generating stories as well as reacting to them. Guardian News &amp; Media's head of news, business and sport Paul Johnson, who chaired this lunchtime Future of Journalism panel, set the scene with two examples - Reuters is working on a tool to monitor micro-blogging service Twitter for mentions of newsworthy keywords such as \"earthquake\", while AP has agreed to buy content from user-generated site www.nowpublic.com. User-generated content and citizen journalism Jemima Kiss, digital media reporter at MediaGuardian.co.uk, said news organisations need to be careful about how they use user-generated content and social media. \"I see these things as tools like any other websites we use as journalists and part of our skill is learning how to use them,\" Kiss added. Paul Brannan, editor, emerging platforms, at the BBC said the broadcaster had enjoyed \"fantastic success\" with user-generated content. \"It's lit up our journalism for the last five years - people offer us pictures every single day on the web, a call on Five 5 for people connected to specific events will get people coming back in spade loads,\" Brannan added. User-generated content is no less important on theguardian.com but the focus has been on opinion rather than reactions and observations of events. Meg Pickard, head of communities and user experience, for theguardian.com, said: \"User comment is very complementary to official or professional comment.\" Increasingly, people who witness news events may not choose to give their news leads and pictures to big news organisations such as the BBC and the Guardian. Instead, they are publishing through intermediary sites, or through blogs or using tools such as Twitter. Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at City University New York, BuzzMachine blogger and MediaGuardian contributor, said he no longer likes the term \"citizen journalist\". \"It's a mistake to define journalism by who does it and it can lead to accreditation and non-accreditation,\" Jarvis added. He pointed to the recent example of Mayhill Fowler who broke the stories of presidential candidate Barack Obama calling working-class Pennsylvanians \"bitter\" and Bill Clinton calling journalist Todd Purdum a \"scumbag\". Jarvis said it was outrageous for younger journalists to condemn her for \"breaking the rules\" when they should be celebrating increased reportage and journalism and suggested that they were guilty of trying to keep journalism as a closed shop. He acknowledged Fowler should have identified herself to Clinton but noted that the situation would have more grey area if she'd merely been observing Clinton speaking to the person next to her. \"Life is public now and anyone, anywhere, any time can be an observer and what can be observed can be shared,\" Jarvis said. Crowd sourcing David Leigh, assistant editor (investigations) at the Guardian, cautioned there was a risk technology could undermine serious investigative journalism if editors put a premium on news with images and photographs submitted by users. \"It's fine for plane crashes but most of the significant things go on in the world are not visible things but how drug companies operate or how arms companies operate,\" Leigh said. \"No citizen journalist or wise crowd is going to see the process of political decisions and take a photo.\" Leigh added that he was excited by the possibilities opened by technology but he had been disappointed by some of the results so far. For example, Wikileaks, a site for whistleblowers to securely leak documents, sounded great in principle but \"didn't work\". Leigh said the problem was that documents would be uploaded to the site but no one knew what they meant because there was no context or analysis. In another example, he put a call out for people to help with an international investigation and all he got back were \"some nutters and spam\". However, Jarvis said crowds could be a great source of knowledge when you ask them about their own areas of expertise. For example, NPR Radio asked people to go to the shop and find out the price of a quart of milk, a head of iceberg lettuce and six-pack of Budweiser beer in their neighbourhood. The cost of a price of milk varied from $1.09 to $2.49 and NPR overlaid the data onto a map to see how the cost varied according to the socio-economic and ethnic make-up of neighbourhoods. Jarvis added that there was the advantage of data to ensure people were telling the truth - you can look for the patterns and check out any anomalies such as a $10 carton of milk to work out if it's wrong or a great story. Kiss said she had a critical mass of followers on Twitter and she used that as a tool to research stories. This week, for example, she asked her Twitter followers to suggest questions for her interview with MySpace founder Tom Anderson and the responses included some real gems. Jarvis said Dell and Starbucks were using new software that let customers suggest ideas and vote them up and down. He suggested news organisations could employ the same principle and get readers to suggest stories or nominate which stories they would like followed up. However, he added that editors needed to retain control to ensure this was not gamed by public relations, adding \"journalism is not a democracy, it's a republic and we have our representatives, maybe not elected ones, to field that\". He said some news organisations posted up the \"most emailed\" and \"most read\" stories on the wall but this was the wrong way to look at journalism because the most emailed was usually the weirdest story and the most read was usually an obvious news event. Pickard said the Guardian was working behind the scenes on an \"interestingness algorithm\" that combined factors such as page impressions, the number of comments, and the number of times emailed to a non-Guardian email address. Legal ramifications Both the Guardian's Pickard and the BBC's Brannan said most moderation decisions on comment forums were based on protecting the brand and user experience before any legal considerations. The BBC's unique position means that it has to be even more careful and the broadcaster would not, for example, have a reader discussion on Israel and the Middle East without full moderation by a BBC journalist because otherwise the comments would descend and produce \"more heat than light\". However, news organisations need to be even more careful about legal issues online than in print because of the global nature of the internet. Brannan said the BBC put its television news online but this recently posed a challenge when a South Australian court had ordered a reporting black-out in its own jurisdiction on a case. Jarvis said British news organisations should be more vigorous in defending free speech and agitate for a UK equivalent to the First Amendment to override contempt of court and libel restrictions. He also believed it was detrimental to cater for more restrictive laws abroad. \"If you try to play it safe you end up journeying to the lowest common denominator of [free] speech and that's bad for our world and bad for the world,\" he added. \u2022 The Future of Journalism series is an internal Guardian conference.
