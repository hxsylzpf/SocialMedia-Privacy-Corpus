  "content": "Charlotte Church, the singer and songwriter, has told the Leveson inquiry that she was advised to waive a \u00a3100,000 fee to perform at Rupert Murdoch's wedding to Wendi Deng, because she would get \"good press\" from the media mogul's newspapers. Speaking to the Leveson inquiry on Monday, Church said she agreed to appear at the 1999 event \u2013 she was 13 at the time \u2013 because she was advised by her management and record company that it was a good idea given Murdoch's power and influence. \"I remember being told that Murdoch had asked me to perform at his wedding to Wendi Deng in New York on his yacht,\" she told Lord Justice Leveson. \"I remember being told of the offer of the favour \u2013 to get good press \u2013 and I also remember being 13 and thinking why would anyone take a favour of \u00a3100,000? \"But I was being advised by my management and a certain member of the record company that he was a very, very powerful man and could certainly do with a favour of this magnitude.\" Murdoch married Deng, his third wife, in June 1999, in a private service on board his yacht Morning Glory in New York harbour, with 82 guests attending. Church performed three songs at the event, according to press reports at the time. News Corporation, Murdoch's company, denied the allegations and said that Church's performance was a surprise to him. Church said that she received a specific request to perform Pie Jesu \u2013 and that she was flown on Murdoch's private jet from Los Angeles to New York for the event. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
