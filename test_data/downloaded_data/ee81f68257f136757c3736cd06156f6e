  "content": "London Olympics organisers today warned of the increased danger of cyber attacks that could fatally undermine the technical network that supports everything from recording world records to relaying results to commentators. The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (Locog) said it was \"inevitable\" that its systems would have to repel malicious attempts by hackers to bring them down. Unveiling a new lab that will run simulations of millions of scenarios at venues with 200,000 hours of testing ahead of 2012, Locog chief information officer Gerry Pennell said the threat had increased since the 2008 Beijing Olympics. \"It's clear that cyber security is rising up the agenda in this country and others. We're taking it very seriously. It consumes a significant proportion of my time,\" he said. Patrick Adiba, the chief executive of Locog's IT partner Atos Origin Iberia, said that during the Beijing Olympics there were 14m \"events\" a day, about 400 of which were \"relevant events that could have been an issue that may have impacted on the Games\". All of them were blocked, he said. \"We will get cyber attacks, for sure. We are working very closely with our partners and with government to make sure we have got the right level of defences against cyber attacks,\" added Pennell. \"It would be where typically a malicious group launches an attack with a view to bringing down the Games itself or the website. Those kind of malicious attacks you can imagine people attempting to try.\" In December last year, a government security review of the Olympics overseen by Lady Neville-Jones warned that \"the need for a strengthened approach in mitigating the risks of cyber threats was identified\". It said an action plan was being developed by the Office of Cyber Security to address the threat.",
