  "content": "The gay news website that suggested the footballer Ashley Cole was the alleged subject of a News of the World story has been warned it could face legal action from the paper. Lawyers acting for the News of the World sent PinkNews.co.uk a letter today in which they said the paper and its stablemate the Sun were reserving their rights to issue proceedings against the website under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978. That could involve the website in the libel action brought by Arsenal and England star Cole against the papers. Cole has taken action over a series of stories in the two papers between February 12 and 19 claiming two unnamed Premiership footballers had taken part in \"perverted\" and \"debauched romps\" with a \"well known DJ\". He sued the two papers for defamation after internet sites and chat rooms named him as one of the footballers in the story. PinkNews.co.uk discussed the News of the World story and internet rumours speculating on the identity of the individuals concerned. It reproduced a pixelated version of a photograph used by the News of the World that claimed to be of a Premiership footballer and a well-known music industry figure, comparing it with a photograph showing Cole and Ian Thompson, better known as the Choice FM DJ Masterstepz, at a party. Thompson has since joined Cole in taking legal action against the Sun and the News of the World. The case is highly unusual because neither man has been named by the papers. But their lawyers claim the way the papers wrote their stories led to their identification. The website said it had not claimed either of the men was gay or had been involved in a taped \"romp\". Its article was designed to \"explore the media hysteria relating to these allegations and the impact that the internet has had in rumour-spreading\". The website's editor, Benjamin Cohen, said it had behaved in a responsible way in its handling of the story. \"At no point did we claim that Mr Cole was gay,\" he said. \"All that PinkNews.co.uk did was to publish what it believed to be the original version of a photograph edited by the News of the World. \"News Group have merely informed us of their rights to bring proceedings. As yet, proceedings have not been issued.\" PinkNews.co.uk has appointed solicitors at Stock Fraser Cukier to represent it. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
