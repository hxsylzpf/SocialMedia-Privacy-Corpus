  "content": "Mr Bean star Rowan Atkinson has demanded an apology and damages from the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday over what he says are \"quite ridiculous\" allegations that he came close to a nervous breakdown and checked into a clinic for treatment for severe depression. The comedian's solicitors, Schillings, have also written to other newspaper editors warning them not to repeat the \"highly defamatory\" claims. The allegations first surfaced in the Mail on Sunday on December 28, 2003, under the heading: \"Why Mr Bean fears he's a has been\", and were repeated in the Daily Mail on January 3. Atkinson has denied suffering from any form of depression or nervous breakdown, or spending five weeks at a clinic receiving treatment for depression. He has demanded an immediate and prominent apology, an undertaking not to repeat the allegations and to remove the articles from the newspapers' library databases, as well as damages and costs. The claims have already appeared in a number of other newspapers following the publication of the Mail articles. Last week, the Mail on Sunday agreed to pay substantial libel damages to a Saudi businessman, Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, over an article which suggested he was the brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden and helped to finance terrorism. In December 2003, the paper was forced to pay \"substantial damages\" to police chief Commander Brian Paddick over two articles based on \"kiss and tell\" interviews with two of his former partners, and false allegations that he had taken drugs. It also paid libel damages to Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed after falsely alleging that some of his assets might have to be sold because of financial pressure. Atkinson, whose fame began on sketch show Not the Nine O'Clock News and was sealed by his central role in historical comedy Blackadder, is one of Britain's most successful comedians, with a personal fortune estimated at \u00a355m. A feature film based on his slapstick comic character Mr Bean became a worldwide sensation, and last year his latest film, Johnny English, grossed over $30m at the box office. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
