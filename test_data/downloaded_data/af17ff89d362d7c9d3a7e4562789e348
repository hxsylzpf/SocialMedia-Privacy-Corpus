Dmitry Sklyarov, 27, had been accused of violating electronic book copyrights in the first criminal prosecution under a controversial US law, the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. He could have faced up to five years in prison. \"Until I'm in Russia, it is too early to say that I'm happy,\" Mr Sklyarov said in a statement. \"But this agreement looks like the first significant change in my situation for the last five months, my first real chance to get home.\" Mr Sklyarov and his employer, ElcomSoft of Moscow, were accused of releasing a program that lets readers disable restrictions on Adobe Systems electronic book software. Adobe's eBook Reader gives publishers a format for selling books online and is designed to prevent the transfer of materials between users and devices without publishers' consent. Mr Sklyarov found flaws in the software's encryption scheme and created ways for users to make backup copies of e-books or transfer them to other devices, such as handheld computers. After the software became available for download in the US, for around $99 (\u00a368), Adobe complained to the FBI, which arrested Mr Sklyarov in July as he was preparing to fly back to Russia from a computer security convention. Under the deal announced yesterday, Mr Sklyarov will be required to give a deposition and testify for either side if requested by prosecutors or defence attorneys. If he refrains from violating copyright laws until the case against his employer is settled, the charges will be dropped. ElcomSoft's chief executive, Alex Katalov, said he was pleased the company would bear sole responsibility. Critics of the case have contended that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act stifles legitimate computer research and gives book publishers, record companies and movie studios too tight a grip on online content - at the expense of the fair use and first-sale premises traditionally found in US copyright law. Adobe eventually dropped its support of the case after internet policy groups threatened to organise a boycott of the company's products.",
