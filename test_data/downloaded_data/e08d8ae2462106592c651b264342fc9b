  "content": "The social graph trumps algorithms, according to Alexa Andrzejewski, founder of social eating app Foodspotting. She was speaking in a panel session on social mobile apps at Facebook's f8 conference. \"People don't trust algorithms,\" she said, explaining that when Foodspotting users were asked if they wanted recommendations from the company in the app, they said no \u2013 but they were very keen to see what their friends were eating and recommending. \"Remember that people don't care about your fancy algorithm. They care about their friends.\" The panel also featured Zynga's Paul Bettner, Turntable.fm's Billy Chasen and EA/Playfish's Kristian Segerstrale, with social mobile games a key area for discussion. \"Play and gaming is one of the most important trends in mobile right now,\" said Bettner. \"I think mobile is the modern vehicle for play now. When the iPhone came out, it was a life-altering moment for me\u2026 There's never been anything like this before. Everybody is carrying this device around. I could never say my wife was carrying a Game Boy or a PSP around.\" Segerstrale agreed, claiming that there are \"nearly one billion\" smartphones in people's hands now, versus a comparatively tiny number four years ago. \"The really exciting thing is if you think of usage today: 8% of people's time on these devices in applications is spent either social networking or playing games,\" he said, highlighting the strong potential for social games, which combine the two. Segerstrale, said there are still issues though, particularly the way social games on mobile phones can't be updated as quickly and regularly as on Facebook. \"It's crippling and inefficent how many hurdles there are to updating a mobile application\u2026 whether it's iOS or Android\". But he said that technology evolutions like HTML5 may help solve that. \"Being able to update it on the fly as opposed to having to update it through a channel to market.\" Bettner agreed that Zynga has struggled with this too, but also warned of the challenges of reproducing a social game designed to be played on a desktop computer, and making it work well on a smaller-screened mobile phone. Which is why Zynga made a separate CityVille Hometown game for iOS, rather than one that tied into its full CityVille game on Facebook. The panel were also asked about the challenge of discovery on app stores. \"One of the first things you can do is leverage people's narcissism!\" said Andrzejewski. \"Get other people to evangelise your app for you by letting them share stuff about themselves.\" Bettner added that Zynga's most valuable players on mobile are those who came in through personal recommendations: invites from friends. Segerstrale added that app developers still need to have good relationships with app store owners like Apple and Google, but that once they have built an audience for their games, other ways to promote a game become possible: EA's Origin community for example. Bettner talked about \"a huge echo effect back to the iPhone audience\" when Zynga launched Words With Friends on Android: people playing on iPhones came back to the game because suddenly their Android-owning friends could play. The panel were asked about releasing their apps for different mobile platforms, and all agreed that it's tough to launch a social app simultaneously across iPhone, Android and others, especially for smaller teams. \"Hopefully HTML5 gets to a point where we can do that,\" said Turntable.fm's Chasen. \"It's what we tried at first, but it was really slow and required you to download some files first to get it running\u2026 It's very challenging for small teams, so the best I can do is just roll out different platforms. People will wait for it. We have an Android community and we know they're waiting for it. And it's coming soon.\" There was also a debate about the best way to make money from mobile apps, from paid downloads to in-app purchases to advertising. \"The best monetisation is when you don't even realise that's what it's doing,\" said Chasen. \"It's a part of the user experience.\" Segerstrale suggested that it's vital for developers to remain focused on engagement \u2013 getting people to spend more time using their apps rather than hurtling willy-nilly into different ways to make money from them. \"Get them more engaged, and chances are if they do more of that, they'll be willing to part with some money as well\". Andrzejewski said that finding a balance between what's good for the business and what's good for users of apps, although the two are often symbiotic. \"If it's not good for the user, it's not good for the business or the brand,\" she said. Segerstrale also criticised the way a lot of social mobile games companies are caught up in the idea of making money from \"whales\" \u2013 a few big-spending players. \"I actually think that's an unsustainable model. I think it's very important to have a broad base of folks who pay, as opposed to a few who pay a lot of money.\" Chasen finished off by advising developers to \"push the technology to the limits\", using the native features of the mobile phone like the camera, the accelerometer, the GPS sensor and others. \"More important than anything is don't design for today, but design for what you believe the world will look like in 12 to 24 months,\" said Segerstrale. \"Think how the world will be and develop for that, as opposed to developing for what the world is like today.\" The panel were asked what else they're excited about outside their own companies' areas. Segerstrale said sports and exercise is ripe for social disruption, while Chasen is looking forward to more social layers on top of reading books. \"What I would really love to see is an app that harnessed social for giving,\" said Bettner, referring to mobile rather than Facebook's website, where there are a number of charitable apps already. \"It's particularly interesting on mobile because payment is so frictionless, it can be one click to donate\u2026 I'm not yet seeing an app built around that, and I think it would be extremely compelling.\" Finally, Andrzejewski talked about the idea of lifestyle changes, for example \"making diabetes more social and motivating people through that\u2026 helping people achieve their goals and change their lifestyle\".",
