  "content": "After dreaming of this day for so long, it's finally here: former US president George W Bush has joined Facebook. That leaves only his father George HW Bush and approximately 16 other US citizens who haven't yet joined the popular social media site. Sadly, there is no option to \"poke\" George Bush. At the time of writing, George Bush already has 36,000 Facebook citizens who \"like\" him since the page went public on Wednesday morning, although judging by the messages on his wall there is also a substantial number who would like an option to \"unlike\" him. \"I'm glad you finally learned how to use a computer so your supporters can reach you,\" writes one on Bush's wall, followed by: \"And with this, Facebook has officially jumped the shark.\" As Facebook accounts go, it doesn't tell us much about him, other than his birthday is on 6 July 1946, and \"Personal information: 43rd President of the United States, Former Governor of Texas,\" which is already in the public domain (although given Facebook's sieve-like privacy posture, anything you post on Facebook is also probably in the public domain, whether you know it or not). The wall comments are a bizarre bunch: \"Thanks to you, we have more than one internet!! God bless!!!\" writes one. \"Mr President, I SO WISH you had played yourself in the Harold and Kumar film. NOT KIDDING!\" writes another. Others are more pointed: This is awesome to have you on Facebook. The true Americans miss you a lot. Obama is screwing our country. How could so many stupid people vote for that man. He's a muslim just like the ones that took down our Twin Towers. We miss you. God Bless America. And lastly glad to have you back in Texas !! First prize for best wall comment: Please don't have your farm pre-emptively attack my farm on Farmville. Sincerely, The Ghost of Saddam Oh, and then there's this advice: ps don't join myspace!",
