  "content": "Ever since an appeal court judge proclaimed that English law now provides a right to privacy, in the action brought by Catherine Zeta Jones and her husband Michael Douglas against Hello! magazine, the human rights bandwagon has become almost as busy as the taxi rank outside the Met bar. Jamie Theakston, Sara Cox, an as-yet unnamed Premiership footballer and, in the latest case, Naomi Campbell, have all attempted to invoke the newish human rights act to protect against alleged invasions of privacy, varying from the exposure of a brothel visit to a string of extra-marital affairs. It was predicted that press self-regulation would be thrown into turmoil by an advancing army of judges keen to cut down the mischief-making media. But what has now become clear is that the judges will not go so far as to carve out a whole new free-standing right to privacy under the human rights act. Instead, they are using the act to develop and extend the law on breach of confidence, a process which was well under way before the human rights act was a gleam in the Lord Chancellor's eye. The gravy train began to roll with the Douglas/Hello! case. The actors had signed a lucrative deal with OK! magazine to cover their wedding, but unauthorised photographs reached the publication's arch-rival. The couple sued for breach of confidence, and in an attempt to shore up their claim, argued that their privacy had been breached under article eight of the European convention on human rights, incorporated into English law by the human rights act. One of the three judges, Lord Justice Sedley, said the couple had \"a right of privacy which English law will today recognise and, where appropriate, protect\". Since then media lawyers have developed a big business in seeking injunctions to stop publication of kiss-and-tell and other embarrassing tales. These injunctions have become the 21st century equivalent of the gagging libel writ beloved of Robert Maxwell and his ilk. But how creative would the judges be in developing a right to privacy from the law on breach of confidence? And how would they balance the right to respect for private life against the right to freedom of expression, also guaranteed by the European convention? A clearer picture is emerging following the rulings in the Campbell, Theakston and footballer cases. The judges issued their clearest indication that they did not see it as their role to develop a general right of privacy in a case brought by a mother and son who said their rights had been violated by a strip search while visiting a relative in prison. The case went to the appeal court, where the judges said they would not seek to develop a law of privacy by stealth. Such a complex and contentious matter should be left to parliament, they said in their ruling, delivered just before Christmas. But where appropriate, as in the media cases, judges have been busily extending the protection given by the common law of confidence. Their impetus for doing so dates back to 1991 when the appeal court lamented its powerlessness to give the actor Gorden Kaye any redress for a \"monstrous invasion of privacy\" against the Sunday Sport, which had snapped him in his hospital bed recovering from brain surgery and recorded his ramblings. The latest cases establish that celebrities, however much they thrust themselves into the public spotlight, do have an area of private life which they are entitled to keep private. As Lord Woolf said in the footballer case: \"Where an individual is a public figure, he is entitled to have his privacy respected in the appropriate circumstances. A public figure is entitled to a private life.\" But \"if you have courted public attention then you have less grounds to object to the intrusion which follows\". The footballer had no right to stop the two women he played away with telling their tales because those who indulge in brief flings can't expect the other party to keep them confidential. The women too had rights - the right to free speech, entitling them to tell their tales. Unlike the details of Naomi Campbell's medical treatment, the tales of the footballer's antics were not \"imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence.\" Ditto the visits by Jamie Theakston to a brothel. In both cases article 10 of the European Convention - the right to freedom of expression and the guarantee of a free press - outweighed any right to privacy. In the Campbell case, Mr Justice Morland said the media should respect information about celebrities' private lives which they choose to keep confidential, unless there was an overriding public interest in publishing. This would include exposure of crime or other wrongdoing. In Ms Campbell's case the public had \"a need to know\" she had been misleading them by her denials that she was a drug addict and balanced journalism demanded that the public be told she was receiving treatment. But there was no right to publish details of the treatment, which she chose to keep out of the public domain. This flood of initial right to privacy cases may slow to a trickle as celebrities realise they are unlikely to be awarded telephone number damages for perceived breaches of privacy. That puts the spotlight back on the press complaints commission, under fire in some sections of the press for an alleged failure to take a tough enough line on tabloid excess. Celebrities do not like the PCC: it can impose no financial penalty, and editors are forced only to publish an apology. But the PCC argues that its cheap and swift method of judgment means it is by far the best method of achieving redress for everyone - 95% of its cases involve ordinary members of the public. Whatever the PCC's problems, and the resignation of Lord Wakeham over his role in the Enron scandal has plunged the organisation into near-crisis, the human rights bandwagon appears to have dealt press self-regulation only a glancing blow.",
