All being well, the hair-raising ride should end at 10.15am UK time with the smouldering craft at rest in the open grasslands of southern Kazakhstan. Weak and hemmed in, he and his companions - Nasa's Tim Kopra and the Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko - will be lifted free, checked by doctors, and after a short traditional ceremony flown back to their respective space agencies. Peake will accompany Kopra to Bod\u00f8 air force base in Norway, switch planes in the dead of night and arrive in Cologne, home to the European Space Agency's astronaut centre, early on Sunday morning. The journey home marks the end of a six month trip for Peake, the first Briton to be admitted to the European astronaut corps. But it is also the end of a space mission that has broken records for the public interest it has drawn. Since his selection in 2009, and on the back of a highly effective publicity campaign, Peake, a former army helicopter pilot, has become a household name. The seeds for his success were sown long before he launched. At the UK Space Agency (UKSA), plans were thrashed out for the largest education programme ever put together in support of a European astronaut. Meanwhile, at the European Space Agency (ESA), the media team had decided to share the mission, named Principia, on as many social media platforms as possible. Peake was handed a dedicated blog and set up accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Today, more than 780,000 people follow him on Twitter. That is more than any other ESA astronaut. From the start, media requests poured. If they reached key audiences, and Peake agreed, the European and UK space agencies worked them into his schedule. In orbit he donned a fake tuxedo to award Adele a Brit award. He read a bedtime story about astronauts on CBeebies as the Earth rolled beneath him. He called down to schools to take questions from children. \"The response was amazing,\" says Jules Grandsire, communication officer at the European Astronaut Centre. \"We have a responsibility to share these stories with the people who fund the missions. Now, with this fantastic tool of social media and the internet, we don't have to wait until the astronauts get back home.\" It was not an entirely engineered success. Peake would not have amassed such a following, and have inspired so many, were he a man of different character. At Baikonur cosmodrome on launch day in December, Peake stood out as the man with the broad grin and the double thumbs up. In one memorable photo, taken as the crew's bus prepares to leave for the launchpad, Peake, with hands pressed to the glass, positively beams at his toddler son, who is riding on a family member's shoulders. The easy manner held in space. When Peake arrived at the station after a dicey docking that had even Moscow mission control admit they were worried, he wore a Cheshire cat smile. He tweeted about coping with life in orbit. He beamed down photos and videos of sights that only a minuscule fraction of humanity will ever see with their own eyes. He called his parents, but got the wrong number, and on another occasion, phoned when they were out. In one video clip, he was chased around the station by the commander, Scott Kelly, who had dressed up in a gorilla suit. When asked how he was doing on a spacewalk, as he clung to the outside of the station, he replied: \"Fine. Just hanging out.\" Chris Hadfield, the Canadian astronaut who mastered the art of social media in space, said the technology has made a real impact on the ability of astronauts to share their experiences. When he flew to Mir in 1995, the best astronauts could do was chat to random enthusiasts over ham radio and take photos that had to be developed and shared in person after they landed. \"Now you can take a picture and within a few minutes share it with a billion people,\" he said. But Hadfield insists that the technology has not become a burden for the modern astronaut. \"I think people get the mis-impression that it's what we're doing all the time, but of course it's not. I spent more time trying to share the experience when the media was a lot less user-friendly,\" he said. At least a million children got involved in the 30 educational projects Peake led around the Principia mission. Libby Jackson at UKSA said that when he called into schools from space, the students reacted with unbridled excitement. \"You go into schools and everyone finds it fascinating. I wish we could bottle it,\" she said. Children told her they would remember the day for the rest of their lives. \"Tim has balanced it really well,\" says Hadfield. \"He's made it look accessible and interesting to so many people that otherwise might not have seen it. But he couldn't have done it without the last decade in advances in communications technology. That has really democratised the experience.\" While Peake's time in space is over, the Principia mission is not. For the next six months or so, the research will continue. Once Peake has regained his strength and fitness, the media appearances will start up again. The bookies are already taking bets on him appearing on Top Gear and Strictly Come Dancing. \"He's done a great job,\" said David Willetts, chair of the British Science Association. \"It's gone better than one dared hope.\"",
