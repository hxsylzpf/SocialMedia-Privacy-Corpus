Criado-Perez has fled London for the countryside, where her signal struggles to penetrate the stone walls of her mother's house, providing some respite, not just from the Guardian, but the online abuse that seems to have spiked again since the charges were brought. A year ago, Criado-Perez was a little known campaigner and journalist studying for an MA in gender studies. In the past 12 months, she has successfully persuaded the Bank of England to keep the image of a woman other than the Queen on banknotes and become well known for her stance against online misogynists. Yet for all her achievements, it has not been an easy time. \"It has been unprecedented, completely mad and deeply unpleasant,\" she says. \"That's my overriding feeling and I wish it wasn't. The awfulness was so awful that it took away from anything else.\" The \"awfulness\", as she calls it, began with an abusive tweet the day after the then new Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, agreed to her demands to recognise the achievements of just one woman among the five portraits on our banknotes. Her \"elation\" was short-lived as the one abusive tweet soon became a \"huge avalanche\" and included vicious threats of rape and other violence. In September, having \"really hit rock bottom and had some kind of breakdown\", Criado-Perez quit Twitter for a month. She is considering another temporary \"deactivation\" of her account during her Christmas break but is nervous of saying so as her last attempt also prompted another wave of abuse. \"I go up and down but at the moment I'm in a pretty bad place,\" she admits. \"I am reaching boiling point and am incredibly stressed. I feel angry, upset, scared of opening my inbox or looking at my mentions [on Twitter]. I feel under attack all the time \u2026 I feel like I'm the go-to person to send abuse to now.\" That morning, she received an email calling her a \"fat ugly twat\" and had had \"a bit of a rant\" on Twitter after a barrage of comments suggesting she only went to the police for the notoriety. In two tweets, she wrote: \"For the benefit of idiots: I sought equality for women. I did not seek death &amp; threats, or thousands of followers whose sole purpose seems to be telling me how shit I am. You want \"fame\"? You think it's so fucking awesome? Try it for a fucking day. Have your bloody platform.\" Now she regrets losing her temper: \"I haven't dealt with it very well. I am speaking as someone really psychologically scarred by this.\" Criado-Perez, 29, was born in Brazil to an Argentinian father and an English mother. Her father was a self-made businessman who began selling handmade dolls on the streets and she had an itinerant childhood, moving to Spain, Portugal, Taiwan and then to public school in Britain when she was 11. Some critics suggest she simply stay off of Twitter to avoid the abuse but as Criado-Perez says: \"Getting off Twitter is just not an option for me \u2013 it's how I do my activism, how I work. I would love to close down my email facility but I can't, I need it for work.\" Part of the problem is the sense that online abuse is not in the same league as offline threats, yet she sees both as part of a culture in which women are undervalued and their fears ignored. The campaign that in many ways started the whole thing off \u2013 against the Bank of England's decision to drop Elizabeth Fry, the only woman, from banknotes \u2013 is part of a culture which \"consistently undervalues women\", she says. She is critical of US-based social media companies such as Twitter which cite freedom of speech issues for failing to act and describes abuse which aims to silence women as itself \"anti-democracy anti-freedom of speech\". Criado-Perez is critical of the new \"blocking\" button brought in by Twitter which continues to allow users to follow and retweet from accounts they have been blocked from. Women's groups are calling on the police and prosecution to treat abuse of women and girls online as \"robustly\" as they do offline. Holly Dustin, director of the the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW) said: \"Rape threats online should be treated with the same seriousness as if they happened in the street or on the bus. They need to treat abuse online in the same way as they do offline.\" A young woman, 23-year-old Isabella Sorley, as well as 25-year-old John Nimmo have been charged with improper use of a communications network for allegedly abusing Criado-Perez. It is the attacks from women online that seem to upset Criado-Perez most. In early December there was a \"big flare-up of abuse \u2026 [with] all the women attacking me \u2026 saying stuff like how rubbish the banknote campaign was\". The abuse she allegedly received from the two charged wasn't even the worst, she said. Yet she will be glad when the case is over, whatever the outcome. With her MA dissertation due next September, she is thinking of writing about gender equality in the criminal justice system and the need for \"greater victim awareness\". \"This year has been unlike any other in my life. I've gone from being someone nobody knows, to someone that quite a lot of people have a very strong opinion on. It's weird going from anonymity to a kind of fame \u2013 and an overnight one, one that wasn't because of anything you can be proud of. One that comes from an experience that has left you emotionally and psychologically scarred. \"I have tried to cope with this new-found notoriety, but I haven't always dealt with it very well. I haven't learnt yet how to cope with people who don't know me thinking they have access to my innermost thoughts and hating me for them. I haven't learnt to cope with the sheer volume of people wanting to tell me they hate me, think I'm great, can I read this, do that, come here, go there, opine on this, denounce that. I haven't learnt to switch it off and realise I have to say no sometimes, if only for the sake of my sanity. And it's been exhausting.\"",
