  "content": "A Church of England bishop has been suspended indefinitely following his disparaging remarks about the royal wedding. Pete Broadbent, a suffragan bishop in Willesden, wrote a series of posts on Facebook, where he said the marriage of Kate Middleton and Prince William would last seven years and described the wedding day as being surrounded by \"nauseating tosh\". \"We need a party in Calais for all good republicans who can't stand the nauseating tosh that surrounds this event,\" he wrote. His comments incurred the anger of politicians and fellow clergy, with the outcry forcing him to apologise for his language, which he described as \"deeply offensive\". But his apology failed to appease his superior, the bishop of London, the Right Rev Richard Chartres, who said he was \"appalled\" by Broadbent's comments. In a statement today he said: \"In common with most of the country I share the joy which the news of the engagement has brought. \"I have now had an opportunity to discuss with Bishop Peter how his comments came to be made and I have noted his unreserved apology. Nevertheless, I have asked him to withdraw from public ministry until further notice. \"I have been in touch with St James' Palace to express my own dismay on behalf of the church.\" Broadbent was absent from this morning's service at Westminster Abbey, marking the inauguration of the Church of England's General Synod.",
