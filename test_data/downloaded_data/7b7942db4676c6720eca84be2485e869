  "content": "The press celebrated Kate Middleton's 25th birthday by treating her to an array of headlines and photographs cynically discussing whether she should have greater privacy protection. News International even took the seemingly altruistic step of announcing that it would not use any paparazzi pictures of Ms Middleton in any of its publications. While this may mean the Sun and News of the World default to their own snappers rather than pay over the odds for sneaky paparazzi shots, it won't drive down demand for pictures of a person who is tipped to become a princess. While there may be an eerie similarity between the press harassment Ms Middleton is being subjected to and that which faced the young Princess Diana, the legal landscape relating to such harassment has seen a significant shift. Both refinements to the PCC code of practice and developments in the law have given greater emphasis to the need for privacy and recognition of its protection. Recent cases have made it clear that even though the public may be interested in someone as a celebrity (Naomi Campbell v Mirror) or royalty (Hannover v Germany), such interest does not of itself reduce the level of privacy protection that they should be reasonably and legally entitled to receive. The PCC code provides that it is unacceptable to photograph people in private places without their consent - this includes public places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. The code also provides against \"harassment or persistent pursuit\". In relation to such harassment it puts the onus on editors who must also ensure they do not use \"non-compliant material\" from other sources - such as freelance paparazzi. So it is perhaps with this in mind that News International has announced its own attempts at self-restraint. From a legal perspective, earlier incoherent and unsatisfactory attempts at formulating privacy protection through the use of confidentiality and common law constructs have been replaced by a tangible privacy tort. The European case of Hannover v Germany made it clear that where the public interest is not engaged through some specific activity (such as attending a public event or engagement or in Kate Middleton's case, attending Prince William's passing out parade at Sandhurst), then taking and publishing photographs of someone just because they are royalty, a celebrity or 'of interest' will amount to an invasion of privacy. In Campbell v Mirror, the House or Lords also made it clear that even celebrities who had lied about their drug addiction were still entitled to privacy protection. This shift towards greater privacy protection has been upheld in recent cases such as McKennitt v Ash and Prince of Wales v Associated Newspapers (Charles's journal case). The difficulty for Kate Middleton will lie in distinguishing between actual invasion of her privacy and the more generic harassment that may give rise to privacy breaches. If a paper published pictures of Middleton going about her ordinary or 'private' business then, in line with recent cases, this will give her a cause of action. The private nature of her activities will engage Article 8 of the European Convention and unless the press can demonstrate a real public interest element in their story and inclusion of the photograph then this is likely to outweigh the freedom of expression conferred under Article 10. Similarly, if a paper publishes a \"non-compliant\" picture it has obtained from a paparazzi or its own snapper then it will fall foul of the PCC code. This is all well and good but the real question is this: While the PCC code may deem \"harassment\" and \"persistent pursuit\" unacceptable and the law will provide a cause of action where privacy has been invaded, what can Ms Middleton actually do to prevent this happening? The answer is, very little. Here lies the flaw in the current system of privacy protection in the UK. It is largely retroactive. Harm has to have been done before a cause of action is engaged. Where the press publish photographs that breach her privacy then she can go to court but, by this stage, that which was private will have been made very public. She could apply to the court for an injunction preventing publication of pictures taken of her going about her private business but while she may be able to provide grounds for such an order it would be difficult to secure an open-ended one covering all media. Even if she were to secure protection against some or all of the UK press, this will do little to keep foreign paparazzi and publications at bay. Consumer demand will always ensure there is a price for her picture, the best she can hope for is to use the law to level the playing field on home ground. \u00b7 Edgar Forbes is senior lecturer in Media Law at Bournemouth University \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
