  "content": "Tweetminster has teamed up with Portland to visualise Twitter buzz about the AV referendum by comparing the average tweets per hour of several events: \u2022 #Yes2AV and #No2AV tweets on April 27: 232.5 TPH (tweets per hour) \u2022 C4news 19:00 edition on April 27: 129 TPH \u2022 Britain's Got Talent on April 30: 64,836 TPH \u2022 BBC Newsnight edition of April 27: 466 TPH \u2022 #Libya tweets on April 28: 1,032 TPH \u2022 #Syria tweets on April 28: 2,554 TPH \u2022 Royal wedding tweets tracked between 8:45-12:45 on April 29: 514,845 TPH \u2022 Tweets about Greek bond yields on April 29: 15.5 TPH The purpose of the infographic is to show conversations about AV within the context of a range of different events. Unsurprisingly, the royal wedding and global news items, like Libya and Syria, have significantly higher volumes, the data shows though that the AV referendum hasn't captured the imagination of many beyond the Westminster village. In fact, more people tweet during an edition of BBC Newsnight than about AV. The Twitter activity of both is significantly smaller than a popular \"national event\" - the latest episode of Britain's Got Talent. On the plus side, AV excites people more than bond curves. The infographic was designed by Tweetminster's Brad Martin and Andrew Walker. \u2022 Get the data Data summary Download the data \u2022 DATA: download the full spreadsheet More open data Data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian World government data \u2022 Search the world's government data with our gateway Development and aid data \u2022 Search the world's global development data with our gateway Can you do something with this data? \u2022 Flickr Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our Flickr group \u2022 Contact us at data@theguardian.com \u2022 Get the A-Z of data \u2022 More at the Datastore directory \u2022 Follow us on Twitter \u2022 Like us on Facebook",
