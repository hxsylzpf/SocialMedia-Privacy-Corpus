  "content": "Premier League football clubs now regularly vet the social media activity of prospective players for evidence of bigotry, hate speech and other illegal and offensive behaviour, following a spate of scandals. Kroll, a private investigation and cybersecurity firm, has trawled the social media accounts of potential signings for several Premier and Champions League clubs, checking their posts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other platforms against a list of more than 1,000 problematic words. Ben Hamilton, a managing director at Kroll, said the list included racist terms; references to extremist beliefs and groups \u2013 such as suicide bombers and the National Front; indications of drug and alcohol misuse; comments about inappropriate sexual activity; and any indications of criminality. The revelation comes after former Sunderland and England footballer Adam Johnson was jailed for six years for grooming and sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Hundreds of messages from social media, messaging and chat apps \u2013 Facebook, WhatsApp and Snapchat \u2013 provided crucial evidence. \"We're looking for any sign of instability,\" said Hamilton. \"Anything that could damage the reputation of a club, whether that's extreme promiscuity, or religious or extremist beliefs. British examples might include the National Front, any anti-Jewish organisation, [the] English Defence League, different words that relate to fascism or suicide bombers, [or the terms] Muslim, Catholic, Republican, pikey, Gypsy.\" The list includes drugs and terms for drug use, words suggesting intolerance towards lesbian and gay people, words describing criminal offences, as well as terms more obviously suspect in a public discussion, such as prostitute and rent boy. The first stage of vetting was an automated search through a player's entire public social media history, Hamilton added. If that flagged up key words, the relevant posts were examined to verify whether they are of real concern. \"We are working with several clubs \u2013 Premier League, Championship \u2013 using these kinds of techniques,\" he said. \"Particular clubs have particular problems, because, for example; they may have Jewish owners or Arab owners.\" He said vetting was more commonly used when British clubs were looking to sign overseas players. If suspicions were serious enough, and the club consented, Hamilton said, they would go to court to get access to a player's activity on private messaging services such as Snapchat and WhatsApp, or force them to hand over any phone that the club had provided or was paying for. Hamilton said they were working with a growing number of clubs after a spate of social media incidents involving Premier League players. The Football Association has imposed more than \u00a3350,000 in fines on players and officials since 2011 for offences including racist and sexist comments. In 2014, former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was suspended for three matches while at Queens Park Rangers and fined \u00a325,000 for directing a jibe at a Twitter follower using the word \"sket\", Caribbean slang for a promiscuous woman. In 2012, the former Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole was ordered to pay \u00a390,000 \u2013 the heaviest fine for a social media infringement \u2013 after he described the FA as a #BUNCHOFTWATS on Twitter. Most clubs provide guidance and training to their teams and academy players. Birmingham City said background checks on new signings covered social media, but they had never withdrawn an offer as a result. Their media team also monitor players' social media activity. Although no British clubs are known to have dismissed players for bad social media behaviour, last July Spanish club Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a called off the signing of Julio Rey less than a week after announcing a deal with him after the club discovered he had insulted them on Twitter. Three years earlier, when he was 17, Rey posted a tweet that read, when translated, \"Fuck Depor, Fuck Riazor [the club's stadium]\". In December, Barcelona released a player just hours after signing him, citing offensive tweets discovered by fans that Sergi Guardiola had posted two years before, backing Real Madrid and insulting Catalonia. John Carr, who sits on the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, the government's advisory body, questioned the fairness of the vetting process. \"When you're posting on Facebook and Snapchat, you're not doing a job application,\" he said. \"If someone is very evidently a dedicated Nazi that's one thing, but the odd silly remark or youthful excess is something else. Obviously, we'd prefer them not to make racist or homophobic remarks, but it's ridiculous that that should end your sporting career.\" He said Johnson's case underlined the responsibility of clubs to ensure that players did not exploit young people. \"They are role models whether they like it or not,\" he said.",
