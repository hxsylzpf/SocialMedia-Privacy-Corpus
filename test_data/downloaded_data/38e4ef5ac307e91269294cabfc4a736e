  "content": "Former footballers and celebrity fans have been reacting to Manchester United's dismissal of the manager David Moyes, after news of his removal at around 8am on Tuesday prompted millions to offer their views on social media. There was a mix of sympathy and some anger following the decision, although many claimed to have seen it coming as Moyes endured a dismal season. The former United captain Roy Keane said the players and club hierarchy needed to take much of the blame for Moyes's failure. \"He certainly had a hard start but I'd look at the chief executive [Ed Woodward] \u2013 he didn't get the deals done,\" Keane said on ITV. \"I think it's a shame, he should have been given more time. Some of the players should be ashamed of themselves, they really let him down.\" Former England, Liverpool and Manchester United player Michael Owen tweeted: \"Huge news at Old Trafford but with the summer looming and a huge transfer kitty available, United had to be 100% Moyes was the right man.\" He added: \"Evidently they didn't have the confidence in him, in which case makes the timing absolutely right. Now the big question is who's next?\" Dwight Yorke, a former United striker, told Sky that Ryan Giggs would be best. \"I think for togetherness and getting the results and playing a certain way, a brand of football that is more eye-catching, the Man United way, I feel that Ryan Giggs is the right person.\" Retired Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher called the decision \"inevitable\", adding: \"Was always going to be difficult but it hasn't gone well. It's been a disastrous season.\" Former United player Paul McGrath claimed Moyes was \"out of his depth\" at Old Trafford. \"I don't think David has the same strong personality as Sir Alex [Ferguson] and it's as simple as that,\" McGrath told the Irish Independent. \"He looked like a man under strain all season.\" Others took a more sympathetic stance to Moyes's removal after 10 months in the job. Match of the Day frontman Gary Lineker said: \"Always thought the manager's job to have at Manchester United was the one after the one after Sir Alex.\" It is thought the final straw was the 2-0 defeat at Everton on Sunday, United's 15th loss this season and one that pushed the reigning Barclays Premier League champions down to seventh. United will now end the season with their lowest Premier League points total. Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti told his press conference in advance of his team's Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich on Wednesday night: \"I am sorry for David Moyes. In general this is the life of a coach. Sometimes things don't come out well and they get rid of you and that's it. I was a bit surprised because Man United is not normally like this. It might be normal in another club but at Man United after 26 years I was surprised.\" Late on Monday, football pundit Robbie Savage tweeted: \"If Moyes is to go, some of the players at Utd need to have a look at themselves some of their performances have been a disgrace!\" Once the news was confirmed on Tuesday morning, he added: \"I honestly feel sorry for David Moyes.\" Sean Bones of the Manchester United Supporters' Trust pointed the finger at the club's owners and accused the club of a \"lack of class and dignity\" in the way they handled the sacking, after the news was leaked to the press before it was officially confirmed. Bones told Sky news: \"It was a risky decision in the first place to appoint Moyes because he wasn't proven at the highest level \u2013 that decision is down to the Glazer family.\" This was echoed by United fan and former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan who also condemned the club: \"If you are going to sack someone at least have the decency to tell them first rather than leak it. Poor from whoever it was at United.\" Cricketer Kevin Pietersen, who was removed from the England team this year, took a more self-deprecating approach to the news, tweeting: \"Anyone got #DavidMoyes details pls? Myself &amp; @piersmorgan want to compare notes &amp; see where we all have gone wrong this year\". Celebrity supporters of the club also joined the fray on social media. Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden said: \"Moysey did a great job for Everton \u2013 I hope this is how he is remembered.\" Former Tottenham chairman Lord Sugar also expressed his commiserations, tweeting: \"Anyone going there the 1st year after Sir A would have struggled. He needs another season.\" Former editor turned television host Piers Morgan, an Arsenal fan, was quick to draw comparisons between his own team and United: \"Moyes followed someone who won 10 trophies in last 9yrs. Next Arsenal manager follows someone who's won nothing in 9yrs. Big difference\". Just before news of his sacking broke, Morgan had tweeted: \"Sir Alex recommended Moyes over [Jos\u00e9] Mourinho because he feared the latter would eclipse his memory too fast. Harsh, selfish, reality.\" TV presenter and lifelong Manchester United fan Eamonn Holmes said: \"I'm sure David Moyes is a nice man, but he just didn't understand our team and our players didn't understand him. This is the right thing.\" \"Not surprised David Moyes has gone,\" added singer and United fan Olly Murs. \"I would have given him the summer to rebuild but we've been awful this season #whoarewegettingnow\".",
