  "content": "Facebook has introduced a new feature, called Facebook Groups. If you're sensible, you will have reserved Facebook for 'true' friends and family and added your work contacts to LinkedIn, which is a far better way (without the incriminating Glastonbury photos) to maintain some kind of professional online relationship with your colleagues. Unfortunately, most of us started using Facebook in a far more ad-hoc way that didn't really allow for that kind of organisation. The new Facebook Groups should help, a little, with that. I tried in vain to use Facebook Lists to manage different groups of contacts - work, friends, family and so on - but functionality was limited and once you'd grouped people, those groups didn't seem connected to enough of the site's other features to be really useful. Tenby Bowling Club - a perfect candidate for Facebook Groups. Photo by lhourahane on Flickr. Some rights reserved. Facebook Groups is an more effective way of managing different groups of contacts. It means you could put all your family members in one group to invite them to a birthday, for example, or send a message about an anniversary. Facebook Lists should have allowed you to select different lists to invite to an event you'd created, for example, but never did. Facebook Groups creates that link between your contacts and your events. It's also a better way of managing colleagues if you are connected on Facebook; where we used to create a network (again, with limited functionality beyond how it affects your privacy setting) a group works much better. In short: a very good addition, if a little overdue. Privacy for Facebook Groups can be turned up to 11 and is set to private by default, so more like sending a Facebook email to to your contacts. Though they can be made public, it makes more sense for 'open' projects - particularly brands and organisations - to use Facebook pages which has more suitable features. Sceptics will note that creating groups of interest and defining your relationships with your contacts even more closely gives Facebook yet more information with which to target their advertising (a group that meets for tennis every weekend? Send them a Wilson ad!) but as ever, the exchange is a free service in exchange for putting up with ads. I'm of the mind that targeted advertising, rather than untargeted junk, is a good thing. Note that there's also a group chat function, but that Facebook has also snuck in a very interesting document sharing feature. While modest at the moment, that signals a seed for a larger document sharing tool that could rival Google Docs. And that really does mean war.",
