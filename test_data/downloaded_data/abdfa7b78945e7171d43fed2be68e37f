Twitter users have fought back by spreading the word about online guerilla tactics which could potentially be used by Iranian users to bypass government-led restrictions. Twitter itself rescheduled their maintenance downtime so as to allow people in Iran to communicate with the world: Some examples of tweets showing solidarity and tips include: Change your Twitter settings to GMT +03:30 Tehran as timezone and change city to Tehran to confuse Iranian censors and Our Iranian friends can access Twitter from 148.233.239.24 Port:80 in Tehran. Can avoid govt filters from here. #iranelection More can be found on censorship and calls to hack government websites here. Meanwhile and perhaps predictably, CNN debated Twitter's relevance, blatantly ignoring how some key events were reported there first by citizens, prompting users to hashtag their tweets #cnnfail. In the same vein, some of the most prolific and informative tweets came from user @persiankiwi, who also blogs in Persian on this site. An excellent set of photographs taken from protests taking place in Paris yesterday can be found here. Monday As Iranian commenters claim that \"traditional media have completely failed\" them following the outcome of Friday's vote, many turned citizen journalists overnight \u2013 using collaborative platforms to publish their pictures and live accounts of what has been happening on the ground as efficiently as possible. Here's a selection of links to some interesting pages in English. Starting with Twitter, comments on the elections can be found grouped together under the #IranElection and #Iranvote tags. These gather tweets from around the world, and are not necessarily from Iranians themselves. For that, a better place to visit is h3x, which has a selection of Iranians on Twitter, with updates unfolding as they tweet, and is updated hourly. A few users stand out from the list, such as Tehranbureau, IranRiggedElect, IranElection09 and Change_for_Iran, a student who started his account last Saturday but already has 11,000 followers: He has tweeted from the protests, where Mousavi supporters were targeted by police with tear gas. He also links to photo blogs such as this one, which documents the aftermath of protests within the University of Tehran. Over on YouTube, amirpix's channel broadcasts footage of the many clashes between young protesters and the police: Always worth a look is Global Voices' coverage, led by blogger Hamid Tehrani. Tehrani not only collected photographs and videos in his posts, he also linked to this cartoon by Iranian cartoonist Nikahang Kosar, which quickly made rounds in the blogosphere (many more can be found on his website): Over on Flickr, the Iran feed brings interesting results and the user mousavi1388 used his account to create a catalogue of pictures of protests organised around the globe, including London, Paris and of course Tehran. The best stream of pictures, however, can be found at Tehranlive.org: On Facebook, I \u2764 IRAN, self-described as a \"student movement for democracy in Iran\" is worth a visit: Finally, interactive maps over at Mibazaar offer updates of both new tweets and YouTube videos: If you know of any twitter feeds, blogs or Flickr accounts which are worth pointing other people to, please post in the thread below.",
