  "content": "In Microsoft's case, range around all the companies it has wooed in the past few years to see whether they would like a tieup; in Yahoo's case, try to placate angry shareholders, who have lost out on what could have been a very good payday. At the last moment, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, increased the per-share offer from $31 (\u00a316) to $34 - but was told by Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo, that only $37 would be enough. That would have valued the company at $51.62bn, rather than Microsoft's $47.5bn. At the time of writing, Yahoo's shares are trading around the $26 mark - better than they were before Microsoft's offer at the end of January, but below most of its 52-week range, which peaked at $33.63 at the end of October. Microsoft is already reported to be wooing AOL (in which Google already has a 5% stake, bought in December 2005, when it fought off Microsoft), and might use its mighty cash mountain to acquire all or a slice of other web properties such as Facebook or MySpace. Meanwhile Yahoo, and especially Yang, will have to come up with a very convincing reason for turning down Microsoft's offer. This will be difficult, since after Microsoft's offer the open market share price never rose above $30. That means its bid was always at a premium on the shares. And Yang, in common with the other Yahoo directors, has a duty to \"increase shareholder value\", all the time. How can turning down a premium-laden offer do that? As the lawsuits from angry shareholders begin to arrive, Yang will have to argue that the Microsoft deal would have gone badly wrong. It was half cash, half Microsoft shares, so at the $31 bid those Yahoo shares would have been replaced with $15.50 in cash and $15.50 worth of Microsoft shares. Strip away all the empty keyword bingo talk (\"we will be able to focus all of our energies on executing the most important transition in our history so that we can maximise our potential to the benefit of our shareholders, employees, partners and users\"); the fact is that Yang's only way to avoid being booted out by pitchfork-wielding shareholders such as Bill Miller, portfolio manager for Legg Mason, which owns 7% of Yahoo (and is its second-biggest shareholder), is to demonstrate somehow that on taking over Yahoo, Microsoft's shares would have fallen in value so much that former Yahoo stockholders would have been out of pocket. We'll await that Powerpoint presentation with great interest. Meanwhile, Ballmer's position isn't strong either. Why start something you aren't prepared to finish? If Yahoo was worth $47.5bn, why not $4bn (or 8%) more - an amount of cash Microsoft has generated since lodging its bid? Neither company looks strong: both look adrift, searching for an online strategy. Expect at least one of Ballmer and Yang to be gone by year-end.",
