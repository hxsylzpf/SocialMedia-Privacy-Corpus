  "content": "The uncle of a 12-year-old girl who was strangled and stabbed to death was charged with her murder today, police said. John Maden, 37, was arrested after the body of Tia Rigg was found at his home in Manchester after a 999 call on Saturday. Tia was found dead at the property in Dalmain Close after a call to emergency services at around 3.45pm. Police have released postmortem results which show she died from strangulation with a ligature and a series of stab wounds to her stomach. Detective Superintendent Mary Doyle, head of the murder inquiry, yesterday described Tia as \"a happy, normal, healthy 12-year-old girl \u2013 she had friends, socialised normally and was in the flush of youth\". Tia's parents and her three younger brothers and sisters were described by Doyle as \"devastated, with their world falling apart\". A RIP Tia Rigg Facebook page where people could leave tributes had attracted more than 3,000 members by tonight. Maden of Dalmain Close, Cheetham Hill, will appear before Manchester city magistrates tomorrow.",
