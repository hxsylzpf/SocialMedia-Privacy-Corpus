  "content": "The Mail on Sunday could become embroiled in a police anti-corruption investigation, after publishing an article revealing that transport union chief Bob Crow hitched a lift to work on the back of a colleague's scooter during the closure of the London Underground's central line last year. The paper reported in February 2003 that Mr Crow, the general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, had ridden pillion on the back of his personal assistant Adrian Scott's scooter to the union's Euston Road HQ. It is not known how the Mail on Sunday discovered who owned the vehicle. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has confirmed that ownership details of vehicle number plates are confidential and cannot be released to the press. The Metropolitan police contacted the RMT in connection with its Operation Glade anti-corruption investigation, which is looking into links between police and the media, part of which centres on a request for ownership details of Mr Scott's scooter. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
