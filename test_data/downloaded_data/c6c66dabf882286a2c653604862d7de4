  "content": "It was love at first \"like\". When Arte Vann, of New York, and Erica Harris, of California, connected on Instagram last winter, they clicked immediately. They quickly fell in love while dating long-distance, and finally met face-to-face for the first time on Friday night at the LA Ontario international airport. Within an instant, Vann proposed and the two got married in the unlikely confines of the southern California airport terminal. By Tuesday morning, the newlyweds were moving into a house together and enjoying their new celebrity status as the unlikely Insta-marriage couple. \"We're still amazed,\" said a giddy Harris, 36. \"We'll sit and stare into each other's eyes, and we're still in shock that we have each other.\" \"It was the best moment of my life,\" added Vann, 40, recounting when they hugged for the first time after he got off his flight \u2013 for which he had purchased a one-way ticket. \"I was so happy. It was such a long road without having her \u2026 I waited for a very long time.\" In February of 2015, Harris (@beauty_deride) stumbled on the Instagram account of Vann (@inkflow_prodigy), who often posts images of his original writing on the photo-sharing site. She \"liked\" one of his posts \u2013 a poem \u2013 and started following him. He immediately followed back, and soon the two were rapidly exchanging messages and flirting in the comment sections of each other's photos. \"She was just really funny and really spontaneous,\" said Vann, recalling his first impression of her. \"She just made me smile. I could tell she was such a good person and a great mother and that she cared about people.\" After it got too tiring to type messages on their smartphones, they decided to talk on the phone. \"Our words were flying at each other, and we just talked for five hours straight,\" Harris said. Vann, who was working as a chef at a resort, said he didn't get any sleep the night of their first phone call. After that conversation, any doubts they had about each other and the authenticity of their Instagram personas quickly began to vanish. They started talking daily \u2013 often for hours on end, at times even falling asleep together while they were still on the line, Vann said. Within a week, Vann told her that he loved her \u2013 and although Harris was at first scared to admit it out loud, she soon told him that she had also fallen in love with him. Harris said she had been very skeptical of men after a difficult marriage had fallen apart. Although she had dabbled in online dating, she never thought she would meet someone special on the internet, especially on a random site like Instagram. But she couldn't ignore their instant connection. \"We feel so blessed that we have each other.\" At one point during their relationship, the two even temporarily deleted their Instagram accounts so they would stop wasting time on the site and getting distracted by anonymous commenters. They've since rejoined the site and now have hundreds of fans liking their photos and congratulating them on their marriage. They both said they were anxious to meet in real life, but never worried that it would be awkward or that their love would not be equally powerful in person. \"It was magical,\" Harris said of the moment they finally met. Because Vann's mother was not able to attend the airport ceremony, Harris invited a CBS Los Angeles reporter to film the rapid proposal and wedding so that they would have video footage to share. Within a day, the Insta-couple's story spread across social media, with reporters from across the country trying to reach the lovebirds. Harris never anticipated their story would go viral, but she said they were happy to use the 15 minutes of fame to remind people that it's possible to find love in the most unexpected places. \"We were both so broken. We want to share with other broken people out there that there's hope,\" she said. \"We've found healing through this love.\"",
