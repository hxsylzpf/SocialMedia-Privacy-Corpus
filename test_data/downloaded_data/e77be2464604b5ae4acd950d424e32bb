The $10bn concept announced by Elon Musk captured the imagination of engineers, although it will take a lot more than an idea to make a reality.  \u2022 'Concorde meets a railgun meets an air hockey table' IFTTT To the uninitiated, IFTTT is a random series of letters but to believers, this ingenious service will help knit one service to another. If you can think of anything that you need connected - your photostream to your Dropbox, an auto email when it looks like rain, or auto-save all your tweets in a much more searchable spreadsheet.
