  "content": "Having been forced to rush-release six songs from her album Rebel Heart after it leaked before Christmas, Madonna has chosen Snapchat as the unlikely conduit for her new video. The photo-sharing app's new Discover channel posted the video for Living for Love on Thursday afternoon. In keeping with Snapchat's self-destructing ethos, it will be deleted from the app 24 hours later. Directed by JACK, a French duo who have made adverts for Ikea, the video is a relatively straightforward performance clip featuring Madonna in a matador's outfit dancing with a group of men in masks and bull's horns. Its simplicity \u2013 particularly in contrast with Madonna's previous videos \u2013 suggests that it is designed to be viewed on mobile. Last year, Snapchat's value was estimated at $10bn, while the company claimed that over 700m videos and photographs were sent on its platform per day. Discover is set to include content from media partners including CNN, Vice and ESPN. Emails leaked in the Sony hack suggest that Snapchat has had ambitions to launch a digital music service. Sony's chief executive, Michael Lynton, is on the board of Snapchat. Snapchat is hugely popular with millennials, an audience Madonna is keen to reach. She is set to perform Living for Love at the Grammys in Los Angeles on Sunday.",
