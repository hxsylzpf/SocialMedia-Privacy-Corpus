  "content": "It's been a couple of years since I offered my (very personal) predictions for the coming year. Make a note in your diaries: in 12 months, we'll come back and find out how I did. (And send your comments now to charles.arthur@guardian.co.uk.) You can also listen to the Tech Weekly podcast team's look ahead to 2008. And now ... General \u2022 Energy use will matter more and more in 2008. Big data centres can use astonishing amounts of power running 24 hours, seven days a week, year-round; as electricity prices keep rising, driven by all sorts of exterior forces (such as oil and gas wholesale prices), the people in charge of computing will have to think about how to use less energy to do the same things. Intel is increasingly focused on \"processing power per watt\", and that will become more important to companies that choose to run their own systems. But equally, more and more companies will choose to move to try... \u2022 \"Cloud computing\". Amazon's S3 service now offers web hosting, processing and even database processing in \"the cloud\": there's no identifiable place where your data is held or processed. (See Nick Carr's piece in Thursday's Technology section.) In addition to rising energy costs, \"sizing\" your system can be difficult. This is because you can never know when some unpredictable event - being mentioned on a site such as Digg leading to a sudden influx of new users, say, or news events directing a lot of people to your site - will crash your servers. So the ability to call in other companies' computing resources could be a lifesaver. \u2022 Microsoft will consider splitting itself into two companies, one for operating systems and another for applications, just as Justice Thomas Penfield Jackson recommended in the recent antitrust trial. And if it doesn't, it damn well ought to: is it really getting any value from being larger? Is it more agile? Microsoft is also likely to see its revenues dip as corporations squeezed by the credit crunch hold off those expensive new software installations. \u2022 Data privacy and sharing will rocket up the charts. Facebook will see a surge in people leaving as they realise that it really is watching what they're doing, even when they're not on the site. In the UK, ID cards will be debated under the same data privacy banner; and the question of why the US government gets to know when and where we're flying, and why we pass so much data across the Atlantic to a country that doesn't even have a concept of data protection, will be raised more urgently. Apple ... \u2022 will easily hit its \"10m iPhones sold in the first year\" target. \u2022 will offer five updates to its new Leopard operating system, so by the end of the year it should be well worth using \u2022 will see growth in music sales through its iTunes Store slow as phone makers and networks improve their music consumption services \u2022 will not launch a music subscription service, even though it is forecast to do this for video. Why? Because video is generally a consume-once product, but you want to keep music, and Apple reasons that people will get annoyed if the music they like listening to vanishes if they haven't kept up a subscription. By comparison, I'll bet that if someone stole all your DVDs but left the boxes, it would take you weeks to notice. I'm sure Apple has the technology to do music subscription, but to do so would also vindicate rivals who already do it. \u2022 won't launch a tablet computer. This is always a safe bet. The iPhone doesn't count - it's not running Mac OSX, but OSX. Subtle difference. Wires and wireless \u2022 BT will begin introducing its ADSL2+ service offering broadband speeds of, yes, \"up to\" 24Mbps. Ministers and consumer groups will complain because not everybody can get 24Mbps - demonstrating that the laws of physics can't be repealed, no matter how many people stamp their foot. When BT explains how much it would cost to connect homes to its fibre network - the process that bankrupted cable companies in the 1990s - and how much of this it will pass on to its customers, the idea of \"up to 24Mbps\" will become a lot more attractive. \u2022 Zigbee, UWB and WiMax - wireless methods for the home, short range and long range - will finally begin to have an impact. \u2022 wireless radios like the Reciva will gain some traction as people realise they can use them to pipe both radio and their music around the home via the wireless routers they bought in 2007. \u2022 caps on broadband accounts will be raised, but not lifted - shovelling data around still costs money in terms of infrastructure. Spam and malware \u2022 By the end of 2008, there still won't be a self-propagating worm affecting Mac OSX. I've made this prediction every year since 2001, and it's been one to rely on \u2014 though malware writers are beginning to focus on Apple's platform, so this isn't such a banker as before. \u2022 Spam, which has colonised email and web commentary, will try to invade some of the microformat systems such as Twitter. Dave Winer has already considered a proof-of-concept for Twitter. But interactive systems such as instant messaging have been resilient to spam; the microformat ones have interactivity halfway between email and instant messenging, so it will be interesting to see whether spam withers or survives there. \u2022 Malware writers will turn their attention to the developing world - specifically, the Intel Classmate and OLPC laptops. It's a market with almost zero malware protection; infect machines in those places with viruses and Trojans, and they'll likely never be cleaned up. Ker-ching! \u2022 We'll find out who was behind the Storm worm, and why. We'll say goodbye ... \u2022 to Vonage, which has struggled since its IPO (initial public offering) with patent lawsuits and service troubles. The credit crunch will chew it up: people won't renew contracts and it will burn through its cash in lawsuits and services. \u2022 to Napster, which might get sold (a year after the For Sale sign was put up) but might just die quietly. As a brand, it's got a split personality and deserves to be put out of its misery. \u2022 to SCO, finally, at long last; it tried to sue Linux off the face of the earth - about as feasible as winning a war on terror - and discovered that Linux had a big, lawyered-up friend, namely IBM. Financial and government \u2022 The credit crunch will have widespread effects; banks are going to try to hoard cash to shore up their liquidity ratios, after borrowing and lending too freely using exotic financial instruments. Everything flows (or doesn't) from that. \u2022 Stock market flotation won't be an option for most companies. Facebook will have to get through a year in which advertising may drop off, with just some venture capital money to keep it going. It'll be hard to sell another slice as it did to Microsoft in 2007. \u2022 Companies which are highly geared (have high debts compared with their assets) will struggle, or die. This includes lots of wannabe Facebooks and other web 2.0 companies. \u2022 HM Revenue and Customs won't discover its lost discs, but examination of government procedures will show laxity and poor practice over data protection and transport that would shame a beginner's class in IT. The idea that we should each \"own\" the personal data the government has about us (such as health records) will gain traction - to little effect, because government likes accumulating data: it's a modern form of capital, a central bank that grows in value faster than you put data in. \u2022 Guardian Technology's Free Our Data campaign will find more countries that are benefiting from government giving away personal data for free; the report on trading funds, due this month, will be equivocal about the benefit of free data. Absent a big brave experiment by government, we'll be left with a poorer information economy. Music \u2022 All of the music majors will offer their songs in DRM (digital rights management)-free formats through at least one online store - though not necessarily Apple's, because they're worried about its increasing dominance. \u2022 Microsoft will wake up from its dream and tell Universal - which currently gets $1 per Zune music player sold - that it's doing fine now, thanks, and the Zune can stand on its own feet without paying tithes. Out of this world \u2022 \"Passenger space services\" will be delayed. Again. \u2022 The UK won't commit to building enough new nuclear power stations to close the gap between future energy demand and domestic supply as the government leaves solving the problem of having to buy oil and gas from a prickly country (Russia) to a future administration. Look at it this way: nuclear power generates waste that hangs around for ages. But we know how to deal with it: capture it and bury it. Fossil fuels, by contrast, generate waste that hangs around for ages but which we don't capture and don't have any effective means to bury. Only one makes sea levels rise and ice caps melt. So remind me what was so bad about nuclear again? \u2022 The phenomenon of \"electrosensitivity\" (and associated stories about Wi-Fi and mobile phones) will continue to resist hard scientific analysis: experiments will show no link but newspapers and TV programmes, who love a story with a good anecdote, will keep on. \u2022 Duke Nukem Forever's makers announce a ship date (it's only 10 years later, come on.) Unfortunately it never ships because some bright spark will realise that the way to exploit \"zero point energy\" - the energy of empty space - is to reverse the expansion of the universe, because that creates free energy at a point. No global warming! Unfortunately doing this causes the universe to implode to a singularity, causing the end of existence. Actually, I hope I'm wrong on this one. So: right? Wrong? What are yours?
