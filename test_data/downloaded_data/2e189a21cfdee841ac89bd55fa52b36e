  "content": "Paul Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail, today declared that he \"passionately believes\" in self-regulation of the press and that any moves to introduce privacy laws would be bad for democracy. In a submission to the commons select committee inquiry into privacy, Mr Dacre, who sits on the press complaints commission, said special laws to safeguard privacy of those not in public life would not benefit anyone. And he said he could not \"overstate the shame\" felt by a newspaper when it is censured by the PCC. \"As someone who has spent over 30 years in Fleet Street I have no hesitation in saying that, as regards to such things as privacy, the industry's behaviour over this period has improved considerably. The PCC has been responsible for much of that improvement,\" he told the committee. \"The industry in general, and newspapers in particular, take the PCC extremely seriously. On the Mail, the code of conduct now governs our every thought and action. All journalists employed by me have the code written into their contract. It is difficult to overstate the shame felt by a paper when the commission upholds a complaint against it. \"It is my conviction that, in a democratic society, self-regulation is the only acceptable way to regulate the press in matters which are not already covered in law. A special law on privacy would not benefit 'people not generally in public life'. \"It would surely be a sad day for the people of Britain - especially those 'not generally in public life' - if your committee came to the conclusion that further legal restrictions were necessary. A free press is an essential part of a true and great democracy - even if the cost of that freedom is that occasionally there are lapses of judgement or mistakes made by editors.\" He added: \"The whole question of privacy, media intrusion and the behaviour of a free press is of vital importance in our society.\" \"The press in this country works under some of the most stringent and powerful laws of any western democracy. \"To add more would add to the burden not only on a free press, but on the courts - and force ordinary people into the onerous and expensive process of going to law to exercise their rights. That is why I passionately believe that an efficient process of self-regulation protects 'people not generally in the public life' much better than a statutory one. \"It is perhaps worth pointing out that, despite the explosion of different media technology over the past 50 years, the printed press in Britain remains remarkably popular. \"It's also worth emphasising that if people don't approve of their paper's conduct they can always stop buying it or switch to another title. \"Indeed, when you consider the depth of national coverage and that of an extremely robust and varied provincial and local newspaper industry, it is surely remarkable that there are not more breaches of the PCC code. Dacre is one of six newspaper editors who sit on the press complaints commission.",
