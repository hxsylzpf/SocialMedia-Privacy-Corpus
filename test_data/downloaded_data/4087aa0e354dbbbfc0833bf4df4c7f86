  "content": "Racist internet trolls may not be too happy with the new trailer for the new Star Wars movie, but the film's key cast members are clearly feeling the Force. Daisy Ridley, who plays staff-wielding scavenger Rey, and John Boyega (rogue stormtrooper Finn) both took to Instagram to reveal their instant reactions to the latest trailer for JJ Abrams' movie. \"Totally emotional seeing it for the first time and so so so incredibly awed to be part of this incredible legacy,\" wrote a tearful Ridley, with Boyega adding: \"THE TRAILER IS JUST EEEEPPPPPPPIIIIICCCCCCC!\" Jurassic World star Chris Pratt, whose film looks likely to be overhauled as the No 1 film of 2015 at the global box office when The Force Awakens debuts, called the trailer \"absolutely awesome\". The preview, which has had more than seven million views on YouTube in just a few hours, also found favour with fanboy icons such as Kevin Smith, Harry Knowles and ... ahem ... Captain America, who called it \"a heck of a trailer\". Others were less impressed. Fan Andy Gibbons was upset that George Lucas's valiant work building plausible realpolitik into the Star Wars mythos (in the prequel movies) appeared to have been abandoned by Abrams. And Darth Vader himself became extremely emotional after viewing the crumpled, ruined mask that once represented such evil majesty. Star Wars: The Force Awakens hits UK cinemas on 17 December, while US multiplexes get Abrams's movie 24 hours later.",
