  "content": "John Prescott has written to the Conservative leader, David Cameron, demanding that he sack his communications director Andy Coulson following the Guardian's revelations about phone-hacking by the News of the World. The former deputy prime minister's letter, posted on his website and on the Guardian's Comment is free, says: \"your 'very relaxed' attitude to these allegations seriously calls your judgment into question. If they are true, Mr Coulson is not fit to enter Government as your Director of Communications if you are elected or indeed, remain in his current post.\" A spokesman for Cameron said last night that he was \"relaxed\" about the revelations, which reveal the methods used by News of the World reporters to obtain stories during Coulson's time as editor of the paper. The Tory leader has today defended Coulson, telling journalists outside his home: \"Of course I knew about that resignation before offering him the job. But I believe in giving people a second chance.\" Coulson's job was safe, he added. Prescott is one of dozens of politicians and celebrities targeted by News of the World journalists, who allegedly hacked into mobile phones messages and secured information about home addresses and telephone numbers from BT, the DVLA and other agencies. Coulson edited the paper for four years until January 2007, when he resigned after its former royal editor, Clive Goodman, was jailed for obtaining information illegally. Prescott also called on Cameron to ensure that Coulson, the Conservative Party's director of communications, \"fully cooperates\" with the Commons culture select committee, which announced today that it will investigate the new revelations. Tory MP John Whittingdale, the committee's chairman, said it was \"highly likely\" to call Coulson to give evidence. Executives from News Group Newspapers, the News International subsidiary that publishes the News of the World, told the committee that Goodman was acting alone and without the knowledge of executives during its original 2007 investigation into Fleet Street practices. \"You now appear to be the only person satisfied with Mr Coulson's role whilst every other relevant authority is investigating the claims,\" Prescott wrote. \"In light of this, will you ensure that Mr Coulson fully co-operates with the Select Committee and, if called, attends to give evidence.\" The Metropolitan police are also \"urgently investigating\" the allegations after they were criticised for failing to inform some of those targeted by the paper, including Prescott, and are expected to make a statement as early as today. The Press Complaints Commission is also to look again at the phone-hacking allegations. After the Guardian revealed he was targeted by the News of the World, Prescott said: \"I find it staggering that there could be a list known to the police of people who had their phone tapped. \"I'm named as one of them. For such a criminal act not to be reported to me, and for action not to be taken against the people who have done it, reflects very badly on the police, and I want to know their answer.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
