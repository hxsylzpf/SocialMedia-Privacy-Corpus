The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it seemed likely that a criminal breach of the data protection act had occurred after a Sun reporter bought bank details from an Indian man who claimed to get them from corrupt call centre workers. The ICO said: \"It is a matter of great concern that such customer details were apparently obtained so easily. \"It seems likely that a criminal breach of the Data Protection Act 1998 has occurred. We will be contacting the City of London police, as well as taking the matter up with those UK companies whose customers' details have been provided to the Sun. \"There are clearly questions for them to answer regarding the steps they are taking to ensure the security of customer data that call centre staff have access to.\" He added that companies that used third parties to provide services involving the use of personal data, such as call centres, were legally required to ensure the reliability of these third parties and remained liable for any failures to adopt appropriate security. However, Steven Philippsohn, senior partner at law firm Philippsohn Crawfords Berwald, said data protection laws could be difficult to enforce in cases involving offshore call centres. \"The hazard with offshore operations is that data protection laws are often not in place and are difficult to enforce,\" he said. \"Even if the offshore company is seeking to improve and certify its security, rapid staff turnover only worsens this problem. \"Any cost savings for UK businesses need to be offset by the damage to consumer confidence and the rising tide of identity theft. As identity-related crimes increase, they will make compensation a growing burden to industry.\" The Sun reporter was sold account details, including the issue and expiry dates of bank cards, the three digit security number from the back of the card, passwords and answers to security questions, for just \u00a33 each. The details would be enough to enable a criminal to take money from someone's account, buy goods over the internet or telephone using their credit card or apply for credit in their name. A number of high-street banks including Barclays, the Woolwich, HSBC and Lloyds TSB, said they were investigating the matter, although they all stressed that they did not yet know if their customers had been involved. A spokeswoman for the City of London Police said: \"All the financial institutions identified have been fully informed of the situation. \"An investigation is now under way. At this stage we are not fully aware of the breadth of what we are going to be investigating. We have been handed information and it is being reviewed.\" This is not the first time Indian call centre workers have been involved in a security breach. In April, 16 workers were arrested after allegedly defrauding American customers of Citiibank of US$350,000. It was claimed the employees at offshoring firm Mphasis, which runs call centres in Bangalore and Pune, tricked the customers into giving the pins for their accounts. In response, industry chiefs in India recommended setting up a voluntary nationwide database of call centre staff who have security clearance. Many banks, building societies, insurance firms and credit card companies in the UK have outsourced jobs to countries such as India, where labour costs are cheaper. British companies that outsource to India, such as Norwich Union and HSBC, insist they have adequate security in place to prevent fraud. The Amicus union, which represents many British call centre staff, has called on the European Commission to prevent unauthorised access to details when they are processed abroad. Research for Amicus last November showed that 18,000 jobs had been switched overseas from the UK in a 12-month period since October 2003. The union said it had cost the economy \u00a32.7bn in lost income and predicted a further 12,000 jobs will be switched before October this year. Lloyds TSB set up a call centre in India last year. Commenting on security, Mary Walsh, a spokeswoman for the bank, said customer security was a \"very, very important priority\", and that standards for recruitment were the same in India as at its UK call centres. \"We have very stringent security measures in place in terms of how we recruit and the types if checks that are done at recruitment and while people are working for us,\" she said. \"The profile of the people working at the call centre would be same wherever it was.\" She added that its systems were under constant review to see if they could be improved. \"We invest an awful lot of time, money and manpower in this part of the business.\" However, research carried out by Alliance &amp; Leicester last year suggested the British public were unsure about the security of overseas call centres. Almost nine in 10 customers questioned said they would prefer not to have their banking or other financial services needs serviced by an offshore call centre, and over half (51%) of those surveyed said they were concerned about the security of their personal information. A similar number (47%) thought they would experience lower levels of service.",
