At its peak on Thursday night, more than 40 hours of footage was being uploaded a minute. And it's perhaps inevitable that Justin Bieber quickly became the first user to attract 1m likes for an Instagram clip. Brands were also among the early adopters of Instagram video, including Burberry, Lululemon, Jeep and Gap. So how is the advertising industry feeling about the new features, how they compare to Twitter's existing Vine app, and where they fit in to the wider rise of super-shortform video? The Guardian canvassed the views of a number of agencies in the UK to get their instant reactions to Instagram video. In general, it's being welcomed, but with a recognition that it shouldn't be judged by its first few days. \"It is a natural addition to Instagram's product \u2013 more evolution than revolution. However, this is social media so it is greeted as a revolution,\" says Jim Dowling, managing director of creative agency Cake. \"We will see a glut of videos of shrinking cappuccinos and cats jumping around a bit. How the dust settles over the course of the next few months will be interesting.\" The fact that the new features are instantly available to Instagram's 130m active users \u2013 well, those who have updated to the latest version of the app \u2013 is the key selling point for many agencies. Several draw the obvious comparison to Vine, which had 13m iPhone users in early June, plus between 1m and 5m installs since then on Android (according to Google Play store stats \u2013 hence the range). \"What makes it [Instagram video] arguably more valuable for brands is Instagram's existing bigger user base, especially for brands who have built Instagram followers, and the ability to apply filters,\" says Mark Holden, head of futures at media planning and buying agency Arena. \"15 seconds also starts to take it into advertising-length formats, so it opens the possibility of putting a bit more craft into video in a way that we can already with Vine, but could grow into a tool for making reactive advertising that could be distributed beyond Facebook or social media.\" Not just TV ads The 15-second length is a topic of some debate among agencies already. Some, like Holden, welcome it on the grounds that 15-seconds is already an established ad-length in the TV world. \"The 15-second format is killer. Advertisers and brands are used to the format and comfortable with it. Coupled with the reach afforded by Instagram's 130 million user base, brands have a huge engagement opportunity from day one,\" says Jonathan Lyon, global director of strategic insight at marketing and technology agency LBi. Alex Wills, group director, digital studio at digital advertising agency R/GA, agrees. \"Instagram's 15 second format lends itself really well to ads \u2013 it's no mistake that the length is the same as a standard television commercial,\" he says. \"Instagram's emphasis on control means you can delete cuts, create longer videos and choose your thumbnail for more beautiful, considered content \u2013 brands can really take advantage of this.\" Not everyone is so enthusiastic though, with the key concern being that the longer the maximum clip length, the greater the danger that advertising creatives will take the safe option when addressing it. \"I fear they will see these mediums as simply further media buying options as opposed to new mediums in of themselves,\" says Sam Haseltine, social media strategist at Greenlight. \"The current average length of a television advert is approximately 30-seconds. The translation of 30-seconds of messaging into 15-seconds is far more attainable than 6-seconds. Under imposed constraints users are at their most creative and I fear that we could find brands opt for the easier solution of migrating existing videos rather than pursue true creativity.\" He's supported by Justin Taylor, managing director of digital for media planning and buying agency MEC UK. \"One of the challenges with 15 second videos on these online platforms is that it can be easy for brands to simply to use a shortened version of their existing TV spot on these,\" he says. \"The trick is to avoid this way of thinking, as the most interesting and engaging Vines are being produced by brands that create content bespoke to the platform and not from creative that has simply been repurposed.\" Practical content not ads Instagram video \u2013 and Vine for that matter \u2013 aren't just for reheated ads, then. What else could brands be doing with shortform video within these apps? \"Instagram Video also has the potential to be far more useful for brands. 15 seconds is enough time to answer a customer question, for example,\" says James Devon, planning director at branding agency MBA. Cake's Dowling agrees, and compares Instagram's potential with a trend that he already sees on YouTube for practical content. \"There is a simple trend for consuming snack-sized media: image and video led, in short form. YouTube in particular, has developed into a search facility,\" says Dowling. \"People hunt for 'how to' do things. 6 or 15 second video format is a great length for that. Show me how a phone works, show me how to install a dishwasher, show me an item of clothing \u2013 and get on with it please. The format works very well for both practical and engaging content.\" Will some brands and agencies still be lazy and shunt existing videos into Instagram? Actually, that's more difficult than you might think, since you can't import videos from your camera roll as you can photos. \"As a consumer, the best news about the launch of Instagram video is that you can't import video \u2013 you have to shoot it in the app,\" says Iain Miller, head of innovation at creative agency Rufus Leonard. \"Hopefully this will mean brands will try and understand what the medium is really good for, and create great new stuff - rather than lazily applying a filter to their existing TV ads.\" Vine comparisons There's an obvious answer to the question of whether Instagram video is a \"Vine killer\" (or vice versa), and it's this: there's room for both. Yet that in itself gives brands and agencies an interesting challenge: which to use and when. More obvious answers: choose the app that's right for your brand's audience, and if both are suitable, create videos for each that make use of its unique aspects, rather than shoving the same footage into both. Miller thinks that brands who got in early to Vine may benefit on Instagram video. \"Those that have been playing with Vine already will be at a significant advantage when it comes to creating content for this new format \u2013 Burberry's forays in particular offer a great guide for brands looking at how to use Vine,\" he says. \"But it's not all straight-forward \u2013 replicating content from other channels won't necessarily work.\" Haseltine suggests that Instagram and Vine remain two very different beasts. \"At 15-seconds Instagram Video is a micro-video service, whilst Vine at 6-seconds is a new medium in itself,\" he says. \"I believe that the integration with Facebook will be the differentiator between Instagram and Vine in terms of both audience and the type of content we expect to see published.\" There are some dissenters to the assumption that video will be welcomed by all Instagram users. Adam Lawrenson, creative director at brand interaction consultancy Digit, warns that more features doesn't necessarily mean more user satisfaction. \"When you start adding more complexity I think it detracts from the purity of Instagram. That's what attracted people onto it the first place, and that's what differentiates it from other social platforms,\" he says. \"That's not to say it won't be a success, it almost certainly will be for some, but for the people who really love it for its purity I suspect it will be a bit of a disappointment.\" Future potential What about the wider implications of shortform video on apps like Instagram and Vine, not to mention pre-roll videos on YouTube and other platforms? \"As consumers become more used to consuming content at speed, maybe 15 seconds will become the new 'norm' for TV advertising as well,\" says Simon Rutherford, managing director of social media agency Cubaka. \"Since the first Flash banners in the 1990s internet advertising has had to battle with the reality that it could not match TV advertising's sheer creative and visual impact. Perhaps this is the turning point, where the lure of filtered 15 second films, achieved at a cut price compared to big budget 30 second TV ads, tips the balance.\" Other agencies think brands need to look for outside help to make their shortform social videos more engaging. \"What will be interesting for brands is whether they open up their social media to creative guest ambassadors. If brands can put out instant video from pop-bands straight to social, it might make for exciting partnerships, but also very risky content,\" says Chris Baylis, executive creative director at Tribal DDB London. \"It will be right for some brands but not others. Otherwise, it will just be used as a cheap short film platform which will be fashionable for a while, but will be superseded by the next thing in 6 months.\" He adds that the most important thing is to stop focusing on the delivery method \u2013 be it Instagram, Vine or other apps \u2013 and talk more about what they're being used to watch. \"When Pixar released their first short film using their revolutionary computer generated animation techniques, people kept asking what software they were using,\" says Baylis. \"Their success has never been down to the software, it was all about the story tellers. And so it is with short form shareable video. It may democratise the making process, but creativity is still a meritocracy.\"",
