  "content": "Jack Straw today announced plans to amend the coroners and justice bill to limit the extent to which it could be used to allow inquests to be held in private. The justice secretary told MPs that he was \"fundamentally\" recasting his plans in response to complaints from civil liberty campaigners opposed to the way the bill would allow inquests to be held without juries in cases involving sensitive information with implications for national security. He also confirmed that proposals in the bill to allow information collected by one government department to be shared with another had been put on hold. Straw said that in response to concerns raised by MPs he was tabling three sets of amendments to the bill: \u2022 The rules allowing the justice secretary to sign a certificate allowing a non-jury interest would be \"significantly tightened\". \u2022 The final decision as to whether the non-jury inquest went ahead would be taken by a high court judge, sitting as a coroner, and not the secretary of state. \u2022 There would be a right of appeal against the decision to the court of appeal. Straw told MPs that he hoped coroners would decide that the use of special measures such as \"jisting\" \u2013 outlining the jist of sensitive information to juries \u2013 would prevent the need for secret inquests in most cases. Straw said: \"There will be circumstances \u2013 I think they will be very few and far between \u2013 where the learned judge may decide that the only way in which the protected information can be the subject of a proper judgment by the court, but also protected itself, will be for the judge to sit alone without a jury. But, in many cases, I hope that the judge will come to the view that it would be adequate for the information in the protected information to be jisted \u2013 summarised in a safe way \u2013 to the jury.\" Isabella Sankey of Liberty said the concessions were cosmetic. \"It is a well-established Whitehall trick to draft the most unpalatable law with a view to making supposed concessions at the last minute,\" she added. \"What about the victims? Where is the comfort for the soldier's widow when a judge feels bound to grant a politician's secret inquest?\" Michael Wills, one of Straw's junior ministers, confirmed that the controversial plans in the bill to allow the bulk transfer of data between departments, agencies and councils had been dropped. Dominic Grieve, the shadow justice secretary, described the move as a \"belated U-turn\". But Wills said ministers were just responding to concerns and that the plans would be redrafted and reintroduced in the future.",
