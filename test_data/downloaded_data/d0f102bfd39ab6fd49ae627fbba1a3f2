  "content": "Love rats and emotional roller- coasters follow in a moment, but first let's remind ourselves what this infernal, amorphous thing called 'Privacy' is all about. Call the Press Complaints Commission code, stressing everyone's right 'to respect for his or her family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital communications'. Call article eight of the European Convention on Human Rights, singing the same tune with Wagnerian force. Call, as a matter of record, Mr Justice Eady, who granted an injunction to one 'sporting celebrity' to stop his wife and family finding out about said celeb's affair with a singer half his age. So, with a heavy heart, to Ashley Cole of Chelsea and England, Cheryl Cole, his pop star bride, plus an assortment of hairdressers, ex-air hostesses and former beauty queens who've 'romped' with Ashley before or after his fragrant \u00a3500,000 nuptials - and now romp across pages of the Sunday Mirror. But this is a romp with a difference. Blonde romper Brooke Healy from Edinburgh tells the Sunday Mirror she was paid \u00a36,300 in cash for signing a declaration saying: 'I did not sleep with Ashley Cole and I will not go to the papers and say I did.' Brunette romper Coralie Robinson from New Zealand says she got \u00a310,000 from Cole for signing a more legal document (with a solicitor present) stating that she 'had never at any time had a sexual relationship of any nature with him' and pledging to destroy all text messages, emails, notes and telephone recordings suggesting otherwise. Thus there would appear to be three options for Ashley. Beg Cheryl's forgiveness (if she stays around long enough to hear it). Find a sympathetic judge who will dish out injunctions to stop Mrs Cole from learning about facts that would hurt her. Or pay those who say they've been kissed big money never to tell. Privacy, in short, can be bought and sold like sausages. Some solicitors I've talked to hadn't heard of this happening before; for them the Brooke and Coralie tale was a first. Others knew all about a trend two or three years old that can shut up the one-night standers, irate mistresses, discarded Wags et al. They are in business to sell their stories to a red-top. Right: instead, the afflicted celebrity - maybe on \u00a390,000 a week, say - buys the story himself and buries it. Why haven't we heard what was happening? Well, we wouldn't, would we? Not hearing is the point of the exercise. And is the idea so very bizarre? English privacy law basically grows out of confidentiality statutes, where paying for secrecy and silence is often the name of the game. You may shrug, smile sourly and walk away. Sordid stories, pitiful people, torrid tosh... Does it matter who pays the gabby girls to shut up? Or perhaps then, in exceptional circumstances, to 'open their hearts' and get paid twice over? But there is one bit of brute realism to register and remember. Privacy, and the law gathering around it, is always presented in terms of innocents invaded, simple lives crushed, honest illusions shattered. Sometimes, perhaps. But most of the privacy laws we have - and most of the disputes done front of house or down the back stairs - can boast few such virtues. They're for wheeling and dealing, sobbing and leering: and, as and when you learn more about them, keep a red card handy. Saying goodbye to Miles Kington Amid the forest of glowing obituaries for Miles Kington, nobody quite wrote: 'We shall not see his like again.' But it is almost certainly true. There is a traditional vein of British newspaper humour that, though it has some sharper moments, is essentially wry, nostalgic and - the key word - gentle. Miles, for the Times and then the Indy, was always a chiding, ruminative, gentle voice. Only Oliver Pritchett and (to an extent) Craig Brown in the Telegraph still have that gift of personal and written gentleness. And where, pray, do you find it in a blogosphere that likes its daily dose of vitriol each morning? You don't. Print can (just about) still prune a few roses. Digital only does chainsaw massacres.",
