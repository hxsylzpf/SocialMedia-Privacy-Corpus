Kirsty Wark, the BBC2 programme's presenter, created a Twitter sensation by dancing along to Michael Jackson's Thriller. Wark, who struck a pose \u2013 several of them \u2013 at the end of the Halloween edition of the programme, later revealed she had been approached more than once to appear as a contestant on BBC1's Strictly Come Dancing. But viewers hoping to see more of the Newsnight presenter's dance moves will be disappointed. Wark, who was a finalist two years ago on a celebrity edition of BBC1's Masterchef, said she would not be following her BBC News colleague, Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid on to the Strictly dancefloor. \"It was Newsnight's tribute to Halloween,\" said Wark, after she was joined by a group of young dancers dressed as zombies and werewolves at the climax to Thursday night's edition of the show. She added: \"We're serious about our journalism but we don't take ourselves too seriously. And no, I've been asked to do Strictly more than once and the answer is still no.\" A stony-faced Wark launched into the Thriller \"walk\" \u2013 and the arms-up werewolf claw manoeuvre \u2013 after telling viewers: \"That's just about all for this Halloween night. Be careful out there. Goodnight.\" The 30-year-old Jackson hit was accompanied by an award-winning, 13-minute video, directed by John Landis, featuring the undead rising out of a graveyard. In her version, Wark was joined by dancers in ripped and bloodied clothes from Tiffany theatre college in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. The routine, at 46 seconds, was understandably shorter than the original. Newsnight's editor, Ian Katz, former deputy editor of the Guardian, had a mixed response from viewers on Twitter. \"For a news programme that's embarrassing,\" said one. But he had the seal of approval from the BBC's former editorial director and erstwhile Radio 5 Live controller Roger Mosey, now master of Selwyn College, Cambridge. \"I admire what @iankatz1000 has done to Newsnight,\" tweeted Mosey. \"It's now talked about for the right reasons, and you need a dash of humour to end the day.\" Wark is not the first news presenter to become a viral dance star. Channel 4 News presenters Jon Snow and Cathy Newman have both thrown a few shapes, and Morecambe and Wise were encouraging news presenters such as Angela Rippon to strut their stuff on their programme in the 1970s. Neither is it the first unusual finish to a recent edition of Newsnight, with Emily Maitlis interviewing Sesame Street star Cookie Monster last month. Katz took over Newsnight in September in the wake of the Savile and Lord McAlpine crisis that engulfed the programme and the BBC. He created a Twitter storm in just his second week in charge when he described shadow cabinet member Rachel Reeves' appearance on the programme as \"boring snoring\" in a tweet he accidentally sent to all his followers. Continuing the Halloween theme, the programme's credits on Thursday's programme listed him as \"Ian Batz\".",
