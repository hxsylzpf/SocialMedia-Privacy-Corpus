  "content": "Forget Chinese wall posters and Kremlinology. These days reading the political runes relies on decoding politicians' Twitter feeds, and the one currently preoccupying analysts is that of Gerry Adams. \"Is the strain of being Sinn Fein president telling on Gerry Adams?\" asked Ruth Dudley Edwards in her column in this week's Sunday Independent. \"More and more, he seems to be taking refuge in a Twitter persona that would be more suitable for a fellow living in his mother's basement, playing in the bath with his rubber ducks.\" The putdown came after a Christmas in which Adams, who started twittering (as he likes to call it) a year ago, exposed a supplier for failing to deliver his Clonakilty black and white pudding, said his teddy bear had baked a cake for Northern Ireland first minister Peter Robinson and tweeted a photograph of four luminous rubber ducks he'd received as a present. He ended the year by sending New Year greetings to \"family, friends, comrades, detractors, begrudgers, bigots, the media\". Dudley Edwards is not the first to wonder what the idiosyncratic Adams Twitter account means. He started to tweet on 6 February 2013, and his early efforts \u2013 \"Emergency legislation shortly on Promissory Note. But no information from government. This is no way to do Dail business of significance\" \u2013 suggested grinding earnestness. But he quickly found his true voice. \"Barr an l\u00e1 leat. Another soft day,\" he tweeted a week later. \"Me @ Ted have work 2 do. Have a nice Lent.\" He appended a photograph of Ted, his teddy bear, a frequent theme in his 2,000-plus tweets since, along with rubber ducks, cupcakes, his dog Snowie (who has his own account, @SnowieAdams, unverified but followed by his owner), food \u2013 he likes to tweet photographs of what he's about to eat \u2013 and popular music, especially Leonard Cohen. Some have suggested the Flann (or perhaps Flan) O'Brienish tone is a little calculating. \"Gerry Adams tries too hard to be cute and whimsical on Twitter,\" said the Irish writer Damien Owens (on Twitter of course) last week. \"It's like Charles Manson showing you his collection of tea cosies.\" Adams is alert to the criticism. \"I listen to some of those things that are said about my twittering by journalists who have never talked to me in their lives,\" he told an interviewer last year. \"It becomes a sinister Sinn Fein plan. It's just me. If people think it's stupid, they can.\" \"But what about the teddy bears?\" demanded the fearless interviewer. \"You have to think of the sensitivities of teddy bears,\" insisted Adams. \"Teddy bears aren't given their place in the scheme of things in this world.\" Quite.",
