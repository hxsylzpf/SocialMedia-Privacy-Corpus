  "content": "Lily Allen has written to thank police for foiling an alleged kidnap plot involving one of her friends. The friend and another man, both in their 20s, were working at a sports store in west London last month when a group of armed men allegedly entered the store and bundled the shop workers into a car. Allen wrote on her blog: \"Thank you to the Met for getting my friend back, we were all terrified and from what I hear you guys did an amazing job.\" The group are accused of holding the pair hostage for a week at an address in Thamesmead, south east London, and demanding a ransom of \u00a375,000 from their families. Lily's friend and his co-worker were found by police a week later on August 9. They were handcuffed with their heads covered but were unhurt. A number of men have appeared in court in connection with the alleged kidnapping.",
