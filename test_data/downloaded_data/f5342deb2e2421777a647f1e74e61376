  "content": "Home secretary Theresa May has said the first time News of World phone hacking came across her \"radar\" was after a New York Times report in September 2010 \u2013 but admitted she did not read the article. May told the Leveson inquiry on Tuesday that the allegations contained in the New York Times article were looked at by the Metropolitan police, which decided at the time they did not warrant further action. \"In terms of an issue it had been there in the past but that was the first time when it came across my radar,\" said May, who took office in May 2010, nearly a year after the Guardian first published revelations that News of the World phone hacking went beyond a single reporter. \"I saw reports of it but I didn't read the whole piece.\" Asked by Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, whether it would not have been appropriate for her to ask for the whole document, May replied: \"It felt it was appropriate to ensure that some action was being taken as a result, that it was being looked into. \"It's not the role of the home secretary to decide whether information that's in a newspaper ... it's an operating matter for the police to decide whether the information that is printed is new evidence that they feel is sufficient and necessary for them to explore that.\" Jay described the article, which was based on interviews with more than a dozen former reporters and editors on the paper, was an \"extremely detailed piece, based on a series of interviews and evidence from a number of sources\" with a \"huge amount of research\". May said she did not think it was appropriate at that time to consider ordering a review of the original police investigation into phone hacking. Lord Justice Leveson asked May whether she was aware of the Met police's decision to interview all those who had spoken to the New York Times under caution. He added: \"In other words, perceiving them as potential suspects and therefore very likely to exercise their right of silence not to say anything, thereby not surprisingly revealing no additional evidence?\" May replied: \"I was aware that interviews had taken place and I was aware that there had been no further information forthcoming as a result of those interviews.\" However, the inquiry heard that within a few months the situation had changed. In a telephone conversation with the then Met police deputy commissioner, Tim Godwin, on 21 January 2011, May was told there would be a \"robust and vigorous investigation\" into phone hacking. A record of the conversation also noted: \"TG reassured the HS that the phone hacking investigation was under control.\" Asked whether there was \"not at least the potential for a national security issue here\" because at least one cabinet minister's phone had been hacked, as well as someone close to a cabinet minister, May said it was not a concern because it was a government protocol that no material of national security should be divulged over a mobile phone. The inquiry was shown a series of briefing notes to the home secretary outlining her and the government's position at the time. They included a briefing that said it was \"crucial that the police have a constructive relationship with the media\". Another said that the government \"recognises that the newspaper industry's system of self regulation is not perfect but the principle of a free but responsible press is paramount ... introducing any type of statutory coverage in this area would destroy this principle\". It added: \"The PCC has shown itself to be an effective regulator in a difficult area. We do not believe that statutory regulation is warranted.\" Asked if she still held that view, May said: \"I believe that in an open and democractic society a free press is absolutely essential.\" In another briefing note on 5 July 2011, the day after the Guardian story about the hacking of Milly Dowler's voicemails, May was told: \"We believe that a system of self regulation that is complementary to the law remains the best way to regulate the press.\" May said there were \"growing concerns\" at the time of the Guardian article but that the \"balance probably lay with the system of self regulation\". But another briefing note, on 11 July, following the closure of the News of the World, referred to the \"inadequacy of current arrangements\" in reference to comments by David Cameron. Jay suggested \"between 5 July and 11 July the landscape was shifting somewhat?\". May replied: \"I think there was a constantly shifting landscape.\" Asked why she commissioned, later that month, a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission about police corruption, May said there had been a growing number of questions about police integrity. \"There was a danger of that important relationship and confidence between the public and police being damaged,\" she said. May told Sir Paul Stephenson, the Met police commissioner who resigned in the wake of the phone hacking scandal and criticism that he hired former News of the World executive Neil Wallis, that she was \"disappointed\" that he had not told her of his concerns over the Wallis contract directly and at an earlier stage. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
