Unrest began on Monday after opposition parties tried to block electoral reforms instigated by Kabila's government that could delay the general election, due to take place 2016. The reported death toll has varied widely. Lambert Mende, a government spokesman, told the BBC earlier today that 11 people have been killed as police use live ammunition to scatter crowds of protestors, while a rights group told journalists they estimate that more than 42 people have lost their lives in the clashes. These numbers are expected to rise. AP reported early on Wednesday afternoon that more gunfire had been witnessed in the capital as police fired at students shouting \"Kabila get out\". Shut down On Tuesday, Twitter users said that the government had shut down internet and mobile phone services. Although services seem to have returned in places, further as yet unverified reports say that radio signals have now been jammed. Undeterred by these obstacles, protestors have continued to take to social media to share images and news from the ground using the #Telema hashtag. \"Telema\" is a call to \"arise\" or \"stand up\" in the Lingala language. President Kabila, who has been in power for 14 years, last week announced a revised election law that requires a census to take place before the next election, a move that opposition leaders say could delay the vote by years. These events echo what was dubbed Burkina Faso's \"revolution 2.0\" in November last year, as President Blaise Compaor\u00e9 attempted to extend his mandate. The result was disastrous for the government, with thousands mobilising in opposition resulting in Compaor\u00e9's swift departure from office. Social media also played a role during the events in the country's capital, Ouagadougou, with protestors and opposition figures uniting on Twitter using the #Lwili hashtag, named after the traditional Burkinab\u00e8 Lwili Peend\u00e9 cloth being worn by many in the protests. Students In Kinshasa, protests were initially led by students from the University of Kinshasa (Unikin). @MrBasaBose, the publisher of the newspaper Le Congolais, warned of more violence as the demands of protestors turned from barring electoral reform, to demanding the departure of President Kabila altogether. \"They will focus guns on #UNIKIN because students have now moved one level up asking Kabila to go. This fool started his own end. #Telema,\" he wrote on Wednesday. Students have also been gathering at the university campus in Goma, a trading post in the north-east of the country on Lake Kivu. Mobile phone footage uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday shows protestors singing demonstration songs amidst street fires and a heavy police presence. FireChat As digital communications have been obstructed by the government, many on Twitter have been calling for protestors to use FireChat, the messaging service used by pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong, which does not require an internet connection. Adam Mukendi, a digital media manager, tweeted: \"The #Revolution won't be televised but can be tweeted-&gt; Use/utilisez @Firechatapp. No Need for #Internet #Telema #DRC #Kinshasa @kambale\". Check back here for more news from #Telema as the situation develops.",
