  "content": "Stephen Fry was tonight inundated with messages from fans begging him to reconsider a threat to quit the social networking site Twitter, of which he has become Britain's best known exponent. The actor and presenter, whose \"tweets\" about his daily life are followed by close to a million users of the micro-blogging site, and who has played a key role in its emergence as a lightning conductor for public protest, sparked a deluge of online mesages after he announced his \"retirement\". \"Think I may have to give up on Twitter. Too much aggression and unkindness around,\" Fry commented earlier in the day, following an online disagreement with another user. In a message to that user, he said: \"You've convinced me. I'm obviously not good enough. I retire from Twitter henceforward. Bye everyone.\" However, he later posted another tweet in which he implied that he had not yet made up his mind, saying: \"Well maybe I'll see how I feel in a few days. Very low and depressed at the moment and any drop of meanness makes it so much worse. Sorry.\" Fry's threat to leave Twitter comes in the wake of his prominent involvement in the recent campaign by the so-called \"Twitterati\" to force the oil trader Trafigura into withdrawing an injunction preventing the Guardian from publishing anything about a leaked report detailing the potentially lethal nature of waste dumped off the Ivory Coast. Separately, his tweets hitting out at controversial article by the Daily Mail columnist Jan Moir about the death of Boyzone singer Stephen Gately formed a high-profile part of the wave of criticism which led to the Press Complaints Commission receiving a record-breaking 1,000 complaints. Fry's disagreement with another tweeter began when the latter said \"I admire and adore\" Fry, but that he found his tweets \"a bit... boring... (sorry Stephen)\". The tweeter, who said that he had been blocked from viewing Fry's Twitter feed, later apologised and acknowledged that Fry suffers from bipolar disorder. The actor has talked openly in the past about his struggles with the condition, also known as manic depression, and made a BBC documentary three years ago about it. Last night, a steady stream of Twitter users, who posted messages pleading with Fry to stay on the site, included some who said they also suffered from the condition. \u2022 This article was amended on Monday 2 November 2009 because we referred to \"bipolar depression\" instead of \"bipolar disorder\". Depression is one of the symptoms of this disorder. This has been amended.",
