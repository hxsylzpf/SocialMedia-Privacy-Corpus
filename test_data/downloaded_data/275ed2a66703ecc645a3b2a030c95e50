And, while we're on the subject, how should we react to the claim of there being \"alternative facts\", the latest distortion of reality to emerge from Donald Trump's team of dissemblers and deceivers? These questions will be asked and, hopefully, answered during a panel discussion at the Frontline Club this Wednesday: Tackling Fake News In the wake of Brexit and the US election, the public on both sides of the Atlantic have put the media in the spotlight over the past number of months. The terms \"post-truth\", \"fake news\" and \"misinformation\" have opened a heated debate about the problematic relationship between mainstream news organisations and social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook. Journalists working for traditional media outlets now view it as part of their task to debunk the erroneous reports which circulate online. They are responding in part to demands from readers who are calling for new standards of accuracy and impartiality. But have they the resources to accomplish the task? Have cuts within the industry contributed to the arrival of the \"fake news\" phenomenon? And will those cuts make it more difficult to devote the necessary time to expose the falsehoods? In short, how can journalism maintain its integrity at a time when unverified information circulates on social media under the guise of fact? The speakers include Rory Cellan-Jones, Amelia Tait and Madhumita Murgia. Cellan-Jones is the BBC's technology correspondent who reports with insight and panache on the advance of the digital revolution, highlighting the impact of technology on business and society. He has presented a number of Radio 4 documentaries, including The Secret History of Social Networking and The Force of Google, an investigation into the power of its search algorithm. Tait is the technology and digital culture writer at the New Statesman with a particular interest in cyber-psychology and the way social media has revolutionised our world. Murgia is European technology correspondent for the Financial Times. I will be hosting the discussion as part of my new monthly series, entitled The Editor's View. It starts at 7pm on Wednesday, 25 January, at the Frontline Club in Norfolk Place, near Paddington station. To book a seat go here.",
