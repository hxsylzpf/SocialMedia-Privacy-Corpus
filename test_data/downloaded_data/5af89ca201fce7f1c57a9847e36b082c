  "content": "The leading business publication Forbes is set to go live with a \"major upgrade\" of its social media later today, Business Insider saying every reporter will be required to have their own blog. Most reporters are \"starting [their blogs] from scratch\", says Joe Pompeo, a reporter at Business Insider, and the fresh take will be based on a \"completely revamped\" WordPress installation. The move \u2013 thought to be the brainchild of Forbes's new chief product officer, Lewis Dvorkin \u2013 comes just days after Forbes-owned blog network True/Slant was shut down, with its editor, Michael Roston, suggesting that operations were being absorbed into Forbes. Lamenting the closure, Roston wrote: \"For other news organisations looking for our lessons learned, the implications are clear. Most legacy news organisations continue to struggle with how to harmonise their print product with what they produce online (not to leave out their mobile apps). They grapple with what comes first \u2013 print, or online? Connecting the two together becomes a managerial struggle as both sides grapple with which element of the business should take the lead. True/Slant offered up an alternative approach: a news organisation could let neither side take the lead.\" Dvorkin founded True/Slant back in early 2009 and, after just over a year in online publishing, news came that it was being acquired by Forbes, with Dvorkin being taken on as chief product officer. In an interview last month, Dvorkin hinted at big changes to the Forbes operation, and \"re-architecting\" the publishing model. \"The goal is to tear down the walls between content creators, audience and marketers,\" he told Daily Finance. \"How do you get those three voices talking to each other so that everyone knows who's talking? To me, if you can do that with transparency and legitimacy, that's the future of the free press.\"",
