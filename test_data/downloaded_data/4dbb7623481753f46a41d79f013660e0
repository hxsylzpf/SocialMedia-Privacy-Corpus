Well, we'll be doing the same again this year, but we want you to be involved too. So if you're going to be tweeting at Glastonbury this year, send a message to @guardianmusic and tell us in 140 characters why your tweets will be essential reading. We'll choose the best ones and get in touch so we can add you to this year's Twitter stream.",
