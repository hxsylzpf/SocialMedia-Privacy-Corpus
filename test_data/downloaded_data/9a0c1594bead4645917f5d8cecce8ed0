  "content": "Kate Winslet has today accepted undisclosed damages from Grazia magazine over claims that she visited a diet doctor. Winslet sued the Emap women's weekly over claims she visited a diet doctor in California for help with neck pain and also to lose weight. The 31-year-old Hollywood star's lawyer told the high court today that Winslet will give the money from the settlement - described as a \"substantial\" sum - to an eating disorder charity. Winslet's solicitor, Rachel Atkins, told Mr Justice Eady at the high court that the story in Grazia magazine last month caused her personal hurt, distress, anger and embarrassment as well as damaging her personal and professional reputation. \"The true position was that she did receive treatment... for a neck injury but she did not go...seeking any treatment for weight loss,\" Ms Atkins said. It was decided in court that Emap would also pay Winslet's legal costs following the company's apology printed in the March 5 edition of the magazine. In a statement released by her solicitors after today's high court hearing Winslet said: \"I am delighted that this matter has been resolved and the record set straight. I am not a hypocrite. I have always been, and shall continue to be, honest when it comes to body/weight issues. \"Grazia magazine have apologised to me in full, and admitted that their story was incorrect, which gives me tremendous peace of mind. \"I feel very strongly that 'curves' are natural, womanly and real. I shall continue to hope that women are able to believe in themselves for who they are inside, and not feel under such incredible pressure to be unnaturally thin.\" A Grazia spokeswoman declined to comment. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
