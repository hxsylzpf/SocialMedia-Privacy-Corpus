Schr\u00f6der, who has vehemently denied rumours of marital strife, last month gained a temporary injunction against the Maerkische Oderzeitung, based in Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, preventing it from repeating the report. The paper yesterdat attempted to overturn the ban at Berlin's district court, but Judge Manfred Mauck issued a statement ordering the reporter responsible, Gunther Hartwig, not to repeat the story. \"The reports go into [Schr\u00f6der's] private sphere and there is no public interest in the spreading of rumours,\" said the judge. \"Even a politician who is not exactly media-shy does not have to accept everything ... The worst thing is when rumours are spread. That can beat anyone down,\" he added. Schr\u00f6der's lawyer, Michael Nesselhauf, was obliged to withdraw the original injunction against the Maerkische Oderzeitung on a technicality, but immediately announced he would be filing a new lawsuit in its place to quash the rumours. Before the hearing the paper's lawyer, Johannes Weberling, said: \"We won't accept the media's reporting being limited the way the chancellor wants.\" However, after the judge reached his decision, Mr Weberling said the paper wanted \"to bury the hatchet\". Maerkische Oderzeitung shares its Berlin correspondent with another regional paper, S\u00fcdwestpresse, which printed the same report and is also contesting the injunction. The German chancellor, who did not appear in court, also won an injunction against British newspaper the Mail on Sunday, preventing it from repeating allegations made in a detailed report published on January 5, although the ban only applies in Germany. The Mail on Sunday responded this weekend by repeating its claims together with a strongly worded leader article attacking Schr\u00f6der for his attempts to stifle the media. \"Sorry, Herr Schr\u00f6der but you don't rule Britain... at least, not yet,\" blasted the paper, which was nonetheless careful to cancel its distribution in Germany, which would have broken the terms of the injunction. Last week Schr\u00f6der conceded that the press had the right to write about politicians' private lives, but said journalists had \"no right to lie\".",
