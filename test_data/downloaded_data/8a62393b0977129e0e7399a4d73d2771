  "content": "The Cricket Writers' Club (CWC) is up in arms about a decision by the Press Association to change the way it plans to cover county cricket from this summer. A posting on the Sports Journalists' Association website says the CWC has complained to the England and Wales Cricket Board over plans by its media contractors, PA Sport, to stop paying freelancers to report matches. Ashley Broadley, PA's sports editor, is quoted as saying: \"When planning how to allocate our resources this year we took the decision to bring coverage of the county game in-house.\" In-house? That means PA will use its own staff to attend county grounds and when that isn't possible, it will rely on officially generated data to provide score updates. It may also use Twitter feeds. Supplying copy and scores to PA is a mainstay of many regional freelancers' incomes. It is thought 20 reporters will suffer. Mark Baldwin, The Times's cricket writer and chairman-elect of the CWC, says his club is deeply concerned about the effect on county cricket coverage: \"It is conceivable that some county matches this summer will be played with no written media in the press box at certain times, as a lot of regional freelances see the PA contract as the basis for their commitment to attend every day of their county club's home matches.\" The CWC is backed by the Sports Journalists' Association (SJA). Its secretary, Steven Downes, says: \"This is the latest example of the erosion of the worth of proper journalistic values, and it undermines, yet again, the work of many of our members... \"The SJA calls on PA Sport to reconsider its position and ask them to make a decision that will uphold the integrity of its county cricket coverage.\" Back in 2001, PA did try to cover county cricket in-house but relented after protests from subscribers at both national and regional newspapers.
