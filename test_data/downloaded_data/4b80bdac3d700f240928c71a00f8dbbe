  "content": "BT is preparing a patch to fix the Heartbleed flaw on its Home Hub routers, the company has confirmed. But the flaw won't expose many customers to danger, the firm says, because for any attacker to make the most of it they would already have to have joined the BT Home Hub's wireless network, which is password-protected by default. \"BT customers needn't worry about this,\" the company said in a statement. \"The risk is extremely low. It's not possible for a hacker to gain access to your Home Hub unless they physically connect a cable to it inside your home or they have found out your Wi-Fi password. \"Even this would not give them access to your data, or allow them to make any changes to your Home Hub. We take internet security very seriously so despite this we will issuing a software patch for the affected Home Hubs.\" Netgear, the manufacturer whose routers are shipped by Sky Broadband, among others, confirmed to the Guardian that it does not suffer from the Heartbleed vulnerability, because it does not use SSL at all. \"We are aware of this Heartbleed bug and we have checked it with our engineers,\" a spokesperson told the Guardian. \"Our home devices such as routers are not affected by it because our routers are all using http locally. Netgear can confirm no vulnerabilities to the Heartbleed bug have been found in our routers.\" Routers from both providers are secure, provided users don't change the default settings, and don't share their wireless passwords too widely. But for users who have made the decision to have an open network, or who are using the less-secure WEP standard to protect their network, there is the risk that their administrator passwords may be easily stolen if they decide to log in. \"Manufactures need to come out and say what products are affected, ship updates, and encourage their users to update as soon as possible,\" said Lamar Bailey, director of research and development at Tripwire. Bailey pointed out a number of ways that such a lack of security, even against insiders, can backfire. As well as networks with open access, he warned that the flaw can exacerbate problems caused by malware infections. \"If a computer has been hacked, or is infected with malware or bots, it would be very easy for the attacker to launch the attacks from this infected computer on the private side of the network.\" \u2022 Heartbleed bug: what do you actually need to do to stay secure?",
