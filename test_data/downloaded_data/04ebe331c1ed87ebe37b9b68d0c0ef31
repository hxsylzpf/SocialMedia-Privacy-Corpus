  "content": "MTV Australia has been heavily criticised for a tweet calling for \"English subtitles\", after Latina actors America Ferrera and Eva Longoria presented a Golden Globe during the broadcast of Sunday night's awards show. \"Where are the English subtitles? We have no idea what @AmericaFerrera and @EvaLongoria are saying #GoldenGlobes,\" tweeted MTV Australia. The tweet was quickly removed after it was denounced by other Twitter users for being \"offensive\" and \"racist\". Others said the comment was in \"poor taste\", particularly because during the presentation Ferrera and Longoria poked fun at the way Latina actors are regularly mistaken for one another. \"Hi, I'm Eva Longoria, not Eva Mendes,\" Longoria said. \"And I'm America Ferrera not Gina Rodriguez,\" Ferrera said, referring to a December tweet in which the official Golden Globes Twitter account mistakenly tagged Jane the Virgin star Gina Rodriguez (@HereIsGina) instead of Ferrera. A follow-up tweet by MTV Australia apologised, claiming the tweet was a \"joke\" made in response to Longoria and Ferrera's joke. \"We get it was a bad call. We'll leave the humour to @rickygervais,\" they tweeted. MTV Australia did not provide further comment.",
