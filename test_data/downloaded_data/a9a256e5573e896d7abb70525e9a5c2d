The latest annual survey of local e-government includes a plea to authorities \"to get a permissive copyright policy on your website, publish your data in a way that computers can read easily, don't charge for your data and respond positively to people who ask you for basic data sets\". The message, in the Better Connected survey of local government websites, is a welcome reminder of councils' pivotal place in the three-year campaign to Free Our Data. Local authorities' databases contain large amounts of information that may be of interest to data-mashers and other re-users. However, authorities vary widely in their attitudes to making it available. They can do this because, unlike central government bodies, councils own the intellectual property in the data they produce. (The situation is further complicated by datasets containing data from other public bodies, such as Ordnance Survey.) Encouraged by Whitehall to act more commercially, several authorities have begun to treat datasets as a revenue-generating asset - even though they will have been collected and curated with taxpayers' (whether individuals' or companies') money. Islington council, for instance, now demands payment for downloads of its planning policy map. Neither the Office of Public Sector Information nor the Cabinet Office, which for the past year has promoted free data as part of its \"Power of Information\" agenda, can order councils to set their data free. The message relies more on peer pressure - it will be read by the council managers who would be responsible for making technical changes to set data free. The report urges councils to sign up to the web 2.0 vision. But it warns that much still needs to be done to make basic public services available on the web, a goal in theory achieved in 2005 - \"the web is the least successful channel in terms of customer satisfaction. Councils need to invest much more in getting the web channel right.\" The Cabinet Office will demonstrate its own thinking about what happens when e-government meets web 2.0 as it unveils a new civil service website this week. It will include a new civil service jobsearch with a common format for ads that can be used by commercial sites. Civil service job news will also have its own Twitter channel.",
