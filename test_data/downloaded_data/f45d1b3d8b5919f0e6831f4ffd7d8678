  "content": "Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor and collaborator Atticus Ross are writing the soundtrack for The Social Network, a forthcoming movie about Facebook by director David Fincher. \"I was planning on taking some time off after the continual waves of touring,\" Reznor explained on his website. It seems that Fincher must have sent him a persuasive Facebook message. Written by The West Wing's Aaron Sorkin, The Social Network tells the story of the site's founding, centering on ruthless young CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"I've always loved David's work but quite honestly I wondered what would draw him to tell that story,\" Reznor said. \"When I actually read the script and realised what he was up to, I said goodbye to that free time I had planned.\" Reznor called Ross, with whom he has worked on several NIN albums and the forthcoming How to Destroy Angels debut LP. Now, \"months later\", they are approaching completion of the score and \"distilling the large amount of music we've written for this down to a satisfying record (or two)\". The Social Network opens on 1 October. Reznor has contributed to movie soundtracks before, including Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers and David Lynch's Lost Highway; later this year, new music by Reznor will close the Japanese film Tetsuo: The Bullet Man. But The Social Network is his debut film score. \"I couldn't be happier with how it's turned out,\" he wrote. \"The level of excellence that David operates on is inspiring and the process has been challenging and truly enjoyable.\"",
