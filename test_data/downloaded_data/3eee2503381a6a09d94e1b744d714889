  "content": "Readers of this blog will probably be aware that Facebook is trialling six new words to add to its standard \"like\" button. If they pass muster, these \"reactions\" and their accompanying emojis could transform our communication on social media and revolutionise the way we respond to photos of our friends' lunch and videos of skateboarding cats. I may need a \"mind blown\" emoji to get my head around this. I'm all in favour of adding some much-needed variety to this limited digital lexicon. Let's face it, \"like\" doesn't quite cover the full range of human emotion and a jolly \"thumbs up\" sign isn't a catch-all response to the human condition. My concern is that, as our communication increasingly takes place online, these developments could eventually reduce our conversations to little more than a series of hashtags and winky faces. The new words and the sentiment they represent seem slightly ebullient and shouty for Brits. There's little room for nuance, irony, sarcasm and wit \u2013 the bedrocks of British chatter. In short, it's all too flat Americano. If we are to communicate via soundbites and emoticons, what we need from these tech giants is a British English version. Here are my suggestions for some modifications to Facebook's proposed shortlist. \u2022 Yay \u2013 no way, I say. No one over the age of five should ever use this word to express their delight. I suggest we opt for an \"ooh\" instead, and the accompanying yellow face should bear more than a passing resemblance to Kenneth Williams. \u2022 Ha \u2013 this we can do. It sounds a little arch and is a vast improvement on \"lol\". However, there are plans afoot to make it \"haha\". A thumbs down from me to the double-ha: nothing is that funny, apart from a cat on a skateboard, possibly. \u2022 Love \u2013 this is fine as long as it is used sparingly and we don't feel obliged to use it when \"like\" will suffice. This unseemly trend towards hyperbole must stop. \u2022 Wow \u2013 this should only be used in truly exceptional circumstances: when an acquaintance wins a Nobel prize, or gives birth to a 12lb baby without a C-section. My concern is that if used liberally, \"wows\" will replace \"likes\" as the holy grail for the vain and the vacuous, providing even more incentive to post dreary selfies and ab shots. \u2022 Sad \u2013 Mark Zuckerberg wants to introduce this as a way of expressing \"solidarity\" without the schadenfreude that \"like\" can convey. In the main, we shouldn't be posting things that require this response. When feeling sad, it's much better to repress it, as British people have done for years. If you must talk, do so with a close friend, in person and over a pot of tea. \u2022 Angry \u2013 despite years of debate at Facebook HQ about a potential \"dislike\" button, this word has apparently been discounted because of its negativity and potential for trolling and digital unpleasantness. Ironically, \"dislike\" received too many dislikes to make it a worthy contender. So how did angry made the cut? Anger, with its little red-face emoji, is a pretty negative emotion in my book. If someone's post makes you feel this way, there's already a button for this. It's called \"unfriend\". And here are a few additions I'd like to propose. \u2022 Man up \u2013 this will be the default icon for all posts about \"flu\". If you have flu, you can do nothing but shiver and sleep for three days. If you are able to live-post during your confinement, you simply have a heavy cold. The same goes for those who check in at their local A&amp;E department. If you are browsing social media, it's not an emergency and a plaster will probably do the trick. \u2022 Come off it \u2013 hit this as soon as someone posts a highly photoshopped and filtered image of themselves. We saw you in Tesco last week: we know what you really look like. \u2022 Aww \u2013 since much of our newsfeeds contain images of kids or pets, I think an \"aww\" button would be really useful shorthand. It feels less American than \"cute\" and could work just as well for people announcing marriages and engagements. It has something of the kindly grandmother about it and would enforce Facebook's brand positioning as the positive, benevolent face of social media. \u2022 Jel (abbreviation for jealous) \u2013 this word has transcended its Essex origins, and is the perfect response to images of a Patagonian sunset or the ubiquitous airport check-in. It's a light and breezy way to show that you're OK with people having a more interesting and photogenic life than yours. However, don't hit this button if it's your ex enjoying the sunset with their new partner: that would be less breezy, more stalky.",
