  "content": "It promised to be the most exciting and unpredictable election for a generation \u2013 and it didn't disappoint. Social media, reflecting its younger user base, has tended to amplify support for the Liberal Democrats and Labour, skewing expectations of its users. On results night, it was the prospect of a Tory majority. Results came in slowly, partly due to large turnout, but attention was focused on chaos at the polling stations \u2013 though the first outrage came at 10.20pm when California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger tweeted: \"Just called @davidcameron to congratulate him on the victory.\" Even before voting had closed, reports of queues were popping up on Twitter. Responses were unsympathetic about reports of voters being turned away. @paulbailey: \"So you looked at the queue at 6pm, 7pm, 8pm, and then finally decided to join it at 9:15pm?\" By the time the polls had closed, 1.8 million people in the UK had told their Facebook friends they had voted. But along with the votes were more reports of queues and hundreds of voters getting turned away in Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and Birmingham. In Hackney, voters started a sit-in when the station closed and other polling stations had run out of ballot papers. Students at Sheffield Ranmoor \u2013 where voters had refused to let the ballot box leave the building \u2013 set up a Facebook group, saying they had been told to queue in a separate line from local residents. Max Hebditch said: \"I stayed on till the police kicked me out. A total disgrace.\" On Facebook, there were comedy groups including: \"David Cameron wants change \u2013 give him 30p and tell him to f-off.\" On Twitter, there was comment on Emily Maitlis's giant iPhone. @gothick: \"BBC1 now seem to be using a large Apple-style device, presumably called the iGuess.\" And Joan Collins' appearance on the BBC's celebrity boat went down well with some \u2013 @GayTimesMag?: \"Joan Collins is the number one worldwide trending topic on Twitter. The best result of the general election ...\"",
