  "content": "James Blunt's nice-guy reputation precedes him. Sure, he's had four platinum albums, with his breakout hit You're Beautiful going to No 1 in 10 countries, including the US, where it sold over three million. But it hasn't gone to his head: he's \"free of ego\" (Evening Standard), \"friendly and easy to talk to\" (the Telegraph), \"impressively unselfconscious\" (the Independent), just an all-round \"good bloke\" (Metro). When I mention I'm going to interview him, people offer stories of how charming he is. Yes, they all say, his music isn't to everyone's taste, but he's self-deprecating, a good egg, just a BLOODY NICE CHAP. As I travel to Braunschweig in Germany to meet Blunt in the middle of a year-long world tour, I am steely in my insistence not to indulge in sycophancy. He might have charmed some journalists in the past, but I will force him to do the only thing that can reveal someone's true narcissism: Google himself. I arrive at a basketball arena \u2013 Blunt fans are already queueing up outside \u2013 and am ushered into his dressing room. He is, it can't be ignored, exceedingly posh. But he also has that knack posh people have of being shamelessly self-deprecating while totally in control of the situation, making you feel welcome by taking himself to pieces. The first time he makes a dig at himself \u2013 \"I'm a short, fairly plain person who's bluffing his case and getting away with it\" \u2013 I try to say something reassuring (\"Oh, you're not too bad\") but it happens so often that I realise he's not looking for reassurance. Does he often look himself up on the internet? \"I generally read everything about me. Based on my army experience, I think it's the right thing to do. Saddam Hussein didn't read his reviews and thought he was winning the war.\" Google Googling yourself isn't what it use to be. Instead of funny Blunty fansites, we simply get the same story 300 times: James Blunt, say news outlets across the world, has apologised for You're Beautiful, admitting that it was annoying. \"That is entirely made up,\" he says. \"It's all based on a misquote.\" In the original Hello! story, he didn't apologise, but he did say the way the song was marketed became annoying. \"But they're clearly enjoying misquoting. So what I take from it is a journalist isn't necessarily a truth-teller, but a storyteller. Maybe I should consider being insulted by the fact I've been forced to apologise for my song, but I'm rather enjoying myself too much to get worried about it.\" Does he listen to his own music? \"No!\" he says, \"I have better taste than that.\" You've never put You're Beautiful on in the past five years? \"I swear on my life, no.\" What if it comes on Magic FM in the cab home after a night out? \"I hope, if it did, I would have the embarrassment or humility to ask to turn it over.\" Blunt is largely relaxed about his unfavourable write-ups, admitting that he's \"in the entertainment industry rather than the music industry,\" and so some tabloid hackery is inevitable. But, he says, he thinks people come after him, \"because I make music that is very easy to judge \u2013 about weaknesses and failings and fears, and I perform those songs under a spotlight stared at by thousands of strangers every night. If you turned that spotlight on the people who like to critique it, they'd shit themselves.\" Reddit Search on Reddit and it turns out that Blunt is an unlikely star of one of the most popular subreddits, Today I Learned, where people post surprising facts. It's where we stumble across a story about the time he sold his sister on eBay. \"Oh, this story. I'm going to make it into a movie at some stage, cash in on that shit. Well, I was an eBay addict, before my first album hit big. I wanted to go on this tour of the world, so I started selling everything on eBay. I just sold all my shit. I literally came back to my empty, empty flat. Eventually there was nothing else to sell except her.\" It's true? \"She basically had a funeral to go to in Ireland and the planes were on strike and the ferries were out of season. So I put on eBay: 'Damsel in distress needs knight in shining armour to get her to this funeral on Saturday. What can anyone do?' And these men bid and bid and bid and the winning guy said: 'I can do this, I've got a helicopter.' Anyway, now they're married, they have been for five years and they've got two kids together. He's got some dough, he's got a chopper, he's a great guy. They named both their kids after types of helicopter.\" Twitter Blunt has had a lot of fun on Twitter in the past couple of years, taking on his critics by retweeting their insults with his own putdowns. You sense that people accusing him of being a bit wet aren't quite expecting his blue humour. \"Oh yeah, I think one of my favourites was someone who said: 'James Blunt is my guilty pleasure,' and I replied: 'Mine is anal.' You just know I've had one too many drinks when I type that.\" He's very good at shaking off criticism, but surely being best known for defending himself against accusations of being a twat takes its toll? \"For me, what's interesting is that we focus on the negative, which is addictive for us as humans. At a concert I'll play to a few thousand people, but I'm always asked, 'Did you read this mean thing about you, does it hurt?' I can only laugh at the five guys, and, let's be honest, the five white men, with their trousers round their ankles, on their own, in the dark, typing with their right hand.\" I notice that none of these assumed masturbators have specifically tweeted @jamesblunt. Does that mean he's actively searching them out? \"Well, of course. What else am I supposed to do? That's where the truth lies.\" He shows me his TweetDeck, where he has a column dedicated to people talking about, but not to, James Blunt. I ask if he can tweet one of his putdowns for me right now, but we struggle to find a suitably cruel recent comment. \"Yes, my real sadness now is that people have stopped being horrible,\" he says. I actually believe him. Facebook Each night Blunt takes a photo from the stage \u2013 in giant arenas, at huge festivals \u2013 and you can't quite believe all those people are there to see James Blunt. There's a particularly raucous crowd in Zurich. There is some raunchy stuff too, particularly of him and his band in states of undress. In one, they're all soaking in bathtubs. \"That was in Chile; I know that seems like we went to a traditional bathhouse or something, but that's just in the dressing room. They had three baths in there, so we all got in.\" Finally, a shot of James back home in Ibiza, sipping on a ludicrous pina colada. \"I think this is my favourite picture of me. Someone nicked it from my Facebook and ran it with the story, \"James Blunt quits music industry,\" which I thought was quite good.\" BBC News What's here? Only the most bombastic story written about any pop star in the modern age. Kanye West has made some bold claims, Bono has got a bit of an ego, but neither has warranted a headline to match \"Singer James Blunt 'prevented World War III'\". \"And you can say thank you to me at any fucking stage you want,\" says Blunt, deadpan. \"You sleep under the blanket of my security now. All the facts are entirely true with this one.\" The story goes that at a crucial moment in the Kosovo conflict, Blunt, who was leading a large number of troops, received commands from an US general asking him to \"destroy\" around 200 Russian soldiers at Pristina airport. It seemed like an excessive and unnecessary command, and Blunt disobeyed orders and refused to do it. So does that make him a Franz Ferdinand or a Vasili Arkhipov \u2013 one man at a turning point in history? \"Well, no, it was General Mike Jackson who said the words: 'This is ridiculous and I will not have my soldiers responsible for starting world war three.' He is the man who took control in that situation. I happened to be the front guy. But it was the most amazing day of my life, categorically. If you find yourself with 30,000 people behind you, following you, and then you're told to overpower these people and you refuse. Anyone could understand how important that felt.\" Mail Online Blunt tenses up when we look him up on Mail Online. Immediately a story on tax evasion pops up, as do a few kiss-and-tells and other allegations of his womanising (all dating from before his recent marriage to human-rights lawyer Sofia Wellesley). Blunt stares at the screen for a bit when I ask which story we should get into first. He starts talking as I scroll through the headlines and then falls back into silence. \"What I have to say, and I really promise this: none of it's true. None of it. I do go on these stories and honestly, it's astonishing, it's just made up completely. Certain things you can say, yes, I was there, I was in that town or city, but the rest of it is nonsense. They did one recently that quoted me as saying I was planning a family, and I can assure you, if any journalist asked me whether I was planning a family, I'd say \u2013 'I don't think we know each well enough to ask about that.'\" But what about the paparazzi shots? They don't lie. I point to an image of worse-for-wear Blunt with two women, in their bras, on either arm. \"Well, that quite a good picture, I suppose, but the paparazzi is an ugly business. A paparazzi shot of me smiling is worth fuck all, \u00a350 or less. Of me looking upset or angry, it goes up to \u00a3500. Of me taking a swing at someone, it goes up into the thousands immediately.\" YouTube Time to look up You're Beautiful parodies on YouTube. Blunt shows me his favourite, a deconstruction by Australian standup Tom Gleeson. \"He has actually understood the meaning. It's not a love song, it's about someone high on drugs, on the underground perving over someone else's girlfriend. He should have been arrested.\"",
