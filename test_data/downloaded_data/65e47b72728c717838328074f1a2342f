  "content": "A father who campaigned against homophobic bullying after his son killed himself amid rumours that he was gay has been found dead. Earlier this month Roger Crouch, 55, who launched a Facebook campaign after 15-year-old Dominic leapt off a roof after apparently kissing a boy for a dare, was named \"hero of the year\" by the lesbian, gay and bisexual charity Stonewall, beating the likes of Lady Gaga and Joan Armatrading. He was pronounced dead after Gloucestershire police went to his home in Gretton, near Cheltenham, on Monday following \"concerns for the welfare of a man at the address\". A police spokesperson said on Thursday that they were not treating his death as suspicious and that the coroner had been informed. Crouch, who was clerk of Stow-on-the-Wold town council in the Cotswolds, was also a patron for Diversity Role Models, a charity campaigning against homophobic bullying. He lobbied schools to ensure anti-bullying policies are used and argued young people should be taught coping strategies, and visited the House of Commons to tell MPs what they could do about bullying. Crouch's wife, Paola, wrote of her and daughter Giulia's heartbreak on the Facebook group she and Crouch created. She posted: \"The changes you have started for young people everywhere, the work you have done against bullying, will remain as a towering monument to you.\" Dominic leapt from the roof of a six-storey building near his private school, St Edwards in Cheltenham, in May last year. The inquest into his death heard that there had been rumours he might be gay after he was said to have kissed a boy during a spin-the-bottle game. The inquest recorded a verdict of suicide, and his son's death prompted Crouch to begin his campaign against bullying. Crouch said at the time: \"It is clear that the banter and rumours were based on Dom's alleged sexuality. Some maintain that mystery still surrounds Dominic's death. There's no real mystery around why Dom was driven to take his own life. \"He was desperate that his happiness after the residential trip was punctured by rumours and being the butt of jokes. Over a single morning he felt he went from hero to zero. The real tragedy is not just that he died. It's that his death was preventable.\" After receiving the Stonewall award last month, Crouch said: \"I see this as an award for Dom. By choosing us for this award you've also chosen to take a stand alongside all the young people whose lives have been ended by bullying. \"We are parents who loved our son. We stood by him in life and we stand by him in death.\" A spokesman for Stonewall said: \"His tireless campaigning against bullying following the death of his son was an inspiration.\" Joanne Dunning, of the Lesbian and Gay Foundation, said: \"It seemed like he was only just getting the recognition he deserved for his anti-bullying work.\"",
