Hayek used her Advertising Week Europe session with senior Facebook executive Nicola Mendelsohn to announce her debut on the social network, with her arrival on Instagram and Twitter to follow on Tuesday. \"I'm a rebel and I don't want to do what everyone else does,\" she said, speaking to about 300 attendees at the session held at St James's Church in Piccadilly. \"I did resist [social media]. I have this idea that I [like to be personally] present, I'm not always calling, texting. When I am with you, I am with you. And I feel sometimes people are not so present because of social media.\" Hayek said it her belated launch on social media was a thank you to fans who look for her on multimedia channels. \"You cannot deny it is a very important part of today,\" she said. Hayek said that the rise of social media has given consumers a voice which has enabled a \"peaceful revolution\". \"This is the strength of technology, everybody gets to have a voice,\" she said. \"People have regained some power, there is a lot of hope in that. I feel many times people in power, in big corporations, dictate which way we go. It is like a peaceful revolution.\" Responding to a question from the floor, the Frida actor said that people power has enabled the stereotypes of women used by the advertising and marketing industry to be challenged. \"I think [advertisers and agencies] are making an effort [to change female representation] but not because they are saints,\" she said. \"It is beginning to dawn on them, and probably social media has something to do with it ... that they are beginning to realise many things. \"First, women in their 50s have a lot more of the means to buy things, it is not like before [when advertising] people said OK if you are 50 you are finished. You are supposed to be ugly not work and stay at home, you are done. No, that isn't happening any more. You sort of surrendered to what they told you you were supposed to be. I am hot and I am smart.\" She said that female consumers of all ages have become empowered, opening up a rethink on the traditional use of young, very thin models to advertise products. \"Women are also saying 'I don't want to be a stick, I want curves, I don't want to starve myself to death,'\" she said. \"I want to eat, I want to be healthy. I think [the ad industry] is beginning to discover women and women are saying this is who we are and what we want. I think we are empowering ourselves and more and more consumers are changing the advertising world.\" Hayek has starred in numerous ad campaigns during her two-decade career in film and television, but cited her work with Avon as the one that made her the most proud. She said that while the company initially \"just wanted a face\" she knew that in Mexico women often became Avon sales women to try and build an independent income to then leave abusive relationships. \"I remember in Mexico a lot of friends went through school because their mothers, who had no chance at education, were able to earn a living because [Avon] empowered women financially.\" Hayek said she convinced Avon to go beyond its traditional main cause, cancer, to take on domestic violence. \"I convinced them, They did amazing things,\" she said, adding that Avon has raised more than $90m to help tackle domestic violence. \"I used advertising to create a social consciousness. Domestic violence was something that was so taboo. No one wanted to talk about it, no one wanted to get involved. It has come a long, long way.\" Of course, Hayek has done plenty of campaigns with no social cause; she cited a campaign with Mario Testino for Campari as an example. \"There is a little bit of everything in my life, I'm sorry,\" she quipped. At the end of the session Hayek stumbled on a few quick-fire \"either or\" questions, revealing she is a technological newcomer. Asked to choose between Apple and Android she asked \"what's an Android?\", and then chose Spotify over iTunes before asking \"what's Spotify?\". She ended the one-hour session by inviting the crowd to join her for her first ever selfie \u2013 which took three tries.",
