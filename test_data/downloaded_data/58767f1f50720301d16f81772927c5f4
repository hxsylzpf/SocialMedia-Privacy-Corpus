  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission has published new guidance on privacy and the public domain following the publication of the naked Prince Harry pictures by The Sun in August. The PCC thought it \"inappropriate\" to investigate the matter because the prince didn't make a formal complaint. But the commission felt it \"raised an issue that has been growing in importance with the increasing use of social media as a means of communication by the general public and as a journalistic tool.\" So it has produced what it calls practical guidance to enable editors and journalists to decide whether or not to publish material said to be in the public domain. It rests largely on a reminder of the way in which the PCC has previously interpreted the specific clause about privacy in the editors' code of practice. It states that the commission, when considering complaints about possible intrusions into privacy, will take account of the complainant's previous public disclosures of personal information. The code does require the commission to \"consider the extent to which material is already in the public domain, or will become so\" when assessing potential public interest exceptions to its injunctions to respect privacy. The new guidance outlines a number of factors which the PCC will consider when considering privacy complaints. These include the nature of the material; the extent to which it has previously been published (including online); the context in which the publication has presented the republished material; and any public interest in publication. It reproduces summaries of a number of relevant past rulings, as well as a checklist of questions for editors to consider (see below). Charlotte Dewar, head complaints and pre-publication services, said: \"The code requires that editors justify any intrusion into an individual's private life without consent. \"It is important that editors understand that caution needs to be used whenever they are considering publishing potentially intrusive material, even if it has previously been published elsewhere - and particularly if the previous publication has occurred without the individual's consent. \"This guidance should provide a useful, practical steer to editors and journalists, drawing on the commission's extensive experience in this area.\" Questions editors should ask themselves before publication 1. What is the quality of the information? (How personal is it?) 2. What previous disclosures have been made by the individual concerned? 3. If the material has been sourced online, who uploaded the material? 4. Has the individual taken steps to indicate that they regard the information as private, for example by complaining about the previous publication of such material, placing on the record their concern about the publication of such material, or putting in place specific steps to protect their privacy such as privacy settings? 5. How is the material presented? (Is it likely to embarrass or humiliate the individual?) 6. Is any new disclosure proportionate to material that is already in the public domain? 7. If it is argued that the publication of new material is justified by the existence in the public domain of similar or related information, is the new material proportional to material already established in the public domain? 8. Is there a public interest in publication proportional to the potential intrusion? Comment: So fellow journalists, having asked yourself all those questions, was it right to publish pictures of a naked prince in a Las Vegas hotel? Source: PCC",
