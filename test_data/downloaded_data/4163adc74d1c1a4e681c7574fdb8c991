In other words, we all think we're a bunch of special snowflakes, each one perfect and unique, bursting with creative juices and pulsating with a million skills that make us career catnip to a infinitesimal number of deskless blue-sky thinking companies operating out of that entity somewhat camply known as \"the cloud\". This conviction is, apparently, the reason why we're all so annoyed that, instead of being assigned our own thought pods by some groovy internet startup carpeted with plastic grass and populated with young men in tight trousers who say \"sup bro\" ironically, the best we can hope for it a thinly partitioned booth at the jobcentre and a CV workshop that makes your GCSE careers class look like a string theory seminar. So before you start lamenting the sources from whence my generation gets its information (stick person diagrams on the Huffington Post, obvs), spare a thought for us, for the fug of disappointment is so thick that it can only be kept at bay for long enough to quickly read-scan 140 characters of text. But in light of this \"special snowflake\" analysis, it's comforting to know that, essentially, human beings will revert to stereotype with astonishing predictability. An enormous study that analysed 700 million words, phrases and topic instances collected from the Facebook feeds of 75,000 volunteers has found as much. As you can see from the infographic, \"the ladies\", as we are collectively and homogenously known, rejoice in such meaningful chitter chatter as \"my hair\", \"chocolate\", \"besties\", and \"xoxo\". But before you cease your copious vomiting to sneer at the vacuity of my gender, consider that the main male terms seem to be \"fuck\", \"fucking\", and \"black_ops\". Before I read this study, I had assumed that everyone experienced those moments where, when they're in the process of doing something particularly derivative and cliche, they take a moment to consider what a massive, contrived stereotype they actually are. Just the other day, a friend of mine announced that she was engaged and I became one of flappy handed women, squealing \"ohmygaaaaddddd show me the riiiiiing\" and clapping like a baby seal on helium. It wasn't until afterwards that I took a long, hard look at myself and wondered where the hell that came from. This was a learned behaviour from romantic comedies, surely? It couldn't actually be \u2026 me? It made me worry that I might be one step away from actually congratulating a pregnant friend, rather than doing the proper response of \"don't worry, I'll come with you. They have a pill for this now, so get out of the bath and save the good Tanqueray for the party later.\" We're all parodies of ourselves from time to time, but I'm probably wrong in assuming that there's that much self-analysis going on. The speed and convenience of social media doesn't leave much time for all that. Indeed, the whole thing moves so quickly that the impulse to share probably even bypasses the brain. When faced with snap decisions, human beings tend to revert to the norm, and when that norm is 25 years of being told that the way your hair looks is really important, then that is, of course, what spews out. That's not, of course, to say that the study isn't fascinating and that the results are inaccurate, merely that we should be careful when it comes to correlating social media activity as a way of defining our personalities or, for want of a better term, souls. I'd be horrified to think that anyone was building up a picture of my \"essence\" as a human being on the basis of my Facebook activity. In all honesty I probably have talked rather a lot about my hair \u2013 not because I'm particularly interested in it but because, in my youth, I foolishly assumed that other people would be. Much like my writing for the Guardian, it makes up just one composite of my multi-faceted personality. In other words: I am a special snowflake, goddammit, and therefore, by extension, just like everybody else.",
