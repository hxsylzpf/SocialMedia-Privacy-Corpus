  "content": "I don't hate Instagram Stories, but Instagram Stories hates me. I also don't know what I've done to deserve such brilliant friends in life, but, equally, I don't know what I've done to deserve their banal videos of facial cleansing routines or them making a peace sign on a busy road as a lorry roars by or a macro shot of a bug they found in the bathroom. This is what I've had to witness since Instagram introduced its clone of Snapchat's Stories - a section that lets users posts pictures and videos that are only available for 24 hours. When I were a lass, stories had to have a beginning, a middle and an end. Then I realised that wasn't strictly true \u2013 shout out to Queen Woolf, Ford Madox Ford and my postmodernism crew etc \u2013 but they have to have, you know, something. There's the theory (possibly Shakespeare's, but honestly, who even knows with that guy anymore?) that there are only seven original stories in the world. Whatever: eating avocado isn't one of those. I left Snapchat when Stories began to take over. But I was never a big fan of Snapchat in general. And the reason why? I have a problem with mediums and platforms that encourage ephemeral sharing: if something isn't worth saving \u2013 or at least being able to view over and over \u2013 it isn't worth sharing. Snapchat and Instagram Stories encourage people to share what, in modern parlance, we would call content that is dull as hell. Instagram Stories is basically the visual equivalent of someone tweeting their entire drafts folder. Sure, the ethos is \"live in the moment!\" But why are these moments all people just scrunching their noses up or photos of filing cabinets? Snapchat, the popularity of which relies massively on its multiple filters, encourages zero filtering in terms of the content produced by users. You might argue the entirety of the content just becomes the filters and stickers overlaid on top. The ultimate in style (well, dog overlay) over substance. If you take away the filtering and stickers, then ask yourself, was that really worth posting? Instagram Stories is even worse because at the moment it doesn't even carry Snapchat's more fun features. It's a me-too version. A good-enough version, to halt Snapchat's market. I can already hear the sounds of \"killjoy\" being typed in the comments, so let me say that I'm all for fun, I'm all for filtering, I am all for silly content. But that's not really what a lot of ephemeral content is: it's filler, or a dump for all the stuff you wouldn't put on Facebook and Twitter or Instagram proper. And often, inflicted without discrimination. The formula cover letter that is addressed to someone else, the round-robin Christmas letter that no-one cares about but everyone is in receipt of. I don't have an issue with Snapchat's (genuinely fun) features applied to direct or group messages, but what is it about our collective ego (including mine) that we think anybody and everybody cares about our commute? Of course, the answer for those of us irritated by the fleeting sharing of coffee queues and missed buses and the same pictures of a mug next to the same picture of a desk is just to avoid the ephemeral social apps and networks. And I do, for the most part. As I say, I stopped using Snapchat. But with Instagram, those spinning circles up-top grate, and make me wonder how much time they've taken to put together and for so little gain. I have come across a few (OK, two) Stories that have made me laugh. And when that happens, the medium frustrates even more with its fleetingness. But here's hoping the Instagram Stories on my feed improve as time goes by. The End.",
