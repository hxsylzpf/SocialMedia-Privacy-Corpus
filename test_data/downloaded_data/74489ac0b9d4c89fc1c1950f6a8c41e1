  "content": "Today's extract from The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial* is taken from a chapter by Glenda Cooper in which she explores the implications of people revealing personal details on social networking sites. She begins by recalling the case of Rebecca Leighton, the nurse arrested for contaminating saline bags at Stepping Hill hospital, near Manchester. Though it later transpired that she was innocent and she was released, while she was in jail her private life was excavated by journalists accessing her Facebook page. Cooper explains the process... Any \"collect\" [a family photograph from the past] that you see in a newspaper these days is likely to have come from Facebook. As Paul Fievez, a former night picture editor recently blogged: \"Within seconds of a story breaking, news and picture desks are all assigning reporters, photographers and picture researchers to log-in to Facebook, Twitter, Linked-In, Friends Reunited. All of the other social networks and personal websites are Googled and scoured for pictures and information. If there is a live web-cam, pictures are grabbed and frequently published without any regard to copyright. Likewise, any images on the social sites and personal blogs or web-sites of anyone involved are all also grabbed before anyone has a chance to close the site down, and are then published, syndicated, used on television, re-published or broadcast repeatedly\"... ...Yet when Kevin Marsh was editor-in-chief of the BBC college of journalism, he noted that there was a fundamental disconnect between how journalists and users saw social networking sites: \"There's no doubt most teenagers don't think when they post to Facebook it is public... they see it as a public private space. It's like a conversation in the pub \u2014 it's in a public space, but not everyone and their uncle can eavesdrop.\" That misunderstanding between private and public tripped up not only Leighton, but another 20-something girl, Amanda Knox, convicted and then cleared on appeal of the murder of the British student, Meredith Kercher. Knox proved gold dust for journalists looking for colour with her nickname \"FoxyKnoxy' \u2013 that she put on her MySpace page, where she had also posted short stories that involved a drugging and rape scenario of a young girl, and a picture of herself posing with a gun. A YouTube video of her drunk at university also emerged, all fodder for articles such as the Daily Mail's expos\u00e9 of 7 November 2007: \"FoxyKnoxy: inside the twisted world of flatmate suspected of Meredith's murder.\" Invasion of privacy? If so, like Leighton, Knox had effectively invaded her own. The reality was, however, that women such as Knox and Leighton had probably never considered that their unguarded photographs and comments would have a wider circulation than friends and acquaintances... With Leighton, there were plenty of candid photographs on Facebook which played up to the party girl image the media wanted. \"We used a Facebook picture because there was no official one released and no snatched one,\" says Neal Keeling who led the Manchester Evening News (MEN) team and which has broken many of the significant developments in the case... Most journalists will instinctively side with [The Guardian's David] Leigh: if you don't want it used, don't publish. And in many cases so far, the Press Complaints Commission has agreed: for those who willingly put material in the public domain, even if intending it only for a small audience, they run the risk the mainstream media will utilise it, if the public interest argument can be put forward. Even if a person has attempted to protect their photographs/comments from general view by privacy settings, that does not mean they cannot be used according to the PCC... There are some stories where the use of networking sites is clearly unethical. For example, a story in the Sunday Express claimed survivors of the Dunblane massacre, now turning 18, had \"shamed\" the memory of the deceased with \"foul-mouthed boasts about sex, brawls and drink-fuelled antics\" posted on their social networking sites. The newspaper justified its decision to publish on the basis that the boys' identities had been made public in 1996 when the shooting happened. The PCC warned, however, that the boys had been out of the spotlight for 13 years and concluded: \"Even if the images were available freely online, the way they were used \u2013 when there was no particular reason for the boys to be in the news \u2013 represented a fundamental failure to respect their private lives\"... [Kevin] Marsh recalled at the time of Benazir Bhutto's murder, he became aware of another phenomenon because Bhutto's son Bilawal was at college with Marsh's son: \"There were hundreds of false Facebook and My Space sites 'set up by Bilawal' to try to get information or photographs. They were set up by journalists saying things like 'I've lost all my photos of my mates, can you repost them'. I can't think of the real-life equivalent of that. It's like breaking into someone's house and stealing their photo album\"... ...Some media organisations are becoming increasingly aware that smash-and-grab raids on personal data on the internet raise difficult questions... The BBC has... updated its guidelines on how the use of material from social networking sites should be used. It comments: \"Whilst some in the media might argue that, once an individual has begun a declarative lifestyle... they cannot expect to be able to set limits on that, people making content for the BBC should ask themselves whether a door that is only ajar can justifiably be pushed further open by the media... And it should be considered that the use of social media content by the BBC often brings that content to a much wider public than a personal website or social media page that would only be found with very specific search criteria\"... ...Those media organisations who push open an ajar door could potentially find themselves on the wrong side of the law as a result. Leighton's name was almost inevitably prefixed with the words \"party-loving\", thanks to such Facebook comments as \"Bad bad day follow(ed) by wine is a must\", or 'Oh what will tonight bring... drunken nurses\". After charges concerning the contamination of the saline were dropped and Leighton was released, she reflected on how she had been portrayed by the media. \"I was just out with my friends having a good time. Everybody I know does that. I've not done anything different to what anyone else would, you know a 27-year-old girl, that goes out with her friends,\" she tried to explain. It may be difficult to sympathise with Leighton, who has since been sacked from Stepping Hill for stealing tramadol. But that does not make her a murderer \u2013 nor does it mean her whole life is up for grabs... After the early coverage she ended up initially being refused bail for her own protection, and after her release ended up living with her parents. She claims she feels now that she can't walk down the street on her own because she feels so scared. Most importantly, Neal Keeling of the MEN also feels in the furore over use of Leighton's Facebook page a vital part of the story has also been missed, one that only his team are still pursuing: \"The charges have been dropped against Rebecca Leighton. So who was responsible \u2013 someone who still works at the hospital? A bank nurse?\" he asks. \"The media got obsessed with their angel of death story and have not investigated fully. If I was a patient I'd want answers.\" Tomorrow: John Tulloch examines the relationship between journalists and the police *The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, is published by Abramis",
