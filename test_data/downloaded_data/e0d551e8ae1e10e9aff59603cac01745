  "content": "Ah, the technical problems. Despite suffering many of these since the launch of its Your Freedom website last week (the above tweet is both surreal and genuine) the coalition is proceeding with its apparent desire to poll internet opinion on policy decisions. The latest is a deal with Facebook for a \"spending challenge channel\" where you can make suggestions for further public spending cuts (you know, the ones the IMF is warning about). What fun! I'm old enough to remember when Facebook was mainly about throwing sheep and playing Scrabble-like games of dubious copyright, but if the kids these days want to trim the education budget who am I to stop them... ? The big question to ask of any of these idea-seeking schemes is if they succeed in coming up with the answers. Last night via Facebook, however, an example did pop up. The Barack Obama feed linked to a blogpost announcing the White House was launching a competition, now in its second year, where federal employees can make and vote on suggestions for cutting waste from government spending. The 2009 winner was a Nancy Fichtner, who works at a Colorado medical centre for military veterans and suggested finding a way for unused medical items such as ointments, inhalers and eye drops to reach those who need them, rather than being thrown out when the patient is discharged \u2013 as was (or maybe still is) the case. Will Facebook throw up something similar for George Osborne? Possibly. There are, however, two problems. The first is that this, er, isn't really on Facebook. The deal at present appears to be for a link on Facebook's Democracy UK page to a government-hosted Spending Challenge website that in turn looks to be a facsimile of Your Freedom. At least that cuts down on the building costs (though the Your Freedumb blog has posted at some length on that website's failings.) The second is the pyschology of the people who add the suggestions. The internet is great place for mischief making (see 4Chan this week trying to send teen pop star Justin Bieber to North Korea). Soon after Your Freedom went live last week asking for laws to be repealed, in came those wanting the repeal of the second law of thermodynamics or asking Nick Clegg to give police powers to break up groups of 30-somethings discussing The Breakfast Club in bars. And, along those lines, though less whimsically, there are those who if asked what freedoms they want will come back with an answer that somehow involves restricting the freedom of others \u2013 especially if they are towing a caravan. So how will this pan out with Facebook? Maybe a call for cuts will be interpreted as ideas for spending and increased subsidies for Farmville farms really will head the list of Facebook's demands.",
