Jason Bateman, who plays the show's central character Michael Bluth, ignited the frenzy by tweeting a picture of the set on the long-awaited first day of season four shooting: This innocuous picture of an airport counter desk, the crew and not a single (known) member of the Bluth family whipped the social media world into a hysteria and had 4,336 retweets less than 24 hours later. This follows Bateman's similarly mundane tweets of things about his TV son Michael Cera on set and basic updates on filming \u2013 these clocked up more than 7,000 shares on Twitter apiece and incited press coverage that is way out of proportion to the amount of new information the tweets provide. (And yes, we are aware of the irony that by reporting these reports, were are contributing further to this imbalance.) Off air since 10 February 2006, rumors of the Arrested Development resurrection bounced around until November 2011, when it was announced that a 10-episode fourth season would be released on Netflix in 2013, to be followed by a movie. Updates on the show's progress have been few and far between, but when they come through, they set off the sort of impassioned response one would expect from the news that a dead relative had been brought back to life. And for fans of AD, that is a lot what it's like. When Arrested Development originally aired on Fox, its offbeat humor compelled committed fans to tell everyone they knew: \"You have to watch this show.\" Those pleas became more desperate as the Emmy-winning program faced cancellation with the average episode getting a paltry 6m viewers. After its cancellation, those pleas didn't end, and the show gained a greater audience as people finally followed through with their friends' recommendations and watched it on DVD, Netflix and Hulu, where each of the just over 20-minute episodes are still available for viewing today. The show is based on the innocuous, and very 2000s, premise of a single father (Bateman) taking care of the family business and the family after his father is imprisoned for dubious corporate leadership. This family happens to be highly dysfunctional, and the show's absurd and alienating humor cemented it as a cult-hit with gags including: never-nudes, a staircar, the Blue Man group, Saddam Hussein look-a-likes, a corn baller, Liza Minelli, a hook hand, hot cops and the always-profitable banana stand. The season four episodes are set to be released all in one productivity-limiting day next year, and the newest update from set likely elicited such joy because the day people have been waiting more than six years for is becoming a more tangible reality. Bluth family members weren't the only ones to leak information from the set. Some roving members of the public managed to snap some secret pics of Tuesday's shoot as well: The first day of shooting seems to have taken place at Burbank airport, where these tweeters accidentally missed out on one of the most-anticipated days in television history:",
