  "content": "A prospective pub landlord says the police insistence on him installing CCTV cameras to film everyone entering his pub threatens his customers' civil liberties. Nick Gibson says he has been in a \"silent rage\" since the police outlined conditions to his licence application, which also requires him to hand over any film of drinkers on request. \"I have been spitting teeth ... since I first heard of this request, but at every turn I am alternately advised to keep my head down or laughed at for my naivety,\" said Gibson, who plans to reopen the Drapers Arms in Islington, north London, in April. Gibson spoke to his MP, Emily Thornberry, whose offices are on the same street. But she said the right of residents not to become victims of crime overrode his concerns. \"My priority is the safety of local residents and if a camera at the pub helps, then I think it should be supported.\" Thornberry said there was a problem with antisocial behaviour in the area and that the majority of residents were in favour of more CCTV cameras. The Metropolitan police said: \"Islington is one of the most densely populated districts for licensed premises in London and the borough's licensing authority is committed to providing a safe environment in which to socialise.\" But Gibson insisted filming his regulars would impinge on their rights. \"When was it that the constant erosion of our liberties became irreversible?\" he said. An Islington Council spokesman said it did not have a policy of insisting on CCTV for licensing applications although he added it had been used in some pubs to help \"solve crimes and monitor sales of alcohol to young people\". \"Under the Licensing Act the council can't impose conditions unless they are suggested by the applicant or thought necessary to answer concerns from residents, business or responsible authorities such as the police,\" he said. The row comes a week after a House of Lords report stated that the steady expansion of the \"surveillance society\" risked undermining fundamental freedoms including the right to privacy. Peers said that Britain, with an estimated 4m CCTV cameras in use, had constructed one of the most extensive and technologically advanced surveillance systems in the world in the name of combating terrorism and crime and improving administrative efficiency. However, the cross-party committee warned that \"pervasive and routine\" electronic surveillance was almost taken for granted adding that privacy is an \"essential prerequisite to the exercise of individual freedom\". Lord Goodlad, the former Conservative chief whip and committee chairman, said that there could be no justification for this gradual but incessant creep towards every detail about an individual being recorded and pored over by the state. \"The huge rise in surveillance and data collection by the state and other organisations risks undermining the long-standing traditions of privacy and individual freedom which are vital for democracy,\" he said. \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 17 February 2009. The MP for Islington South and Finsbury is Emily Thornberry, not Thornhill. This has been corrected.",
