  "content": "Professor Robert Pinker, the acting chairman of the press complaints commission, has welcomed today's court ruling that the Sunday People newspaper can name the married Premiership footballer at the centre of a \"kiss and tell\" scandal. Professor Pinker welcomed the \"common sense judgement\" of the appeal court in deciding to overturn an earlier order preventing the Sunday People from publishing the story. \"Others will comment on the implications for press freedom,\" said Professor Pinker. \"What is crucially important for the press complaints commission is that the strong judgement endorses and strengthens effective self-regulation under the tough code of practice,\" he said. Today's ruling means the newspaper will be able to publish interviews with the footballer's former lovers, who include a lap dancer he met in a nightclub. The decision overturns an earlier high court ruling that the Sunday People should be barred from reporting the \"kiss and tell\" stories. Echoing remarks made earlier today by the editor of the Sunday People, Neil Wallis, Professor Pinker described the decision as a \"victory, above all, for ordinary people\". Wallis said the ruling proved that the public interest should be defined by the views of \"ordinary people\" rather than those of judges and the readers of broadsheet newspapers. Today's judgement will be welcomed by the newspaper industry, which had feared increased restrictions on reporting in the wake of a series of recent privacy lawsuits brought by celebrities under the Human Rights Act. The PCC has come under fire recently from senior newspaper figures including the editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore, and the editor of the Independent, Simon Kelner. Moore described the PCC's actions as \"a stitch-up\" after a series of reports that the watchdog had colluded in a deal struck between St James's Palace and the News of the World over revelations that Prince Harry had smoked cannabis.",
