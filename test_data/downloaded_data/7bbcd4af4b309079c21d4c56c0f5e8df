  "content": "The story behind the collapse of MtGox is almost unbelievable. How could any business not notice that over \u00a3200m worth of assets had simply disappeared? The answer involves a flaw in bitcoin itself, seemingly compounded by MtGox's implementation of the protocol and the company's bizarre internal practices. Between them, they created a situation where a cunning attacker could convince the company to hand over money without even realising what it was doing. Malleability At the heart of MtGox's troubles lies an issue with bitcoin known as \"transaction malleability\". When a bitcoin transaction is made, the account sending the money digitally signs the important information, including the amount of bitcoin being sent, who it's coming from, and where it's going to. A transaction ID, a unique \"name\" for that transaction, is then generated from all of the information in the transaction. But some of the data used to generate the transaction ID comes from the unsigned, insecure part of the transaction. As a result, it's possible to alter the transaction ID without needing the sender's permission. Nothing important is lost in that scenario, because the crucial payment information is still securely signed. But it can cause problems down the line if the sender is expecting the transaction to show up under a particular ID. In MtGox's case, it appears that what happened is that the site was expecting transactions to show up in the public ledger under the specific transaction ID it had recorded. When those transactions didn't show up \u2013 because the thief had edited the ID \u2013 the thief could then complain that the transaction had failed, and the system would automatically retry, initiating a second transaction and sending out more bitcoins. Transaction malleability is a flaw in bitcoin itself, and it's not MtGox's fault that transactions can be renamed in this way. But it's also a flaw which has been known about since 2011, and one which can be rendered harmless with software which accurately reports balances and transactions. The Bitcoin Foundation, a non-profit devoted to development and promotion of the currency, acknowledges that transaction malleability is an issue, which it says \"cannot be corrected overnight\", but argues that \"any company dealing with Bitcoin transactions and have coded their own wallet software should responsibly prepare for this possibility and include in their software a way to validate transaction IDs\". The Foundation's own bitcoin software, the widely-used Bitcoin-Qt wallet, does just that. But simply allowing some bitcoins to be stolen through a bad implementation of the bitcoin protocol wouldn't be enough to lead to the sort of collapse that MtGox has seen. That would also require serious lapses in how the company audited its accounts, and how it dealt with the discovery that it was in financial trouble. Fractional reserve Ryan Selkis, the bitcoin entrepreneur whose publication of a leaked \"crisis strategy\" document was seemingly one of the triggers for MtGox closing its website, claims that conversations with sources inside and allied to the company paint a picture of an almost unbelievably lax approach to accounting. \"MtGox has allegedly never conducted a single audit of its customer deposits,\" he writes, \"and it is believed that [Gox CEO Mark] Karpeles may have been the only one within the company to have knowledge of how to actually tap the exchange's cold storage. It remains unclear exactly how this type of storage leak could have happened over a multi-year period without any knowledge on the part of the executives at MtGox.\" One key question for the company is how long it had been operating without enough funds to pay every depositor. The transaction malleability issue was discovered in 2011, so it seems likely that the thefts started around then; but it's perfectly possible for a company with a strong customer base to operate with a fractional reserve for a long time. Fallout The real trouble for MtGox began in the summer of 2013, when the company suspended withdrawals in US dollars entirely for two weeks. Spooked by the prospect, customers began pulling their money and bitcoins out of the company. In effect, it was a slow-motion bank run. And eventually, that led to the company not having the bitcoins to return deposits; at the time of the creation of the crisis strategy document, it held just 2,000 bitcoin, while customer deposits totalled over 600,000. In early February, MtGox suspended bitcoin withdrawals as well as cash withdrawals. According to the leaked document, the plan was that Karpeles would ask outside investors to give the company enough bitcoin to return to solvency. Their motivation for contributing would be to prevent the collapse of the single company most identified with bitcoin. Selkis writes that that plan was put in action, but with less-than-stellar results. An emergency investor meeting was called, where Karpeles \"outlined the extent of Mt. Gox's losses\". But the investors did not buy in. \"This meeting triggered a chain reaction of events in which the solicited investors rebuffed Karpeles and his colleagues,\" Selkis says, \"demanded they come clean to customers and stakeholders immediately, and then notified other industry executives, including those at the Bitcoin Foundation, of the catastrophic losses at MtGox.\" On Sunday 23 February, Mark Karpeles resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation; on Tuesday, MtGox closed its website. \u2022 Mt.Gox v Fort Knox: What happens when a bitcoin exchange collapses",
