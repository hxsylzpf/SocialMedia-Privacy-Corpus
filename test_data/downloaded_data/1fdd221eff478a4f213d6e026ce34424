  "content": "This is a curious book; a text that in its physical production \u2013 its writing, its publication and possibly even its reception \u2013 says much more than its actual words disclose. Which is not to say those words are badly written or otherwise lacking. Laurence Scott has set himself the formidable task of registering the impact of the new digital technologies on our cognition, our perception and our emotions; in short, our phenomenology in its broadest sense. Other pundits take on the political, economic and social changes occasioned by the world wide web and the internet \u2013 Scott busies himself with the existential ones. The four-dimensional humans of the book's title are our wired selves, compelled increasingly to inhabit an environment in which the old certainties of space and time are being disrupted by a global network that abolishes distance and privileges instantaneousness. Besides the title, Scott devises other motifs to exemplify these transformations: the four-dimensional human, ever conscious of the clock ticking in the corner of the screen, looks through \"a reverse peephole\" into the homes of others. Airbnb encourages us to turn booking a night's stay into a paradoxical form of intimacy: we may never meet the people who pimp their sheets to us, yet both parties know exactly where to find one another should those sheets be egregiously stained. The frontier era of cyberspace, was, Scott suggests, painfully short-lived: we set off pell-mell into the virtual new-found-land, gleefully abandoning the old strictures of gender, sexual orientation, class, age and ethnicity, only to find them catching up with us \u2013 and indeed being still more rigidly imposed by interests for whom it is essential our identities be defined, so they can sell us stuff we don't need, but which they know we've bought in the past. If the vertiginous seesaw between seeming anonymity and actual surveillance (by both commercial and state apparatuses) typifies online life, then our communications within it have, Scott suggests, an equally Janus-faced character. One of the great strengths of this book is that its author offers himself up as the experimental rat in the virtual maze, analysing his own emotional responses to a life on social media. He writes of how in an era when everyone has the permanent possibility of communicating with just about anyone else, his own interactions with those actually present have become curiously stilted. He distinguishes between telephonic silences, which link us together \"like a thick rope\", from Skype ones that, as we avoid our interlocutors' eyes, only drive us further apart. Nowadays, he writes, the phrase \"awkward silence\" is utterly tautologous: all silences are awkward. Scott, who is a self-styled social media \"loiterer\", rather than a compulsive tweeter, is particularly good on the ways four-dimensionality seems to queer our flesh-and-blood existence: the friend who continually updates their online profiles can seem oddly insubstantial and anachronistic in person; the fleeting real-life encounter can turn into a persistent virtual presence, hovering around our twittering timelines; while the deaths of casual acquaintances can gain huge salience, even as those of old friends are lost in a spume of pixels. Marshall McLuhan's much-trumpeted \"global village\" is, it transpires, not some Laurie Lee hamlet where everyone brings in the hay together, but a world-girdling Hollywood chock full of overdemonstrative divas. And, according to Scott, this is the virtual world at its best, because the confusions of scale and proportion are necessarily uncanny, making us only too aware of the trolls and stalkers who lurk about in the unearthly glow of light-emitting diodes. But if the capacity of the internet to unite us is deceptive, so are the apparent fluidity and diversity of our online existences. In a section that takes as its starting point Marx's apercu in The Communist Manifesto about the transformative power of capitalism, \"All that is solid melts into air\", Scott argues that far from liberating us into a realm of vaporous reinvention, every web-surfer is \"training to be a taxonomist\". The culture and operation of the web thrive on our willingness to point and click and view; Scott cites \"cyber-philosopher\" Jaron Lanier, who coined the expression \"virtual reality\", as the champion of \"a sustainable global economy based primarily on exchanges of information\" \u2013 namely all those clicks and likes and views \u2013 but he himself isn't convinced. Perhaps too much of a cybernaut and an egalitarian to argue straightforwardly that the web banalises culture by bypassing the traditional gatekeepers, Scott instead wittily dissects the phenomenon of \"Normcore\", seeing it as emblematic of a medium that relentlessly privileges novelty over originality. But really, as Lear observed to Cordelia (who clearly didn't have an Amazon Prime account), nothing comes of nothing, and no \"information economy\" can ever topple the suzerainty of things. In some quite prosaic ways Scott is an ideal person to tackle this subject: he is in his mid-30s, and so reached adulthood before the inception of wireless broadband, the technological change that freeze-dried cyberspace into full, gelid existence. Moreover, he is both a creative writer and a perceptive literary critic, who leavens his text with some mercurially brilliant turns of phrase and poetic coinages, while at the same time stiffening it up with huge dollops of literary explication and quotation. There's room in The Four- Dimensional Human for everything from Proust's madeleine to Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\", and back again. The former is employed to discuss the web's time- and memory-distorting capabilities; the latter as prescient of its simultaneous visibility and obscurity. I enjoyed Scott's tropes, whether it was nailing the defining quality of Katie Price (AKA Jordan) as \"eternal nextness\", or describing the x-ray view of screened luggage as a Warholian \"pastel fantasia\". And I appreciated the erudition, which brings the same degree of criticality to bear on The Wings of the Dove as an advert for Dove soap, without thereby implying any necessary equivalence. However, speaking with all the gravitas of my 53 years, and as not so much a digital immigrant but more of an away-dayer who takes short trips into cyberspace, I think Scott may not quite have the long view necessary to fully apprehend this epochal transformation in our terms of existence. In part, his scholarliness is responsible, making of him an oddly fusty zeitgeister, since he explains emergent technologies almost solely by reference to content derived from one \u2013 the codex, or physical books \u2013 that is increasingly redundant. Yet there is also a failure here to fix the phenomenon of digital media properly in a universal timeline, one that allows for other developments that have had just as radical effects. I've often thought the virulence with which these technologies have battened on to human psyches is due to our already having been softened up. Really, the communications and media technologies that came to fruition in the late-19th and early-20th century already constituted an embryonic \"world wide web\"; many of the characteristics Scott attributes to his contemporary four-dimensional human were already evident in the city-dwellers of the recent past. High-speed transport links allowing for mechanised distribution systems, the telegraph, the telephone and radio were all in place by the late 1920s, while the roiling, jostling urban millstream was itself a spatial analogue of the cluttered screens that have subsequently come to fill our vision. Scott does understand the past has much to teach us, yet understandably he wants to make it new by privileging the novelty of the virtual; but, really, metropolitan existence, at once utterly anonymous and rigidly codified, while also imposing on us all sorts of spatial jump-cuts and temporal stitching, has been the truly transformative force in human affairs. The new media have \u2013 through their ubiquity and prevalence \u2013 finished the job by changing the physical city into an electro-physical network. Towards the end of this book Scott seems to lose his focus; shifting from forensic descriptions of web-heads' perceptual and cognitive glitches into lengthier philosophising of the Whither goest thou? form. Unlike Bob Dylan's Mr Jones, Scott sees there is something going on here but he has a fairly good idea of what it is: a sinister lock-step between humanity's technological \"advance\" and its compulsive shitting in its own nest. He tries to stave off what he terms \"the Demon of Melodramatic Prophesies\" which can bedevil writing about the present, yet having already identified as intrinsic to virtual existence a collapsing of the future and the past into a permanently digitised \"now\", he can't avoid the doomsday intersection of human connectivity and environmental degradation. But this is a cop-out: seemingly even youngish literary types such as Scott cannot help being nostalgic for the quill, parchment and carrier pigeons they never knew; and would prefer extinction to any version of \"the singularity\" (the absorption of biological into machine intelligence) that may lie ahead of us. Which is a shame, because with his joyful phrase-making and sharp eye for the follies and absurdities of wired life, Scott would be the perfect investigator to report back on what it feels like to be \u2026 uploaded. \u2022 To order The Four-Dimensional Human for \u00a316 (RRP \u00a320) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
