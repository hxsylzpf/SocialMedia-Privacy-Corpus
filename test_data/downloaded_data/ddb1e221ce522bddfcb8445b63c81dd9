  "content": "As Barack Obama spoke before a joint session of Congress last night, The Twittersphere flourished with activity. The majority of Twitter users who took part in the conversation about the speech were sending out updates while watching the event on television. However, a few of them had prime-time seats. Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, congressmen John Culberson, Rob Wittman, Bob Inglis, Earl Blumenauer and other lawmakers used their Blackberries and iPhones to send Tweets from the floor of Congress. Culberson, a Republican from Texas, joined Twitter last summer and has more followers than any other member of Congress. His updates included the following: How will he assure us that banks will make loans? Sounds like nationalization - very bad news We are at war - seems to me honoring our troops should come on page one rather than the end of the speech Before Obama's speech Democratic House representative Jared Polis Tweeted it would be \"impolite\" to send out updates from the floor of the US House during the president's address.

Twitter is the back channel and they way we find out what others are thinking sc_yang why would it be rude? imagine if you were just taking notes on your blog. nobody HAS to read it IMMEDIATELY. fiftydotsix It wasn't rude but i would rather there was some more analysis from such high up member before they tweeted cymrojazz rude no, unwise yes - where's the time for reflection - give me a notepad and pencil any day (not) but seriously, think first .. andrewkfromaz No, it's their House. it's crazy down there on the floor, no matter who's talking. why should Obama get diff treatment? dbdkmezz Texting is rude, tweeting is just texting to many people. Also, hearing unconsidered instant reactions from Congress isn't good. carolbory It's a bit unsavory for Congress to twitter during Obama's speech. Prefer 'seat' go to person who gives respectful attention. 24alex I don''t think it's rude so long as their phones were on silent! Ipstenu If congress tweets while Obama speaks and aren't talking about their suits, then props on them for paying attention in class. Paxbrother Rude and suggests a lack of seriousness. Most people doing that during a work's meeting would get in trouble, from KFC to FBI Thank you for contributing.",
