Joss Whedon's film, titled simply The Avengers outside the UK, is due to open in the US this weekend after racking up nearly $300m (\u00a3185m) in the UK and 40 other countries in just eight days. Industry experts believe it may even be on course to challenge the $169.2m US opening weekend record, which is held by last year's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part two. The film has also benefited from strong reviews, though not from Scott, who said it suffered from a \"grinding, hectic emptiness\" and \"bloated cynicism\". He added: \"The secret of The Avengers is that it is a snappy little dialogue comedy dressed up as something else, that something else being a giant ATM for Marvel and its new studio overlords, the Walt Disney Company.\" Jackson, who plays Avengers boss Nick Fury in the film, took to Twitter to express his ire. \"Avengers fans, NY Times critic AO Scott needs a new job,\" he wrote. \"Let's help him find one! One he can ACTUALLY do!\" A number of Jackson's followers then asked Jackson if Scott wasn't entitled to his opinion, to which the actor responded: \"That is My Opinion! ... They aren't going to fire his jaundiced ass &amp; You &amp; I Know It!\" By this time, however, fellow critics and fans had united in support of Scott's right to deliver a negative review. New Yorker music critic Alex Ross wrote: \"@AOScott His call for you to lose your job only supports your point about 'glowering authoritarianism' in pop culture\". New York magazine TV columnist Matthew Seitz added: \"The latent fascism of fanboy culture manifests itself through Samuel L Jackson. 'A few negative reviews in hundreds? Get 'em, boys!'\" The row is unlikely to have much effect on The Avengers' gargantuan expected box office take this weekend. An indication of the rabid appetite for the film among American filmgoers is that Hollywood's famous El Capitan cinema has scheduled it to screen around the clock, with breakfast served at 2.30am. However, Marvel has other worries on its hands, if relatively minor ones. The studio is being sued by the creator of an Iron Man children's playhouse who says it reneged on an agreement to provide artwork despite striking a deal in 2010. LA-based toy company Box-O-Mania had hoped to capitalise on the success of Iron Man 2, which appeared the same year, but subsequently discovered that Marvel did not have the relevant intellectual property rights to strike the deal. The suit alleges fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. The studio has not yet made any public comment. Iron Man, in the form of actor Robert Downey Jr, appears in The Avengers as a member of a superhero team that also features Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo).",
