  "content": "It was only a matter of time. When it emerged people on Twitter had been shouting \"Parklife!\" at Russell Brand, it became the best thing to happen last week. Parodies were made, people did mashup videos of Blur and Brand and the man himself even tweeted acknowledgement. But now he's gone one step further by covering the song with hip hop comedy duo The Rubberbandits \u2013 the ones who wear plastic bags on their heads. Here's a taste of the lyrics: Verbal dexterity plus estuary accent is what leads to parody of PARKLIFE But words used efficently can be a dangerous tool that slices through propaganda like a SHARP KNIFE We can't get our heads around the fact that five families have as much dough as 12 million Brits, that can't be right in any accent CLASS STRIFE You can't be polysyllabic or talk about important things unless you went to school in a top hat and tails You'll have to watch the video for the rest. And in case you hadn't seen people taking the mickey last week, here's one of the best Vine mashups courtesy of BuzzFeed's Alan White. What do you make of Brand's parody? The best way to reply, or has he just killed the joke completely? Let us know in the comments. Update: we got some of the lyrics wrong - thanks to those who corrected us.",
