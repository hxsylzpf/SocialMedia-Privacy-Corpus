  "content": "Beano publisher DC Thomson is considering strategic options for social media site Friends Reunited, including bringing in an outside investor and \"re-incubating\" it as a standalone business. The move follows a review of DC Thomson's digital division Brightsolid, which is home to Friends Reunited, carried out by new senior executive Annelies van den Belt. Van den Belt, the ex-News UK and ITV senior executive, joined at the end of August as chief executive of DC Thomson division Bright Solid Online Publishing. She said that BSOP will focus on its genealogy properties, which include findmypast.co.uk and successful Friends Reunited sub-brand genesreunited.co.uk, with the Shoreditch-based division renamed as DC Thomson Family History to become a \"lean, mean family history machine\". As part of the restructure, Friends Reunited, which it acquired from ITV in 2009 for a cut-price \u00a325m, is to be \"re-incubated\" as a separate business. Van den Belt said DC Thomson remained \"committed\" to running the once-powerful social networking site, but that the \"next phase\" is best served by putting more focus on it as a standalone operation. She said Friends Reunited, which ITV paid \u00a3170m for in 2005 only to find it rapidly outpaced by the inexorable rise of Facebook and other social networks, still has plenty of potential. \"The idea of re-incubation is you get more air, more light to develop it with an outside team [separate to DC Thomson Family History] that can look at different platforms in an agile environment,\" she said. \"It has strong brand equity, huge data on schools and millions of users both in the UK and internationally. It is still a very valuable proposition.\" Van den Belt said she has held talks with a \"couple of interested parties\" elsewhere within the Dundee-based media company about finding a home for Friends Reunited. She also said that the company might look to bring in an external investor, but that no talks or approaches are in progress at this stage, and that DC Thomson is \"committed to staying with Friends Reunited\". One internal possibility could be to hive Friends Reunited into IDEALondon, the innovation \"hot house\" established at London's Tech City as a joint venture by DC Thomson, Cisco and UCL. The venture aims to host about 25 digital and media companies supporting those \"championed by one of the key partners\", which could make Friends Reunited a candidate. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
