  "content": "Last year's Lady Gaga album, Born This Way, was one of the most daring pop masterpieces of the modern age but it was, as they say, \"strictly for the heads\". In Gaga's case these heads were the \"Little Monsters\" who comprise her fans, or at least the significant and vocal proportion for whom she decided to make her record. Her next album isn't out until next year but she's already promoting it using social media. In the last week she's revealed the title (the slightly overcooked ARTPOP), and a new tattoo of that title on her arm, along with a photo of herself naked with actor boyfriend Taylor Kinney. But there is a noticeable difference to the promo for Born This Way, because there seems far less buzz outside Gaga's fanbase. It's a large fanbase, admittedly \u2013 28m Twitter followers and counting, with 53m likes on Facebook \u2013 but the new place for Gaga to talk to her fans is Littlemonsters.com, which is a closed community. Treading the same line between humanitarianism and commerce that saw the Born This Way album, with its themes of freedom and equality, promoted through Farmville, the apparently altruistic Littlemonsters.com network is built using Backplane, the software devised by Gaga's manager Troy Carter, and in which Gaga is a key investor. This decision to form a breakaway social network puts Gaga in the unlikely position of being pop's very own Louise Mensch. Mensch's network Menshn is not as sophisticated as Gaga's: the strapline \"Talk On Topic\" seems to take the stance that Twitter is full of noise. Or, to put it another way, it's too full of the general public. Perhaps that's par for the course with a Tory MP, but it's more confusing with Lady Gaga. Gaga's Born This Way single was derided by many but its heart was in the right place: regardless of colour or sexual preference everyone's the same, the song suggested with all the subtlety of a spasming ox, so get along or get out of the way. It worked perfectly alongside one memorable a nightly set-piece on her last tour, when she told her audience of supposed misfits that the real freaks were on the outside: \"AND I'VE LOCKED THE FUCKIN' DOORS!\" That was thrilling in the live arena, but online this walled garden feels strange because it is as if Gaga is withdrawing from normal life and taking her fans with her. She insisted that fans should never feel ghettoised, but if she's not careful she will have created a ghetto of her own.",
