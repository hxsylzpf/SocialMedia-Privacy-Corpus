  "content": "The Countess of Durham is among four new claimants suing News UK over alleged phone hacking by the News of the World. Marina Lambton, a former model who married the Earl of Durham, Ned Lambton, in 2011, has filed a civil claim against Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper group at the high court in London. She is the latest member of British aristocracy to take legal action over allegations of phone hacking. Harry Meade, a close friend of Prince William and Prince Harry, filed a claim against the publisher in April. Dr Hasnat Khan, the former lover of Princess Diana, is also seeking compensation over allegations his voicemails were secretly accessed. Others behind fresh claims launched in the past week include Andrea Winders and Tina Dutton, the founders of the women-only taxi operator Pink Ladies, previously promoted by former singer Kerry Katona. Katona was a family friend of Dutton's but severed links with the Warrington-based firm a few years after its launch in June 2005. The former singer, whose mother is also suing over alleged phone hacking, settled her own claim against the publisher in February, saying: \"There were times when I thought I was going mad wondering where those stories could be coming from and I'm just glad it's all over now and we can move on.\" A fourth claim has been filed by a man named Phil Dale.
