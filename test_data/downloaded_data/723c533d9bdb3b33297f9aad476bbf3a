If 5m daily active users and a recent \u00a338.9m funding round hadn't changed your mind, new figures published by analytics firm Onavo might. The company claims Snapchat was used by 18.6% of all iPhone owners in the US in June 2013, up 10.5% month-on-month, making it the ninth most popular iPhone app there in terms of usage. Snapchat \u2013 which lets people send photos and videos that self-delete after between one and 10 seconds after being viewed \u2013 is still a long way behind Facebook (used by 72.5% of US iPhone owners) and Instagram (36.6%), but Twitter's 26.7% market share is within Snapchat's sights. Bear in mind that these figures are for one country and device only: Snapchat has been installed between 10m and 50m times on Android smartphones according to the stats on the Google Play store. In June, Nielsen claimed that Snapchat had more than 8m monthly active users in the US across iOS and Android, but its survey only covered adults aged 18 and above. Snapchat's iOS popularity isn't a new trend. Earlier this year, another analytics company \u2013 App Annie \u2013 estimated that it was the most-downloaded non-game app on iOS globally in May 2013, overtaking YouTube to top that chart. Snapchat's funding round in June valued the company at $800m, despite the fact that the free app has yet to make any revenues at all: it doesn't include ads or charge its users via in-app purchases, although it's expected to add the latter in the coming months. Dennis Phelps, general partner at Institutional Venture Partners \u2013 one of the companies investing in that round \u2013 claimed at the time that Snapchat's growth was on a par with some of the biggest existing social networks and apps. \"The growth and engagement metrics are off the charts. Seldom have we seen a consumer application with this type of user momentum and excitement,\" he wrote. \"Think Twitter ... Think Instagram \u2026 Think Pinterest \u2026 and Snapchat is just getting started.\" Onavo's stats only cover the US, although for now, that's by far Snapchat's most popular country. Chief executive Evan Spiegel said at the Dive into Mobile conference in April 2013 that 80% of its users were in the US at that time, with 20% overseas.",
