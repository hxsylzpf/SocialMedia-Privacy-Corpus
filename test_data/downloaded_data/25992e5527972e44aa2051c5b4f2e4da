Watson, 24, was subjected to a barrage of insults and criticism when she lost a gruelling three-set match against Annika Beck in the longest women's contest of the tournament so far. Earlier in the week, the British No 1 Johanna Konta said she had received abuse online, and the South African Kevin Anderson revealed he had received death threats after his first-round defeat. A search of Twitter reveals a significant volume of abuse directed towards Watson, making references to her weight and appearance. It is understood that much of the abuse is coming from gamblers who have bet on matches and lost. Players are being handed leaflets warning them to report any online abuse, and tennis authorities have pledged to identify and exclude perpetrators from the tournament. Watson, who crashed out in the first round on Thursday in what she said was one of her worst ever defeats, said she had been chatting in the changing rooms with fellow British professionals Naomi Broady and Tara Moore about online abuse. \"They're not brave enough to say it in person,\" she said of the trolls. \"That's why they hide behind a computer.\" She said logging on to Twitter had become like a form of self-punishment. \"After a loss like this, I'm so angry with myself, I feel like I need to punish myself,\" she said. \"I don't know. It wasn't a good day. I just went on Twitter. There was plenty [of abuse]. \"What can you do? There's always going to be people saying stuff. It's, like, it comes with it. You've just got to deal with it.\" Asked whether a solution would be to avoid Twitter entirely, she said: \"I usually don't read it too much.\" The Guardian's The Web We Want series has examined the scale of vitriol online, aimed particularly at women. Konta, 25, said after her first-round victory on Tuesday that online abuse could \"ruin your day\". \"It's unfortunate it exists,\" she said. \"It's important not to read it, to not pay attention to it where you can. If it's anything that affects the integrity of the sport, it's important to contact the right people about it. \"Otherwise when you do read it, make sure you read it when you're in good spirits and you can laugh about it because otherwise, yeah, it can ruin your day.\" A spokeswoman for the Women's Tennis Association said: \"Player security is our number one priority. The WTA employs athlete assistance and security personnel trained to handle this. \"Any player who has concerns about comments, images or messages posted on digital/social media knows to notify the WTA, which has processes in place to provide players with appropriate support and guidance to manage these concerns, including, if appropriate, notifying the social media companies and local authorities. \"The WTA also proactively monitors player digital/social feeds and will follow up directly with players to offer support and assistance.\" Anderson, ranked 25th on the men's tour, complained on Tuesday that he had been subjected to a number of threats following his defeat to Denis Istomin the previous day. He tweeted: \"Bummed to have lost yesterday, but at least I had a ton of death threats on Facebook and Twitter to make me feel better about things.\" Anderson later said that he had received threats from people who had bet on the match. \"It pretty much happens after every match regardless of the circumstances. People who have bet on the match tend to take to social media and say very inappropriate things,\" he said. The Tennis Integrity Unit, an anti-corruption body for the professional sport, works closely with players who are subjected to abuse or threats related to betting. Watson, the world No 55, would have been on course for a Wimbledon rematch against Serena Williams in the third round had she beaten Beck, but she missed three match points before losing 10-9 in the deciding set. Beck, who needed treatment on her ankle after tumbling in the damp conditions before play was abandoned on Wednesday, held her nerve to secure a place in the second round after two hours and 52 minutes on court.",
