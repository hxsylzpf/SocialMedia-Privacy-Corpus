  "content": "The threat to close the Irish Daily Star in the wake of the decision to publish the controversial pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing topless appears to be receding, with Irish shareholders trying to walk the paper \"back from the edge\". Independent News and Media (INM), which owns 50% of the paper, believe it has taken the heat out of the situation and is now working with the other shareholder, Richard Desmond, who had threatened immediate closure, to find out what led to the decision to publish without either owner being informed. After telephone exchanges on Monday, the two shareholders both agreed to look at the circumstances surrounding publication afresh with the launch of a joint internal investigation and the suspension of the editor, Mike O'Kane, pending the results of the inquiry. The decision to publish the photos infuriated Richard Desmond on Saturday, when he declared that he would take \"immediate steps\" to close the paper with the loss of 120 jobs. But by Monday his company, Northern &amp; Shell, was indicating that the company's focus was on exiting the publishing joint venture. One informed source said INM were \"trying to walk it back from the edge\". That person added: \"If it's the case of [Desmond] being very much incensed and offended, then the passage of time might ease that, but if there is a commercial imperative at stake, the outcome of the inquiry won't matter.\" The INM Ireland chief executive, Joe Webb, described the closure of the paper as \"disproportionate\" over the weekend, but said he had no warning of the Star's decision to publish the long-lens, topless photos which were taken without permission in France. Webb added that the decision to publish was regrettable. The paper's former editor Ger Colleran, a well known figure in Ireland, was quoted in INM's Sunday Independent saying he was \"surprised about the furore ... particularly in a British media that gave freedom of speech to the world and is rightly called the mother of parliaments, underwritten by freedom of expression and a free press.\" Colleran, now managing director, pointed out that the paper had taken care not to publish the pictures in Northern Ireland where UK laws apply and where there may be more sensitivity towards the royal family. The decision to publish has threatened the end of self-regulation of Irish newspapers, with the justice minister Alan Shatter threatening privacy legislation. He said the publication of the pictures was down to \"perceived financial gain\" and not \"principled freedom of expression\" and a belief by certain sections of the print media that \"public figures are fair game\". He declared he was going to revisit the 2006 privacy bill. The National Union of Journalists said it would fight against any \"knee-jerk\" reaction. The NUJ's Irish secretary, Seamus Dooley, said the threat of privacy legislation was \"a worrying development with serious implications\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
