  "content": "Updated 2.15pm: Have we been taken in? I reported earlier, after several journalists brought it to our attention at The Guardian, that Guitar Media magazine was making an offer that had upset people. Its website offered people the chance to become gig reviewers. But is it real? Does the magazine even exist? Two calls to two reputable guitar mags suggest it doesn't. They have never heard of it. Anyway, the offer, such as it is, hasn't gone down too well with those people who have come across it, and I can see why. First, to take up the chance, you are required to pay an annual fee of \u00a349.99 ($79.99 for US applicants) to join the gig members' scheme. Then, having paid up front, you will be expected to write the reviews for free. If the Twitter traffic is anything to go by, this has struck a bum note with the public. And, if it isn't real, an even bummer note. Journalists are particularly upset because Guitar Media gig members will be admitted to concerts as part of the magazine's press team. On the other hand, there are some benefits. The website - which crashed while I was trying to access it earlier - asks rhetorically: \"Do you want to the chance of going to gig after gig with no need to purchase tickets? Do you want the chance to interview stars before and after gigs? Do you want to be known for your journalistic skills?\" The magazine's blurb says it is looking for people who \"have a great talent for writing informative reviews.\" So why the fee? The site explains: \"We need to make sure that we get only serious applicants. Paying for this service means that you are committed to creating informative reviews that meet deadlines.\" An emailer to The Guardian said: \"Essentially, a music publication wants people to pay them nigh on \u00a350 to be considered as a possible unpaid gig reviewer. \"The depressing fashion for unpaid work is galling enough, but this takes the biscuit.\"",
