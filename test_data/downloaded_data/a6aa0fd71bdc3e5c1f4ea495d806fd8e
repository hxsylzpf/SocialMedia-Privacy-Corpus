  "content": "Facebook, the second-largest social networking website in the US, is reportedly in talks with Yahoo! over a possible sale that could value it as high as $1bn (\u00a3527m). If the deal goes through it would top the $580m (\u00a3305m) that Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation paid for rival - and bigger - social networking website MySpace last year. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, the deal follows talks over the past year that Facebook has held with companies including Microsoft and Viacom. Facebook - which recorded around 14.7 million unique users in August. according to comScore data - falls well short of MySpace, which has over 60 million users. The website, which targets school and college students and has a presence in the UK, was forced to apologise earlier this month after introducing software that allowed users to see all activities - such as posting messages and pictures - of other members in their circle of friends. Earlier this week, Yahoo!'s shares plummeted more than 11% after it warned that an advertising slowdown would hit profits. Susan Decker, the Yahoo! chief financial officer, told investors that advertising growth for the third financial quarter was expected to slow dramatically, and the company's profits would come in \"at the bottom\" of analysts' forecasts. Ms Decker said that there had been \"a little bit of weakness\" in recent weeks, particularly in motoring and financial advertising. If a deal goes through, it will mean that Yahoo! will own a company which last month struck a three-year exclusive advertising banner sales and search deal with Microsoft. Microsoft struck the deal after missing out on similar agreements with MySpace and AOL, both of which chose to partner with Google. Google's deal with Myspace is worth some $900m over three years and also covers other websites owned by News Corporation's Fox Interactive network. Earlier this summer, Yahoo! replaced Google to provide eBay with similar ad and search services in the US. Analysts put this change of allegiance down to concerns over how search giant Google was launching competitor products to eBay. However, this was followed by a renewal of ties with Google through a partnership with the auction website in markets outside the US. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
