At least five high-profile movies, including the upcoming remake of musical Annie and Brad Pitt second world war drama Fury, have found their way onto piracy sites in the wake of a security breach last week, reports Variety. Sony and security experts believe the attack may have been carried out by Chinese hackers working on behalf of North Korea, tech site recode.net reports. Autocrats in Pyongyang have been strident in their criticism of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's film, which centres on a US plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un and is said to feature a scene in which the face of the \"supreme leader\" is melted off. North Korean ambassador Ja Song Nam labelled the comedy's release an act of war in a letter to United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon in July. Sony has only confirmed that it suffered a \"system disruption\", which it was \"working diligently to resolve\". However it appears North Korea may have exacted revenge after The Interview's stars openly mocked Kim Jong-un on screen and via social media. \"Kim Jong-un's people believe everything he tells them, including that he can speak to dolphins, or that he doesn't urinate or defecate,\" CIA agent Lizzy Caplin tells TV producer Rogen and show host James Franco in a trailer for the film. \"It's all a marketing ploy,\" joked Rogen of Kim Jong-un's temporary disappearance from public view in October. \"We've hid him somewhere, and he'll be released one week before the movie.\" While The Interview itself does not appear to have been hacked the leaks are no laughing matter for the studio, which now could face losses running into hundreds of millions of dollars on Annie alone because the film has not yet hit cinemas. When a screener copy of Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 3 hit the web for free earlier this year prior to its theatrical release, the sequel floundered at the US box office with just $39m (against an average of more than $90m for the first two movies in the series). Other films believed to have leaked are two Oscar-tipped dramas, the Mike Leigh biopic Mr Turner and Alzheimer's-themed Julianne Moore vehicle Still Alice. The Nathan Frankowski-directed true life tale To Write Love on Her Arms has also appeared on download sites.",
