  "content": "The Guardian has launched a new Facebook app, becoming one of the first newspapers to launch a product alongside the social networking giant. The new app, unveiled at Facebook's f8 conference in San Francisco on Thursday, will allow the social network's 750 million users to read theguardian.com articles without leaving the social network. The theguardian.com network of websites includes MediaGuardian.co.uk. The Guardian is one of a number of media organisations to launch partnerships with Facebook at this year's f8, including the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and Spotify. \"We know that a lot of Guardian readers are keen Facebook users, and vice versa, so we wanted to create a news experience that was native to the Facebook environment,\" said Meg Pickard, GNM head of digital engagement. \"The app draws on the social functionality they are already familiar with to highlight and discover quality Guardian content, and makes users' reading experience more personal and relevant. \"We've had a presence on Facebook for some time, but working with them to develop this app as a Facebook Open Graph launch partner has demonstrated that it's possible to get the best of both social and news worlds. We can also engage new readers who may not already be frequently interacting with the Guardian brand, who can now discover our excellent content via their friends' interactions.\" Christian Hernandez, director of platform partnerships at Facebook, said: \"Since Facebook Platform launched four years ago, innovative companies have been transforming industries by rebuilding products through social design. \"The Guardian is rethinking how people consume news online through its new integration with Facebook, making it easier for people to discover the most relevant news through their friends.\" The Facebook app is part of Guardian publisher Guardian News &amp; Media's shift to a digital-first strategy and comes a week after it launched its new US website homepage out of New York. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
