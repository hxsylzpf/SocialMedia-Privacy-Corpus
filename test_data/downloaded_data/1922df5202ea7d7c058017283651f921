  "content": "The voluntary sector has often been considered a great proponent of social media. From the nfptweetup to global tweet chats, charities are constantly challenging the boundaries of social networks. But are they doing enough? New research suggests that charities should be expanding their use of social media, away from just fundraising and communications to service delivery. The survey, conducted by the social enterprise Connect Assist, found that social media is an essential source of support and information for people \u2013 particularly younger generations. The sector is, however, \"worryingly behind the curve\" when it comes to using this potential. With this in mind, our next live Q&amp;A will consider: \u2022 Examples of innovative uses of social media \u2022 How to expand your charity's social media function \u2022 The common pitfalls to avoid \u2022 What help and support is available You can leave your views and questions in the comments section below, or come back to join the discussion live from 1pm to 3pm on Tuesday 26 June.
