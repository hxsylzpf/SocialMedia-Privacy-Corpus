Wall Street's Trinity Church, in New York, is to use the microblogging site to recreate Christ's final hours in a Twitter version of the Passion Play. Followers of twspassionplay will get updates from the main characters of the play for three hours starting at 5pm today. The church describes the project as a \"unique Passion Play that marries this timeless Christian tradition with the latest in social networking trends\". The response \"Jesus Wept\" would fit into 140 characters with plenty to spare.",
