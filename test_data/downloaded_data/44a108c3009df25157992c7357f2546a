Someone on Twitter thought it would be a good idea to tweet \"PARKLIFE!\" each time the comedian-turned-revolutionary tweeted. Exhibit A: Exhibit A: So after the tweets to @rustyrockets, came the vines, and then this beautiful fusion of the celebrity's 2013 Newsnight interview and the Parklife video. It is in reference to the Blur track where actor Phil Daniels rambles in a distinct London accent, only to be interrupted by the band, who yell the song's title. Next up, we have the new John Lewis Christmas advert about a CGI animated penguin finding love, that had people up and down the country people wiping away their tears on their cashmere John Lewis jumpers. The \u00a37m campaign was launched on social media and is set to the tune of John Lennon's Real Love, with some exclaiming that \"it's adorable\", while others asked, \"yeah, but what does he taste like?\" Dug up from the depths of YouTube this clip of Squeak, the sneezing chicken from Brisbane, has now over 1.4m views. The good people on Reddit posted the viral video this week and asked \"have you ever heard a chicken sneeze?\". Surreal. Let's be honest, we all know that one person who just want to meet up with you for the food, and this Seinfield supercut this glorious in glorious fashion. In the Larry David and Jerry Seinfield sitcom, wacky neighbour Cosmo Kramer invites himself to Seinfield's flat and treats himself to the food in the fridge. In one episode, Kramer walks into the flat, straight over to the counter, picks up a box of pastries and announces \"no expiration date on this\" then proceeds to cough and splutter all over it. Comedy gold. Elsewhere on the internet, we have a TV news anchor dad-dance to T.I's \"Where they at doe?\", a useless wireless duck and reactions of children when their parents tell them that they have gobbled up their Halloween sweets.
