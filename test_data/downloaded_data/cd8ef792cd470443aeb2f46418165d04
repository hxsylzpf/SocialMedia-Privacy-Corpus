  "content": "The upholding by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) of complaints by the Duchess of Cambridge about intrusion into her son's privacy was interesting on several counts. She had complained that photographs of her son, Prince George, published on the websites of the Daily Express and OK! magazine, breached the editors' code of practice. They showed the duchess watching as the two-year-old prince clambered aboard a motorbike in the grounds of Kensington Palace. Ipso's ruling in her favour reinforced decisions by the previous watchdog, the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), that people \"with a reasonable expectation of privacy\" deserve protection from photographers. Indeed, it takes us further back still, to a ruling by the PCC's predecessor, the Press Council, that Princess Margaret's privacy has been compromised by photographs in The People and the Sunday Express of her water-skiing in a swimsuit. As with this latest Prince George example, papers sought to make a case about the pictures having been taken from a public place, so no trespass was involved. Such a defence didn't persuade any of the watchdogs, however. The duchess's complaint contained a new twist: in its ruling, Ipso said she had \"expressed particular concern\" that the photographs \"had been taken for commercial gain.\" She also pointed out that she and her son \"were on private, protected land where commercial photography is prohibited.\" This stress on the royal family's opposition to photographers and their publications profiting from photographs of their number has not previously been as explicit. The complaint also confirms a zero tolerance policy by the duchess and her husband, Prince William, about the private life of their family. Despite their privileged status and their public roles, they are determined not to allow any intrusion into their private time. Ipso's complaints committee acknowledged that they are public figures but concluded that \"they were not carrying out any official duties and they were unaware that they were being photographed.\" So, in essence, they should be let alone. Rightly, Ipso could not see any public interest justification for using the pictures and it required both sites to publish its rulings. Fair enough. I think Ipso's decision was correct. Nevertheless, I think it reasonable in the circumstances to question the strategy employed by the Duchess and her husband. Media management by royalty, controlling what is and is not published, could prove to be a double-edged sword. Yes, there is a thin-end-of-the-wedge argument. To allow inoffensive pictures of a little boy at play to be published without complaint may potentially lead to yet greater intrusion by encouraging the reformation of a royal photographic rat pack. Even so, I am beginning to wonder whether the Cambridges, who so rarely appear in public, are seeking to enjoy rather more privacy than is warranted by their very special status.",
