Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, responded to the judge's order in a letter published on the company's website: \"We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the US government.\" During the brief demonstration on a very wet San Francisco evening, attendees held out cellphones with stickers reading: \"I do not consent to the search of this device,\" while Cohn took the microphone. \"We're here to say to Apple: 'We're going to have your back all the way,'\" she said. The last-minute gathering drew a mix of longtime and novice activists. Joshua Jendryka, a stagehand, said he was \"new to being outwardly political\", but had joined the rally after receiving an email from EFF. \"The government has shown that if you give them a blank check to any kind of power, they will abuse it,\" he said. Another attendee was an old hand at demonstrations. \"I should have brought a banner\", said Don Bechler. \"I'm the world's fastest banner maker. I can knock out a banner in 20 minutes.\" The chair of statewide advocacy group Single Payer Now, most of Bechler's activism is focused on healthcare, but he was happy to show his support for privacy. \"I can't stand government spying,\" he said. \"I'm much more fearful of the San Francisco police than I am of Isis.\" One attendee who did have time to knock out a sign was Starchild, a self-described \"full-time activist\" and libertarian. Wearing a blue windbreaker with \"tyranny response team\" emblazoned on the back and baseball hat that read \"civilian\", he balanced a sign reading, \"Thank you \uf8ff no backdoor!\" on his bicycle handles. \"It's like a security guard uniform, but this is more like my liberty uniform,\" he explained about his outfit. \"I really appreciate Apple taking a stand.\" Charlie Furman, a campaign manager with Fight for the Future who organized the event, recognized it was unusual to demonstrate in support of a tech company, instead of against it, but he said he organized the event to bring the privacy community's appreciation of Apple off the internet and into the real world. \"It's really important that we hold companies accountable when they're doing something wrong, but stand in support of them when they're doing something right,\" he said. Fight for the Future is planning to hold similar events at Apple stores across the country on 23 February.",
