Anyone who read their Guide will have noticed we were asking readers to tweet using the #gmreview tag. Some people (especially @Sourrain) managed to see more bands than the entire @guardianmusic team. Here's some of the best \u2026 now we're off to collect our P45s. @jamescann https://twitter.com/jamescann No sound at MAXIMO PARK ruins it 4 30,000 punters who've baked in the sun for hours waiting. Bad start Glasto @andyrapkins https://twitter.com/andyrapkins Beardyman the most amazing beatboxing I've ever seen. To hold a tent that packed with a voice and no backing is amazing 4 days ago @jamescann https://twitter.com/jamescann REGINA SPEKTOR, thought-provoking, melodic, method-acting music. She banished the rain 4/5. @tmjackson https://twitter.com/tmjackson The first gift I bought my gf 11 months ago was a Lamb CD. We're now watching them together @fishandsteak https://twitter.com/fishandsteak Sun is setting behind the Pyramid stage as the Specials make the whole crowd move. This is what Glasto should be #gmreview 3 days ago @justmetalking https://twitter.com/justmetalking Came across a secret Lady Gaga set in Club Dada in Shangri-La. Another brilliant performance with only costumes this time @sourrain https://twitter.com/sourrain Joe Bananas silent disco had me raving next to toilets and bins with about 30 others \u2026 as sane onlookers stared @andrewfurlow https://twitter.com/andrewfurlow John Peel tent smells quite a lot of crap at the mo ... and sadly sounds like it too, big pink v poor @fishandsteak https://twitter.com/fishandsteak Strange that almost every band I have loved this year are from before 1990: Neil Young, Spinal Tap, the Specials etc @andyrapkins https://twitter.com/andyrapkins Springsteen blew me away last night. Not a fan; didn't really know the tracks but it was incredible performance and atmos @fishandsteak https://twitter.com/fishandsteak Battle for best emerging artist is won \u2013 Kurran &amp; the Wolfnotes were unbelievable, huge sound and amazing songwriting @joel_davies http://twitter.com/joel_davies Status Quo brought glastonbury to its knees. Waking everyone up with hit after hit. True rock legends @sourrain https://twitter.com/sourrain Florence and the Machine \u2013 a modern-day rock goddess following Enya's footsteps about 21 hours ago @fishandsteak https://twitter.com/fishandsteak art brut are stupidly good. Tales of love and derision of mainstream music for a generation whose sex isn't on fire @sourrain https://twitter.com/sourrain Tom Jones rocked my pants with his singalong faves ... and burned the house down with EMF's You're Unbelievable! @justmetalking https://twitter.com/justmetalking I found Blur so dull I'm now at Black Eyed Peas",
