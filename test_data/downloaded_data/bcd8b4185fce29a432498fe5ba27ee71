  "content": "I wish I could say it is a pleasure to be with you tonight. But it isn't. You see journalism is something I have done for 30 years. Horrible thought; 30 years. But I have always shied away from thinking about what it is I do, what it is we do. I just got on with it. I hope there is a lot of reflection in my journalism, about easy things such as whether global financial capitalism is as unstable, vicious and resistant to reform as it seems. But reflecting on the nature of what we do, what I do, for a living, well that always seemed a waste of time \u2013 a distraction from the more enjoyable task of landing a good tale. So why am I here? Well, it's bloody vanity, isn't it? When George Brock asked me to give the James Cameron Memorial lecture, I did two things. The least shameful of the two is that I remembered what a totemic figure James Cameron was for me when I was a teenager in the 1970s. To be honest, I did not know that much about him except that he seemed to have an astonishingly glamorous and laudable life, charging around the world, reporting on appalling injustices. And everyone apparently admired and loved him. I remember my mum saying what a thoroughly good person James Cameron was. So no matter how different what I do may seem to be from what he did, it is a fact that if anyone persuaded me \u2013 by example \u2013 that journalism is a respectable trade worth doing, it is him. So there is something proper in my trying to honour his memory. But there is the less edifying explanation for why I'm here, which is that I looked at the list of past speakers, a remarkable list of the giants of global journalism \u2013 not just British hacks \u2013 with the series having been inaugurated by the legendary Ben Bradlee \u2013 and I could not resist being seen in their august company. Terrible terrible vanity. If my wife Sian Busby had still been alive she would have explained to me, not altogether kindly, that Brock and City University had made a bad mistake, and I should politely turn them down. But she's not, and I am here. So what I am going to do tonight is reflect a bit on what we do for a living, to see if there are any lessons for us relevant to this miserable debate about the curbing of newspapers' excesses \u2013 not the alleged criminality, which is being dealt with by the law, but the inevitable mistakes and the not-so-inevitable invasion of the privacy of those who don't deserve it. And when I say I am going to reflect on what we do for a living, I of course mean I am going to reflect at some length on what I do for a living. And if you feel a bit nauseous by the end, or already, I can only apologise. There is, however, one thing to be said about giving this talk, which is that it's a distraction from my preoccupation of the past few days, which has been to learn about the recreational drugs of choice of those who chair our banks. Now I was struck last week, when the Sun newspaper said on its front page that the Uncle Monty of the banking world, Reverend Paul Flowers, enjoyed a substance called GHB, without any explanation of what GHB might be. I thought it was quite interesting that Sun subs apparently thought the papers' millions of readers were so au fait with drug culture that they didn't need to be told what GHB is. But I had no idea what it is. So I thought the best thing to do would be to ask some young people, my two boys. And you can't imagine how proud I felt of them when it turned out that neither of them had ever heard of it \u2013 because of course the last thing I would want is for them to regard bank chairmen as role models. 'Journalism is not a job; it is a way of life' Now for those of you who only know me from the telly or radio, I should point out that it's not completely presumptuous of me to share some thoughts on the future of the press, because I was in newspapers for 23 years, with long stints at the Independent, the Financial Times and the Sunday Telegraph, in that order. And if I am any good as a hack, it is because of what I learned as a print journalist. For me, journalism is not a job; it is a way of life, a cast of mind, a vocation, a passion. It is who I am. Very occasionally I think about doing something else and it precipitates a panic attack. In 2000, I strayed a bit \u2013 seduced by the internet boom \u2013 to help a City pal build the editorial side of an online business aimed at investors. But as my late wife wryly observed, I was pretty soon miserable. Although I had columns in the Sunday Times and Statesman, I was too far from the buzzing hub of news. And it was with enormous relief that the Telegraph came and found me. So who am I as a journalist? Who are we? Well a few weeks ago, when City University asked me for the title of this talk, I recklessly supplied the title \"addicts, establishment lickspittles and paranoid monomaniacs\". And that's because I thought I should do a bit of modish, spurious social anthropology on our trade. I thought I could fit most proper journalists into that rubric. But actually \u2013 you'll have guessed \u2013 what I was doing was describing myself \u2013 except, probably, for the paranoid bit. The point is that those unedifying traits have been essential to whatever success I have achieved as a journalist. At any one time, there is a tussle for supremacy in my personality between those characteristics. When I was political editor of the FT, the establishment lickspittle tendency was rather more to the fore. To get a story out of politicians, whose self-regard is if anything even more over-developed than ours, mine, you have to do a fair amount of pretty horrid fawning and flattering. As the head of an investigations unit, I was necessarily more of a monomaniac, seeing conspiracies when often \u2013 although not always \u2013 there were just cock-ups. But I have always been an addict, though my drug of choice has been a bit different from what the Rev Paul Flowers apparently enjoyed. I was reminded of this last week, when immersed in the extraordinary soap opera of Rev Flowers and the Co-op \u2013 whose origin was a pretty good scoop in the Mail on Sunday. The high of chasing a story and getting to the front of it has consistently been pretty intense. But it has been changed by the advent of the 24/7, multi-platform, digital and social media world. To be clear, in the inky print world of the 1990s, the pleasure of putting out an exclusive at 10 or so in the evening, and knowing newsdesks would at that instant be bollocking my peers and rivals for missing the story, well there was nothing quite like it. Childish? Staggeringly so. Fun? Oh my god, yes. And if it's a great story, and over the years I've been lucky enough to have had a few, you're on a high for days. But technology has changed the nature of the drug. On a big story today, you can be high \u2013 at a lower level of intensity \u2013 pretty much the whole time. Because you are always \"on\", always able to get the story out \u2013 in audio, in video, in blogs, on social media, every waking minute of the day. You get a break in the story? Out it goes \u2013 on Twitter, which is the stake in the ground that you got there first, on BBC News, in a blog. And, for the first time in our history, there is a real-time feedback loop: people on Twitter, or in blog comments, or in emails immediately telling you what they think, and, quite often, providing valuable information or ideas to help develop the story. There are two important points here. The first is that if you understand the opportunities presented by the technology, you can dominate or more-or-less become the market for a news story. I first recognised this after I broke the story of Northern Rock's collapse in September 2007. Probably because I faced so much criticism from the establishment for doing what I considered to be the essence of my job \u2013 which is giving people information, news that is materially important to their lives \u2013 I was then relentless in making sure I was ahead of the game in reporting the impact of the meltdown of markets and banks on our economy, on the global economy, on people's livelihoods. At the heart of what motivated me were a couple of things: I wanted to demonstrate the absurdity of the idea that I was somehow to blame for the mess we were in, that I was supposedly on some kind of insane mission to talk down the economy and ruin sound British banks. It was a matter of some pride to me \u2013 ghastly vanity again \u2013 to draw back the veil on the deeply flawed structure of the financial system. And I wanted to explain what had gone wrong in the boom years to the BBC's millions of viewers, listeners and readers \u2013 in the hope that there would then be the kind of national debate that would lead to serious structural reforms of economy and financial system. It is for another occasion to debate whether that hope was a bit na\u00efve. 'There are advantages to being the last hack standing' It is important to point out that any success that I had at this juncture was partly \u2013 only partly, I hasten to add \u2013 luck, the happy coincidence that in a long career I was unusual in having been steeped in both finance and politics. Knowing the firestarters and the firemen would be essential to landing the big stories on the mother of all financial conflagrations. And amazingly, unlike so many of my peers, I hadn't been seduced into PR or (ahem) banking. There are advantages to being the last hack standing, But it would be disingenuous to pretend that it was not thrilling. What I did was to try and make my blog the repository of all material news on the financial crisis that I gathered. I updated it hour after hour, often with the latest desperate thoughts of those in the middle of the inferno battling vainly to put it out, periodically with disclosures of shocking and era-altering events, such as enormous banks like RBS and HBOS failing and being rescued by taxpayers, entire economies like Iceland's melting down, international trade falling off a cliff, or the earthquake extending to China, where hundreds of thousands of workers were thrown out of their factories onto the streets. And because quite quickly the blog gained a reputation for being where the latest developments could be found in an unfolding drama that was changing our lives, I found myself in the highly unusual and privileged position \u2013 for about two years, from the summer of 2007 till well into 2009 \u2013 of being the person to whom those in the crucible of the crisis came to unburden themselves of their cares and knowledge. It was an extraordinary period. I was writing and broadcasting almost every hour of the day, for month after relentless month, on a global economy cracking before our eyes. I am absolutely sure I will never experience anything quite like it again. And, for the aficionados, I would say that if you want to boss a story, the tactics for doing so have changed even since 2009 \u2013 with social media now playing a much bigger role. I can recognise why some would think it unhealthy that my voice on these life-changing events was unusually loud. Unsurprisingly, however, I am not going to underwrite that view. What I have to concede is that you need to have an addictive and competitive personality to drive a story in this way, and that when you are winning it is a better drug than anything Rev Flowers may have experienced. So what flows from this incredibly self indulgent and perhaps pooteresque account of what I did in the war? It won't surprise you that I think my addiction was a good thing, that it helped to give the public a clearer view of the causes and effects of events that have changed our lives forever. But I have of course witnessed less benign manifestations of this propensity to addictive behaviour in journalism \u2013 especially from the late 1990s onwards, when there was an observable decline in standards (and, for reasons that I don't believe anyone has compellingly explained yet, there was a tendency to putrefaction not just in journalism but in so many other foundations of our society, from the great banks to parliament). I have seen journalists who I have known almost all my career, and who I regarded as friends, attempt to steal physical documents on private property not because they knew there was a public-interest scoop to be landed, but as a speculative fishing exercise. And before you ask, I didn't stand idly by, but I won't go into details. And I have had to instruct hacks working for me that they were not to employ private detectives to carry out theft on their behalf \u2013 and cope with their frustration that I was tying one hand behind their respective backs, because all their peers and rivals were at it. And, of course, entire newspapers (and television businesses, and online) from time to time get carried away with the addictive excitement of being at the forefront of a story that's shaking the country or the world, and in the process trample on the innocent. So I am certainly not going to argue that there should be no regulatory backstop. It is the constitutional nature of the regulation that is material for me. Now you might think that I would reflect on how I have apparently been perfectly able to kick the establishment in the goolies while at the BBC, an institution regulated by charter and statute, and that therefore I would conclude that state regulation of newspapers is not such a terrible threat. And I can see why some might draw this conclusion. After all, in the tumult of 2007 to 2009, I bashed up and bruised a fair number of powerful people. And a collection of former ministers, MPs and bankers tried and failed to shut me down, by complaining to regulators, police and select committees about what I was disclosing. And the BBC was completely brilliant in being resistant to the criticism, standing by me and giving me the space and platform to get news out that it recognised to be in the public interest. If I am honest, there were times when I wondered whether they quite understood what was happening and what I was doing. One of my (ahem) favourite memories was of 13 September 2007, sitting next to Huw Edwards on the Ten O'Clock News desk, shortly before going on air to flesh out the news I had broken earlier that evening, that Northern Rock had failed and was being bailed out by the Bank of England. It was literally two minutes before going live when a senior BBC editor came up to me and asked \"are you sure this is a story?\" 'I am uncomfortable with any kind of state role in press regulation' But although I absolutely love the BBC, and think it is a bulwark of our democracy, that does not mean I regard the currently proposed regulation by royal charter of the press as benign. This is by no means an easy argument for me to make, for reasons that will become clear. But I am profoundly uncomfortable with any kind of role for the state, even one simply approving the modus operandi and membership of a putative self-regulatory body, as per the current government plan. And that is broadly because of an examination of who I am. The point is that I do not believe that I would have been able to do what I have done at the BBC if I had worked all my life in regulated television. My ability to take calculated risks to break stories that I believe to be important owes a huge amount to the fact that I grew up and was trained in newspapers. And it is the culture of newspapers \u2013 at worst being beholden to some megalomaniac proprietor, but never to the institutions of the state \u2013 which fosters a \"cat-may-look-at-a-king\" arrogance that underpins important freedoms, and is part of our history as a nation. When newspapers serve the commercial interests of their owners in their choice and slanting of stories, it is sick making. When they show political bias because of the prejudice of owner or editor, I gag. But I am less anxious about all that than I am about the impact of sanitising the press, which I fear would be the long-term consequence of the current proposals. I don't say this as a criticism of BBC News, because I think it copes extraordinarily well with being in an imposed straitjacket of political, national, social and ethnic impartiality. When grandee and faux barrow boy unite to accuse us of being institutionally biased to the left, I hear the authentic voice of ideology and commercial interest. Pretty much every story put out by the BBC is judiciously and often frustratingly calibrated so as not to show any tilt of any sort. However, this unavoidable obsession with editorial balance and what the BBC euphemistically calls policy creates a risk-averse culture, which means that when young journalists are trained and made at the BBC, they are taught about how to follow the rules, but not enough about how to stir things up. The BBC plays a unique and important role, in Britain, in the world, as a trusted source of news that matters. Its work in covering crises in places like Syria and Egypt is magnificent. But its perhaps unrivalled success in reporting civil wars and overseas traumas may well be connected to that fact that the directors of communication for the major British political parties have neither the locus nor the motive to complain about those stories. And sadly regulation gives them every ability to do that in our domestic coverage. There is a paradox here. And an important one. Much of the criticism of the BBC by the self-interested printed media is completely unfair and unfounded. But it serves an important job - in keeping the BBC on its toes, in preventing it sliding into a complacent mediocrity. And the unruly press is benign for the BBC in a second sense \u2013 in that newspapers train up and supply journalists to the BBC who have the news-breaking skills which the BBC, for institutional reasons explicitly related to its regulated status, finds difficult to develop. So I see a state-and-charter-regulated BBC \u2013 and ITV, Channel 4 and Sky \u2013 as being in a symbiotic relationship with newspapers \u2013 and of course with new online media too \u2013 that are importantly detached from the state. Which is not the same thing as saying they shouldn't be regulated, just that the state should play neither implicit or explicit role in that regulation. Newspapers investigating each other It is not, I think, coincidence that it was a newspaper, the Telegraph, not television, which broke the story of the MPs expenses scandal. And it needs to be remembered that newspapers in general, and Rupert Murdoch's newspapers in particular, would not be in the mess they are in, were it not for the quite brilliant and dogged work over many years of Nick Davies and the Guardian in exposing the extent of phone hacking. If ever there was a manifestation of the importance of a free press it is in the way that the press has wreaked havoc on itself via an investigation by one of its own. There is a palpable good to be seen amidst the stench of apparent corruption at the News of the World and the Sun, which is that this corruption \u2013 that appears to infect not only newspapers but civil servants accused of taking bribes and police unhealthily close to journalists \u2013 was only brought to light by what I would describe as the monomaniac obsession of a print-journalist with an addictive personality. So three cheers, surely, for the non-state regulated press, and its willingness to do itself in. It is also important to point out that what Davies and the Guardian uncovered were not infringements of the thoroughly useless Press Complaints Commissions' rules, but allegedly criminal acts. And, to state the bleedin' obvious, the law seems to be doing its job: unprecedented numbers of journalists and media executives have been arrested, and are being tried or face trial. None of that seems to me to represent a failure of self regulation; it is a victory for a free press and a manifestation that legal process in Britain still works. And, although this is a bigger argument than I have time for today, it does seem to me more important than ever that press and state remain quarantined from each other in the light of the Snowden revelations about how the security arm of pretty much every state gathers private information on all of us on a scale well beyond the capability and ambitions of Stasi and NKVD. What has happened of course is that hacking has been elided with a different set of criticisms of the press, which is that it too enthusiastically and brutally invades the privacy of the innocent, that it engages in character assassination too unthinkingly, and that it is slow and mean-spirited in correcting mistakes. To be clear, I regard that critique as spot on. But I should draw a distinction between what I think needs dealing with, and what doesn't. So, for example, the Daily Mail for years regarded me as a pompous, over-mighty, egomaniac who had to be cut down to size. And it wrote unpleasant features, columns and diary items about how I was far too powerful and nobody liked me. For what its worth, these pieces were always riddled with mistakes. But, for the avoidance of doubt, I regard myself as a fair target. Having made the choice to work in a prominent position at the BBC, with my eyes open about what this meant, I have to take the rough with the smooth of publicity. And I don't have much sympathy with those who choose to live in the public eye, and make a very good living out of it, and then complain when not all the coverage is positive and fawning. I might wish the Mail more rigorously checked its facts. But that's an observation on the quality of its execution, not a self-righteous plea to be left alone. That said, it is interesting that since my wife died, the Mail has laid off, presumably because the importance of cutting me down to size was rather lessened by a personal tragedy that might elicit public sympathy for me. Principle tempered by commercial instincts. Daily Mail's unacceptable article That said, in January 2008, there was a story in the Mail which went beyond what I regarded as acceptable. I will read you the first couple of lines: \"A champagne party at the Royal Academy provided a glamorous backdrop for BBC business editor Robert Peston and his writer and film-maker wife Sian Busby to celebrate her receiving the all-clear from lung cancer. After a gruelling year battling the illness, during which she had to have part of a lung removed, mother-of-two Sian (pictured with Peston) was in high spirits.\" Now there were a number of things wrong with this. One was that it was less than six months since Sian was diagnosed with non-smoking lung cancer. The other was that Sian had not received the so-called \"all clear\" and \u2013 tragically \u2013 never would. But actually those characteristic factual errors were not what upset us. What knocked us over was that we had gone out of our way to keep out of the public domain that Sian was suffering from such a serious cancer, because we wanted our children to have as normal and untroubled a life as possible, and in particular we didn't want our youngest boy \u2013 who was still at primary school \u2013 to be badgered by kids in the playground about his mum who had cancer. So for both of us, the really maddening thing about that piece was that the Mail ran the story without bothering to give us any advance warning or to check whether it was appropriate. As it happens, Sian was a Daily Mail reader \u2013 in part because (curses) she liked the way it was so rude about people like me, but mostly because of the daily Scrabble puzzle \u2013 and the first we knew of this story was when she opened the paper at breakfast. There was no public interest justification for the disclosure of Sian's serious illness. It had no bearing on whether I was fit and proper to be in a licence-fee funded job. So surely it would have been reasonable to ask if we wanted this very private element of our lives shouted to the world. My instinct was to complain to the Mail and its editors. Sian asked me not to, because she was frail and did not want the added stress of seeing me go to war with a powerful newspaper. So the Mail got away with it. As it often does. 'The regulatory status quo is unacceptable' It should not therefore surprise you that I am clear the regulatory status quo is unacceptable. Some way has to be found to force improved standards of common decency on newspapers. And the essence of this is that there must be a cheap, easy, independent and reliable arbitration process to force speedy prominent corrections on newspapers, and deliver ample compensation in a timely fashion to those who have been traduced. And, for cases such as the Mail's disclosure of Sian's cancer, it would be helpful to be able to ring some kind of central clearing house, to explain that the Mail had for no good public-interest reason revealed highly sensitive and private information, and to ask other newspapers not to repeat it. I am not the first to have argued this. It is surely obvious. And the fact that, in a crisis of existential proportions, the press has failed to come up with a credible, robust, autonomous, well-funded, new self-regulatory system is almost beyond parody. And, if there were not something bigger at stake, which would make all us poorer \u2013 and less free \u2013 in the long run, I would now be arguing that the press has sacrificed its opportunity to avoid some form of state-underpinned regulation. There is one final thing I want to say. The press's best argument for seeing off regulation by royal charter would be behavioural. I don't mean by that merely that newspapers should take more care before vilifying and pilloring individuals who may or may not deserve it, or before invading precious privacy without good cause. What I mostly mean is that if they are going to defend their right to investigate free of state-empowered scrutiny, they have to do more proper investigating that's plainly in the public interest, rather than just of interest to the public. As luck would have it, the disclosure in the Mail on Sunday nine days ago of Rev Flowers' apparent attempts to buy crystal meth and cocaine was a topnotch tale, which shone a light on how an important institution, the Co-op Bank, had been chronically mismanaged to the brink of disaster. It has triggered at least three official probes which should help to further mend woefully inadequate City regulation, and which should reveal if a Tory Treasury and Labour Party, both cheerleaders for an ambitious Co-op Bank, were complacent or complicit. But in recent years, that kind of constructive stonker of a public-interest scoop has been the exception not the rule. Or to put it another way, the strength of the press's case to be free of state interference is correlated with its desire and capacity to shine the brightest light on the institutions of the state, and on the powerful in general, to defend the rights and freedoms of the many by exposing actual rot and not just hypocrisy and double standards. Only then would the press be able to credibly and convincingly argue that its role as defence against a state that would otherwise become complacent, corrupt or over-mighty means that occasionally the privacy and reputations of the innocent will be damaged. It is a difficult argument to make, at a time when many \u2013 not without cause \u2013 see the press not as disinfecting sunlight, but as some kind of socially destructive toxin. But, as it happens, I am pretty sure it is one that my darling and brilliant late wife would advance, partly because as a historian she had a deep understanding of the role of scribblers in the creation and advance of our democracy, and partly because \u2013 despite everything \u2013 she never dumped the bleedin' Daily Mail.",
