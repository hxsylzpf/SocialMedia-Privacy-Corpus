  "content": "I still remember the horror of discovering that the phantom scribbler who had been writing stuff on the desks and lavatory walls had written something about me: \"Sophie is a slag, who wears too much make-up\" and much more direct and to the point: \"We all hate Sophie Radice!!\" It took me a whole double science lesson to felt-tip over it and for the next few weeks I felt humiliated and paranoid, particularly as other nasty comments about me (\"Sophie is not nearly as pretty as she thinks she is\" \u2013 ouch) appeared on desks and on the outside walls of my school. I strongly suspected that it was written by someone I considered a friend and the fact that I can remember every magic-markered word of it 30 years on indicates just how much it got to me. The website Littlegossip.com is the modern-day school bog wall. It is believed to have originated in South America but has now gone worldwide with hundreds of sub-sites for different schools. It invites teenagers to submit rumours and comments and then others to react with their own posts and rate how true they think these remarks are. Celebrity gossip sites such as PerezHilton.com and Superficial.com have been popular for five years or so, but following the trend for exposure of real people's lives on TV and the internet, and the popularity of the Gossip Girl TV series, in which a girl starts to manipulate wealthy Manhattan youths through the power of her internet site, these teenage gossips have become must-reads for secondary school kids everywhere. Who wants to write comments about a celebrity when writing something nasty about someone you actually know could have so much more impact? A love rival has gone off with your boyfriend? Here's a quick and easy way to destroy her confidence forever? Jealous of the boy who seems to get all the girls and be good at sports? Why not make up something about his incontinence problem for all your peers to see? Facebook has had to take down local teenage gossip pages (Gossip Redbridge, Goss girl South London). A friend's son refused to go to school because of 70 comments that had been written about him and another boy's sexuality. Although he wanted her to do nothing because he feared it would make things worse, his mother contacted Facebook to get the local site taken off. As soon as that closed down, one was opened up on the same day, seemingly by the same group of teenage gossipmongers. It is anonymity that really seems to bring out our basest instincts. Any online discussion board shows that being able to say what ever you want without any redress can lead to either the most interesting or the most crude debate imaginable. The Guardian.co.uk Comment is Free site features posts from the \"hang 'em, shoot 'em and if they are lucky flog 'em\" types who hide behind their often self-aggrandising (\"Warriortruthman\" or \"GoddessStar\") web pseudonyms. Throw in the complicated mess of emotions that is teenagehood, when you are more likely to say someone is ugly and unpopular if you feel that about yourself and where sexual envy and longing often spring from the same murky well. Some of the local Facebook pages are controlled by one person who \"writes-up\" the gossip she/he has supposedly been told and are so well-written and arch that it is quite disconcerting: \"Was it Emily K's medical aspirations that saw her examining Justin S's tonsils at Jamie L's 16th birthday party? Perhaps her boyfriend, apparently laid up at home with the flu, would have liked some of her well-known bedside manner?\" (Names changed.) It is either a very weird adult (a mother who fancies herself as Truman Capote perhaps?) or, much more likely, one of those highly intelligent outsiders who is taking their revenge on the popular set who have never even noticed them. In a way, the bile that goes on Littlegossip.com is much easier to dismiss because it is uniformly unimaginative, horrible and badly written \u2013 one outraged mother in the Daily Mail was more shocked by the spelling on the site for Eton College than the viciousness of the content: \"mate your a ******* wannabe, u spend all of dads cash on your drug addiction.\" Schools and parents are now up in arms, trying to do something about these sites. A year ago, the American site Juicycampus was forced to shut down because of the withdrawal of advertising after complaints about the site. This happened around the time that two state attorney generals began investigating the site for possibly violating consumer-protection laws and its own terms of use. But CollegeACB.com (the acronym stands for Anonymous Confession Board) quickly filled the gap. It is run by US undergraduate Peter Frank who takes down posts when asked, although he admits that he can't always get to them right away. He never takes down posts when asked by the college or school as a matter or principle. As he said in Time magazine: \"I am not looking out for the school's best interests, I'm looking out for the students' best interests.\" What frightens parents and teachers is the lack of control they have over what happens on the internet. The way to diminish the power that these sites have is not to try and take them down legally because that is probably just a losing battle and may even increase the rebellious element of logging on to the sites. Luckily, the natural law of the short teenage attention span has already come into play here. Just as it was fashionable to listen to a certain band or to wear a certain brand six months ago, teenagers who were compulsively checking their local gossip websites in the summer holidays to see if they or their friends had been mentioned are now rarely bothering. The fact that parents and teachers are only now expressing their outrage is indicative of the gossip sites' waning favour, because by the time adults notice a \"disturbing teenage trend\" it is probably no longer a trend. According to reliable sources it is now only viewed by \"saddos\" who don't even have the guts to put their name to what they want to say about someone. The need for anonymity is now seen as creepy, cowardly and, most important, rather uncool. Also Littlegossip is very popular with private school kids and things that are very popular with private school kids mean that they have or are about to slip off what teenagers (even the private school kids themselves) consider to be essential to their status and social wellbeing. So the way to tackle these sites is probably not to ban their use (how will that be enforced anyway with the prevalence of smart phones?), but to understand that the fickle nature of adolescents means that Littlegossip.com has already lost its grip on the hearts and minds of the young",
