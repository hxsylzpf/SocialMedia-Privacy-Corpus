  "content": "Job: general manager, Twitter UK Age: 41 Industry: digital media New entry Tony Wang, the general manager of Twitter UK, was thrust into the spotlight into the wake of the hate abuse controversy that engulfed the social media website. Wang apologised after a string of rape and bomb threats were made against female journalists and campaigners, saying that abuse was \"not acceptable in the real world\" and \"not acceptable on Twitter\". Wang, who tweeted the apology, subsequently found himself targeted by Twitter trolls himself. Critics accused Twitter of being slow to react to the problem, although a new \"report tweet\" option for abusive messages has now been introduced. Wang, who was born in San Francisco, joined Twitter in 2010 from Google, having begun his career in law. He has previously said the company remained \"neutral\" about the content put on its site because \"our general counsel and CEO like to say that we are the free-speech wing of the free-speech party\". The site has come under scrutiny not just over issues of abuse but libel and privacy. It is a debate that it not going to go away anytime soon.",
