  "content": "Tumblr is to launch a new policy banning \"self-harm blogs\" from the site, with posts promoting anorexia, bulimia and self-mutilation set to be prohibited. The blogging site had previously allowed blogs which promoted and depicted self-inflicted injury, but in a staff blogpost Tumblr said the policy would be changing \"next week\". \"Our content policy has not, until now, prohibited blogs that actively promote self-harm,\" the post read. \"These typically take the form of blogs that glorify or promote anorexia, bulimia, and other eating disorders; self-mutilation; or suicide.\" Tumblr said it \"strongly opposed\" such messages, but had been faced with a dilemma: The question for us has been whether it's better to (a) prohibit them, as a statement against the very ideas of self-harm that they are advancing, or (b) permit them to stay up, accompanied by a public service warning that directs readers to helplines run by organizations like the National Eating Disorders Association. The statement said Tumblr would be implementing a new content policy \"in the very near future\" which would prohibit content \"that actively promotes or glorifies self-injury or self-harm\". \"This includes content that urges or encourages readers to cut or mutilate themselves; embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders; or commit suicide rather than, eg, seek counselling or treatment for depression or other disorders.\" The statement added: \"Of course, we will allow any affected blogs a grace period in which to edit or download your content\" \u2013 implying that if offending material was left on an individual's Tumblr account it would eventually be deleted. In addition, the site will show \"'public service announcement'-style language\" to users searching for terms typically related to self-harm blogs, directing them to self-help organisations and similar.",
