So most people will know nothing about a recent fascinating European court of human rights judgment called Peck v United Kingdom . Geoffrey Peck, while depressed and mentally unbalanced, tried to kill himself in Brentwood high street, Essex, in 1995. He was saved by the CCTV cameras which monitored his attempt to slit his wrists with a kitchen knife. Some time later the local council released the CCTV footage and stills to television stations and the local press. One paper used a picture under the headline \"Gotcha!\". Mr Peck complained to three media regulators - the broadcasting standards commission, the independent television commission and the press complaints commission - claiming that his privacy had been invaded. The BSC and ITC upheld his complaint. The PCC rejected it without an adjudication. Mr Peck eventually ended up before the court of human rights in Strasbourg, where he complained not only that his privacy had been violated (under article 8) but that under the current system of media regulation in the UK there was no remedy (under article 13). Last month the Strasbourg court ruled that Mr Peck was right, noting that it was the second time that the UK had been found wanting in this respect. It awarded him \u00a37,800 in damages and lobbed the ball firmly back into the government's court. Cue sucking of thumbs. Mr Peck is, of course, not the only person to have resorted to law over his privacy in recent times. A string of footballers, DJs, television personalities, actors, newsreaders and supermodels have - with greater or less cause - gone to law, with mixed success. Many of them are testing the new Human Rights Act and its competing clauses seeking to balance the right to privacy with the right to freedom of expression. Last week's case of the mystery footballer who succeeded in getting an injunction against the News of the World - to interestingly sympathetic coverage in the Daily Mail - was yet another example of someone in public life who bypassed the PCC in favour of a route which evidently appeared to him to be rather more effective. All these developments are of great interest at a time when a House of Commons select committee is looking at the subject of media intrusion and the effectiveness of the press's system of self-regulation. The PCC has submitted a long and powerful defence of the way it has developed over the past 10 years. Much of it is very persuasive and there is plainly no appetite in government to introduce statutory controls or to legislate for any kind of privacy law. But even the most vocal defenders of the PCC will privately admit to reservations about its workings. This is hardly surprising. Just as judges are divided on these immensely complex and sensitive ethical issues, so there is a wide range of different opinions among journalists about the best approach to dealing with them. We ought to welcome that debate, not attempt to stifle it. It is common ground that effective self-regulation is the best way forward. But it does have to be effective. It's not difficult to persuade ourselves that everything in the garden is lovely. The harder thing (see the cases above) is persuading others. So all the press's efforts ought to be channelled towards delivering a form of self-regulation that will be widely seen as transparent, credible and, where appropriate, tough. Should that mean accepting one current idea - an ombudsman to hear appeals from PCC judgments? Knee-jerk response: over our dead bodies. More considered response: would we really be happier for dissatisfied claimants perpetually to be rushing off to the courts? The PCC survived Anna Ford's appeal. No one believes it would have emerged unscathed had the case brought by Sara Cox gone in front of a judge. None of this is to argue for an ombudsman. It may be a terribly bad idea. But it is an example of the sort of notion kicking around which might be better discussed openly than buried under a torrent of dismissive invective. The PCC rightly claims considerable credit for establishing a model of newspaper self-regulation that is now studied and imitated around the world. But there are still issues to do with independence, transparency, pro-activity and effective remedies that will not go away, however much we, as an industry, wish they would. It is far better for the press to face up to these issues openly than wait for a succession of claimants to create a privacy law by the back door. Those, such as the Independent's editor, Simon Kelner, who argue for more effective regulation, are not betraying the press. They're doing it a favour.",
