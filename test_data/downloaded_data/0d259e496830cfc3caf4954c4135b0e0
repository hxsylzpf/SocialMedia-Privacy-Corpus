J Brand's Goldfrapp trousers If you live in your J Brand jeans, time to broaden your horizons to J Brand leather jackets, silk blouses and \u2013 our favourites \u2013 these coated twill trousers. In store now. Love. Topshop Dress Up range Because there's still totally time for Ryan to call needing a date for the Oscars, so it's only sensible to invest \u00a3200 in this jewelled vest dress. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, right? Kidda Christopher Shannon's signature chain and modern paisleys on jersey tops and T-shirts at Asos. We're on board. Avocado omelette The so-wrong-it's-right supper du jour. Trust us. Going down Pugs Owls are now the fashionables' favourite, fyi. Pete Doherty Yes, he's in a fashion ad campaign. No, we still don't care about what he's got on. Instagram Enough already. Giving your photos a vintage filter doesn't make them any more interesting.
