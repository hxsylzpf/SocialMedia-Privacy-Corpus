In front of a television audience that would be much better-off watching almost anything else, the candidates will \"debate\" each other. I put that word in quotes for the simple reason that this exercise is anything but an actual debate. It is a joint appearance designed to revolve around slogans, soundbites and spin, and which demonstrates the sheer contempt in which American political parties and their media collaborators hold the public. In the age of the internet and distributed communications, we could do so much better. When Abraham Lincoln debated Stephen Douglas in the famous 1858 Illinois Senate race, they were engaging in a form of public conversation that meant something. The knew the issues, and they went deeply into them for hours at a time, in front of audiences that recognised they were voting on their state's future. Television has reduced debates into a pathetic shadow of the real thing. Not only do press questioners ask puerile questions, with few exceptions, but the very format of these affairs \u2013 limiting the candidates to soundbite-length answers with little follow-up \u2013 guarantees shallowness. Four years ago, in a Boston Globe opinion column and on my blog, I urged a shift in tactics. I didn't get very far with my suggestions, needless to say, but hope springs eternal. What I suggested then was that political candidates use the incredible tools we now have at hand \u2013 search, blogging, online video, wikis, interactive games, and virtual worlds, among other things \u2013 to create the kinds of serious conversations, with voters and each other, that we all deserve at this perilous crossroads in our history. Communications technology has played a key role in American politics for more than two centuries. The printing press empowered pamphleteers and early American newspapers in our revolutionary days. Later, the telegraph speeded up the news, and still later the telephone, radio and ultimately television transformed media into one-to-many megaphones of unparalleled power. The internet is all of that plus more, a many-to-many system that makes conversation and collaboration easier, and deeper. There have been a few fledgling efforts to use the net in the context of debating, but those events have typically involved major media organisations creating what amounted to sideshows on the main events. A better idea in the 2008 election cycle was 10Questions.com, created by the TechPresident.com political site, working with the New York Times and MSNBC. It allowed voters to ask video questions and decide, via voting, which questions the candidates would answer. on the ones that get posed to candidates. There are any number of ways to do even better. One, especially useful in a multi-candidate race like the Republican presidential marathon, would have the candidates agreeing to lengthy, one-on-one meetings, and then put everything online. These would work best with the candidates querying each other, cutting journalists out of the loop, as long as the politicians had time to provide substantial responses, and then follow-ups. Then, the rest of us could sort through the mass of video, creating comparisons on the issues. Most voters would merely sample the videos, but some would want to go further. The best feature of this kind of debate: highlighting the shallowness of what they candidates do now. But that's just one step. Truly using the web would mean creating a much more ambitious project. Imagine, for example, a debate that unfolds online over the course of days, or even weeks and months. While they'd include audio, video and other media, these debates would necessarily exist, for the most part, in the more traditional form of text, which is still by far the best for exploring serious issues in serious ways. Questions would be posed by candidates to each other, as well as by journalists and the public. But an answer would not be the end of that round; in fact, it would only be the beginning. Rebuttals and further rejoinders would be the meat of these conversations. They would not be done on the fly, but would come after the candidates and their staffs had some time to consider their responses. They'd point out flaws and inaccuracies in their opponents' statements, drilling down into details where warranted. Wherever possible, people would use the internet's elemental unit \u2013 the hyperlink \u2013 to point to source material or other supporting information. The public's role could be crucial in this system. They would help their own side come up with rebuttal arguments, offering corrections, new facts and other supporting material. Candidates could use this, or not, as they wished. Wise candidates and their staffs would encourage as much participation as possible. These moderated events would run for days, maybe for the entire campaign season. They would not be debates in a classical sense, but would definitely be the kinds of conversations that would illuminate the public sphere. What technologies should we bring to bear on this? We're limited only by our imaginations. We might, for example, use a virtual world or game technologies. Online forums would be useful. Wikis, sites where anyone can edit the pages, are another potential venue; the International Debate Education Association's \"Debatepedia\", has much to recommend. Active moderation would be essential. These online communities could self-police, to some degree, using tools that work well for this purpose, but the events would likely need some help from people whose role would be to intervene on the side of maintaining civility. As we've seen repeatedly, online trolls do their best to ruin even the most civil conversations, and when politics is involved the trolls descend like locusts on a field. Most of all, if this kind of thing is going to happen, we need collaboration among technologists and political people \u2013 and the public \u2013 to identify best approaches. That would be an interesting debate in itself. Now that we're in the second decade of the 21st century, isn't it time to bring debating close to the present?",
