  "content": "The Sun has defended the photographs it published today of Prince Harry groping and kissing a female friend, saying there is \"absolutely no question over their authenticity\". Clarence House has disputed when and where the photos were taken and has asked the Sun to correct the story. It says the photos are three years old - before the prince was dating his current girlfriend Chelsy Davy - and were taken at a different nightclub to the one named in the Sun. But the Sun has issued a robust defence of its decision to publish the six photos - including one of Prince Harry fondling the breast of friend Natalie Pinkham - in a story headlined \"Dirty Harry\" and tagged \"picture exclusive\". A spokesman for The Sun said: \"We bought the photographs and negatives of our favourite playboy Prince which were taken in a popular London venue attended by members of the public. There is absolutely no question over their authenticity. \"Clarence House have informed us they have concerns over precisely when and in which nightclub the pictures were taken and we are discussing these matters with them.\" Paddy Haverson, Prince Charles' communications secretary, told MediaGuardian.co.uk that the pictures were taken at another nightclub, Purple, in September 2003 - before Prince Harry began dating Ms Davy. \"The pictures are three years old and we have asked the Sun to correct [its story],\" said Mr Haverson. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
