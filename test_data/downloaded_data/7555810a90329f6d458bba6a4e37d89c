  "content": "A German bank that allows customers to set their savings rates based on its number of likes on Facebook will launch in the UK on Friday. Fidor \u2013 derived from the Latin word for trust \u2013 does not have any branches and is part of a new wave of banks aiming to attract digital savvy customers at a time when the market is being subjected to an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. Based in Germany, with deposits overed by the German savings guarantee scheme, Fidor is starting out with a savings account and intends to launch full service current accounts and other products later. The launch was originally slated for the first half of the year. Matthias Kr\u00f6ner, chief executive of Fidor, said he was aiming for 50,000 in the next three years. The UK is Fidor's main move outside its domestic market where it has almost 100,000 customers and 300,000 users of its community sites. Kr\u00f6ner said he is aiming to turn it into a pan-European digital bank. A venture into Russia has stalled while operations with a US banking partner are also being discussed. Initially , customers will need to open what is called a current account \u2013 although it does not yet have a debit card attached to it. The account will offer a 0.25% savings rate, which could increase to 0.5% depending on customers' willingness to rate it on Facebook. Each 2,000 likes on Facebook will increase the percentage interest, so 4,000 likes would take it to 0.35% \u2013 rates that do not challenge the incumbents such as Lloyds Banking Group, which pays a higher amount for in-credit balance. The initial current account will only offer a basic minimum of transfers to other banks and mobile phone numbers initially, but will allow customers to open a savings product, which eventually may also be priced depending on Facebook likes. Among the ideas being introduced from Fidor's German operation to the UK is its \"community Karma\" forum aims to curate the views of members. Rewards for customers, who are required to log in, are promised for asking questions, Kr\u00f6ner said. During the trial phase, participants were offered \u00a35 for finding spelling mistakes, for instance. \"The community is [the way] we offer a platform for conversation with our customers and user base, and we are going to define the future priorities,\" said Kr\u00f6ner. \"I have an idea what better banking is. It may not be the idea of the audience,\" he said. \"We are the only bank paying money for asking questions. I don't there is another bank on the plne to be paying for asking questions. Normally you get an annoyed look,\" said Kr\u00f6ner.",
