  "content": "And the winner was ... 44 minutes. That was how long it took Jonathan Ross to say \"salad\" while hosting the Bafta film awards last night. Ross asked his Twitter friends to suggest a word that he had to shoehorn into the show, with the winning entrant chosen by his wife Jane. She went for salad and Ross popped it in during a not very good acting analogy. The lack of audience response, as noted in the Guardian's live Baftas blog, suggests the crossover between \"Bafta nominee/buddy/ligger\" and \"Twitterer\" is not particularly big, and possibly non-existent. Twitter fans at home, meanwhile, were simultaneously jumping up and down on the sofa yelling \"He said salad! He said salad!\" to the bemusement of all around them.",
