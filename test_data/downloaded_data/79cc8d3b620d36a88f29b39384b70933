Moss's lawyers have written to the newspaper to complain about the photograph, which appeared to show the supermodel walking arm in arm with Gillespie. In fact, claims Gerrard Tyrrell of law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis, Gillespie was holding hands with his girlfriend Katie England when the picture was taken - and Moss was walking in front of the pair. In the photo Moss is positioned in front of Gillespie and although long lenses can shrink distance, they appear to be standing quite close to each other. However, on closer inspection it is possible to see that Gilliespie is holding hands with someone who was standing behind Moss - although this person appears to have been airbrushed out completely. Mr Tyrrell is also contesting the newspaper's claim that Moss was \"comforting\" Gillespie following the break-up of his relationship with Ms England. \"Not only have they not split up, but Kate [Moss] and Bobby were in different continents when the article was published,\" said Mr Tyrrell, who is acting on behalf of both Moss and Gillespie. \"You can actually see him holding Katie [England's] hand in the photograph.\" The Press Complaints Commission's code specifically bans newspapers from publishing \"inaccurate, misleading or distorted material including pictures\". The News of the World said today: \"The allegation that the News of the World faked this photo is untrue. The photo was obtained from a reputable picture agency and was not airbrushed or doctored in any way. We are surprised by Gerrard Tyrrell's comments. Rav Singh put the quotes contained in the article to him on the day prior to publication. He made no objection and added: 'Bobby [Gillespie] is nothing to do with us. He is a big boy.'\" In April 1996 John Prescott was outraged by a doctored photograph published in the London Evening Standard, apparently showing him quaffing champagne at a party in an effort to portray his as a \"champagne socialist\". The trick was exposed when rival newspapers published the same photograph the following day, showing Mr Prescott in fact had a bottle of beer in front of him. And in 1997 the Mirror published a photograph which appeared to show Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed in an embrace. In fact, Fayed's head had been rotated using computer technology to give the appearance of intimacy. And in 1992 the former Neighbours star Jason Donovan successfully sued the Face magazine after it published a two-page article alleging he was gay alongside with a doctored photograph of him wearing a T-shirt onto which the words \"Queer as fuck\" had been superimposed. Donovan was awarded \u00a3300,000, but insisted the magazine keep the money. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
