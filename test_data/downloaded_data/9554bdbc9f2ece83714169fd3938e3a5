  "content": "Shamed TV presenter Angus Deayton is under pressure to take a pay cut if he wants to return to Have I Got News For You in the autumn. Hat Trick Productions, which makes the BBC show, is finding it difficult to justify paying Deayton the huge fees he commanded before sordid details of his encounter with a prostitute and cocaine-taking surfaced, according to reports today. Deayton, who receives fees of between \u00a340,000 and \u00a350,000 a show, is one of the highest paid presenters on TV, according to today's Daily Mail. This equates to an annual fee of up to \u00a31.5m for the 30 episodes of the show - putting him ahead of A-list actors such as David Jason, who earns \u00a31m a year, or veteran newscasters such as Sir Trevor McDonald, who earns about \u00a3560,000 a year. Deayton's demands for cash have hit the headlines before - last May he was paid a phenomenal \u00a350,000 to present the Bafta awards. \"Angus's wage demands are legendary - he's always driven a hard bargain,\" an unnamed TV executive told the Daily Mail. \"Hat Trick would like more leverage. Now the boot is on the other foot. \"If he wants to return to Have I Got News For You it's not going to be on the same terms. He is going to have to eat some humble pie.\" Following the revelation of Deayton's sex and cocaine sessions with call girl Caroline Martin, it emerged he had been unfaithful to Lise Mayer, his scriptwriter partner of nine years and mother of his child, with another scriptwriter, Stacy Herbert. Deayton could face further embarrassing allegations in the autumn. The Mail on Sunday is appealing against an injunction preventing the paper from revealing more details about Deayton's private life and the case is due to be heard in October.",
