  "content": "The details of David Jones online customers have been hacked after a vulnerability in the department store's website was discovered. David Jones is not saying how many customers have been affected but has moved to reassure people no credit card details were accessed. The breach accessed names, email addresses, mailing addresses and order details of David Jones customers who have shopped on the store's websites. \"David Jones takes its customers' privacy very seriously. As soon as David Jones learnt of the unauthorised access it moved swiftly to prevent any further incident, working closely with IBM, our internet platform provider,\" a spokeswoman for the department store said. \"We sincerely apologise to our customers and have assured them that David Jones and IBM are doing everything we can to make sure this does not happen again.\" David Jones said it did not store any financial information of its customers on its website and there is not yet an indication of the information accessed being misused. It said affected customers have been emailed and if customers have not received an email then they have not been affected. The store reiterated it would never contact customers and request that they provide their financial information or credit card details over the phone. It is the second reported hacking incident affecting a large retailer this week, after Kmart revealed on Wednesday that details of its online customers had been hacked in an \"external privacy breach.\" It also said no credit card details were accessed.",
