  "content": "Can you tell us a little about your role at Olswang? I am a solicitor specialising in providing legal advice on commercial transactions and copyright issues relating to all forms of digital media, particularly those offering music and audiovisual content. Over the past 20 years, I've helped clients launch new and innovative services across a range of technologies, delivering originally to TV sets and latterly to PCs, mobile devices, tablets and other connected devices. Since your career began, how has the digital media landscape evolved? It's changed a lot. When I started working, the only digital content was to be found on CDs. What then seemed progressive is now obsolete. Having worked on analogue cable and satellite, acting for internet service providers (ISPs), watching the launch of digital TV, seeing digital switchover and the launch of web presence, I've seen many changes. There's been a number of technologies that have evolved and shaped the media landscape. In my view, the most significant development is the iPlayer \u2013 it was a well-executed pioneer of the services that have revolutionised how the younger generation is consuming content. Is the legal system moving quickly enough to keep up with advances in online content delivery? People overstate the extent to which the law needs to change to deal with new technology. Obviously, there are areas around the periphery where the law doesn't quite work and needs updating. However, if we had really serious problems at the heart of how the legal system deals with digital, then we wouldn't have experienced major transitions and changes for the better. The legal system is forever changing as are the advances in online content delivery. The law does need to continue to adapt to the market especially in areas such as data privacy and cyber security, which are both of increasing importance to senior executives. Going forward, new legislation will need to be sensitive to business needs so as to not cause damage by taking an over-protective paternalistic approach. To what extent is media convergence muddying the waters in terms of clear legal definitions? The great thing about contracts is that people can use them to define things for themselves. Take football rights \u2013 10 years ago people would buy rights to football by reference to a specific technology (internet or TV). That doesn't happen any more, but the rights owners can still clearly define what rights they are giving to their licensees. The only area left behind is regulation \u2013 it makes less and less sense for broadcast television to be regulated very differently than other forms of visual content being delivered to exactly the same screen via the internet. That is the next challenge for regulators and legislators. Should access to content across international boundaries be standardised? Legally, can it be? The simple answer is that this should be driven by consumer demand. There are many reasons why standardisation is difficult to achieve and probably undesirable. If we think about content in an international context, there are many reasons why things cannot be standardised \u2013 cultural differences and sensitivities, consumption habits, language, certification rules. An Estonian may want to watch US movies and English football, but with editing of violence, nudity etc according to their own rules, and with subtitles or dubbing or commentary in Estonian, and (in the case of football) with pundits who are famous in Estonia. Making it easier to watch English language content around the world risks undermining local cultures and local content industries. In your experience, do consumers care about the usage of their data? Generally, I'd say no. Consumers appear to be indifferent to what they're signing up for and are no more cautious about joining, say, Facebook, in countries with little or no data protection laws than they are in countries with strong data protection regimes. When a story hits the headlines about a data breach, leading to public discourse and debate, this doesn't necessarily affect consumer behaviour. There's certainly a role for industry and government to provide education to people so that they better understand what they're signing up for and perhaps understand how powerful data can be. With a public that's being made increasingly aware of both the value and dangers of parting with data, how can companies move to guarantee data privacy, or acceptable use of the collated data? There's increasingly a need for company executives to have better security in place to guard against data breaches and to deal with the consequences of any actual breaches. We've seen in recent times how data breaches and hacking can be very harmful to a company's brand. It doesn't take much for consumer confidence to fall \u2013 so companies need to have effective security, to communicate that and to be open and transparent in order to engender trust among their customers. As media companies begin to better understand the value of data, do you expect companies to offer more as the exchange value changes? As media companies become more sophisticated with data analytics they should be able to provide better services to their customers. Ideally, both the consumer and company feel they are gaining value from their interactions. What I expect to see more of is companies working together (even sometimes when they are otherwise competitors) in order to aggregate data insights and provide even greater value to consumers. What advances do you expect to see in content delivery over the next five years, and how will the law adapt to this? We're already seeing a move towards content delivery to tablets and other portable devices via both fixed and mobile infrastructure. This will only increase, with some estimating that 75% of all data traffic will be video by 2020. The law will increasingly be called on to ensure that those who control the technical infrastructure are allowing consumers to access whatever content they want \u2013 in other words net neutrality, but there is a tension between that and making sure that the costs of providing the infrastructure are fairly borne by all those who use it. I think we'll also see the law increasingly being used to seek to deal with the digital divide \u2013 especially as more government services are delivered digitally, there are increasing societal questions about access to the internet and social exclusion.
