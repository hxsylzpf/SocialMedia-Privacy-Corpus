  "content": "A Premier League footballer fears that if details about his alleged extra-marital affair became public he would be \"booed during games\" and \"the subject of cruel chants\", according to a witness statement submitted to the high court. In the witness statement the player said that exposing his personal life would have a \"devastating effect on his marriage, on his wife and particularly their children\". \"He states that it has become common for footballers whose private lives are exposed by the media to be booed during games and be the subject of cruel chants,\" the statement added. The footballer and the woman he is alleged to have had an affair with obtained the injunction on 16 May \u2013 four days after the Sun gave the player's club notice that it intended to expose the alleged affair. On Monday high court judge Mr Justice Tugendhat published the reasons for the gagging order being granted and maintained. The high court also heard on Monday how the footballer's legal team have submitted evidence concerning publication on Twitter which allegedly breach the injunction, as well as in the Sun and Daily Mail newspapers. Another footballer in a separate injunction case on Friday attempted to begin action against a number of Twitter users. The written judgment details how a journalist from the Sun went to the woman's home several months ago and said the paper \"would be willing to pay a lot of money\" for the story, but she refused. However, Tugendhat pointed out that this case is \"not a case of kiss and tell\", because both parties in the alleged relationship sought the gagging order. \"It is one in which both parties to the past relationship wish to keep it private.\" The judge added that the Sun had so far not produced any evidence to show that the gagging order should be lifted in the public interest. The paper had previously argued in a telephone conversation with the claimants' solicitors, Schillings, that it was in the public interest because the paper was \"exposing his hypocrisy\". Tugendhat added: \"No doubt NGN [News Group Newspapers, the publisher of the Sun] came to appreciate that, in the light of numerous judgments by different judges of the House of Lords, of the court of appeal, of this court and of the European court of human rights, it had no prospect of success.\" In the written judgment handed down at the court, Tugendhat said: \"The court does not grant injunctions which would be futile. But the fact that these publications have occurred does not mean that there should be no injunction in this case.\" He added that there was \"still something to be achieved by an injunction\" even \"once the secret is revealed\". \"In the present case the effort of the publications ... is that private information which was secret is no longer secret. So to that extent one purpose of the injunction has been defeated,\" Tugendhat said. \"There is a pressing need for the injunction to prevent harassment and unjustified intrusion into the lives of the claimants and the man's family.\" Addressing the recent string of gagging orders taken out against the media, Tugendhat said that there was \"no stereotype\" to which they all fit. He pointed out that of those who have taken out injunctions, \"many are women\" and \"many of the cases are about information which is not sexual\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
