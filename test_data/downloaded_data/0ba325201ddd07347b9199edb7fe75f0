When hackers falsely tweeted claims of an attack on the White House to AP's 1.9 million followers, markets plummeted. The S&amp;P 500 quickly lost $136bn in value as traders dumped stock in response. The breach showed in glorious Technicolor the potential real-world impact of our growing reliance on social platforms, and the impact from a single compromised login. Twitter has evolved far from its original roots as a relatively niche tool for the tech-savvy, and is now one of the major information sharing platforms in the world. Everyone from news organisations to large corporations and political figures trust the medium as a way for communicating with the outside world. The key word here is 'trust'. As social media services have evolved into everyday consciousness, people have come to rely on their timeliness and ease-of-use as a way of staying informed. Users engage with the information which appears from big brands and organisations in their social feeds as if it were from a family member or friend. This seemingly informal tone and the fact that people choose to consume the information, rather than having it thrust upon them, means these platforms incite a high degree of loyalty from users. However, with the increasing profile and importance of such services comes unwanted attention from hacking groups, of which the Syrian Electronic Army is just one of many. Once targeted by this relentless and disparate collection of individuals, their hive mentality can be ruthlessly creative in determining potential exploits. Their persistence can often pay-off, and high-profile logins are the ultimate prize, valuable in many ways beyond just bragging rights. The problem for the social media giants is that, as it is in the very nature of social media, each and every breach is in the public domain and recent high-profile attacks serve as a multiplier. Although the halo effect these have had on reputation is hard to quantify, it is definite. Users enjoy a special trusting relationship with social media brands that other companies envy, and attacks by hackers seriously detracts from this. These companies, which often have few tangible assets, rely largely on trusting relationships as the basis of their financial value. This, coupled with a ballooning importance as trusted information sharing platforms, means login security has board implications. The high-profile hacks of late have put the issue on the agenda and big online players are now rapidly fortifying their login processes. In order to augment existing systems with an added security process, such as SMS-based two-factor authentication, each organisation must consider the balance of cost, user-friendliness and security. Two-factor authentication via SMS lends itself nicely to integration because the cost to send an SMS is relatively low (especially when compared to other solutions) \u2013 it's also easily accepted by end-users and a natural complement to personal usage-associated mobile phones. Online communities have historically been reticent to roll-out an additional layer of security, afraid that an additional step to the login process would drive away users, or prove expensive to deploy. Using SMS as a security transport mechanism to deliver a one-time password is becoming increasingly commonplace. This technique, which has crossed over from the financial world, is also gaining popularity with users, negating concerns of over-complicating the login process. Because high-profile breaches have become a part of mainstream life, users are willing to undergo an additional step to access their social media accounts and maintain an extra level of security. Anecdotal examples aside, a recent survey by the Ponemon Institute (pdf) found that almost half of British people do not trust websites that only rely on a single password. As we enter an era where trusted information becomes of the utmost importance, the platforms which are used to share it are acting to ensure its validity. Ultimately, no security system is infallible, but for the moment it seems that SMS-based two-factor authentication is providing a much-needed security layer for online companies keen to ensure legitimacy. With hundreds of millions of people relying on social networks every day, and the value of the platforms themselves contingent on these people, technical discussion on login authentication has become the norm. This is being driven by the collective reputational and financial impact of hacked accounts, but a single login in the wrong hands is worth billions.
