Coulson, 43, was arrested by appointment at Lewisham police station in south London by detectives from Operation Weeting and Operation Elvedon. The prime minister's former spin doctor arrived at the station at 10.30am, where he was placed in custody and held for nine hours, then released on police bail to return in October. On his release, at 7.30pm, he told reporters he had attended voluntarily. \"There is an awful lot I would like to say, but I can't at this time,\" he added. Detectives made a search of his home in Forest Hill, south London. In a dawn visit police also arrested the News of the World's former royal reporter Clive Goodman, 53, at his home in Surrey and took him to a different south London station for questioning. Police searched his home and later searched his offices at the Daily Star Sunday. Goodman (who served four months in prison over the phone-hacking scandal) was arrested on suspicion of contravening Section 1 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 in relation to allegedly paying bribes to police officers. He was also released on police bail until October. In a statement, the Daily Star Sunday said: \"They [police] confirmed they were similarly carrying out these routine checks at all places where Mr Goodman has worked as a freelance since he left the News of the World. Officers formally requested any and all computer material that Goodman had been involved with during his occasional shifts as a freelance reporter at the paper over the last year to cross-check it with his activities in his NoW role. They were particularly interested to check Mr Goodman's current email contacts to cross-match them with those from his time at the NoW.\" The paper said there was no suggestion Goodman acted improperly during \"occasional\" work for them, adding no payments of \"any kind were made by the newspaper to Goodman contacts\". Three officers were invited to examine any desk where he may have sat during shifts.\" Yesterday evening a third, unnamed man was also arrested on corruption charges. Scotland Yard said: \"The Metropolitan police has this evening arrested a member of the public in connection with allegations of corruption. Officers from Operation Weeting together with officers from Op Elveden arrested a man on suspicion of corruption allegations contrary to Section 1 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906. The man, aged 63, was arrested at a residential address in Surrey. A search is ongoing at this address.\" Sir Paul Stephenson, Met commissioner, has repeatedly said that Operation Weeting, the hacking inquiry, will go wherever the evidence leads it. It is highly likely it will examine other newspapers suspected of making payments and other police forces. It may also examine a wide range of illegal practices by news organisations going back many years. As well as Weeting, deputy assistant commissioner Sue Akers is investigating alleged bribes of up to \u00a3100,000 paid to three to five Met officers by the News of the World, in an inquiry overseen by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. News International meets the police once a fortnight, according to sources. At these meetings officers often demand documentation relating to their unfolding investigations. \"It is very much police asking News International to go away and find emails or documents for detectives as their inquiries take them down certain paths,\" said a source. A third investigation is looking into the activities of the disgraced private detective Jonathan Rees, who supplied the News of the World, the Sunday Mirror and other media organisations for many years. Officers are conducting preliminary investigations into the vast amounts of documentation relating to Rees, who ran a private detective company with his partner, former police officer Sid Fillery. Rees has already been the subject of five Metropolitan police inquiries since his original partner Daniel Morgan was murdered in 1987. Earlier this year Rees and other associates stood trial for the murder and were formally acquitted when the case collapsed. Documentation in the Met's possession is extensive, spanning more than 750,000 pages containing evidence of corrupt practices by Rees and corrupt officers paid to acquire information for the media. He is also alleged to have got confidential information by using virus-carrying emails to steal data, and \"blaggers\" to trick banks into releasing details of customers' accounts. As a result of one of the Met inquiries Rees was jailed for six years for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. On his release from prison, in 2005, he continued to work for newspapers. The Scottish Crown Office also said that Strathclyde police were working with counterparts in London to see if phone hacking extended to Scotland. The Crown did not comment on any specific allegations, but But Aamer Anwar, a solicitor for celebrities and sports stars, has handed a dossier to police in Glasgow which he says contains details of private information accessed by the NoW. \"In Scotland, scores of names, numbers and addresses appear of individuals from all walks of life who may have been subjected to illegal activities by News of the World, but the Metropolitan Police in the first inquiry never bothered to contact them. \"We are requesting that they are contacted by the Strathclyde Police and that their details are cross-referenced with the phone-hacking inquiry now taking place in London.\" Cameron on Coulson 31 May 2007 \"Andy is a hugely experienced journalist. I am delighted that he has agreed to join my team. Andy will make a formidable contribution as a senior member of my team in building the most effective strategy and operation to win the next general election.\" 9 July 2009 \"It's wrong for newspapers to breach people's privacy with no justification. That is why Andy Coulson resigned as editor of the News of the World two and a half years ago. But I believe in giving people a second chance. As director of communications for the Conservatives, he does an excellent job in a proper, upright way in everything that he does.\" 25 September 2010 \"People are trying to punish him twice for the same offence.\" 5 October 2010 \"No one is unsackable. But ... we haven't had one single complaint about how he has done his job. He's someone who serves the government and actually runs a very good press office and communications department.\" 17 January 2011 \"Obviously, when he was editor of the News of the World, bad things happened at that newspaper. I would just argue that, working for the government, I think he has done a good job for the government and for the country.\" 21 January 2011 \"I am very sorry that Andy Coulson has decided to resign as my director of communications, although I understand that the continuing pressures on him and his family mean that he feels compelled to do so. Andy has told me that the focus on him was impeding his ability to do his job and was starting to prove a distraction for the government.\" 8 July 2011 \"I decided to give him a second chance and no one has raised serious concerns about how he did his job for me. The second chance didn't work out. The decision to hire him was mine and mine alone and I take full responsibility for it. When you work with someone for four years as I did and you work closely, you do build a friendship and I became friends with him ... so, yes, he became a friend and is a friend.\"",
