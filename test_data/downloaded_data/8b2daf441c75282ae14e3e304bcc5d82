  "content": "Imagine the scenario. You are enjoying an afternoon shopping with your two small babies and your 16-year-old daughter. You notice a man taking photos of your family, so you ask him to stop. He becomes aggressive and threatening, but eventually he leaves. Satisfied that this strange man has gone, you go into a cafe to buy some drinks, but when you return you find your teenage daughter looking terrified. You learn that this stranger came back to photograph your children from a few feet away. Your young daughter feels intimidated, helpless and afraid. A while later, you notice this man yet again, hiding behind a tree and continuing to photograph your family. Apparently you must accept this behaviour, simply because you are \u2026 a musician. This is what happened to my family in October 2012. My husband is Paul Weller, or \"Dad\" as he's known to the most important people in our lives. When I discovered these photographs of my children on Mail Online, one of the world's most visited websites, I felt sick. My children's privacy had been violated. I didn't believe it was legal to expose any child in this way \u2013 no matter what their parents' profession. What happened next was a lengthy, distressing and costly legal battle. If we had been unsuccessful, it could have cost us hundreds of thousands of pounds. On our children's behalf, we successfully fought Associated Newspapers, the Mail's owner \u2013 and one of the most powerful and deep-pocketed organisations in this country \u2013 for assurance that this would never happen to our family again. In reality, the result of our case prevents this one publication from further exposing the facial images of these three of our children in their salacious gossip columns. It does not prevent another paper from doing the same thing. It does not protect our other children. And it does not protect yours. The only way to ensure properly that this doesn't happen to any family again is to legislate against it. That is why I am campaigning for a change in the law to make it an offence for the media to identify any child without their parents' consent. You may believe that these issues don't affect \"normal\" families, but this really can affect anyone. One need only look to the McCanns, the Dowlers or the Lawrences to see how something as unpredictable as becoming the victim of a crime can thrust a family into the media spotlight. However, let me just make one thing clear \u2013 my children are \"normal\" children, just like anyone else's. They are not \"celebrities\" and are no different just because of who they are related to. All children deserve the same protection. Every fair-minded person would agree that it is in all of our best interests to have a free yet responsible press, and if all editors adhered to their own code there wouldn't be a problem. Many powerful parts of the media and their vested interests will vehemently oppose any change in the law that enforces press improvement, but it is a case of balancing their rights with our responsibility to protect children. As a mum, my view is that the media's right of free expression cannot outweigh a child's right to grow up privately and safely. It is not in the public interest for the tabloids to identify children, and it's not in the child's interest for their privacy to be violated in this way. It is not in anyone's best interest for the tabloid editors to decide whose child gets scrutinised this week. If a child were ever kidnapped, abused, harmed \u2013 or worse \u2013 as a direct result of tabloid exposure, the whole country would undoubtedly cry that something should have been done sooner. Why must we wait for a tragedy before we take action and stop this unjustifiable intrusion into children's lives?",
