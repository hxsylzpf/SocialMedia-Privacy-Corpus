But however doggedly Google pursues its mission to organise the world's information, there are among the growing band of website pioneers new, innovative and increasingly influential companies pushing alternative ways to find what you're looking for. Type a question into Google these days and, particularly if it's related to the technology business, you're increasingly likely to be served results from Quora.com. A simple Q&amp;A site with well-executed rating features and social media integration, Quora has become the darling of Silicon Valley's elite and has provided easy pickings for quote-hunting technology journalists since it was launched in January 2010. This week, the latest bubble-expanding rumours claimed that Quora turned down investment funds that valued the firm at $1bn (\u00a3620m). Hot on the heels of Facebook's latest astonishing valuation of $60bn, Twitter at $10bn and social-games company Zynga at $9bn, Quora's perceived value can be taken as another indicator of an inflated and unrealistic internet market. But it is also incontrovertible evidence that the online Q&amp;A business is on a steep upward curve. Use your Facebook or Twitter login to join, enter your question and tech insiders and pundits rush to prove their credibility and expertise by providing a knowledgeable \u2013 and literate \u2013 answer. Quora's sudden surge in popularity has been helped by several factors. It was founded by two ex-Facebookers, former engineer Charlie Cheever and chief technology officer Adam D'Angelo \u2013 another startup by Facebook alumni who benefit from the cachet of their former employer. Cheever and D'Angelo used their social media expertise to develop Quora as a more intelligent, sophisticated Q&amp;A site, but also helped generate enough buzz that some Silicon Valley heavyweights began contributing. Entrepreneur Mark Cuban, Craigslist founder Craig Newmark and part-time tech entrepreneur Ashton Kutcher have all contributed to Quora. In response to the question \"What does Dustin Moskovitz think of the Facebook movie?\", it was Facebook co-founder Moskovitz himself who replied. \"I'm not exactly sure how or why lots of 'big name Valley types' started using the site early on,\" Cheever wrote on Quora. \"But we did think it was really cool to learn from what they had to share. There is a general culture in Silicon Valley of wanting to try out new things, which probably helped everything get started.\" If winning high-profile users was not enough, last month Quora managed to tempt financier Marc Bodnick, co-founder of Bono's private equity firm Elevation Partners, to leave the company and join Quora as its new head of marketing and business operations. For now, Quora is riding the new wave of anticipation over the next phase of the social internet: taking discovery, and personalised information away from pure search to more intelligent information systems. Its success can also be attributed to answers that are well optimised and therefore highly visible among search results, but are also cleverly woven into users' social accounts, sharing answers and inviting exchanges between people we know. Radio technology executive James Cridland, managing director of Media UK and regular Quora user, said he was attracted to the site by the calibre of users. \"On Yahoo Answers, you get a well-meaning 13-year-old answering questions, badly, in return for points,\" he said. \"On Quora, it's not unusual for a question about a digital business to be answered by the CEO of that business. It's particularly good at highlighting the qualification of the user to answer a particular question, and as a specialist in my field it is clearly a great marketing opportunity to show off my knowledge.\" Cridland acknowledges that the site's early users will demand new innovations to maintain their interest: \"There is also the small thing that it has no visible means of earning any revenue whatsoever. How they crack that will be interesting to watch.\" In trying to build revenue streams into the site, Quora faces similar challenges to Twitter in having to devise unobtrusive and sensitive ways for brands to engage with its audience, such as sponsorship of certain topics. Recruitment is another area with potential, as users already demonstrate their expertise, profile and experience through the answers they contribute. Stack Overflow, a larger and more serious contender in the Q&amp;A space, is a business already focused on making money through recruitment. \"Our organic way to monetise is going to be with a large network of highly engaged users who are experts in a topic,\" co-founder Joel Spolsky told the Business Insider website. \"Experts are in demand. Just having that network means there will be ways to help those experts get jobs and help people find experts that can solve their problems.\" Spolsky said the site's strategy was to expand only in areas where they can cultivate a core of several hundred experts. Confirming the popularity of different Q&amp;A sites for different audiences, Yahoo Answers had 48 million monthly US users in January, according to digital marketing analysts comScore, but is filled with chat and barely literate questions that include \"why are hotdogs called hotdogs and not hotpigs?\". Editorially focused Mahalo had 4.2m US users, Answerbag \u2013 also dismissed as shallow and low-quality by some \u2013 had 11.2 million, while flirting teen favourite Formspring.me had 5.4 million. Slick, socially focused Aardvark (which has a slogan reading \"Tap the people in your network!\") is still too small to show up. Israeli site Answers.com is being sold to investment firm AFCV Holdings for $127m, a price its shareholders said was too low for an estimated monthly user base of 55 million, according to comScore. Quora was too small to be picked up by comScore's measurement tools until it started being hyped by the tech community in December 2010, when it had 164,000 US users. However, by January 2011 it saw that audience drop to 147,000. Each visitor viewed one page on average and spent just two minutes on the site. To develop, Quora is focusing on algorithms to determine quality \u2013 working on encouraging more users to rate content and improving the introduction to the site for new users. It also plans to expand significantly across new subject areas. \"In five years, I hope there will be great coverage on the site of almost every topic anyone is interested in,\" said Cheever, writing on Quora. \"Right now, there is great coverage of some areas and many more are growing, like life in the military, parenting, farming, etc. I think this will keep happening. For information that isn't new, there's a very good answer in place for almost every question, so you can just look things up on Quora instead of posting new questions.\" Quora's investors feel that the site is developing with the same steady and thoughtful strategy that saw Facebook's exponential growth into the mainstream. Its combined strategies mean Quora will overlap \u2013 and present at least some competition \u2013 to curated information sites such as Wikipedia; to the accessible information mission of Google and the social sharing of Facebook. That is a fearsome set of rivals and, while Quora currently has the attention of California's tech heads, it may lose much of its charm as it attempts to scale up for the mainstream. Investors are falling over themselves to buy a piece of what they think the future of the internet could look like. A worrying sign for the stability of this market is the interest of non-technical investors who want in on the action. Goldman Sachs had to abort a private placement scheme last month that offered clients a stake in Facebook for a minimum investment of $2m; the scheme was so over-subscribed and heavily reported that it risked breaching regulations. As seasoned venture capitalist and dotcom survivor Fred Wilson noted in December: \"When celebrities start popping up in deals and wanting to meet me, I know we are about to hit the wall.\" The real test for Quora will come if it survives the impending bursting bubble of the inflated web technology market, which will see the bluff and bluster and unrealistic, over-hyped startups evaporate. Those left behind will require real revenues, real business models and, at last, will show what the future for the social web really looks like.",
