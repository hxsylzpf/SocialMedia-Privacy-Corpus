  "content": "Rarely can a micro-blogging site have relayed anything as plaintive as the seven-word, three-exclamation-mark message that an exasperated American babysitter shared with the world yesterday. Stumped and hit for six after technology and her nickname conspired to bowl her a celebrity googly, Ashley Kerekes decided to set the record straight. \"I AM NOT A FREAKING CRICKET MATCH!!!\" she howled into the Twittersphere. The 22-year-old's existential crisis began last week when the Ashes started and Twitter users noticed her name: theashes. The ensuing bombardment was enthusiastic and relentless. In the space of a few days, as her cri de coeur echoed around cyberspace, the ranks of her followers swelled from 300 to 8,200. By today, Kerekes was a bona fide Twitter celebrity, with the offer of a free trip to Australia to watch her very own (freaking) test match. \"I was out Christmas shopping with my aunt and I got a Twitter from a friend of mine telling me that some guy was trying to get information about me,\" she told the Brisbane Times. \"I'd turned off notifications on my phone right after my first outburst so I had no idea. After that I went looking around and found that I had hundreds, maybe thousands, of messages about the Ashes.\" Most of them, it seems, left her a little confused. \"What the hell is a wicket?\" she tweeted yesterday, eliciting the waggish reply: \"A sticky wicket is a way of finding badgers in English forests.\" Her celebrity, she said, was due entirely to her other half. \"My boyfriend gave me the nickname years ago, maybe because of the cricket tournament. We don't remember,\" she said. \"He's been calling me the Ashes for ever.\" Despite the \"amazing\" celebrity, Kerekes said she had no plans to change her username. \"I've been into social media for a long time, but I was never this popular,\" she said. Her popularity has already sparked a #gettheashestotheashes movement on Twitter, aiming to get Kerekes to Australia to experience the timeless joys of leather on willow for herself. It appears to be paying off. Today, the Qantas press office tweeted that the airline was bringing \"@theashes to Australia for the Ashes\", while Vodafone Australia has offered to \"pony up #theashes tickets &amp; a phone so she can tweet\". Not to be outflanked by the commercial giants, Kerekes has also come up with her own money-spinning scheme and is now selling T-shirts emblazoned with the legend: \"I AM NOT A FREAKING CRICKET MATCH!!!\" However, she is adamant that she is not being greedy. \"I hope no one is offended by me making T-shirts,\" she tweeted this afternoon. \"I probably make two cents a shirt. I'm not trying to get rich, just have fun.\" A little later, the babysitter-cum-cricket-fixture signed off with a wink to her new friends: \"Howzat. I'm off to bed. See you tomorrow.\"",
