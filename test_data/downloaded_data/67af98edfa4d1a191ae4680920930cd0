  "content": "In 10 years' time all newborn babies could have their genetic code mapped at birth. A complete DNA read-out could help to detect, or predict, conditions such as diabetes and heart failure. However, the automatic mapping of babies' genes is bound to pose questions of privacy and how the information will be handled: could an employer refuse to hire someone likely to suffer from a chronic condition? Or could your insurance company decide inflate its prices after reading your file? If given the choice, would you agree to have your DNA sequence mapped, in spite of the external risks? Would you want to know which diseases you were likely to suffer from?",
