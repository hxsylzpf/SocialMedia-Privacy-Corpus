  "content": "While the Pakistan cricket team stand on the verge of implosion, and corruption reaches its tendrils into hallowed grounds from Lord's to the SCG, it is good to know that the men who run English cricket are keeping a sense of perspective. The validity of the last Test series played on their home turf may be threatening to crash down round their ears like bits of Roman marble in the last days of Nero, but they refuse to take attacks on cricket's reputation lying down. And that's why they have taken immediate action against high-profile players caught besmirching the name of the game, and fined Kevin Pietersen and Dimitri Mascarenhas for saying rude things about them on Twitter. Now, regular followers of Pietersen's feed will be happy to tell you that as crimes go, telling the England and Wales Cricket Board that its selection process is a \"fuck-up\" really doesn't compare with his profligate use of exclamation marks, or the fact that he thinks \"LOL\" is still in current usage. If the ECB is going to police its players' postings, I think I'd have liked it to step in rather earlier, perhaps as he began his ill-advised attempts to empathise with his public: \"Does anyone like traffic wardens??? SOOOO rude!!! Not a good morning, starting with a parking fine..Grrrr!!\" It is now being suggested that the board could ban players from Twitter in perpetuity. As ever with the ECB, you find yourself wondering just how small that piece of moral high ground it occupies can be, and whether it had to ask for directions on the way there. After all, there are several hundred thousand people following various professional cricketers online, and you can be sure that if each of those people could be made to pay a fiver for the privilege, Twitter would suddenly become a far more popular concept in the committee room. But, leaving the ECB's legendary moral rectitude aside, a ban would be a terrible mistake on its part. Twitter is one of the best marketing tools an under-rated England team has going for them right now. Graeme Swann and James Anderson's on-off \"bromance\" has been a cracking storyline and frankly deserves some sort of Bafta recognition, if not a full-blown film adaptation starring Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller. They have 60,000 supporters each, which is 57,000 more than any of the counties have at their average gate. Tim Bresnan, the pair's oft-maligned stooge \u2013 the Karl Pilkington to their Gervais and Merchant \u2013 has 20,000 followers, and he's not even in the Test team. Now, it is true that Bresnan himself has fallen foul of the Twittersphere, telling a follower where to go in four-letter words when he poked fun at his girth. But he apologised and got straight back into his work as the comic fall-guy without so much as skipping lunch. Saying something stupid on Twitter is like making embarrassing remarks when your microphone's still on \u2013 you only do it once. Unless you're George Bush Jr. And of course, what the ECB will also miss out on with a shortsighted ban are the many possibilities Twitter can offer. When a bunch of egomaniac sportsmen think that their every shopping trip and bowel movement is fascinating to the public at large, you've got what Sir Alex Ferguson would kill for \u2013 a free, round-the-clock surveillance network for monitoring your wayward charges. I can't think of anything more comforting for the England team director Andy Flower than the knowledge that @stuartbroad86 is \"luvvin my new Best of James Corden bxst, hahaha!\" on the night before a Test, or that the photos @fatmaninthefield posted of his pie and chip dinner will be followed by a swift bleep test the following morning. And in terms of getting inside a player's head \u2013 think of the money you'll save on team shrinks! How much easier to assess how to motivate and manage your players when they're publicly broadcasting each cogitation and flash of emotion in 140 characters. I expect one of those analysts who sit on the dressing-room balcony with a laptop can knock up an algorithm that translates Twitter traffic into some sort of team morale index. At the very least, Sky could incorporate banter levels into a new HD datagraphic. The England team are doing very nicely right now. They hold the Ashes and the World Twenty20 title, even if, thanks to the ECB handing all live cricket to Sky, not that many people know it. Twitter's not a bad platform for the England team to engage with the public \u2013 and the players clearly enjoy it a whole lot more than press conferences. As vices go, it's a pretty tame one for a sportsman. Tweet and let tweet.",
