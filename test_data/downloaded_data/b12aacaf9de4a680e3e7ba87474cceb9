  "content": "Heat magazine has apologised to the Duchess of Cambridge (aka Kate Middleton) for publishing a picture of her shopping at a supermarket. The Press Complaints Commission negotiated the publication of the apology after receiving a complaint from her lawyers, Harbottle &amp; Lewis. They argued that the use of the picture, carried in the first week of December last year, breached two clauses of the editors' code of practice - intrusion into privacy and harassment. The apology, which is published on the magazine's \"emails\" page in this week's edition (dated 26 May- 1 June), said the magazine had accepted that it should not have shown her shopping. The apology has also been published online here. Source: PCC",
