  "content": "What's your favourite piece of technology, and how has it improved your life? My favourite technology that I've encountered in the recent past has been Twitter. It has enabled me to keep track of what my colleagues and peers and other people whose opinions I respect are thinking about, reading and linking to. I've also been able to tweet out updates about the film, and people have followed my account to know more about [my documentary] Page One. It's been even more valuable to me as an ear on what others are doing and thinking. When was the last time you used it, and what for? An hour ago to hear what [New York Times media columnist] David [Carr] had done at the Guardian, because some people were tweeting about his visit there. I use it all throughout the day, sometimes without any specific objective other than to see what's going on. What additional features would you add if you could? I would add nothing. I believe that the virtue of Twitter is that it's such a lightweight and low-fi technology. It's 140 characters, its links to stories are so easily presented without requiring a ton of augmentation or commentary \u2013 and that's part of its ease of use for me, its simplicity. Do you think it will be obsolete in 10 years' time? I think that if it stays as simple as it is, then no. If it remains a platform for people to present their ideas, then its ease of use will be its success. Is there any particular piece of technology that you have owned and hated? Certain cell phones, for sure.The [Motorola] Droid I had, I did not get on with. It was way too complicated, and I thought it was like a device for someone at Nasa to keep track of a rocket ship's trajectory or something. It was just too much. I actually have a BlackBerry Pearl, in addition to an iPhone, which I use for internet service, but I still love the double-tap function of the Pearl. Its very small, and all it really does is take calls and allow you to send emails and texts. I like the way it only has one objective in life. If you had one tip about getting the best out of new technology, what would it be? Continuing with this theme of simplicity and ease of use, sometimes it's better to not try and make everything you have be the Swiss Army knife of devices and walk around with only one thing in your pocket. Sometimes it's better to have dedicated devices \u2013 for example, the Flip camera. It's incredible in its quality of image and its simplicity. Do you consider yourself to be a luddite or a nerd? Neither, really. Is there anything in between? What's the most expensive piece of technology you've ever owned? Probably my G5 tower. It's now has been replaced by an iMac, which can now do the same but also includes a screen. But the G5 with 2TB of hard drive space and 8GB of Ram was probably like $8,000. Mac or PC, and why? Definitely Mac, because we live in a Mac world. Do you still buy physical media such as CDs and DVDs, or do you download? Not so much CDs but definitely DVDs, which I think are amazing \u2013 all the DVD extras, the ability to listen to commentaries, to even in some cases see different angles on a film. I think that there's something about being able to identify with the content when you have it on the shelf that I really love. Robot butlers \u2013 a good idea or not? Why not! What piece of technology would you most like to own? I'd probably love to have a big server on which I could store all of the tapes that I have shot in my 10 or 11 years of making films and shooting video. When I edited my first film, an 80GB hard drive was the size of a breadbox. Today I'd probably need like 20TB or 30TB of storage space, and I'd lvoe to have a breadbox that can hold all of that.",
