Media organisations have objected to the guidelines drawn up by the information commissioner's office (ICO) as a result of moves, at European Union and UK level, to introduce greater protection for individual privacy. They argue that the requirements would have a chilling effect on journalism, pointing out that public interest journalism is being defined too narrowly in the guidance while offering too great a protection for privacy. As The Times's article states, the guidance \"does not take into account the day-to-day reality of journalism and could stifle investigations.\" The final document has been delayed until after the summer. But the subject will surely be raised when the information commissioner, Christopher Graham, appears on a panel next Monday in a debate about data protection. The event has been organised by the Media Society and will be hosted by ITN News at its London headquarters (details here). News organisations are facing a growing number of requests from the subjects of their investigations for access to material they have gathered. They cite the data protection act (DPA) as justification. These \"subject access requests\" can be refused on the ground that information was obtained for journalistic reasons. But the subject can go to law, which is a costly deterrent to publishers, especially those with the least resources. The Times's report quotes media lawyer Caroline Kean, as saying that the use of the DPA is undermining increased protections that publishers won last year through reform of the UK's defamation law. \"It's a fundamental threat to freedom of expression and people haven't yet woken up to what's going on,\" she said.
