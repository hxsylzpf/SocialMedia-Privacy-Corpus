Street View, launched in the US last May, adds street-level pictures to the search engine's existing Google Maps' information. A fleet of vans fitted with cameras have been trawling the streets of more than 20 American cities, photographing the pavements to provide a complete visual map of the area. But the cameras also take pictures of anyone who happens to be walking by at the time. While this has caused controversy among privacy campaigners in the US, it could result in serious legal problems in countries such as France with strict privacy laws. Last night, Google relaunched its Street View of Manhattan with pedestrians' faces blurred. The in-house technology errs on the side of caution so it also tends to pixellate faces in adverts. It will also remove Street View images if anyone objects . Cars and vans bearing the Google Street View logo have been spotted in Paris and the company is understood to be planning to add a number of other European cities, including London, to the service this year. A spokesperson for the company refused to give a date for the European launch but said: \"We will not launch in Europe until we are comfortable Street View complies with local law. \"We will use technology, like face-blurring, and operational controls, such as image-removal tools, so Street View remains useful and in keeping with local norms wherever it is available.\"",
