  "content": "Social networking site Bebo has dismissed rumours of a sale as \"ridiculous\" following reports that US media giant AOL is to sell it just 10 months after buying it for $850m (\u00a3417m). Executives at AOL are disappointed with the performance of the site, according to TechCrunch UK, and have been slow to integrate the service with other properties such as AIM instant messaging and its email service. Sources claim AOL is trying to sell Bebo for around $200m \u2013 less than a quarter of the price it paid in March last year. \"The whole thing is ridiculous and there is no truth in it at all,\" said a Bebo spokesperson. \"Social Inbox was launched in December and is just the first step in answering that framentation problem with Twitter, Flickr, AOL Mail and a recommendation tool. It was the first step and there's more to come \u2013 there's a lot of stuff to be layered over to build on that.\" The spokesperson added that the next phase of Bebo's integrated services would be launched later this month, with a third phase in February. Bebo has a particularly strong following in the UK and Ireland but has yet to make a significant dent in the US social networking market. The site had 10.5 million unique users in the UK during December and 22.6 million worldwide, according to comScore. This week it was announced that Bebo's vice-president of global sales, Mark Charkin, is to leave the firm after more than two years to work for a Silicon Valley startup firm. One UK entrepreneur and investor told MediaGuardian.co.uk that last year's Bebo deal had been the climax of an extravagant period of acquisitions in the technology sector. \"Credit has been cheap for companies, so a lot of M&amp;A [mergers and acquisition] guys bought without thinking of when companies might start making money,\" he said, adding that even Google has been closing some of its recent acquisitions and that Yahoo had been forced to sell shopping site Kelkoo for $125m \u2013 $450m less than it paid for the site in 2004. \"If AOL is selling Bebo, this is much less to do with strategic fit and more to do with that male machismo culture when M&amp;A guys get a hard-on from how much money they make,\" the UK entrepreneur added. \"There's that business school attitude of buying something and saying you can create value without really understanding where the money will come from.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
