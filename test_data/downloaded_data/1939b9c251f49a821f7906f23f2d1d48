  "content": "Favourites \u2013 we use them for a myriad of reasons. Favouriting a tweet could mean \"I like this tweet\", or \"good point\", or \"this is fun, but not enough to retweet\", or \"I acknowledge your communication, but can't be bothered to reply\", or \"the conversation is ending now, but on a positive note!\" Also, the favourite is a great bookmarking tool. Now, however, Twitter has cruelly stripped away all of the above nuances of communication by replacing the favourite function with a \"like\" button. Unlike. How, now, is one supposed to bookmark an article on the refugee crisis without 'liking' it? I'm not ready to inaccurately look \u2013 ironically \u2013 heartless on social media. In a press release, Twitter's thinking is entirely wrongheaded. Hearts are, it says, \"more expressive\". No, hearts aren't, for reasons outlined above. Here is what they think a heart can mean \u2026 \"ADORBS\". Bleurgh. Here's how others have reacted \u2026 Some users on Twitter have taken the change really well Others have made the point about 'liking' bad news tweets While these people make very good points Some are more optimistic Others took to polls to debate the subject Some people think it is ADORBS And some are already being caught out People are taking the mickey, too, obviously Here is what all British users need, however. Can we sort this? Do you like the new \"like\"? Or was the old star your favourite? Let us know in the comments below.",
