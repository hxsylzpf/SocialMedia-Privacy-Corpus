  "content": "The prototypical football coach is a sitcom dad. You can quite easily picture Chuck Pagano leafing through a book about World War Two called Wages of Honor and then falling asleep for several hours in an armchair, or Gus Bradley embarrassing his son in front of his friends, or Lovie Smith sitting on a toilet, calling to his wife: \"Maryanne! Is there any TP in the hallway closet?\" These aren't the sort of men you would figure are well-versed in social media. There are only four NFL head coaches on Twitter at the moment, and Mike Tomlin appears to be the only one who operates his own account. Jay Gruden doesn't have so much as an intern posting tweets for him, but he wants his players to know he's keeping an eye on their social media activity regardless. At a press conference on Monday, Gruden mentioned that, at team meetings, he sometimes reads a few of his players' tweets aloud, to let them know Big Brother is always watching. \"So far I think they've been pretty good,\" Gruden said, \"with a few exceptions.\" Twitter is many things to many people, but athletes tend use it either as an extension of their personal brand or as a repository for whatever's on their mind while they're waiting for the team charter to take off. Russell Wilson, for instance, only ever tweets stuff that further burnishes his squeaky-clean public image. Joseph Fauria occasionally uses his account to, um, accuse Russell Wilson of cuckolding him, but he usually just roots on his alma mater. DeSean Jackson communicates primarily through inspirational memes and pictures of food. So there's a spectrum. As a general rule, Athlete Twitter is lethally boring. The players with interesting things to say are too smart to share them with us, and the filterless ones churn out hundreds of bits of grammatically fraught inanity. When JR Smith tweeted a couple years ago, the basketball blogosphere melted down for 48 hours, as if no one involved had ever seen a lady's butt before. This was a response, not to the fundamental outrageousness of Smith's behavior \u2013 are we surprised he wants us to know he hangs out with attractive women? \u2013 but to the fact that an athlete actually used social media to do something goofy and genuine. Imagine eating a diet of gruel and club soda for months, then biting into an apple. Coaches don't want this sort of unfiltered expression to happen, and as a result, they often come off as scolds. If the NFL's restrictive social media policy and Roger Goodell's itchy fine-finger are any indication, coaches are constantly reminding players to mind your words and to remember you're representing yourself and this organization. This father-knows-best mentality characterizes most sports, but it's particularly pronounced in the NFL, which thinks it's a terrific idea to have Herm Edwards lecture its incoming rookies about such difficult-to-grasp concepts as being on time and trying hard. This must scan as an insult, to a lot of athletes. They are treated as if they are forever on the verge of doing something stupid, or as if their lifestyle is so depraved that they should not dare disclose its details, lest they bring their employer into disrepute. Sure, some athletes are incorrigible morons \u2013 there are a few in every workplace \u2013 but most function fine in society. They can handle the responsibility of 140 characters and a \"send\" button without parental guidance. The vast majority of athletes do not lack self-awareness. On one level or another, they are conscious that they live inside a bubble, and that, when they share something on social media, they are ever-so-slightly defogging that bubble. So they do what anyone with an ounce of social intelligence does: they present themselves selectively, in a way that is aimed at getting us to like them. They post pictures of their kids and talk about how hard they're working. They show off their charity work and recite platitudes. They keep up appearances, in other words. What Jay Gruden and his ilk fail to understand is they don't need to peer over their players' shoulders to encourage best behavior. Social media is a panopticon \u2013 an especially well-populated one if you're a famous athlete, with possibly hundreds of thousands of people looking at what you post at any given moment. If a player doesn't understand that, he is truly beyond help. Any additional attempts to drive the point home will only alienate the folks who already know better. And there seem to be a lot of those guys. Have you checked Athlete Twitter lately? It's like a test pattern made out of words.",
