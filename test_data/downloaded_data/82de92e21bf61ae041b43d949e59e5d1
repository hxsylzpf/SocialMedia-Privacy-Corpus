Richard Branson now an investor. Geddit? \"If you are wondering why Tumblr just raised $85 million, all you have to do is look at its pageviews. The super-easy blogging platform saw its pageviews jump from about 2 billion a month to 13 billion since the beginning of the year. It recently passed 10 billion posts, and is adding 40 million more every day. According to Quantcast, which directly measures the site, Tumblr attracts 72 million visitors a month, more than half of those from outside the U.S.\"\" Zynga Profits, Users Decline Ahead Of Proposed $1B IPO &gt;&gt; Gamasutra \"\"...Ahead of an estimated $1B initial public offering (which is being delayed due to \"rocky stock markets\"), the company revealed its financial performance for the quarter in an SEC filing, showing that its year-on-year profits declined around 95 percent, from $27.2M to $1.3M.\"\" .london, .scot, .what? How to work out whether to seek a generic TLD &gt;&gt; Guardian.co.uk \"\"Ultimately, it's only possible to have one owner of one string.

Yes, this is the name Amazon has settled on, to help differentiate the product from the e-ink Kindles, which will still be very much alive and for sale. And while Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos will show off the Fire on stage, it won't be ready to ship until the second week of November, we've learned. Everything we've previously reported on the hardware remains the same. It will be a 7-inch backlit display tablet that looks similar to the BlackBerry PlayBook. Gdgt's Ryan Block was able to dig up a bit more about the connection. Apparently, the Kindle Fire looks like a PlayBook because it was designed and built by the same original design manufacturer (ODM), Quanta.
