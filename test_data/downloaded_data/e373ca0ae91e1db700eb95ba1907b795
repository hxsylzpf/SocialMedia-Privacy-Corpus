  "content": "The periodic punch-up between press and politicians has become one of the much-loved rituals of British public life. The two opponents square up to each other in the Last Chance Saloon and growl all kind of menacing and increasingly bloodthirsty threats. Just when innocent bystanders fear for their own safety the parties sober up, drag on their coats and head out into the cold night. In accordance with this ancient tradition blood did not run in Portcullis House yesterday when Gerald Kaufman and his select committee unveiled their report into privacy and media intrusion. Mr Kaufman was, for him, on rather unacerbic form. The press complaints commission, which had spent the weekend ill-advisedly leaking blustering legal threats against the MPs, looked rather contrite. What was all the fuss about? There will doubtless be a rash of headlines telling us that the MPs demanded a privacy law. Well, not quite. They did highlight a recent judgment in which Mr Justice Lindsay observed that, in the absence of any guidance from parliament, the courts may well feel obliged to develop a freestanding law of privacy. This led the MPs to recommend that the government should \"clarify the protection that individuals can expect from unwarranted intrusion by anyone - not the press alone - into their private lives.\" This is not quite the same as demanding a privacy law. But, in any event the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, promptly rejected the suggestion. So no change there: the privacy ball is, for better or worse, firmly back in the legal court. For the rest, the MPs made a number of interesting suggestions about how the PCC could become a more effective and respected organisation. These included setting up a pre-publication team to advise people who believed their privacy was being invaded; a ban on payments to police officers and private detectives; a more transparent selection procedure for lay commissioners; league tables of the worst offenders; and the establishment of an effective and independent appeals procedure. None of this should prove terribly controversial. More contentious will be the \"gently punitive\" suggestion that newspapers' financial contributions to the PCC should be increased if they regularly offend. And there will be much resistance among some newspaper groups to the \"modest\" idea that there should be a fixed scale of compensatory awards in the most serious cases - even though, on the PCC's own evidence, these are few and far between. The MPs observe that this money could be paid to charity and need not involve m'learned friends. We may expect many newspapers to disagree. Self-regulation rather than state regulation should remain the ideal. The PCC, at its best, remains free, quick and responsive. At its worst, it is quixotic, weak and clumsily political. On this occasion it should calmly reflect on some generally constructive suggestions from its parliamentary interlocutors. Knee-jerk defensiveness should be avoided. The newspaper industry must accept that the people it writes about will increasingly seek to assert their rights to privacy. It is in the interest of journalists to take notice of these concerns. That means acknowledging the spirit of the Human Rights Act and a preparedness to introduce some pretty wide-ranging reforms of the PCC. If the PCC is not seen to be open, independent, consistent and effective there is little doubt that the courts will intervene - thus achieving the very result which the press rightly seeks to avoid.",
