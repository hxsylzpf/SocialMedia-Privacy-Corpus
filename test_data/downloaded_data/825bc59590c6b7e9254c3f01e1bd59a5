  "content": "The Press Association said on Tuesday it was offering its full support to Laura Elston, its royal reporter arrested and bailed by police investigating allegations of phone hacking by journalists. Elston, 34, was released on police bail on Tuesday night after being questioned for several hours by Scotland Yard officers as part of Operation Weeting, the Metropolitan police's investigation launched in January following new allegations about phone hacking involving the News of the World. She is the fifth person to be arrested and bailed by Scotland Yard as part of the operation. Three of the others are current or former senior News of the World newsroom staff. \"Laura Elston is a journalist of integrity who has worked for us for over 10 years with great distinction, said Jonathan Grun, editor of PA, the news wire service. \"We are offering her our full support and we hope that this matter can be cleared up as quickly as possible.\" The mother-of-two, who joined the agency as a graduate trainee in 2000 and has worked for PA ever since, was arrested when she voluntarily attended an appointment at a central London police station. Scotland Yard said she was questioned on suspicion of intercepting communications, contrary to Section 1 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. On Thursday last week a 39-year-old woman was arrested at her home in West Yorkshire by Scotland Yard officers as part of Operation Weeting, on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications contrary to section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977. She was released later the same day after questioning at a West Yorkshire police station. The woman, believed to be Terenia Taras, contributed more than 30 stories for the News of the World as a freelance between 1998 and 2004, although Scotland Yard would not confirm this. She was never on staff at the News of the World. A spokesman for Scotland Yard said she had been bailed to return to a West Yorkshire police station in mid-October. Taras is the ex-girlfriend of Greg Miskiw, the News of the World's former assistant editor (news), who is currently in the US. She has also written occasionally for other tabloids including, most recently, the Sunday Mirror and, less often, for the Daily Mail. Her last bylined article appeared in the Sunday Mirror in December 2007. In April a senior reporter at the News of the World, James Weatherup, was arrested and questioned. Weatherup, who has also worked as a news editor with the Sunday tabloid, was released after questioning. The paper's chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, and assistant editor (news) Ian Edmondson, were also held in April and released on police bail to return in September.",
