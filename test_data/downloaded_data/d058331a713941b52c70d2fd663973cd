  "content": "In a speech two weeks ago, Jack Straw mocked my suggestion that Britain's pupils were being groomed for the surveillance society. I wonder how the justice secretary reacts to a story from Davenant Foundation School in Loughton, Essex, where pupils walked out of classrooms that were fitted with CCTV cameras \u2013 on the grounds that their civil liberties were being breached \u2013 and refused to return until the camera system had been turned off. Straw would no doubt dismiss this incident with the same ease with which he has slunk away from accusations about overcharging the taxpayer for his council tax. But for the rest of us the story in the Waltham Forest Guardian is pure joy to read. This splendid group of pupils wore masks when they returned to class. The school, a mixed comprehensive, is at the cutting edge of surveillance technology and has already drawn criticism from parents after introducing finger-scanning technology it its canteen. It is astonishing that schools are spending public money on these surveillance systems, which, whatever Straw says, are grooming pupils for life in a society in which they may expect to be watched at every moment of the day. Clearly the headmaster, Chris Seward, needs a lesson or two about the essential right of privacy from his own pupils. However this looks like being delivered by the information commissioner, who has been contacted by parents and Epping Forest's Conservative MP, Eleanor Laing, a shadow minister for justice. Laing has not acquitted herself well in this affair. She told the Waltham Forest Guardian: \"We need to find out if the pupils are happy to be filmed but there are two valid sides to this argument, and I am trying to get to the bottom of it.\" Actually there is no valid argument for this kind of surveillance, as Laing ought to know. Perhaps the students of Davenant Foundation School should carry out a democratic audit of Laing's views. And if any students have time to spare from their examinations, they might like to enter my essay competition with a short composition on the rights of children in schools entitled \"What Mr Seward doesn't know about pupils' rights\". First prize \u00a350. Maximum word length 250 words. Post your entries below on the thread and I will decide the winner next Friday. Only school students are eligible for the money. Meanwhile my congratulations to all those who walked out. It is the best news I have had all week. Any pictures of the masked protesters welcome.",
