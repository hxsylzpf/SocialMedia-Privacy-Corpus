  "content": "Most parents will have enormous sympathy with Mr and Mrs King and members of their family (Parents of Ashya in separate jails, 2 September). Many members of the public will not argue with their individual preference for a particular sort of medical treatment which they believe (rightly or wrongly) will be the most effective for their son. The treating specialists and other experts may disagree with this point of view and the matter may ultimately have to be decided at court. All those involved are likely to want to do the best they can for Aysha. Leaving those points aside, what I cannot accept as being in Ashya's best interests is the use/involvement of him by his parents on social media. I did not see the \"happy\" boy his father described when I watched my television on Sunday, and this appeared to me to be yet another example of a situation where the filming of a child on social media is potentially emotionally abusive and misguided. In my opinion a five-year-old boy does not need such a level of exposure to the arguments going on about him and his medical condition. Dey Wilcock Consultant social worker/expert witness \u2022\u2008As a parent who has suffered the tragic loss of a child with cancer, I can understand the anguish of Ashya King's parents, but am concerned about their lack of trust in Southampton general hospital. Unfortunately their subsequent desperate measures involved a very long, arduous journey for such a sick little boy. I find Suzanne Moore's stereotyping of \"the medical system with its certain arrogance\" unacceptable (Criminalised for caring, 2 September). In particular I take issue with her sweeping statement \"Once a doctor has said no more can be done, people are too often just left to cope somehow.\" This was not my experience. Also, I would like to fiercely defend the hospital's reputation. Recently my grandson, who has a brittle bone condition, was admitted as an emergency. The treatment he received and his subsequent care have been excellent, and communication with him and his parents cannot be faulted. Any criticism must be aimed at the cuts being made to the NHS by the coalition government and its policy of creeping privatisation, which has damaged trust on the part of some of the population.
