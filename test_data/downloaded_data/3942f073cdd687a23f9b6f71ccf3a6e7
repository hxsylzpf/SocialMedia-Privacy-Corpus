  "content": "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that the Republican party has a problem with the millennial generation. Americans born after 1980 voted by some 25pt for President Obama over Mitt Romney, while the rest of the electorate narrowly supported the Republican candidate. It's my view that Republicans can do little to attract most Millennials \u2013 but privacy may be the exception. Our Guardian poll conducted by Public Policy Polling indicated that Democrats were more supportive of President Obama's position on the National Security Agency (NSA) leaks than other parts of the electorate: \u2022 58% of Democrats were OK with the government collecting data on internet or phone data, compared with 44% of voters overall \u2022 By a 4pt margin, Democrats were more fearful of putting national security at risk than of infringing civil liberties. That compares with a 22pt margin going the other way among the overall sample \u2022 Only 28% of Democrats said that the information learned made them less likely to support President Obama against 48% of the electorate overall These results aren't too surprising given that a political base usually support its leader. That's why you saw far more Democrats supporting Obama's actions on collection and access of phone and internet records than for a somewhat similar policy under President Bush, while Republicans were far more receptive of the policies under Bush than under Obama. You'd expect, therefore, that young voters \u2013 who are the bedrock of the Democratic base \u2013 to be receptive to President Obama's actions. You'd be wrong. Young voters are overwhelmingly against the NSA's access to internet and phone records. \u2022 A meager 27% said the government should be accessing internet or phone records \u2013 31pt lower than Democrats overall \u2022 73% were more fearful of an infringement of their civil liberties, compared to 15% who were more afraid of putting national security at risk. This 58pt margin is a reversal of the 4pt margin of Democrats who were more scared of a terrorist attack than abridgement of civil liberties \u2022 69% of young voters said that what they learned from the NSA leaks made them less likely to support President Obama \u2013 41pt greater than Democrats. Exactly zero young voters in our sample said what they learned made them more likely to support Obama To me, this indicates a tremendous opening for Republicans: 69% of young voters think that this country needs a fresh conversation about privacy versus security \u2013 and they are not with President Obama or the Democrats on this issue. If Republicans don't at least discuss it, it will be an opportunity lost.",
