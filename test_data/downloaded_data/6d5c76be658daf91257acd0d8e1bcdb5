  "content": "Former reality TV star Josh Duggar has admitted to being \"the biggest hypocrite ever\" in being unfaithful to his wife, Anna, a day after he was revealed to have allegedly held an account on the Ashley Madison spousal cheating site. Duggar and his family rose to fame as the stars of the TLC show 19 Kids and Counting, which was taken off the air in May after it was revealed that as a teenager, Duggar had molested underage girls. Duggar and his parents, Jimbob and Michelle Duggar, posted a statement on the family website on Thursday, a day after Gawker said it had found his name among the 33m account details of Ashley Madison customers whose information was released by hackers this week. \"I am so ashamed of the double life that I have been living and am grieved for the hurt, pain and disgrace my sin has caused my wife and family, and most of all Jesus and all those who profess faith in Him.\" Duggar and his wife were married in 2008 and have four children. He is the oldest of 19 children in the Duggar family, whose conservative Christian Arkansas upbringing was featured on the TLC show. When allegations of child molestation were first revealed in May, he resigned from his job at the Family Research Council, a conservative lobbying group based in Washington DC, and issued a statement in which he said he felt remorse for \"wrongdoing\". \"Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret. I hurt others, including my family and close friends,\" Duggar said at the time. The Duggar family have associated with and campaigned for a number of prominent Republican politicians \u2013 including Mike Huckabee, in Iowa in 2008. The data from Ashley Madison, whose tagline is \"Life is short. Have an affair\", was released by hackers from the Impact Team cybergroup, and took the form of a 10GB database on the \"dark web\" that could be accessed through a specialised web browser called Tor. One coder then created a site for internet users where it was possible to enter a specific email address to see if that matched a customer record, potentially allowing spouses to check whether their partners had an account on the controversial site.",
