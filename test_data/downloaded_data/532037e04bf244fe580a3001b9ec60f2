Edward Fitzgerald QC, representing Bell, 46, who now lives under a fresh identity, said there was a real likelihood that disclosure of her identity and whereabouts would lead to harassment. \"That is the view of all the experts - and that in turn raises the risk of vilification, ostracism and interference with the rehabilitation of Bell and prejudice to her physical and mental well being,\" Mr Fitzgerald said. In December 1968 Bell, then aged 11, was convicted of the manslaughter of two small boys, Martin Brown, four, and Brian Howe, three. She was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure and released on licence in 1980. Mr Fitzgerald told Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, president of the family division, that the features which justified a unique approach in the case were the extreme youth of Bell at the time of the offences, and the fact that she had had a new identity since her release with the full consent of the Home Office. Both Bell and her \"innocent child\" - who turns 19 next month - were protected under existing injunctions, said counsel. He added it was also highly relevant that the press did not contest the proceedings and that the attorney general, representing the public interest, did not oppose an injunction under the narrow basis of article eight of the human rights convention, which requires respect for someone's private and family life. However, Andrew Caldecott QC, acting for the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith QC, emphasised that there were \"very delicate issues\" about the balance between the right to privacy and family life and the importance of open justice. \"Emotive terms like 'naming and shaming' do tend to rather belittle the importance of open justice, and certainly the attorney general is very concerned that the question of creating zonal secrecy around certain offenders should be very strictly justified on the particular facts of the case. \"This is obviously a case in which not only the decision, but the particular reason for it, will be extremely important. \"If this is an exceptional case, the reasons why it is exceptional will obviously be of interest to the public and as legal precedent.\" Speaking ahead of today's hearing in London, the mother of one of Bell's victims said she felt she was in a \"no win\" situation, but hoped the killer would never make any money from selling her story. June Richardson, 59, mother of victim Martin Brown, said: \"As long as she goes away and just hides and never makes money again, then she can remain anonymous. \"But that is only because of her daughter, who should remain anonymous. \"Too many murderers are making money out of their memoirs. If she is granted anonymity, there should be rules ensuring she never makes any money out of this.\" Mrs Richardson, from Newcastle upon Tyne, said both her daughters, Linda, 36 and Sharon, 30, were opposed to Bell being granted lifelong anonymity and believe that if her request is refused there will be massive interest initally, but it will soon disappear. \"My first thoughts were to let her have her anonymity, and she might go away and never be heard of again - but then again if she loses her anonymity, she will be free to sell her story and her picture and will make money again,\" said Mrs Richardson. \"It's a no win situation for me, but the best that could happen would be for her to remain anonymous and just vanish and we can get on with our lives,\" Mrs Richardson said. A decision in the case will not be given until after Easter.",
