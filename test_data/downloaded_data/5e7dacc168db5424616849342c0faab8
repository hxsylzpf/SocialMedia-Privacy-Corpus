  "content": "The case of a celebrity whose medical records were illicitly viewed by more than 50 members of an NHS hospital's staff raised doubts yesterday about the security of the government's \u00a312.4bn scheme to upgrade the NHS's IT systems. The prying was revealed in board papers for North Tees primary care trust as a warning to managers to tighten procedures requiring doctors and nurses to log on individually before being allowed access to sensitive personal material. The trust did not name the celebrity whose privacy was invaded and said the episode did not occur at any of its local hospitals. But the infringement will ring alarm bells among famous people who would be appalled at the possibility of intimate medical matters leaking to the media. MPs raised the issue of security in a report published last week on progress on the NHS Connecting for Health project, which includes plans for GPs to upload the medical records of more than 50 million patients in England on to a national electronic database. The initial aim is to make a summary of each patient's medical notes available to hospital staff or paramedics treating the patient in an emergency. The government has said that systems for accessing patient records online are secure. A Department of Health spokesperson said last night: \"There is no evidence to suggest that this alleged incident took place or that it was anything more than a hypothetical example referenced in a board paper. The reality of the situation is that, for the first time in the history of medical records, the new IT systems being implemented across the NHS have a fully integrated audit trail that tracks access to any care record to safeguard and maximise patient confidentiality. Any inappropriate access is identified and NHS management is alerted by the associated protocols and guarantees.\" The British Medical Association and some patient groups have expressed concerns about erosion of patient confidentiality. Rules governing the system prohibit staff from viewing a patient record unless they have a legitimate medical reason for doing so. Access is controlled by smart cards and passcodes designed to leave an electronic fingerprint of every individual who calls up a patient file. Earlier this year, the South Warwickshire General Hospitals NHS trust admitted allowing some A&amp;E staff to share their smart cards, saying slow log-in times were affecting the speed of treatment. The latest case, reported in Computer Weekly magazine, is detailed in the North Tees trust's board papers from March. The papers said: \"It was noted in an audit that a recent admission of a celebrity to a hospital had revealed over 50 staff viewing the patient record.\" To satisfy the guarantee, staff \"should only access records of patients with whom they have a legitimate relationship,\" the trust said. A trust spokesman said yesterday: \"This incident is unrelated to North Tees PCT and occurred in an unknown trust. North Tees PCT is satisfied that it has security measures in place to address such an incident should it occur.\"",
