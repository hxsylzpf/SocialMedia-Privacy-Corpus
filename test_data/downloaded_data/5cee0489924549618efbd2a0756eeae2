Gareth Malone, collecting the best factual entertainment gong for The Choir: Military Wives (accompanied by \"some of my wives\"), affected puzzlement because in his shows everyone knows what's going to happen: \"Nobody sings. Everyone laughs at me. I get very cross. Everyone sings.\" \u2712 Backing into the limelight at Friday's Broadcasting Press Guild awards were Rev's writers Tom Hollander and James Wood, winners of the writer's award as well as best comedy/entertainment. Hollander, also star of the series and credited with having the idea, insisted that he was not really a writer; but Wood, referring to a clip just shown of the Rev Adam Smallbone having a pre-Christmas breakdown, countered by saying the scene was improvised \u2013 \"Tom went mad, and I just typed it\". \u2712 Their modesty was topped by Hollander's screen wife Olivia Colman, who walked away with the best actress and breakthrough awards. Colman not only queried whether she really had breakthrough cred (\"I've been slogging away for 20 years\") but also whether any actor should be honoured at all \u2013 \"I just turn up and read the lines that a writer's written\". Even this seemed too immodest as soon as she said it: \"I don't even have to turn up, I'm driven there.\" \u2712 As if taking its cue from Sky Arts, home to the septuagenarian legends Melvyn Bragg, Michael Parkinson and Laurie Taylor, the radio station Magic Network North has just launched a Sunday line-up that brings together Dave Lee Travis (already on the Magic roster as host of what it calls \"his infamous DLT show\") with his former Radio 1 buddies Tony Blackburn and Mike Read. What's particularly intriguing about this real-life version of Smashie and Nicey \u2712 Worries that an imposter may have got hold of Rupert Murdoch's Twitter feed hardened last week as the mogul ostensibly blamed \"enemies, old toffs and rightwingers\" for the latest allegations about dirty deeds in a part of News Corp. The owner of Fox News is clearly in no position to attack rightwingers; and the real Rupert, the Oxford graduate son of the press magnate Sir Keith Murdoch and his former debutante wife, wouldn't be well placed to slam toffs. Mind you, an establishment background hasn't prevented Marlborough-educated Tom \"Olivia\" Newton Dunn, the Sun's political editor, from leading the paper's dutifully Rupert-echoing crusade against \"Toffs at the Trough\", and so getting roundly mocked on Twitter. \u2712 Though he has yet to name him, Newton Dunn was among the journalists calling for the head of chief government spinner Craig Oliver after a week of farcical PR disasters reminiscent of The Thick of It. As the hapless Oliver (as if scripted by Armando Iannucci) was reportedly ringing Newsnight mid-broadcast to insist that David Cameron had bought a pasty, but at Liverpool, not Leeds, the double-barrelled man of the people was tweeting \"whoever thought up [Tory] 'panic strategy' has to go now, and publicly\", after raging \"how dysfunctional has this govt's PR machine got?\" post-budget. The Mail's Andrew Pierce meanwhile told PR Week that \"they are missing Andy Coulson \u2026 he would have seen the bear traps over pasties\".",
