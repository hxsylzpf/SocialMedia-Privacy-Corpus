  "content": "A \"youth against the banks\" Facebook party at a Mayfair mansion in London was broken up by officers in riot gear last night after revellers pelted police with bricks and bottles. The teenage organisers of the party conceded that the event \"got out of hand\" when thousands more people than expected attended the five-storey squat in Park Lane. But they claim that heavy handed tactics by the police sparked the unrest. Police, ambulance crews and the London fire brigade were called to the house just after 11pm, and used loud hailers to urge partygoers to leave. \"There was a fear for their safety because the structure was believed to be unsafe,\" a Metropolitan police spokesman said. \"Through loud hailers we tried to inform people that the building was unsafe and that they should leave.\" Riot police moved in after bottles and bricks were thrown at the police and ambulance workers, the spokesman said. \"Once that sort of thing happens you need to be prepared for every eventuality, but thankfully it cleared up pretty quickly after that.\" No arrests were made. But one of the organisers, 18-year-old Oliver Fox, said the police presence was excessive and provocative. \"The police response is what made it get out hand,\" he said. Co-organiser Neil Fraser, 19, said: \"A couple of people wanted to cause a scene, but it was nothing really. There was an incredibly heavy police presence. We had expected a knock on the door, so it was a bit of shock when they turned up in riot gear.\" The pair started a Facebook group last Sunday urging people to \"come and live the high life in a mansion on Park Lane\". The party was billed as a \"youth against the banks\" event as the organisers believed the home was partly owned by HSBC. The bank has yet to confirm this. \"We wanted to shake things up because the banks are kind of running the world which isn't fair,\" said Fox, a sixth-former from north London. \"We didn't break in, we got in through an open window. It's not illegal, that's just how squatting works,\" he said. Members of the Facebook group, which has since been deleted, grew rapidly. \"The idea was to invite a large number of friends not the whole of London youth,\" Fraser said. \"We personally only invited about 200 each. We then watched the group grow, it didn't seem real. It was growing by a person a minute.\" The police estimated that \"in excess of 2,000 people\" attended the party. Fox and Fraser said 5,000 turned up. Fraser said: \"There were 3,500 people confirmed to come, and they all invited their friends. And there were another 5,000 people awaiting replies the last time I looked [at the group]. We didn't plan that many people so it was kind of an uneasy time.\" Fox said: \"I've never seen that many people, except at festivals. As we were leaving the police said 'it's all kicking off you'd better get out of here'. They didn't know we had organised the party and were responsible for this chaos around us.\" The police spokesman said: \"Inquiries are under way to establish who the organisers were.\"",
