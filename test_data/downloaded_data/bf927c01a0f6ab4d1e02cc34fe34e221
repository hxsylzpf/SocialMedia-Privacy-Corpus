  "content": "The war of words \u2013 or at least the tussle of tweets \u2013 between Kanye West and Deadmau5 shows no signs of abating. In the latest online exchange of words between the rapper and DJ, West compared Deadmau5 to Mickey Mouse, while the dance musician hit back, saying West was trying to deflect the story away from accusations of piracy. Isn't it great that our popstars can be so grown up? It all started when West posted a screenshot of him listening to Sufjan Stevens's latest album Carrie and Lowell on YouTube \u2013 an image that also contained open windows to Pirate Bay, where he seemed to be in the process of illegally downloading music software. His excuse was that it was all a joke regarding the piracy of his own album The Life of Pablo, and besides, he would never stoop so low as to actually own a PC himself (Kanye only uses Macs, obvs). But Deadmau5 was unconvinced, calling him a \"dick\". Never one to let things lie, West responded with a string of admittedly quite amusing tweets, inquiring into the practicality of Deadmau5's mouse head, questioning the pronunciation of his name, mocking his Tidal figures and asking if he would mind appearing as Minnie Mouse at his daughter's birthday party. Now the DJ producer is firing back, saying: \"Imma let you finish ... But you should probably be saving the money for a 4th grade education.\" He added: \"I can out idiot an idiot. It's what I do.\" When a user suggested that Kanye's insults were simply an attempt to deflect the conversation away from the illegal downloading allegations, Deadmau5 concurred, saying that all he was seeing was \"an attempt to derail it\". As to whether he will take up Kanye's offer to perform as Minnie Mouse at his daughter's birthday party, we will keep you posted.",
