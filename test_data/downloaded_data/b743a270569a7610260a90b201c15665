  "content": "Lawyers and telcos have called on the Abbott government to tighten its data retention laws, arguing their vague wording would allow the intrusion into citizens' activities to expand over time. A parliamentary committee is examining legislation that would require telcos and internet service providers (ISP) to store customer details, such as telephone numbers they dialled and the internet protocol addresses they were assigned, for two years. Police and security agencies have told the inquiry these details, commonly known as metadata, are crucial to criminal investigations and the laws will ensure uniform storage practices. But industry representatives and lawyers have made submissions to the inquiry arguing the bill was not specific enough about the material that must be stored. The detailed requirements will be spelled out through ministerial regulation rather than legislation. \"The data to be retained by service providers remains ill-defined, and new enforcement agencies can be added on an ad hoc basis through additional regulations,\" wrote Professor George Williams and Dr Keiran Hardy, of the Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law. \"In this undeveloped form the regime is open to enormous creep in scope and could expand significantly over time, including through regulations made by future governments.\" Williams and Hardy said this approach was unsatisfactory because telecommunications data could reveal significant private details about an individual. They called for metadata to be defined in legislation, ensuring that any future changes were put to parliament, and also urged the government to explain why it must be stored for so long. \"A stronger justification for the two-year timeframe could help to reduce public perceptions that the bill is designed to allow mass surveillance of the population,\" Williams and Hardy said. The Communications Alliance, which represents carriers and ISPs, and the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association expressed similar concerns about \"scope creep\" and \"open-ended language\" in the legislation. In a joint submission, the groups said agencies seeking access to metadata would \"naturally tend to 'ask for everything' because completeness lowers the risk of any small detail being missed\". \"But when telecommunications users and taxpayers are liable for the cost of 'everything', some discipline should be applied to the scope and volume of agency requests, to increase the likelihood that the national cost incurred is reasonably proportionate to the additional national security garnered,\" they said. The groups called on the intelligence and security committee to consider whether some form of warrant process should be required for access to metadata to guard against agency overreach. They also said industry was \"far from convinced\" the two-year retention period for internet-related data was necessary or cost-effective, suggesting six months as an alternative. Police and other law-enforcement agencies strongly support the bill. The Australian federal police said telecommunications data played \"an important role in nearly every organised crime, counter-espionage, cyber security, child protection and counter-terrorism investigation\" and could be used to identify people of concern and rule out possible suspects. The government pledged to make a \"substantial\" financial contribution to help industry implement the scheme, but officials told a committee hearing last month the exact costs were still unknown. Key details would be set out in regulation rather than legislation because the scheme must remain \"flexible enough to adapt to future changes in communication technology\", according to the explanatory memorandum. But the document said the laws explicitly ruled out forcing providers to store people's web-browsing history or \"the content or substance\" of emails and phone calls. The inquiry is accepting submissions until 19 January, with the committee due to make recommendations at the end of next month.",
