  "content": "Recent events in the high court suggest that we now have two parallel media universes. In one \u2013 Universe A \u2013 we find tightly knit groups of newspaper editors and expensive lawyers trying to persuade a judge that details of the sexual relations between sundry celebrities and a cast of characters once memorably characterised by a Glasgow lawyer as \"hoors, pimps and comic singers\" should (or should not) be published in the public prints. If the judge sides with the celebs, then he or she can grant an injunction forbidding publication. But because news of an injunction invariably piques public interest (no smoke without fire and all that), an extra legal facility has become popular \u2014 the super-injunction, which prevents publication of news that an injunction has been granted, thereby ensuring not only that Joe Public knows nothing of the aforementioned cavortings, but also that he doesn't know that he doesn't know. In the old days, this system worked a treat for the simple reason that Universe A was hermetically sealed. If a judge granted the requisite injunctions, then nobody outside the magic circle knew anything. But those days are gone. Universe A is no longer hermetically sealed. It now leaks into Universe B, which is the networked ecosystem powered by the internet. And once news of an injunction gets on to the net, then effectively the whole expensive charade of Universe A counts for nought. A few minutes' googling or twittering is usually enough to find out what's going on. This raises interesting moral dilemmas for Joe Public. In Universe A, most of the relevant ethical decisions about when it is justifiable to breach someone's privacy were effectively subcontracted to editors. All Joe had to decide was whether to purchase (or read) the newspaper. The massive readership of newspapers such as the News of the World suggests that many of our fellow citizens are untroubled by ethical considerations. Their behaviour may be described as passive prurience; they choose to consume whatever titillating information has been presented to them, even if it has been obtained by illegal or unethical means. If the paper publishes, then they will come. But what of Universe B, where the forbidden information is available if you are willing to go looking for it? This is a different kind of behaviour \u2013 call it active prurience \u2013 in which one becomes a virtual accessory to the violation of someone's privacy. Given the near impossibility of censoring the internet, and the apparent insatiable human appetite for titillating gossip, we're moving into uncharted territory. The outcome will be decided by how we think about privacy. The omens are not good. Our attitudes to privacy are riven with what psychologists call cognitive dissonance, which is a fancy term for our ability to hold two contradictory beliefs at the same time. We claim to value privacy highly, yet increasingly behave, especially in our online lives, as though we didn't. So in return for getting \"free\" email from Google, we accept that Google reads our messages in order to beam ads at us. We know \u2013 or should know \u2013 that everything we do on the internet is logged and leaves a trail and that this trail is available not just to our security services but also to the companies whose web services we use. We are increasingly delighted by shiny devices that track not just where we go in cyberspace but also our movements in the real world. Last week saw the revelation that the Apple iPhone keeps track of where its owner has been and that it stores the data in unencrypted form on the phone, where it can be easily read by anyone with a modicum of technical knowledge. \"For divorce lawyers, particularly in the United States, the first question when taking on a new client could be, 'Does your spouse own an iPhone?\" wrote the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones. Not to worry, we were told, the data isn't sent back to Apple or Google. Then came the revelation that Android phones also log location data. And then the Wall Street Journal found that these spyPhones do indeed beam details of their owners' movements back to their corporate mother ships in California. The spyPhone is the undercover agent luring us to what the computer industry sees as the next Eldorado \u2013 \"location services\". Once everyone has a handheld device that can relay its geographical location back to HQ then (so the argument goes) there's no limit to the stuff that can be sold to us. Walk down the high street and every shop and coffee house you pass can beam special offers directly to you. Need an off-licence? There's one just round the corner. Nearest massage parlour? Second left, third door on the right. The hypocritical cant being used to justify this vision of unlimited huckstering is breathtaking. Its basic tenet is that location-aware devices are really good for us, whereas the truth is that they are mainly good for the huge corporations that will exploit the location data that our spyPhones collect. That's not to say that something like GPS navigation isn't useful \u2013 it is \u2013 but only if it's under your control, and it shouldn't be beaming data back to California or anywhere else. The most depressing thing about the spyPhone revelations is how relaxed the geek fraternity seems to be about them. Sure, some people were exercised about the issue, but the prevailing response was a weary yawn: \"Surely everybody knew this?\" This was closely followed by a spate of blog posts in which people proudly displayed their iPhone tracks. Then there was the reminder that all location data are collected by the mobile networks, so what's new? (Answer: the networks are bound by law to keep such data secret; they can only be accessed by police or security authorities under conditions laid down by statute. Apple and Google labour under no such restrictions.) I have no doubt that the hoary old chestnut \u2013 if you've nothing to hide then you've nothing to worry about \u2013 made the odd appearance on some blogs. Perhaps this weary ambivalence is just evidence of the anaesthetising effect of technical expertise \u2013 not so much technological determinism as technological fatalism. Geeks may be subconsciously taking their lead from a famous remark made by Scott McNealy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems and an uber-geek, in 1999. \"You have zero privacy,\" he said. \"Get over it.\" It looks as though he was right.",
