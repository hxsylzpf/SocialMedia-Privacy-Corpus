The 15-year-old unnamed pupil broke into Bay House's private database in March after he obtained the password from a member of staff. The student, who has been temporarily excluded by the school, exposed the names, addresses, photographs and medical information of 7,600 past and present pupils, plus confidential details on about 13,000 adults. Bay House school, in Gosport, was ruled to have breached the data protection act. An investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) found the school had compromised the privacy of those on the database because it used the same password for the website. The headteacher, Ian Potter, has signed an undertaking to ensure reasonable measures are taken to encrypt and separate sensitive and confidential information held on the school's systems. The ICO said there was \"no evidence\" the student had exposed the personal details further than showing it to a handful of his friends. It is not known what motivated the incident, although a source close to the inquiry said it was \"probably just teenage intrigue\". Bay House issued a statement saying: \"We are pleased to learn from the ICO that it is taking no further steps, because we have fully co-operated with the commissioner's office. We take very seriously the security of our data system. In this case we were able to act very quickly to identify the hacker and take appropriate action.\" Separately, the ICO on Tuesday rebuked the Lush cosmetics group after fraudsters hacked into its website and stole the credit card details of 5,000 of its customers. The company was found to have breached the data protection act at the time of the attack, which happened between October 2010 and January 2011. The beauty group became aware of the hacking only when almost 100 of its customers reported credit card fraud. Many more may have been targeted. Lush was criticised for informing its customers on 21 January \u2013 four months after the first of the payment details were stolen. Sally Anne Poole, the ICO's acting head of enforcement, warned that the breach should act as a warning to retailers to protect customers' information. \"Lush took some steps to protect their customers' data but failed to do regular security checks and did not fully meet industry standards relating to card payment security,\" she said. \"Had they done this, it may have prevented the fraud taking place and could have saved the victims a great deal of worry and time invested in claiming their money back.\"",
