  "content": "On Tuesday, NYU student Josh Begley attempted to tweet the history of 10 years of US drone strikes in 10 minutes as part of a graduate project. Twelve hours later, he had only reached March 2010. \"At first, I wanted to visualize frequency \u2013 to see if I could tweet 10 years in 10 minutes,\" Begley told the Guardian. \"Clearly that didn't work out. After tweeting for 12 hours I've only reached 2010, and as many folks will tell you, the strikes only pick up from there.\" The Twitter handle @dronestream will recount every known drone strike since the first recorded instance in 2002, including links to accompanying news stories. The data, pulled from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, covers Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, and will fit into roughly 400 tweets, according to Begley. \"And that's not including attacks in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, which are rarely reported on,\" Begley said. In the first 10 minutes, almost 80 tweets were fired.

I certainly didn't,\" Begley said. \"I'm interested in a simple question: even if we have access to the data about drone attacks, do we really want to be interrupted by it?\" Previously, Begley built an iPhone app that tracks drone strikes, which pulled on the same Bureau of Investigative Journalism data. However, Apple rejected the Drones+ app several times.",
