The article, which appeared on the bottom of the front page of the paper with the byline \"Daily Telegraph Reporter\", said News UK, which publishes papers including the Times and the Sun, had launched an internal investigation into the deaths. The article claims there are \"fears that staff are being put under unreasonable pressure to hit targets\" in its commercial department. A spokesman for News UK told the Telegraph: \"We would never comment on the details around an employee's death but very sadly we lost two members of staff in unconnected circumstances in recent months from our London and Manchester offices. \"The company's HR procedures are second to none, with weekly and often daily meetings with team leaders, a compulsory induction and training day for new starters and a proud open door policy for all employees. In keeping with our high standards we are currently conducting an internal investigation.\" Earlier in the week the Times and the Guardian had disclosed that the Telegraph's owners had secured a \u00a3250m loan from HSBC for their struggling parcel company, Yodel, shortly before the newspaper's reporters were alleged to have been \"discouraged\" from running articles critical of the bank. The Telegraph also published a story critical of the Guardian on Friday, again with an anonymous byline. On Wednesday, the Telegraph's chief political columnist Peter Oborne announced he had quit the paper and launched a scathing attack on the paper's management and owners over its lack of coverage of the HSBC tax scandal. The story about the deaths of Times employees attracted a strong backlash, with many other journalists suggesting it marked a \"disgusting low\" from the newspaper. In an article on Friday night, Buzzfeed UK reported a source at the Telegraph saying: \"I don't think any journalist at the Telegraph agrees with what's going on at the moment.\" On Saturday, it published an update based on further contacts with Telegraph staff, who it said were \"disgusted and bewildered\" by the story's publication. It added: Three individuals with knowledge of the newsroom claimed the reporter who wrote the anonymous piece did not bring in the story themselves but was given it to write by their superiors at the newspaper. One source in the newsroom saw the reporter arguing with the news desk over the story, while a second described a newsroom culture where journalists could not veto stories they did not want to write.",
