  "content": "Remember that time British prime minister David Cameron got mocked mercilessly for his look-I'm-on-the-phone-to-Obama tweet? It seems world leaders haven't learned from it just yet. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott has now become the butt of Twitter jokes after he tweeted a very similar picture on Wednesday of him speaking on the phone to Angus Houston, who is coordinating the search for the missing Malaysia airlines plane. The inevitable Twitter japes followed, though sadly minus comedian Rob Delaney and the inimitable Sir Patrick Stewart. Responses featured everything from bananas to an irate-looking cat. Obviously, this dog got involved. Of course, Abbott's call was actually about something quite important \u2013 the search for missing flight MH370. You can find the latest updates as the search zone narrows here.",
