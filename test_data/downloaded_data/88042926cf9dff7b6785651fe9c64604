His lawyers complained yesterday of the \"chilling and intimidating threat\" made by the US authorities against the man who carried out the \"biggest ever military computer hack\" - from a room in his girlfriend's aunt's house in Crouch End, north London. Gary McKinnon, 41, yesterday lost his appeal against extradition to stand trial in the US on charges connected with hacking into the Pentagon and Nasa systems. He is accused of stealing computer files, intentionally causing damage to a protected computer, obtaining secrets which might have been \"useful to an enemy\" and interfering with maritime navigation equipment. He was initially arrested in 2002. Appealing against the decision of the home secretary, John Reid, to grant the extradition request, Mr McKinnon's barrister, Ben Cooper, argued that his client could spend the rest of his life in an American jail. Lord Justice Maurice Kay and Mr Justice Goldring dismissed the challenge but were critical of the US authorities. \"Mr McKinnon's conduct was intentional and calculated to influence and affect the US government by intimidation and coercion,\" they said. \"As a result of his conduct, damage was caused to computers by impairing their integrity, availability and operation of programmes, systems, information and data on the computers, rendering them unreliable.\" However, the judges said in their ruling that they were unhappy with the US handling of the case: \"We make no secret of the fact that we view with a degree of distaste the way in which the American authorities are alleged to have approached the plea bargain negotiations.\" Mr Cooper told the court that his client would apply for leave to appeal to the House of Lords in what is seen as a test case on extradition law. Mr McKinnon's lawyers have argued that, as the alleged offences were committed in this country, he should face trial under British law. Jeff Anderson, solicitor for Mr McKinnon, said the American authorities had threatened his client with draconian punishments if he resisted extradition and did not agree to a plea bargain. \"The threats made included relaying to Mr McKinnon that New Jersey prosecutors expressed an intention to see Mr McKinnon 'fry',\" he said. \"This is a reference to capital punishment by the electric chair. This is a chilling and intimidating threat.\" Mr Anderson added: \"The US now intends to prosecute Mr McKinnon as a cyber-terrorist, which would lead to him spending the rest of his life in prison in the US with repatriation to serve his sentence in his home country denied as his punishment for contesting his extradition. \" Mr McKinnon, a former systems administrator for a small business, has always maintained that he was motivated solely by curiosity and that what he had done could be classed as investigative journalism. Friends have set up a website (freegary.org.uk) in his support. Born in Glasgow and now living in Bounds Green, north London, Mr McKinnon became fascinated with hacking as a 17-year-old watching the film War Games. He also acquired from his stepfather an interest in UFOs, which became another motivation for his hacking life. How he did it: From computer nerd to most wanted With homeland security a primary concern after September 11, it is easy to assume that puncturing the protective layers around military computers would have been a Herculean task. So how did Gary McKinnon become a \"master hacker\"? Very easily, it turns out. From a house in north London, Mr McKinnon - a self-confessed \"bumbling computer nerd\" - spent hours laboriously testing out the different ways of accessing US computers in his quest to prove that UFOs existed. After discovering the addresses of some computers at the fringes of the military system - in departments such as logistics or support - he found it easy to break in. With a software tool used by IT staff to manage their systems, Mr McKinnon was able to work his way into networks at Nasa and the Pentagon. The biggest loopholes were created by users who failed to follow basic security measures, such as changing their password from the default \"password\". With such glaring errors leaving the back door wide open to intruders, Mr McKinnon said it was a simple task to remotely control computers on the other side of the world. Choosing to work at times when American staff would be asleep, he would climb inside and hop on to more secure systems that were impenetrable to outsiders but wide open for \"trusted\" users. By the time he was caught, Mr McKinnon was even leaving messages on the desktops of computers he had hacked into. He has admitted that it was more like the Keystone Cops than a masterpiece of science fiction. \"It got a bit silly,\" he told the Guardian last year. \"I suppose it means I'm not a secretive, sophisticated, checking-myself-every-step-of-the-way type of hacker.\" Bobbie Johnson",
