  "content": "In taking up Twitter, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has joined a group of about a dozen leaders who use the microblogging site to share their thoughts, banal or otherwise, with the world. Some leaders tweet themselves, others regurgitate official annoucements. Barack Obama, who has the most followers of any leader by a long way (3,790,213), may be a compelling orator but his tweets are humdrum. His latest entry reads: \"Hosting a town hall meeting at Indian Hills Community College in Ottumwa, Iowa. Watch Live at 5:35 pm ET.\" Obama does not tweet himself anyway, as he admitted to a group of young people during a visit to China last year. He said he had never used Twitter because his thumbs were too big to type on a phone. The disclosure may have disappointed the US president's followers, but it was probably reassuring to those who think that he should concentrate on stuff like reforming health care and bringing banksters to heel. Kevin Rudd, the Australian prime minister, seems to be a hands-on and accomplished tweeter. Interspersed among government announcements are personal observations when he's out and about on official visits. During a visit to Penguin Composites, a company that designs and makes fibreglass, Rudd tweeted: \"Met some young welding apprentices - Josh, Matt, Marcus and Danny - at Penguin Composites in NW Tas today. Killer earring on Danny! KRudd.\" The tweet sent out a message that he was out meeting people and showed him as someone with a human touch. Other leaders could learn from Rudd's matey style. The Malaysian prime minsiter, Mohd Najib Tun Razak, is unfortunately a tad soporific. His 15,752 followers are likely to stifle a yawn when they read his latest tweet: \"Will attend the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China opening ceremony later at the Mandarin Oriental in KL.\" However, he won plaudits for using Twitter to condemn the bombings of Christian churches in Malaysia, communicating directly with people the need for religious tolerance. More interesting is Queen Rania of Jordan, who has a large following (1,267,926). Rania, who is on a tour of the US to publicise a book \u2013 The Sandwich Swap \u2013 about bridging cultural divides, comes across as a lively and engaging sort, someone you'd be happy to have coffee with. Ch\u00e1vez is unlikely to send out tweets such as can be found on the Dalai Lama's Twitter page, where the Tibetan leader muses about true compassion. The Venezuelan leader sees the internet as a \"battle trench\" where he has to engage with his ideological enemies, and Twitter will be part of his arsenal. Will anybody care? Well, he has already accumulated more than 30,000 followers.",
