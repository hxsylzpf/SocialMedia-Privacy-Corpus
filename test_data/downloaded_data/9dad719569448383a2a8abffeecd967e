  "content": "Give young people the vote at 16 and then force them to use it or face a fine? Gosh, that's a lot of bad policy summarised in a single sentence and promulgated on bank holiday Monday by a Labour(ish) thinktank. Why doesn't the Institute for Public Policy Research go the whole hog and send the miscreants off to re-education camps where they can be molested and learn more about drugs? This is foolishness of a high order, even for August. Yes, there is a serious problem of voter disaffection from politics, a process that delegitimises government and hollows out democracy across the developed world. One does not need much imagination to see where that may quickly take us: towards authoritarian populist regimes which erode the all-important rule of law. This is partly the voters' fault, though pandering politicians rarely say so (and pandering newspapers dare not, for fear of losing readers). If that sounds harsh consider one of the more telling points in today's IPPR report: 44% of 18 to 24-year-olds vote, compared with 76% of over 65s. Guess which group's benefits (the tabloids never admit pensions are benefits) have been protected by the coalition? Right first time. So lesson one is that those idiots, step forward Ken Livingstone and many others who should know better, who say \"voting doesn't change anything\" are clearly wrong. It may not make a lot of difference to comfortable middle-class lefties, Ken, but the rich and poor both notice the difference in the tax and benefits system. So it is inappropriate to incentivise what is both self-interest and a civic duty (voting protects our rights, which we lose when we stop caring about them). We vote for what we think is the better option and also the one which best suits our interests and those of our loved ones. You should neither be bribed for doing it, nor punished for not doing so. In countries where voting is compulsory, spoiled or none-of-the-above ballot papers are more frequent. And why not? One obvious explanation for the feeble turnout among the young, a trend which is spreading into the 24 to 30 age group, is that politicians don't listen. They ignore the wishes of young voters. The usually smart ConservativeHome website has called for the change to come from politicians this morning. Being a grassroots Tory platform, ConHome wants to blame Brussels, over-regulation, unresponsive quangos, and a soggy consensus among the political elites for the lack of interest among young voters. Funny then that the Americans, who do not suffer all or any combination of these burdens in the way Europeans are supposed to suffer them, have an even more acute issue of disaffection/low turnout. Of course, politicians should listen to the voters. In my experience they do, in fact they often listen too closely and follow public opinion instead of taking the riskier path and leading it where a leader thinks it should go. Love her or hate her, that is what Margaret Thatcher did \u2013 as all exceptional leaders do. By coincidence, I took part last night in a debate at the Edinburgh festival of politics, staged at the Holyrood parliament. We talked about the impact of social media on the political process, how parties and leaders struggle to use it effectively, how it was harnessed to promote the boy band, One Direction, and how the Egyptian military proved smarter than the Muslim Brotherhood in using it to promote their coup. And did you notice how the Chinese communist party is using social media to orchestrate the trial of Bo Xilai? But one thing the panel more or less agreed on was that social media is just another (brilliant and new) tool in the time-old process of communication between governors and the governed, that online participation \u2013 clicking on a 38 Degrees petition or one to raise the speed limits on motorways \u2013 is wide but shallow. Sometimes it works in achieving change, as in Moldova. Sometimes it fails, as in nearby Belarus. But engagement on social media is not the same as commitment. It's a \"weak-tie\" bond like many Facebook \"friendships\", not a strong-tie one. Action-orientated strong ties, say Greenpeace or Liberty, need personal contact, structure and even hierarchy. Staying power too. As Malcolm Gladwell wrote in his 2011 New Yorker essay, Small Change, it wasn't Twitter that carried Martin Luther King from the southern bus boycotts to the Lincoln Memorial \u2013 his \"I have a dream\" speech was made 50 years ago this week \u2013 but a powerful body of organisational structures underpinned by the discipline and authority of black churches. Social media isn't like that, but politics is. That's why it's boring to young people, even the concerned ones (think teenage William Hague) who view it as too slow, too unidealistic. At the Tory conference of 1977 Hague (then 16) lectured Mrs T to her face, the cheeky whippersnapper. Social media is what the kids do. It's a network, it's not an organisation, it has no structure or hierarchy, no leader. It's egalitarian, an anarchic sharing of information, ideas (and daft photos from Saturday night) and, of course, the darker side of human impulses which include cruelty and violence. Why mention them here? Because we are talking about the relationship between teenagers and civil society, their right to vote or not, their growing awareness of the world beyond home, school and friends. It's a process, as is politics, not a campaign. Campaigns are more fun, but often fall apart quite quickly, either when a goal is achieved or rejected. Bepe Grillo, the Italian columnist turned activist, won a huge slice of alienated voters to his banner this year only to waste his opportunity and watch his base fragment. He didn't know what to do next. That's a lesson for Italian kids. Ours may learn it from voting for Ukip, Respect or the Greens, for the SNP \u2013 very new media-savvy \u2013 in next year's referendum. Win or lose, sooner or later insurgent parties, so attractive to the young, have to start taking hard decisions or fade, as the coalition Lib Dems can confirm. All this is part of growing up (some voters never do) and I remain convinced that the error which has driven the IPPR to folly in its report is to think that giving the vote to 16-year-olds will solve what is a real problem among their elders, one where all sorts of gimmicks have been tried with little success \u2013 mobile phone voting, supermarket voting, staggered polling hours and the rest. Yet Labour and the Lib Dems, and the SNP in Scotland ahead of next year's big vote (what can Alex Salmond be up to?) all favour extending the franchise. It's wrong and it rarely works as intended. When Harold Wilson cut the voting age from 21 to 18 in 1970 \u2013 all young people were then supposed to be \"leftwing\" - he duly lost to Ted Heath. That wasn't meant to happen. Teenagers have too much else to worry about without burdening them with the vote. Their exams, their job or college prospects, their relationships at home and beyond, their clothes and even their zits. Even with 20% youth unemployment and a million Neets it's a pretty wonderful world waiting for them out there, and we should be reminding the \"what do you mean, people didn't have mobile phones?\" generation just how much most of them can look forward to. Yes, I know about all the problems they face in a globalised world, all the competition and the worries (which includes us oldies). At 16 they can be forgiven for thinking it's insuperable, except it's not \u2013 and most young people don't think it is. Yes, I also know that they can get married, pay taxes or get killed fighting in Afghanistan at a very young age. But most don't do any of those things and we don't think it's a good idea when they do. \"Too young,\" we murmer and we're right. We still call them children or youngsters when they get killed in car crashes or get kidnapped, but we call them adults when we want to say they deserve the vote. Better to make them wait. Perhaps they'll appreciate it more. Deferred gratification, it's another of life's lessons. Let them concentrate on their music and having fun a little longer.",
