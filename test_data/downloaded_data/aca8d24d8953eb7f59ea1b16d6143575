  "content": "What is it? Telecom companies keep data on who communicated with whom, when, and for how long, for billing purposes. Data includes emails, phone records, texts and internet surfing histories. But they have no lawful basis to record the content of such private communications. What is about to happen? It is going to become mandatory they keep this data for 12 months for anti-terrorist, crime and public safety purposes. Police and security services have to ask for it on a case-by-case basis. What next? Within weeks the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, will outline options for new centralised \"superdatabase\". What will it do? This will give the police and security services direct access in \"real time\" to this tracking data without having to make a new request each time. The Home Office also says it is necessary to capture new data, such as use of chatrooms, social networking sites, VOIP phone services such as Skype. What are the privacy implications? A sea change in the quantity and types of data that the state has on the average citizen, with potential access to data on every email, text, phone call, internet site, chatroom or message board. Any loopholes? Plenty. Now much harder to link an individual to a particular online identity with multiple user names and often weak online registration. Difficult to track which company holds data as services can be used across networks.",
