  "content": "'Just setting up my twttr\", wrote Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder and chairman, on 21 March 2006 at 12.50pm, Pacific Daylight Time. If you feel like lighting candles and baking cakes, that's 8.50pm GMT on Monday \u2013 marking the point at which Twitter, variously dubbed a social networking service and a microblogging service, turns five. In that time it has woven itself into tumultuous events: the news that a plane had crash-landed in the Hudson River (with picture); the election protests in Iran; the rapid dispersal of the news of an 7.8-magnitude earthquake in China; updates from the ground about the terrorist attacks in Mumbai. There have been less important moments \u2013 multiple billions of them, including Stephen Fry being stuck in a lift (\"we could be here for hours. Arse, poo and widdle\"); the race in 2009 between Ashton Kutcher and CNN to be the first past 1m followers (a contest rendered irrelevant by Charlie Sheen's meteoric rise this year); Sarah Palin's coinage of \"refudiate\"; and Clarence House announcing the engagement of Prince William and Kate Middleton. Twitter has become an endlessly flowing river of news, opinion, information, expertise, contacts, data, links, connections. You can not only find out what is happening, but connect to the people you're trying to reach more directly. It's changed the relationship between media, fans and celebrities: the latter can dismiss a story within seconds of it appearing. (Though it has also proved a tabloid godsend, which can generate endless stories from celebrities' real tweets \u2013 especially after the PCC ruled that tweets are public statements.) And links to stories broadcast on Twitter are a new source of incoming traffic for news organisations - though presently far behind Facebook or Google. The question now is: where will Twitter be in five years' time? It is still struggling to find profitability, although multiple revenue streams such as selling its tweet stream to Google and Microsoft, offering \"promoted tweets\" and \"promoted trends\" and its \"Earlybird\" promotions meant it generated $45m (\u00a327.7m) of revenues last year. The most encouraging aspect is that Dick Costolo (who took over as chief executive from co-founder Evan Williams in October 2010) has a clear idea of what Twitter exists to do: \"Instantly connect people everywhere to what's most meaningful to them.\" An aim so simple and yet world-embracing suggests Costolo has his eyes on the long term. Could Twitter be bought by another other company? Google is often reported to be sniffing around it, in the absence of any useful social product. Costolo called the suggestion \"a rumour\" in February. But it probably wouldn't make a difference either way; when Google went public in 2004, journalists didn't stop using it for searches \u2013 quite the opposite. A purchase would make it stronger. And Twitter is only getting bigger and more pervasive \u2013 and more important to journalism in both directions. Clicks from Twitter won't count in the New York Times's forthcoming paywall. And meanwhile, journalists can only see more sources and more news emerging. Costolo is also keenly aware that Twitter has much further to go. Presently 40% of tweets originate on a mobile device, a clue to its enormous usefulness; its text message-length 140-character format made it the first widespread web service to break free of the PC. And with 5.3 billion mobile phone users in the world, and 90% of the world's population in reach of a mobile network, Twitter has a far better chance of reaching everyone first than Google, Facebook \u2013 or Microsoft with Windows.",
