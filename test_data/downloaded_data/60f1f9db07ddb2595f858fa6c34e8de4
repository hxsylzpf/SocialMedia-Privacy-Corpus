The part-time New York University professor is one of the key voices of the social networking movement. With his two books, Here Comes Everybody and Cognitive Surplus, he looked at the consequences of the democratising effects of the internet and became a valued guide to the emerging technological landscape. Not bad for someone who did not own a computer until he was 28 after he was introduced to the internet by his mother. \"We live, for the first time in history, in a world where being part of a globally interconnected group is the normal case for most citizens,\" said Shirky. \"Technologically-equipped groups now have the ability to bring down governments [and] destroy companies. \"More people can communicate more things to more people than at any time ... If you change the way groups get things done, you can change the world.\" Shirky, who predicted that 2009 would be a bloodbath for newspapers, has forecast that within 50 years printed newspapers will not exist at all. \"For the next few decades, journalism will be made up of overlapping special cases,\" he said. \"No one experiment is going to replace what we are now losing with the demise of news on paper, but over time, the collection of new experiments that do work might give us the journalism we need.\" Paywalls, he said, are not the answer. Born in Columbia and a graduate of Yale University, Shirky worked as a painter and theatre director before being caught up in the web (\"It was a kind of second homecoming\") in 1992. He has since worked as a consultant for the BBC, News Corporation, Time Warner and Hearst and has taught digital media at New York University since 2001. He is also a prolific columnist writing for, among others, the Guardian, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Wired and his own blog. \"Growing up with a name that rhymes with turkey \u2013 and jerky \u2013 was no great fun,\" he said. \"But, as an adult, I tell you, being globally unique in the age of Google can be extremely helpful.\"",
