  "content": "What is the snoopers' charter? It's a plan to give state agencies access to your telephone, internet and email records. Data would include information including who you call on your mobile phone, and where you are calling from, and to whom and when you sent emails. I've read Spycatcher - didn't they have access already? Some agencies - the police, MI5 and MI6, the government listening post GCHQ, the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise - already had access. But the new proposals extend the number of agencies that can access this communications data. Who will be able to find out what I'm up to? The revised plans announced yesterday extend the automatic power to see this information to agencies with crime-fighting roles, like the UK Atomic Energy Constabulary, the Scottish Drugs Enforcement Agency and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Fire authorities and NHS trusts will also get full access, so they can investigate suspicious fires and hoax 999 calls. A long list of other organisations, including 468 local councils, the Royal Mail, Food Standards Agency and others, will have more limited powers to access details of phone and internet subscribers. So why was there such a fuss? Some campaigners feel such information should remain confidential for all but the most pressing investigations. And early versions of the proposals, which were revealed by the Guardian in June last year, sparked an outcry. It was revealed that hundreds of bodies - including your local council, any government department and the NHS - would be able to demand full details of your communications without so much as a court order. What did the privacy campaigners say about that? At the time Simon Davies, director of Privacy International, called the plans \"a systematic attack on the right to privacy.\" John Wadham, director of Liberty, said the list demonstrated \"it is not just the police who will be looking at our communications records. It is practically every public servant who will be able to play this game. So then it became law, right? Wrong. In a move that surprised everyone, David Blunkett backed down, admitting the government had \"blundered\" into its plans. He promised to go away and think again, and consult his son Hugh, 24, who works in IT. And that's where the new plans have come from? Correct (from the consultation, that is - Hugh's exact involvement is unclear). Yesterday the home secretary said he took concerns about intrusion into privacy \"very seriously\". He added: \"To succeed in allaying fears of a Big Brother approach... government needs to secure public confidence that the boundary between privacy and protecting the public is set correctly.\" And the privacy campaigners - are they happy? They are a little happier than last summer, but still warn of trouble ahead. Simon Davies warned he thought the plans were a \"Trojan horse\" to \"open up the entire debate about privacy.\" John Wadham said he welcomed much of the new plan - but said there was still a need for safeguards, including judicial scrutiny of requests for data.",
