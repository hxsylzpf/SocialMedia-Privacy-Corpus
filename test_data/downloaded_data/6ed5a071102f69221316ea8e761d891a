  "content": "Labour leader Ed Miliband, often criticised for not being accessible or relatable to the public, has become one of the first mainstream British politicians to join picture-based social network, Instagram. Miliband, who has just announced a six-point plan for Labour 2025 at the party conference in Manchester, has taken time out from speaking on child benefit, apprenticeships and taxing tobacco profits to establish a presence on the Facebook-owned network. Miliband managed to contain the urge to post a selfie or a snap of his breakfast, instead opting to preview a portion of his speech. Employing the hashtags \"#lab14\", \"#forthemany\" and \"#firstpost\", the reaction wasn't too encouraging. One user called him an \"incompetent clown\". Miliband went for a belts-and-braces approach, announcing his Instagram arrival on Twitter: Some people were kinder there: Thus far, his Instagram account has racked up a whopping 257 followers. He is following six users in turn. One is shadow public health minister, Luciana Berger. Miliband is becoming something of a social networking fan, and a bonafide selfie king. Often seen leaning back, eyes-like-Maltesers, grinning into a front-facing lens, thusly: At this rate, he'll be on Meow, Foursquare, Yo! and Kik before the month is out. #swag \u2022 Instagram ads reach the UK with Waitrose, Rimmel and Channel 4",
