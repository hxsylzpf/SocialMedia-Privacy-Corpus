  "content": "Hillary Clinton's senior adviser for innovation at the US state department has criticised the developers of internet surveillance equipment who were willing to sell their services to repressive regimes and allow governments to censor their citizens. Alec Ross took to social networking site Twitter to attack TeleStrategies, the company behind the Intelligence Support Systems (ISS) World Americas conference which was held in Washington last month to give governments and buyers of online surveillance equipment a chance to meet behind closed doors. He accused Jerry Lucas, the president of ISS, of creating \"life and death consequences\" by supporting companies which sell cyberspace products that could be used for censorship, after he claimed that it was not their responsibility to ensure the equipment was not abused to limit political freedom of speech on the web. Ross tweeted: \"The head of ISS World Surveillance Show should be more thoughtful about the consequences of his beliefs. With all due respect, Mr, Lucas, people are tortured + there can be life/death consequences to sales of these products.\" The senior adviser was reacting to comments made by Lucas to the Guardian on Tuesday in which he claimed that manufacturers of internet surveillance equipment should be allowed to sell to whoever they want, including repressive regimes where it could be used for censorship. \"The surveillance that we display in our conferences, and discuss how to use, is available to any country in the world,\" he said. \"Do some countries use this technology to suppress political statements? Yes, I would say that's probably fair to say. But who are the vendors to say that the technology is not being used for good as well as for what you would consider not so good?\" \"That's not our business, we're not politicians \u2026 we're a for-profit company. Our business is bringing governments together who want to buy this technology.\" Ross criticised the comments, instead making reference to a speech made by his colleague Mike Poser, assistant secretary for the bureau of democracy, human rights and labour, at the Silicon Valley Human Rights Conference in San Francisco last month, in which he said companies had a social responsibility to ensure freedom of expression was defended on the internet.",
