  "content": "The government's central advertising body, the Central Office of Information, has tightened up its web advertising guidelines following last week's row over major brands advertising alongside contentious content on Facebook. The COI has contacted its advertising agency i-Level to confirm that government adverts will not appear on user profiles on social networking sites. A spokesperson for COI said that i-Level will be talking to sites this week. \"Advertising has been paused temporarily on any websites that have not provided COI and i-Level with the assurances our bookings require. COI will be talking to i-Level and the respective media owners this week to review individual bookings. COI and i-Level will then update and amend bookings accordingly. \"COI is not considering removing all social media activity indefinitely. COI is regularly reviewing the use of social media in government communications campaigns, to ensure they are effectively reaching target audiences.\" A spokeswoman for i-Level said: \"The COI has very strict rules and guidelines on its advertising and it has issued these again to reiterate those.\" At least six major advertisers, including Vodafone, First Direct and Halifax, have withdrawn their advertising from Facebook after their ads appeared on a profile page for the British National Party. Virgin Media has since said it has temporarily suspended advertising on all social networking sites, including MySpace, until more controls are in place. A spokesman for Virgin Media said that like most big companies, its advertising is handled by brokers. \"This is not so much about the BNP, but is symptomatic of the problem that we don't know where our ads will appear,\" the spokesman added. \"But we've been careful to say that this is only a temporary suspension because we hope to get our advertising back there. The challenge is to them and to our advertising agency to get round this problem. We don't want some kind of stalemate.\" He said that existing codes of practice ensure that adverts do not appear next to illegal content, but that the BNP's content is not technically illegal. Facebook is home to scores of mostly satirical groups that are not \"brand safe\", including \"Thumbs up for leprosy\", \"Americans for the death of Paris Hilton\" and \"Bring back capital punishment in schools\". Facebook has not yet commented on the issue. The site's own terms state that users must not upload or share any content that is deemed to be threatening, inflammatory, obscene or racially and ethnically objectionable. A spokesman for MySpace, meanwhile, said that \"if advertisers are nervous, they can speak directly to us and we will make sure their advertising does not appear against user-generated content pages, or against any political parties. The best way is to come directly to us\". In the past five days, the main BNP group on Facebook has grown from 150 to 194 members. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
