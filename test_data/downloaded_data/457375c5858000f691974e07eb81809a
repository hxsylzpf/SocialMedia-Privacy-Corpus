  "content": "Hello! magazine has won its challenge to a high court order that it should pay more than \u00a31m in damages for publishing paparazzi pictures of the wedding of Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas. The court of appeal today overturned a ruling that Hello! should pay \u00a31,033,156 in damages to rival magazine OK! after spoiling its exclusive by publishing snatched photographs of the wedding. Hello! will still have to pay the Hollywood couple \u00a314,600 damages for printing snatched photographs of the ceremony in New York in 2000. However in a ruling that will have important ramifications for newspapers and magazines seeking to protect exclusives, the appeal judges dismissed OK!'s cross-appeal claiming Hello! had unlawfully interfered with its business by publishing a spoiler edition. A statement issued by Northern &amp; Shell said the appeal court had \"fully vindicated\" the Douglases' action against Hello! But it admitted it had implications for anyone paying big money for exclusives with celebrities. \"This decision will impact all publishers with exclusive rights as it means rivals will be free to run spoilers with no redress in law. OK! will therefore be appealing this judgment to the House of Lords.\" Hello! magazine was delighted with the decision. \"This was a spat between two rival publishers and not between Hello! and the Douglases. The judgment is a resounding win for Hello!,\" said Chris Hutchings, partner in M Law, which represented Hello!. As a result of our win, Richard Desmond [owner of Express Newspapers and OK! owners Northern &amp; Shell], will now have to write a cheque to Hello! for a very large amount of money indeed.\" Media lawyer Mark Stephens told Sky News: \"This is a sea change in the law. The question is will it remain. OK! is going to appeal this in the Lords - they have no other option. \"For Richard Desmond, the scoop and the exclusive is as important as for any other news organisation and he is going to have to carry the flag in the House of Lords.\" Hello! told the appeal court last December that the pictures were published as a \"spoiler\" to lessen the impact of OK!'s exclusive \u00a31m contract with the Douglases to cover the New York marriage ceremony. James Price QC, representing Hello!, told three judges at the time that \"spoilers\" were a well-known tactic in the newspaper and magazine industry and that his clients had been victims in the past. \"This was something previously not considered unlawful. We are in the position that if you are going to compete in this industry you have to publish spoiler,\" he said. \"But what happened to Hello! was that it was caught by a law which said 'stop it' retrospectively.\" The original ruling against Hello! followed a six-week high court hearing in 2003 at which Zeta Jones told how she felt \"devastated, shocked and appalled\" when she realised unauthorised photographers had gatecrashed her wedding at the Plaza Hotel in November 2000. The actor said she and her husband had signed the deal with OK! after turning down a higher offer from Hello!. Mr Justice Lindsay ruled that Hello! had breached the couple's rights of confidence but that they had no claim in law for invasion of privacy. Hello! appealed over its liability to the magazine and the Hollywood couple and the amount of damages to be paid to OK!. Lawyers involved in the case have estimated that the total costs could amount to \u00a34m. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
