  "content": "Suppose, 10 years ago, that a married man found himself fantasising about sex with another woman, or a young woman fell to day-dreaming that she should really have been a pop star. These reveries would have been confined in their minds. Now, though, the dissatisfied guy signs up to an online role-play game, where his avatar has virtual sex with the glamorised stand-in of another player. And the wannabe-Madonna auditions for a TV talent show, where her unsuitability for a musical career allows Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell some easy crowd-pleasing put-downs. And so this week, in landmark examples of the way that new technology has changed our lives, Dave Pollard is being divorced by his wife because she caught his graphic stand-in shagging a computerised beauty on Second Life. And Paula Goodspeed was found dead, apparently by suicide, outside the Los Angeles home of one of the judges who voted her off American Idol. It's more than possible that Pollard would have divorced and Goodspeed died even if computers had remained a business tool and television stuck to dramatising classic novels. All inventions can be misused; the railway network should not be closed down because people throw themselves under trains. But even so, this coincidence of a virtual-reality divorce and a reality-television suicide feels symbolic of modern life. What unites the two cases is that they are part of a fantasy industry, offering escape routes from reality that prove less safe than advertised. Diversions from our given personalities have always been available - drink, drugs, dreaming - but the difference now is that alternative lives acted out on screen may come to seem more attainable than they are. Second Life, for example, is a kids' dressing-up box for alleged grown-ups, or, giving the high sexual content in this imagined world, an undressing box. The case of the couple separated by the husband's online romance starkly illustrates the transformative appeal of such games. Photographic evidence shows that, when Dave Pollard and Amy Taylor created their avatars - \"Dave Barmy\" and \"Laura Skye\" - they took the opportunity, as most players do, to raise their height and halve their weight. But, cruelly, even the understudy Amy did not prove enough for the alternative Dave. Indeed, given that the real Dave and Amy are reported to have met originally in an internet chatroom, they may have claims to be an ultimate modern couple: their union beginning and ending through a technological possibility that was not available to their parents. Although as bitter as ex-lovers tend to be, the couple seem to agree that his infidelity occurred only in Second Life rather than real life. This raises a fascinating debating point about marital morality. The view of some men that fellatio does not count as adultery - most prominently proposed by President Clinton - was always going to struggle to gain acceptance. But seducing a cartoon feels safer, an alternative to masturbatory fantasy that is either less or more hands-on, depending how you look at it. The Pollard/Barmy case, though, reveals the flaw in Second Life's claim to function as a safe space for fantasies: that it is a portal to real people. Amy's fear was that, while Dave B was tupping the puppet, Dave P was just as interested in the puppet-mistress behind her. Luckily, Amy has now replaced both Daves with a bloke she met on a wargame website, although you have to wonder if she's inviting further trouble. No one is saying that courtship should go back to chaperones and dance cards but fantasy universes seem a particularly risky place to pick partners. As with the Second Life divorce, the American Idol death is also not a simple matter of cause and effect: Abdul and Cowell, in rejecting an unlikely pretender, were not directly responsible for this outcome. But the makers of these shows need to reflect on whether they have underestimated the potential consequences of creating a stage on which fantasies and delusions can be played out. With I'm A Celebrity returning to ITV this weekend - and Channel 4 having just announced the return of the racism-disgraced Celebrity Big Brother - this audit is urgently called for. When reality TV began to degenerate from its genuinely interesting beginnings, I wrote that the logic of the genre led inexorably to suicide or homicide, and was accused of exaggeration. But, as the cruelty of this kind of TV has increased there has been a growing sense of the vulnerable being thrown as meat to the ambitious in the cause of entertainment. The current series of The X Factor, for example, has frequently seemed to have less to do with the competitors' ability to deliver a song than the ability to handle the tabloid coverage generated by their involvement. Two buzz phrases of recent years have been \"reality check\" and \"get real.\" This week's strange cases, though, suggest that popular culture needs to take heed of both instructions. The industrialisation of day-dreaming is ruining real lives. comment@theguardian.com",
