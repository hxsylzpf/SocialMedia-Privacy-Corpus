  "content": "Who will watch the watchers? Some guy on a train with a Twitter account, it turns out. The former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden ended up on the wrong end of a surveillance stakeout on Thursday afternoon when, while riding a commuter train, he was overheard \"disparaging\" the Obama administration. The over-hearer was a private citizen \u2013 Tom Matzzie, an entrepreneur who previously worked for MoveOn.org and John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. Hayden was aboard an Acela train outside Philadelphia and talking by phone with a reporter when Matzzie, who was sitting nearby, recognized him. Matzzie heard Hayden insist to the reporter that he be quoted anonymously, as a \"former senior administration official\". Then Matzzie began live-tweeting as the nation's former top spy badmouthed the Obama administration, apparently in connection with the revelation hours earlier that NSA had monitored the phone calls of at least 35 world leaders' telephone lines. The episode came to a remarkable conclusion shortly after Matzzie noticed Hayden receiving a new phone call, and joked on Twitter that Hayden's office must have heard what was happening and called to warn the former spy chief. Matzzie's hunch was right \u2014 but as it turned out, he didn't need to hide. At the end of the episode, though, Matzzie admitted he didn't feel entirely comfortable about what had happened.",
