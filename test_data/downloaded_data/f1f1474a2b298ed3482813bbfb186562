Solicitors acting on behalf of Jane and Leslie Grantham and their three sons have written to newspaper editors accusing the tabloids of breaching the Press Complaints Commission code of practice, and of contravening the European Convention on Human Rights. The Granthams complain that journalists and photographers continue to besiege the family's south London home \"almost every day\" despite being asked to desist in a letter sent to editors in May 2004, after stories about Grantham's private life surfaced in the press. At that time, photos of Grantham - who plays Den Watts in the BBC1 soap - were published showing him naked in his dressing room sending pictures of himself by computer to a 23-year-old woman. The star's 23-year marriage was reported to be in trouble after he moved out of the family home. The new letter from the Simkins Partnership singles out six tabloid journalists - two from the Sun, three from the News of the World and one from the Sunday Mirror. It claims other journalists have also been harassing the family, but when questioned these reporters refused to give their full names or that of their employers. And on at least one occasion the police were called to the house to deal with the press. The Granthams allege that their three sons - one of whom has Down's Syndrome - have been approached and photographed in contravention of the PCC code, although none of the photos has been published. And the letter says that one journalist engaged in a conversation with the child with Down's Syndrome via the house entry-phone and asked him questions about his father. \"Clearly it must have been evident to that journalist that he/she was speaking both to a child, and specifically one with special needs. Clearly this action... is extremely inappropriate and totally unacceptable,\" said the solicitors. Under the PCC rules, journalists must not approach children under 16 unless a parent or guardian consents. And editors \"must not use the fame, notoriety or position of a parent or guardian as sole justification\" for publishing details about a child. The letter also says Mrs Grantham is continually called on her new mobile phone number and that her husband has had to change his number three times in the last few months due to unwanted calls from journalists. The letter concludes by saying that the family, and in particular the children, have been upset by the invasion of their privacy and will make a formal complaint to the PCC or take action through the police and/or the courts. \"Should this become necessary, they will not hesitate to do so in order to protect the rights they are guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\" The Sunday Mirror said it had no comment to make, while the Sun and the News of the World were contacted by MediaGuardian.co.uk but were not available for comment. Grantham is due to leave EastEnders imminently - the character was spectacularly resurrected from the dead in September 2003, more in hope than expectation he could resurrect the glory days when millions regularly tuned in to watch his antics. But the 17 million who watched his return quickly melted away and the BBC soap has suffered a ratings nosedive. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
