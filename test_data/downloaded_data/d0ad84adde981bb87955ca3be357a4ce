  "content": "\u2022 After delays to Rupert Murdoch's paywall strategy and questions about its Google search deal, MySpace's money management is once again under the microscope after it emerged that the struggling web company is still paying $1m a month for an empty office complex in Los Angeles, reports the Financial Times. Ouch. \u2022 The iPhone unlocking community took pause over the last few days, after some some users with jailbroken handsets found themselves hit by a Rick Astley worm. What does this mean for ordinary iPhone users? Not much probably, since jailbreaks are basically built on security exploits and so more susceptible to attack. But the potential is still there. \u2022 This weekend's food-for-thought came from Paul Carr, formerly of this parish, now writing for Techcrunch. In a post spinning off last week's shootings at the Fort Hood US military base, he accuses 'citizen journalists' of indulging in a dangerous kind of selfishness. I have to admit I found his argument slightly odd, though I agree we all carry a responsibility to share accurate information. Still, it's engendered some interesting and eloquent responses. Worth pondering. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
