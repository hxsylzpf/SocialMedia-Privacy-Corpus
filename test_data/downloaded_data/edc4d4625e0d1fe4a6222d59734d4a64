  "content": "Trafigura, a London-based oil trader connected with dumping toxic waste in Ivory Coast in 2006, was the most used word on micro-blogging site Twitter this morning. After the Guardian was banned from reporting the contents of a parliamentary question relating to the toxic dumping scandal yesterday evening, the topic was widely picked up and aired on Twitter. As the statistical page CrowdEye shows, tweeting increased slightly yesterday evening, and a steep rise of more than 5,500 tweets including the word \"Trafigura\" followed this morning. While the Guardian was prevented from reporting the question - from MP Paul Farrelly to a minister - until law firm Carter-Ruck withdrew its opposition at lunchtime today, Twitter wasn't: instead of suppressing the story the attempt backfired. Factor in the Streisand effect, and starting here the topic spread across the internet and became the top trending topic on Twitter. The Guardian editor-in-chief, Alan Rusbridger, tweeted the gagging order with the question \"Did John Wilkes live in vain?\". The gagging order was lifted after Carter-Ruck dropped its claim. But Twitter had already alarmed a variety of platforms, and the question about Trafigura got picked up by a number of prominent blogs, including Guido Fawkes, Richard Wilson's Don't Get Fooled Again, and Adam Tinworth's One Man and His Blog. Finally, mainstream media caught up, with The Spectator pushing the story. It might be a bit too exaggerated to call it a historic moment, but surely the real-time web passed its test today.",
