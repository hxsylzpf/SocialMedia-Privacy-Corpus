  "content": "The advisers to the royal family are facing a real dilemma over Prince Harry's naked pictures. Dare they make a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission about The Sun publishing one of the intimate photos? We already know that the Palace aides regarded the publication of the Las Vegas hotel room pictures as intrusive because their lawyers fired off a note to editors warning them against using them on the grounds they invaded the prince's privacy. But, as last night's PCC statement made clear, without a formal complaint from the Palace it can do nothing. Not only would it be \"inappropriate\", as it said, but it would be unprecedented for the commission to investigate a privacy matter without the wronged party making a complaint himself. If the Palace don't complain, it will be open season on Harry, and possibly other members of the royal family, because they will be viewed as having let The Sun get away with it. On the next occasion (and there always is a next occasion), the Daily Mail, say, or the Daily Mirror, the Daily Star and all their Sunday stablemates, will be desperate to publish. They will argue that if The Sun could stick two fingers up to the Palace without being punished then why should they not follow suit? Yet, should the Palace complain, then it faces the outside possibility, and gross embarrassment, of its complaint not being upheld. The Sun will surely advance the twin justifications it has already made - first, about there being a genuine public interest, and second, about it having been seen so widely on the net that it was effectively in the public domain. On the other hand, should the PCC find against The Sun, then its editor, Dominic Mohan, and its publisher, Rupert Murdoch, are unlikely to take the matter lying down. Murdoch has made much of it being a press freedom issue and is hardly going to tamely accept a censure from a body that, to all intents and purposes, is a busted flush anyway. There would undoubtedly be a split in the newspaper ranks too, between those who view publication as meretricious and those who believe it to have been warranted. Then, of course, there are the 3,800 members of the public who took the trouble to complain to the PCC. What faith will they have in press self-regulation should they be knocked back? Finally, given that the Palace employed their lawyers, Harbottle &amp; Lewis, would it take the legal route? In its warning letter, the law firm said there was no justification under English law to publish and that \"the only possible reason for publication of the photographs is one of prurience and nothing more\". In spite of that, I cannot imagine the Palace launching legal action against The Sun. In truth, and this is a sobering thought as the Leveson inquiry ponders the future form of press regulation, Murdoch looks to have won this battle already. Full PCC statement here",
