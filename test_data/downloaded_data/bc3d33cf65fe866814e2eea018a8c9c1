  "content": "Do you need a degree to tweet? Some, it seems, would argue so. Twitter is by no means the sole topic of the MSc in Information, Communication and Society at City University. But the way it and its fellows \u2013 Facebook and YouTube \u2013 have taken hold in society and business, provides a justification for study. The course has been launched \"in response to employer demands, and the important role that social networking and other Web 2.0 systems now play in society\", prospective students are told. The MSc is aimed at communications professionals who need to use digital information at work, be it in the world of political campaigning, marketing, or the NHS. Presumably opportunity to target an audience at a basic level is fairly short-lived \u2013 what with kids learning all that in school. Tech wizardry of youth aside, though, for those joining the learning curve at this level the postgrad course goes way beyond the basics in a tie-in between the sociology and information science departments. This crossover area will surely merit much more study in the future as \"community\" \u2013 once restricted by geography \u2013 now forms and morphs in new ways, predominantly online. For those keen to latch on to this fast-moving world, the City course starts in September. And before that? Conundrums for the uninitiated remain. To twit? to twitter? to tweet? Tweeter? Twitterer? Twit? Not worth five minutes of your time online, never mind a year's study? Or a communication and networking method that has suddenly becoming a big part of your life? Let us know what you think below, or on our GuardianEdu Twitter feed...",
