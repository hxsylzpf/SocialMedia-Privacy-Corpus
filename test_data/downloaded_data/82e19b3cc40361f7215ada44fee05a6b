As well as being named film of the year, it earned Fincher the best director prize as well as best actor for Jesse Eisenberg (who played Mark Zuckerberg) and best adapted screenplay for Aaron Sorkin. The announcement will add to the growing momentum behind Fincher's picture, which is nudging the $200m mark in worldwide takings. Annie Schulhof, the NBR's president, praised the film's cross-generational appeal and predicted it would have a long shelf life. Fincher also won the NBR's award for best director in 2008 for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The board listed nine other films as their runners-up for best of the year. In alphabetical order, they are: Another Year, The Fighter, Hereafter, Inception, The King's Speech, Shutter Island, The Town, Toy Story 3, True Grit and Winter's Bone. Britain's Lesley Manville won the best actress award for her role in Mike Leigh's Another Year, while Christian Bale picked up best supporting actor for his work in The Fighter. The career achievement award went to Sofia Coppola. The NBR, comprising 110 film critics and historians, has been functioning for over a century and is the oldest independent industry group in the US. The awards will be presented on 11 January in New York.
