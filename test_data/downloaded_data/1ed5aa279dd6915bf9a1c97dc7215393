  "content": "WEbook is trying to disrupt a notoriously elitist industry - building its book community site from the ground up. Itai Kohavi founded the site last year after discovering firsthand what he describes as \"the solitary nature of the writing process\" - he was inspired to create a home for a community that could work collaboratively online. WEbook employs 10 staff now and is aiming for 15 by the end of the year. It has raised funding from Greylock Partners and a handful of angels, and is based in Washington DC with developers in Mountain View, California. Isreal-based (that'll be Israel-based...) Kohavi explains how it works. WEbook founder Itai Kohavi \u2022 Explain your business to my Mum. \"If your Mum likes to write and share ideas, she will love WEbook. WEbook is a platform where passionate writers from different countries and diverse walks of life come together to create engaging works of writing. The community votes for its favorites and we publish and sell those works both in print and digitally as WEbooks, while sharing 50% of the profits with the creators of the books.\" \u2022 How do you make money? \"We have multiple revenue streams. First, we will publish and sell books created by WEbook users. We also have a variety of online revenue options in development that range from pay-for-services to premium subscriptions and, ultimately, an advertising opportunity.\" \u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months? \"We choose not to disclose specific numbers, but I will say that we have tens of thousands of members now and expect hundreds of thousands within 12 months. We are very happy with the current trajectory of both users and active projects.\" \u2022 What's your background? \"I am an entrepreneur and a writer. Before WEbook I founded and successfully exited two venture-backed companies - Comfy, the worldwide pioneer of interactive toys connected to a PC, and the Neat Group, the first technology company to facilitate rules-based dynamic packaging for the travel industry. I also wrote and published two novels and one children's book, the process of which was my inspiration for WEbook.\" \u2022 How are personalisation and recommendation part of your business? \"Personalisation is a key part of our site because everyone who is using the WEbook platform has a lot of freedom to express their creativity, and we ask them to bring their unique background and experiences to the collaborative writing process. \"For recommendation, we rely on our community to vote for which projects will be published by WEbook. It doesn't get much more direct than letting the users recommend which projects become WEbooks.\" \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? \"Our biggest challenge is to contribute to the evolution of the traditional publishing business, which is still dominated by a few large publishers who wield enormous control over the titles that reach the bookstores. While in the past decade the music, software, travel, financial, and other major sectors have shifted the power from the few to the many, publishing continues to function as an exclusive, traditional business.\" \u2022 Name your closest competitors. \"We are pretty unique, and don't see any direct competitors in the marketplace. You could say that HarperCollins and Random House are our competition, but their business is very different than ours.\" \u2022 Any weird business experiences so far? \"Usually I ride my MUNI (mountain unicycle) in the weekends in the forest. On weekdays it is bedridden in the trunk of my car, however, when there's a lack of parking space in town, I tend to park wherever there's an empty spot and ride my MUNI to meetings where I'm to meet people that know that I'm a \"serious guy\". Twice in my life I entered a venture capital office on the MUNI, both ended up as WEbook investors.\" \u2022 Are we in the middle of a new dot com bubble? \"Well, in the middle of a bubble there's empty air, and the same bubble can blow up only once. The internet today is much more like the big bang theory, it's a mass of content that expands quickly in all directions and no one knows whether it will ever stop and how.\" \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? \"In the hands and eyes of millions of talented writers and readers around the globe.\" WEbook.com \u2022 Another great example of a niche social network - but will it last? \u2022 Can creative projects really be developed on a virtual platform? Doesn't it need good old fashioned talking and brainstorming? \u2022 Do the traditional publishers have anything to be worried about?",
