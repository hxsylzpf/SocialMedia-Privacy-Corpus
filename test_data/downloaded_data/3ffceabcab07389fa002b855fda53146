  "content": "Ask most teachers and you'll hear us admit, on occasion, that we've wished for a tool that could record the poor behaviour of a student. What could give sweeter satisfaction than watching little Joshua squirm at seeing his repeated whispering replayed for mortified parents? How pleasurable it would be to freeze on the moment of shoddy subterfuge where a hand slips out of a pocket and glides swiftly to the mouth. No longer would you need to wonder if the slow-moving jaw was a sign of chewing. You could rewind and pause, catching the moment a Juicy Fruit packet is brandished under the table with a pipeline of hands ready to receive contraband. Proof would be only a click away. If this sounds too strong a reaction for what is essentially kids being kids, then you're not wrong. We might like to imagine that this scenario is a touch too close to George Orwell's vision of a draconian totalitarian state; a possibility only in the distant future. But perhaps it's as good a time as any to remind people of that motivational aphorism: the future is now. This week it was announced that two UK schools are trialling teachers using body cameras in classrooms, so \"fed up with low-level background disorder\" have they become. The announcement came via Tom Ellis, principal lecturer at the Institute of Criminal Justice Studies, a man described as being \"intimately involved in the rollout of body-worn video cameras for Hampshire police\". A rather obvious problem presents itself in the twinning of his job title with this subject matter. In case it needs stating, teachers are not police officers and did not sign up to take on their duties (although reportedly a third of teachers are in favour of this latest scheme). There is a difference between managing misbehaviour and policing it as this so clearly seeks to do. And we should not ignore the fact that part, if not much, of the support for officers wearing these body cameras is so that we are more able to hold these public servants, who wield a great deal of power, to account. Do we really need reminding that we are talking about teachers wielding whiteboards and marker pens, not adults allowed to carry batons, gasses and guns? Of course, as teachers we want children to be accountable for their behaviour. But increasing the spread of surveillance in schools isn't going to help us do that. Classrooms will be transformed from spaces cultivating inquiry, in all its forms, to centres wary of the threat of being caught out by an all-seeing eye. Ellis is at pains to point out that the cameras will not be on all the time; only \"where there is a perceived threat to a member of staff or pupils\" will they be used. Quite how this will be decided, and how their use will not gradually become routine, is not clear. Mention of improving safety is supposed to be a persuasive argument, a death knell to voices of dissent. Who could be against increasing it? Except nobody has evidence that this, presumably costly, exercise will achieve what is claimed. At times of shrinking school budgets, with less having to go further, we could argue that problems with behaviour would be better served by having smaller class sizes \u2013 not body-cams. Even without experience as a teacher, it shouldn't be too much of a stretch to comprehend that larger class sizes affect a pupil's level of engagement with their teacher. There is only so much attention one person can give each individual in a class of 36 or 46 (and please, save the \"well, we only have immigrants to blame\" arguments for elsewhere). It's surely basic maths, no? Miserably, the possibility of smaller class sizes exists in a distant future. A recent Guardian Teacher Network poll found that nearly a third of teachers report their schools are not replacing teachers who leave. And this will only encourage body cameras to suffer from an inevitable function creep. In ever more unmanageable circumstances, will they prove invaluable to building evidence to expedite exclusions and become less about illustrating bad behaviour to incredulous parents? Paranoid this may be but that is the drawback of constantly being watched. The government seems happy to relinquish responsibility on the matter, preferring to devolve the power to decide on body cameras to schools. This at a time when schools are increasingly being managed from central government. Currently 80-85% of schools have some form of CCTV and it is estimated that nearly half of England's schools use biometric or fingerprinting technology. All this before we even mention how normal it is to find police officers based in schools. The drive for greater discipline is lost when the means through which it is achieved is coercive. Children will misbehave. It is an essential part of their nature. Infuriating as it can sometimes be, it is not justification enough for putting them under constant watch. Doing so only implies that our job as teachers is to catch them failing rather than to help them succeed.",
