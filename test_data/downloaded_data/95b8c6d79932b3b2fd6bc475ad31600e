  "content": "Radio 1 DJ Sara Cox has won an injunction against a French picture agency preventing it from reprinting nude photographs of her and her husband Jon Carter on their honeymoon in the Seychelles, which originally appeared in the People. Cox is still suing the People and celebrity photographer Jason Fraser, whose agency sold the pictures, on the grounds of breach of privacy. A date for the hearing has yet to be set. But yesterday she won a ruling in default against Paris agency Eliot Press, banning the firm from reprinting the pictures and ordering the agency to hand over or destroy any remaining images relating to the case in its possession. Cox was furious about the publication of the pictures and initially complained to the press complaints commission. The People printed an apology, which former PCC chairman Lord Wakeham accepted as being in line with the spirit of its code of conduct, while former editor Neil Wallis said he had been misled about the circumstances in which the pictures were taken. But this failed to satisfy Cox. She hired Keith Schilling, the lawyer who represented supermodel Naomi Campbell in her case against the Mirror after it published pictures of her attending a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. A high court judge initially found in Campbell's favour, but she lost a subsequent appeal by the Mirror, a decision she is contesting. Gideon Benaim of Schillings said the law firm would be enforcing the injunction against Eliot Press in the French courts. A spokesman for Eliot Press said the agency had no comment.",
