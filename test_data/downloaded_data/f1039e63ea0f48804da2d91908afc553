  "content": "The charitable sector is full of examples of partnership and collaboration; of strong networks and umbrella bodies, and formal and informal ties between people and organisations with shared values and objectives. Yet there is further reason to explore the potential of partnerships for achieving charitable goals. When it comes to digital technology, working with those who have expertise in understanding, using and developing digital technologies can maximise the value of using technologies for social good and crucial to developing new ways of addressing social challenges. One fascinating model is SideKick School, which brings the fast-paced agile development of digital social innovation agencies (or start-ups) to medium to large-sized charities. This approach to partnership aims to develop new digital products and services that support the charity's mission but recognises that both the agile start-up and the established charity need to work together to achieve their shared aims. It is easy to talk about the value of partnerships but they are not always easy to implement: differing timescales, reporting mechanisms or organisational objectives and cultures can mean that partnerships don't always work effectively, and it's important to recognise this when forging new relationships. The process being refined by SideKick School is testing how best this integrated partnership model can work and the lessons should be useful far beyond the four charities they're looking to work with this year. If Sidekick School is an example of how charities can partner to develop fast-paced innovation, there are equally great examples of partnerships that support charities to embed established practices. A great example of partnership between charities and big business can be seen through the Charity Technology Exchange, where eligible UK-based charities are able to request donated technology products from major technology businesses such as Microsoft, Symantec and Cisco. A wide variety of products are available and charities are able to save up to 96% on typical retail prices. Despite the current economic climate, it is this sort of partnership that offers charities the chance to explore and develop their use of technology as the cost of access is significantly reduced. And it's not just charities and social enterprises that can benefit from working in partnership. Funders and social investors have much to learn from working with each other and the wider sector. At Nominet Trust, we have a range of different partnerships \u2013 not least with the organisations in which we invest \u2013 where value exchange is the most important part. We've also been working with Comic Relief and Right Here on a series of innovation labs, developing a range of digital products and services to support young people around issues of mental health. This partnership is not only between the three funders, but also with more than 100 young people and service providers. This means that resources are aligned to tackle a social challenge with more force. We've also been working with NCVO and Big Lottery to explore how open data can best support the sector. The need for collaboration was recognised early on if . While the innovation labs are aligning resources to address specific needs, the partnership around open data recognises that a pipeline of development and exploration is needed, linking targeted exploration and funding, through to larger scale support and investment. Informal online networks It's easy to think of partnerships solely as formalised links between organisations. For me, the most exciting developments are the way in which social media has increased the number of ways we can create links with people outside our organisations. These informal relationships and personal learning networks (PLNs) offer a really exciting new approach as they can tackle some of the issues of aligning organisational objectives to individual need and ambition. These networks are between people rather than organisations and develop fluidly as individuals with shared interests meet and share ideas and resources. Twitter is a great place to begin developing your own PLN, interacting with others who share interests and extending your network to find others who can support you in your work (and you in theirs). Social media surgeries and informal meet-ups build on these PLNs and offer new ways of connecting across the sector. Personal (or professional) learning networks are where individuals within institutions create informal networks with peers inside and outside of those organisations. What is particularly powerful about these networks is that they cross geographic, as well as institutional and disciplinary boundaries. Although these can be termed loose networks, as their make-up can change on an informal basis, they are becoming very important as sources of ideas, resource sharing and support for innovators. If you're interested in exploring your own personal learning network, start simply by reflecting on where you find support and inspiration now. It could be within a team meeting room, at conferences or watching Ted talks. Social media can then be used to expand this by searching for blogs and Twitter streams that talk about similar issues. Social media can turn audience members into participants and in turn, this can lead to the development of informal networks of people with shared interests. Whether formal or informal, research conducted into how charities are using digital technologies highlighted a really important need for partnerships within the sector. The authors describe a growing \"support economy\", which \"will be an increasingly important aspect of the third sector, as 'traditional' organisations come to require new ways of finding agility and of presenting themselves on the internet in ways that resonate with the attitudes and expectations of modern donors and volunteers\". The importance of new 'value relationships' and partnerships will increase as new technologies, new opportunities and economic context demands new ways of building social value. But partnerships can be long term and organisational, or short term and personal. What is important though, is that we find ways of bringing in new expertise, ideas and skills to the sector, to take advantage of digital technology to address social challenges.
