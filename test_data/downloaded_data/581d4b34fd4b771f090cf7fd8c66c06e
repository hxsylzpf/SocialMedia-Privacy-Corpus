  "content": "A high court judge has outlined his reasons for rejecting a privacy injunction sought by former England manager Steve McClaren against the Sun over an extramarital affair. Mr Justice Lindblom said in a written judgment handed down on Wednesday that the Sun was right to publish the \"kiss and tell\" story because McClaren was a public figure \"from whom the public could reasonably expect a higher standard of conduct\". The Sun on Sunday published a front-page exclusive, headed \"Soccer exclusive: McClaren affair with Sven's ex\", on 19 August after the 11th-hour injunction was defeated. Lindblom's judgment was delivered in an emergency private hearing attended by lawyers for McClaren and the Sun on Saturday 18 August, but published for the first time on Wednesday. The judge said the Sun's right to freedom of expression outweighed McClaren's right to privacy because the former England manager was a public figure who had held positions of responsibility in the national game. Lindblom added in his judgment: \"As a former manager of England's football team, the claimant is in my view undoubtedly a public figure within the definition recognised by Tugendhat J in Spelman. \"It is a matter of fact that he previously disclosed an extra-marital relationship in a national newspaper, saying that he was happily married and that his marriage would survive \u2026 I concluded that the [Sun] plainly had a legitimate public interest in publishing its story.\" Richard Spearman QC, for the Sun, argued that McClaren's right to privacy was lowered because he had spoken about his marriage on several occasions. According to the written judgment, Spearman claimed that McClaren had in 2006 used the celebrity agent Max Clifford to sell a statement about a previous extramarital affair to the Sun for \u00a312,500. Hugh Tomlinson QC, for McClaren, said the football coach had \"little choice but to make that disclosure\" and that the question of whether he sold the story was \"contentious\", according to the written judgment. Spearman confirmed that the woman with whom McClaren had the affair had sold her story to the Sun. The affair has not been denied by McClaren. Tomlinson unsuccessfully argued that the story was not in the public interest and that it was a breach of privacy because McClaren and the woman \"had not at any stage conducted their relationship in public\". The ruling has been described by some media lawyers as a \"strong judicial swing towards free speech\". But others have pointed out that the decision relied heavily on McClaren's past role as England manager. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
