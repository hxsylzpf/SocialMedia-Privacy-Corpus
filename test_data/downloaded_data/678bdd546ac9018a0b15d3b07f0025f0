Authors and readers bombarded the Seattle-based firm with complaints over the weekend after books \u2013 many dealing with gay and lesbian themes, and including novels by EM Forster, Jeanette Winterson and Gore Vidal \u2013 disappeared from its ranking system in what appeared to be a botched attempt to make its bestseller lists more family friendly. The company had previously said the de-rankings - which it promised to fix \"as quickly as possible\" - were the result of \"a glitch\" in its systems. Rankings matter to authors because they affect how their books come up in a search: the higher the ranking, the more likely the book is to come up when a customer is looking for it. \"What kind of a childish game is this?\" Vidal said on Monday. \"Why don't they just burn the books? They'd be better off and it's very visual on television.\" Amazon said that the de-ranking was not limited to gay and lesbian titles. Patty Smith, director of corporate communications for Amazon, today issued a statement, writing: \"This is an embarrassing and hamfisted cataloguing error for a company that prides itself on offering complete selection. It has been misreported that the issue was limited to gay and lesbian themed titles. \"In fact, it impacted 57,310 books in a number of broad categories such as health, mind and body, reproductive and sexual medicine, and erotica. This problem impacted books not just in the United States but globally. It affected not just sales rank but also had the effect of removing the books from Amazon's main product search. \"Many books have now been fixed and we're in the process of fixing the remainder as quickly as possible, and we intend to implement new measures to make this kind of accident less likely to occur in the future.\" Author Mark Probst, whose novel The Filly, a gay western romance for teenagers, lost its sales ranking, had called Amazon \"hypocritical\" for stripping the sales rankings of books which \"they deem to be 'adult' material\". \"There is a multitude of 'adult' literature out there that is still being ranked \u2013 Harold Robbins, Jackie Collins,\" he blogged on Sunday. \"They are using categories THEY set up (gay and lesbian) to now target these books as somehow offensive.\" But The Filly has now had its ranking reinstated - as have Vidal, Forster, Hollinghurst and Winterson's novels - and Probst said he did not believe \"that there was any malicious intent\" in the de-rankings. \"Amazon admits they goofed, and I, for one, shall give them the benefit of the doubt,\" he wrote on his blog. \"Case closed.\" But not all authors have accepted Amazon's explanation. Craig Seymour, whose memoir All I Could Bare: My Life in the Strip Clubs of Gay Washington, DC was removed from Amazon's charts in February, and restored later that month, said the statement was \"a start but completely insufficient\". \"It does not explain why writers, like myself, were told by Amazon reps that our books were being classified as 'adult products', he wrote on his blog. \"And exactly what does a 'cataloguing error' mean? Was the error that they ever had an 'adult' category or was the category simply overused? And if Amazon is going to maintain an 'adult' category, who is going to determine what is 'adult'? How will the criteria be applied to ensure that it's not prejudiced toward books with GLBT content; and will there be any way to appeal the process once the determination has been made? All of these questions need to be answered.\" Meanwhile a petition protesting against the move continues to gather support, with over 21,000 signatures today, up from around 10,000 yesterday, and #amazonfail is the second most popular Twitter hashtag.",
