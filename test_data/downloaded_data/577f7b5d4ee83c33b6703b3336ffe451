  "content": "Though the journalistic intrusions into the privacy of Max Mosley and Gerry McCann were very different, there was one thing on which they both agreed when giving evidence to the Commons select committee yesterday. They did not have much time for press self-regulation. Mosley likened the Press Complaints Commission to \"putting the mafia in charge of the local police station.\" He thought it gave preferential treatment to its own industry and lacked sufficient powers to deal appropriately with many complaints. He also attacked Paul Dacre, the Daily Mail editor, who is also chairman of the committee that oversees the editors' code of practice. The code does not specifically prohibit journalists from paying officials to provide information in breach of the Date Protection Act, he said. Yet it was the Mail that had been found (in the 2006 Motorman inquiry) to have been the most frequent payer. Mosley did not mention any of this until one of the committee members asked him what he thought of the PCC. It was a clear indication about the MPs' continuing concern about self-regulation. Similarly, McCann was asked whether he and his wife had thought of making a complaint about newspapers' \"irresponsible and damaging\" coverage to the PCC. He replied that the commission's chairman, Christopher Meyer, advised him that his best course of action was to sue. That must have taken the breath away of some MPs. Was Meyer passing the buck to the courts because he didn't want to deal with the matter? Did he not think the PCC had no role whatsoever to play in curbing the excesses of papers engaged in a feeding frenzy? Was this self-regulation or self-preservation? McCann did say that the PCC had been helpful in protecting the privacy of his children, but he went on to call for more stringent regulation and a greater level of redress. He said: \"There has to be some degree of control, I believe, or deterrent to publising untrue and particularly damaging stories where they have the potential to ruin people's lives.\" He also found it difficult to stomach that Peter Hill, the editor of the Daily Express - one of the papers responsible for the most lurid and libellous stories - sat on the commission throughout the period he was publishing those stories and stayed on for some time after the paper been forced to apologise and pay libel damages. We should not overlook the powerful testimonies by these two people. The McCanns were subject to a prolonged feeding frenzy by papers. Speculation was passed off as fact. Reporters fabricated \"stories\". And the PCC just sat on its hands. Why? In the Mosley instance, the PCC would not act because it does not touch cases that are the subject of litigation. But the commission, confronted by copious evidence down the years of News of the World misbehaviour has preferred to let the courts deal with it. Time and again it has let the paper off the hook, a weakness the public cannot but help to notice. It is perfectly true that the PCC's tight remit, its rules of engagement if you like, largely preclude it from taking up cases in which there is no formal complaint (though it has occasionally done so). But there is no earthly reason why it should stand back from high-profile cases. It should have intervened in the McCanns' coverage. It should have issued a statement after the Mosley case. If the public are to have any confidence in self-regulation - and, despite its surveys, I am sure they do not - then the PCC needs to be more pro-active. That probably means more funding. It certainly means less behind-the-scenes, off-the-record, cloak-and-dagger \"mediation\" and unattributable \"advice\". The Meyer conversation with McCann is astonishing, is it not? We would do well to remind ourselves that the PCC was set up specifically to head off both a privacy law and a right-of-reply law. Yet, if yesterday's performance is anything to go by, Mosley's call for a privacy law appears to have made some headway with the culture, media and sport select committee. I have been sympathetic to Mosley's plight ever since the News of the World covertly filmed him and humiliated him by publishing its story, pictures and video. It was both a flagrant breach of his privacy and, in my opinion, the second week's story was also clearly libellous. But I am opposed to a privacy law, as I make abundantly clear in my column in today's London Evening Standard.",
