  "content": "Trinity Mirror is to launch the next phase of its digital-first strategy with a restructure of its operations in the north-east by taking a giant step into the future. Under the slogan Newsroom 3.1, the company is introducing a new publishing process in its Newcastle and Teesside newsrooms. In the coming months a similar digital-first working system will be rolled out to the publisher's other regional centres in Birmingham, Cardiff, Liverpool, Manchester and Huddersfield. It comes against the background of a rapid increase in online audiences. Trinity Mirror recorded 119m page views on its regional sites in February alone, a year-on-year rise of 72%. \"There has been huge growth in the past year,\" says the company's regional chief, Neil Benson. Together, the regionals and the nationals (largely the Daily Mirror), are now drawing more than 60m uniques a month. In a press release, Benson is quoted as saying: \"Digitally, we have made great progress over several years but we now need to accelerate the growth and engagement level of our digital audiences. \"In an era when audiences want access to live-up-to-the-minute information across a variety of platforms, our working day will no longer be built around our print products. \"The new structure gives us the capability to produce more digital content all day and every day, while still producing brilliant newspapers.\" In practical terms, it means that the entire focus of newsrooms throughout the day will be on posting copy online. Previously, there was a tendency to favour digital in the mornings and then work on print after that. Now content will be created in order to hit key digital audience spikes across the day, ensuring that users can find refreshed and new content each time they visit a website. That online content will then be edited and packaged into the print versions of the north-east region's newspapers - the Chronicle, Evening Gazette, Journal and Sunday Sun. It amounts, in other words, to a change in the mind-set for the editors and journalists. Print comes second and with it, a change of editorial emphasis in the newspaper - \"less megaphone, more discussion,\" says Benson. As for the effect on jobs, the overall size of the north-east's editorial team will increase by 17. There will be 25 new roles but eight existing staff are at the risk of redundancy. Among the new digital positions will be jobs specifically aimed at increasing audience engagement and driving traffic, such as social media editors, planning analysts and advance content writers. In addition, two football roles will be created with a Newcastle United editor and a Middlesbrough FC editor. Darren Thwaites, the publisher's north-east editor-in-chief says: \"The demand for local content is as great as ever and it's our job to give the audience what they want, when they want it.\" Evidently, Newsroom 3.1 will make maximum use of content through SEO and social media as well as through digital analytics tools, such as Chartbeat and Omniture.",
