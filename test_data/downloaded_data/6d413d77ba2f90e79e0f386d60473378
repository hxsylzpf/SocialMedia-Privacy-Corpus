Not just because of the dramatic way she did it, but because of the startling revelation of the frightening economics of Instagram. O'Neill shared how she made \"A$2,000 a post EASY\" by publishing sponsored content to her profile, much of which was not explicitly marked as paid-for content. In her very public take-down of the site O'Neill cautioned her followers that if \"Instagram girls ... tag a company, 99% of the time it's paid\". Adding, in a video posted to YouTube titled How People Make 1000s on Social Media: \"Why would you tell your followers that you're paid a lot to promote what you promote?\" That it's possible to make money from Instagram might well be news to those who don't use the photo-sharing app \u2013 and many of the 400 million people who do. But marketers are very interested in this vast, growing and highly engaged community. Twenty-eight percent of all adult internet users in the US use Instagram, and it is particularly popular among women (31% of female internet users visit the site) and non-whites (47% of African Americans and 38% of Hispanics who use the internet visit the site). Significantly, those who use Instagram do so devotedly \u2013 half of all Instagram users visit the site daily \u2013 and the social media site offers advertisers a way of reaching the coveted Generation Y market; 55% of all internet users in the US aged 18 to 29 (also known as millennials) use Instagram, which gives young Insta-celebrities, or \"influencers\", the opportunity to monetise their followings. Mimi Elashiry, 20, from Australia, has more than 806,000 followers on Instagram who like, comment on and \u2013 advertisers hope \u2013 eventually imitate the life she presents in her posts: relaxing on the beach, eating out with friends, playing with her dog, eating specific brands of coconut yoghurt and wearing particular labels of swimwear. \"I think my audience have connected to my lifestyle,\" says Elashiry. \"I'm not constantly throwing advertisements in their face. I'm like, here's me with a coffee, here's my backyard, my dog.\" Most of her posts receive about 20,000 likes; some, though followers do not know which, earn her more than A$1,500 (\u00a3738) from brands hoping her social media influence translates to real-world sales. She reportedly earns A$10,000 a month from sponsored Instagram posts. Elashiry first started being offered cash and products in exchange for posts when she had only 3,000 followers; for a while, it covered her rent and expenses. It was \"great fun\", she says: \"I'd just finished school and was like, this is awesome, I'm making money by posting photos.\" But her manager, John Scott \u2013 to whom she had to explain what Instagram was \u2013 taught her to be more discerning. She now turns down offers that don't suit her brand \u2013 like a A$7,000 Cartier bracelet (\"My audience of young girls aren't going to respond to that\"). But pre-orders for a sequin mini-dress she designed with an independent designer for her 19th birthday sold out two hours after she posted a picture of herself wearing the sample. She once snapped her order at a Sydney health food cafe; after school that day, Scott says, the cafe was \"bombarded\" by teenagers. How much an Instagrammer can charge depends on who's asking. Between $150 and $300 seems standard for Australians with audiences of fewer than a million, and Essena O'Neill's claim she was making $2,000 a post might have been a one-off, according to Scott and Elashiry. \"I think there's a big myth around the money that people are making out of Instagram,\" he says. \"Everyone likes to talk up the fact that they're earning this much per post, but there aren't many companies that can afford to pay that.\" For US and British models such as Kendall Jenner (47.1 million followers), Cara Delevingne (25.8 million) and Gigi Hadid (12.2 million) who can command six figures per post, the ceilings are higher. Danielle Bernstein, 22, charged between $5,000 and $15,000 for a plug on her @weworewhat account when it had 992,000 followers; now she's passed the 1m milestone, she will be asking \"a good amount more\", she told Harpers Bazaar. The appeal of Instagram, says Scott, is partly that consumers relate to other consumers. \"I think we're all very aware of big brands, and we've become very discerning. 'Hey, that girl's super-cool, I love everything about her life, she's real. If she tells me that this is a cool brand, I trust her, so I'm going to buy into that'.\" Digital influencers, especially on as intimate and engaging a platform as Instagram, have niche, avid followings. Just how avid? A talent management agency recently signed the pet of its popular Instagram star. Health blogger Bianca Cheah has 126,000 followers, her French bulldog Sporte has 16,200 \u2013 and now both are represented by IMG. \"That's how desperate it's got. People are so interested in these people, my God,\" said Georgie Summerhayes from BrandData, a company that measures \"social hotness\", determining which of more than 7,250 brands, personalities and media outlets have more clout online. Elashiry ranks sixth out of 135 listed Australian \"fashion influencers\". What made one influencer more successful than another was strategy. Summerhayes pulled up the profile of the Instragrammer ranked first among \"lifestyle influencers\", with more than 1.2 million followers \u2013 a grid like so many others of shots of brunch from above and beaches. \"You can have one digital influencer who just posts all this shit, and another digital influencer who posts similar shit, but she's more engaging. That's why some are flash-in-the-pan, and others do things in a better way.\" Not every tag or mention of a brand in Elashiry's photos is an ad \u2013 she says she hasn't done a sponsored post \"in months\". But posts that were paid for look just like those that weren't. There's definitely a grey area, she volunteers. She pulls up a recent picture of a vintage Contax film camera. \"That looks like I could be advertising something, but I bought that on eBay as a Christmas present to myself.\" A picture of her painting her nails \"was work\", she says. But for the caption, advertising a competition from Rimmel, it's indistinguishable from her other photos. \"I suppose I blend it all in. I'd never take something that was too overt.\" \"And they liked that,\" adds Scott. \"The brand was like, 'That is so perfect for us'. Subtle.\" Most of the time that a post looks like an ad, it isn't, says Elashiry. \"And even if it is, it's something that I've agreed to do because I think it's awesome.\" For the first time, she seems slightly defensive. \"At the end of the day, it's my job, so it makes sense for me to be paid for it. I don't think that being paid to do it makes it fake at all. Like, I love painting my nails, so I was like, sure, send me orange.\" There's no telling how long this kind of career path will be around. Many influencers are wary of investing too deeply in Instagram or any platform that is not their own website. But Elashiry's celebrity has eclipsed its unconventional beginnings, with presenting work for MTV, a modelling campaign for a high-street fashion retailer, and a swimwear line among the opportunities to come from her Instagram following. Eventually she'd like to use her following to \"give back\" \u2013 she talks, with no less passion for the lack of specifics, about setting up some kind of charity. But the next step is relocating to the US in a few weeks. She has an O1 visa (\"for individuals of extraordinary ability\"), and is signed to Next Model Management in Los Angeles. A major film studio is also \"very curious\" to meet her, says Scott. \"As long as it's fitting with my brand, then I'm completely happy to do those things,\" she says. \"Given the opportunity to go overseas and model, why wouldn't you? Why wouldn't you just go and do whatever you want?\" Read on: The trials of Generation Y - the full series",
