  "content": "Darryn Lyons used to dream of being a war photographer for Magnum, but you probably wouldn't guess this when you meet him. He looks more like someone who used to be in a boyband - only with a parakeet sitting on his head. He lives opposite Kensington Palace in one of the most extraordinary homes I've ever visited: a rococo palace of kitsch self-regard, practically wallpapered with gilt-framed cuttings about himself and his business, and giant Warholian prints of his face. It's the most famous face of the paparazzi in the world today, thanks to a BBC documentary series that featured his agency, Big Pictures, in action. Screened in more than 70 countries, it revealed the secrets of paparazzi photography, and turned Lyons into a celebrity. Big Pictures is now the biggest paparazzi agency in Britain, if not the world. MrPaparazzi.com, his website where the public can submit their own photographs of famous people, attracts 1.7 million visitors a week, and he is soon to launch Celebrity TV on the internet, for people who want to watch video footage of stars on their mobile phones. But right now he is publishing his autobiography. It reads rather like a less-polished, paparazzo version of Piers Morgan's The Insider - a raucous account of the duplicity, ingenuity and raw determination of an industry that seems to compel and appal in equal measure. Not a great literary work, it captures the sensibility and spirit of the paparazzi world. But it's a world which has always been notoriously secretive, so I ask Lyons why he wrote it. \"Well, my whole thing is about ticking boxes. I wanted to put myself through the pain of writing a book.\" Did he actually write it himself? \"No, I didn't write a word! What I actually did was talk into a tape recorder, and I had a very close buddy of mine in PR to try to assemble it in some kind of form. I think if you read the book, I kind of talk it, don't I?\" He's not wrong. Lyons in person is exactly like his book - exuberant, wildly boastful, highly entertaining and fundamentally amoral. He hopes the book will show that \"behind the Mohican\" lies a serious, \"passionate\" journalist, and a gifted entrepreneur. But what comes across most forcefully is a character who could be straight out of a Martin Amis novel - a larger-than-life caricature of contemporary culture Lyons grew up in a small Australian town called Geelong, with Baptist parents who believed in grace before supper and moral rectitude. But their son dreamed of fame and fast cars, fell in love with photography, and arrived in Fleet Street at 22, hungry with ambition. Soon he was on the Daily Mail staff, covering the Bosnian war, and loving every minute - but when he set up his own paparazzi agency on the side, a memo soon went round the office, complaining that Lyons was earning more than the editor. He wept, he says, when they fired him. But he went out with his cameras that weekend, and earned more than his annual salary. The advent of celebrity culture was obvious to him, he says, 15 years ago. And he sees his role in it not as intrusive, but indispensable. \"The paparazzi create the oxygen and the euphoria for fame. How are you going to make people famous without making them famous? And who makes them famous? If all the world's photographers stopped photographing Brad Pitt tomorrow, do you think he's going to be Hollywood's leading man? I'm telling you now, he won't.\" Even so, I start to say, he can't seriously believe that casualties like Britney Spears or Amy Winehouse benefit from the media circus documenting their disintegration. \"Hold on!\" he interrupts. \"Amy Winehouse, Britney Spears, they create a whole brand out of this! Don't you think most of these people are obsessed with seeing themselves in the magazines? Victoria Beckham has built a whole career out of it, for Christ's sake.\" But Beckham is in control of her life. Winehouse and Spears are plainly not. \"Do you really think that? There's an argument for Britney Spears that it was all a massive publicity stunt. Yes, I agree they're vulnerable. But I also think that they have a fascination with being famous, and they can't do without it, and they encourage it. You don't go out in the middle of the night and get your head shaved, whether you're off your face or not, without knowing what you're doing. I'm very cynical about what's done today. And I am this cynical because I see it every day, I see what goes on in the celebrity world, and we're fed so much absolute bullshit.\" Lyons likes to think of himself as a fearless truth-teller in a murky world of media manipulation. \"The difference between me and Vogue is that I'm photographing reality, and they're selling a lie. I mean, Liz Hurley does not look like that. And that, to me, is selling bullshit.\" But one of the truths he enjoys telling is the extent of celebrities' collusion with the paparazzi. A sizeable portion of his tip-offs come from the stars themselves, and stars even sign contracts with Big Pictures to set up photo shoots which look \"snatched\". Aren't those images also selling a lie? \"Well, the pictures aren't bullshit.\" No, but the context is, isn't it? \"Yeah,\" he concedes. \"But you've got to remember, being an entrepreneur, I've got many different aspects. That side of the business is PR.\" Lyons seems to see no contradiction between deriding hollow ambition, and facilitating it. \"Fifty per cent of our celebrities today,\" he says scornfully, \"are famous for doing sweet FA. I mean, Abi Titmuss, all she's done is shag John Leslie. Or Jade Goody, she's just famous for being on reality TV.\" Yet he writes proudly about the management division of Big Pictures \"making celebrities\"? \"Absolutely! It's a business!\" In his book he says he \"despairs of people wanting to be famous for fame's sake\", and yet he's facilitated that process. Doesn't he mind being a part of something he despairs of? \"No, not really. Darryn Lyons has made a lot of people famous with his pictures, without question. I get quite excited about making something from nothing. My whole life has been about making something from nothing. We live in a society where most people today have two major things on their agenda, backed up by survey after survey. They either want to be rich, or they want to be famous. Darryn Lyons would be happy to facilitate that service. \" Even if they're untalented? \"My personal kick,\" he replies, \"is building a great business, or taking a great picture, and if that is making someone famous who is not talented, whether I despair of that or not - well, so be it. That means I'm bloody good at what I do.\" Nobody in the industry disputes that Lyons is good at what he does. Sometimes it lands him in court: Big Pictures was recently fined \u00a3600,000 for photographing Liz Hurley on a private beach resort. He is also fighting a case against JK Rowling for photographing her child in public. The implications of a ruling in that case are potentially serious for the paparazzi, but Big Pictures is applying for leave to appeal to the Lords, so Lyons cannot discuss it. He doesn't appear, however, to be worried about any danger of legal action curtailing his profession. Nor does he anticipate any dip in demand for its wares. \"That will never happen.\" Does he never wonder whether it's healthy for the public to crave the photographs he sells? Not that long ago, after all, an insatiable desire to look at pictures of total strangers might have been considered somewhat odd. \"They're not strangers! You survey most children: who is Gordon Brown and who Coleen McLoughlin, and I guarantee her percentage will be higher.\" But both of them are still strangers. \"The fact is, we live in an aspirational society. And if you're a kid in this country without a lot to look forward to except gangs on streets and knifing people, this is very, very important. Wayne Rooney didn't come from the nicest upbringing. Jade Goody is another example. So is Jordan. I don't think it's a bad thing for people to aspire to be them. Because I'd rather take a kid off the street and make them famous, than for them to go through a life of misery.\" But the problem with celebrity culture, I offer, is the creation of unrealisable aspiration. Children don't want to be doctors or barristers any more, they want to be Paris Hilton. And they're never going to be Paris Hilton. \"But they might be! What's wrong with that? What's wrong with a little kid waking up in the morning dreaming? I was a little kid in Geelong, who always wanted a car that the doors went up. And I got one. That's aspiration. That is not a bad thing for society. In fact that has made Britain what it is today.\" I explain to him that almost everyone I interview nowadays brings up the subject of celebrity culture, and that not one of them has been enthusiastic until now. Lyons looks amazed. Can he think of anything at all which might be bad about celebrity culture? He thinks hard, repeating the question softly to himself. \"I can't,\" he concludes, \"see any problem with it. I think it's harmless. Harmless.\"",
