  "content": "Security researchers are rushing to patch a flaw in the domain name system (DNS) servers that direct internet traffic, after details of how it worked were revealed online where they could be exploited by hackers. The researchers had thought that their own agreement to allow a 29-day \"blackout\" period during which the software vulnerability - which may allow hackers to misdirect innocent surfers to fake sites, even though the address in their internet browser was correct - could be patched. The discoverer of the flaw, Dan Kaminsky of IOActive, found it several months ago and had asked other researchers to hold off on speculating about how it worked until he could distribute it to companies such as Microsoft, Cisco and the Internet Systems Consortium to let them develop patches. He said he would announce the details on August 6 at the Black Hat security conference. But Thomas Dullien, chief executive of Zynamics.com (who uses the online name Halvar Flake) seems to have reverse-engineered the details of the weakness without being told its specifics, and he then speculated on how it worked in a blog post. This prompted Matasano Security, another company which - unlike Dullien - had been briefed on the flaw to put up a blog post of its own confirming the details. That was quickly withdrawn on realising that Dullien's post was only speculation - but it was time enough for the post to be cached and copied widely. The attack uses a method called \"DNS cache poisoning\", which relies on the fact that DNS servers do not store the entire map of the internet (converting a domain name such as theguardian.com into a numerical \"quad\" such as 212.187.153.30). When a server does not have the quad conversion, it asks the next one along to do the lookup. By targeting a DNS server, hackers could poison its \"store\" of lookups and tell it to point users to fake sites. Such changes have been made accidentally in the past: in February, changes by Pakistan to DNS servers it operated made YouTube inaccessible worldwide. But an attack by hackers could be serious. Kaminsky has provided a \"Check my DNS\" button on his blog (doxpara.com) that will let people check whether the DNS they are using is vulnerable to the hack. In the latest post on his blog, Kaminsky accepts that the flaw has been revealed - giving it the headline \"13&gt;0\", implying that having 13 days to fix the flaw is better than having none - and urges the people who will have to do the fixing to \"patch. Today\" and \"stay late\" as necessary. Quite how the bug is being fixed will probably remain secret - to defeat hackers.",
