Google is expected to pay Fox at least $900m (\u00a3470m) in 2007-10 after beating Yahoo! and Microsoft for the contract. Google also signed with Viacom to distribute clips from popular MTV shows. Ad-supported clips will use Google's AdSense network, which delivers targeted content to affiliated sites. One US report suggested Viacom would get more than two-thirds of the proceeds.",
