  "content": "Guido Fawkes blog founder Paul Staines is planning to send a legal warning to the Tory MP Claire Perry after she accused him of \"sponsoring\" the hacking of her website. Perry, who is David Cameron's special adviser on children and internet pornography, reacted angrily when Guido Fawkes published a screengrab of her site showing it had been hacked. The Westminster gossip blog reported that Perry's site carried \"a series of explicit adult images\" which were \"unsuitable for a family blog such as this\". The blogpost prompted Perry to accuse Guido Fawkes of sponsoring the security breach and said she would complain to the Sun, where Staines writes a Sunday column. On Wednesday, Staines said he would send the MP a letter from his solicitors threatening to sue for libel if she did not take down the claim on Twitter and if Guido Fawkes readers voted for him to take legal action. By midday, the vast majority (86%) of those polled urged Staines to sue Perry. \"If the readers say to sue by noon and she hasn't taken it down we will send her a lawyer's letter,\" he said. \"I have an aversion to suing people but the lawyers say it's open and shut. She's been asked to take it down.\" Staines said it was \"very silly\" of Perry to accuse him of linking to porn when he had only published a screenshot \u2013 and ridiculed her threat to complain to the editor of the Sun. \"I don't think she understands. The editor of the Sun edits the Sun. I edit the blog. Why doesn't she call the editor of the Times as well?\" he said. \"It's a bit school playground, isn't it? 'I'm gonna tell the teacher on you'.\" Perry had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
