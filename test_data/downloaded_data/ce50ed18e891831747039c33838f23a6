  "content": "Big W has followed the lead of Aldi in withdrawing T-shirts that referred to Australia as being established in 1788. The decision of the two shopping chains followed pressure from social media users who complained that the shirts were offensive to Indigenous Australians for implying the nation began with the arrival of the First Fleet. A photo posted on social media showed a white shirt, sold in Big W, bearing the words \"Australia Est. 1788\" above \"Authentic Series\" and \"Team A Division\". Aaron Nagas \u2013 guest tweeter on the @IndigenousX account \u2013 had encouraged people to post messages to Woolworths calling for the shirts to be withdrawn after their success in persuading Aldi to withdraw similar shirts. Writing on the Woolworths Facebook page, he said the shirt made no sense for a number of reasons, including that the official federation of the nation called Australia did not occur until 1901. He said the land mass had already been inhabited by Indigenous people for thousands of years and \"obviously didn't just pop out of thin air once the British decided they need more room for prisons\". \"I'm not sure how a company that was started in Australia could make an ignorant mistake like this but I hope that like Aldi Australia you have the common decency to take these offensive shirts off the shelves,\" he wrote. A Woolworths spokeswoman said on Thursday that the shirts would no longer be sold in Big W. \"We've withdrawn the T-shirts from sale,\" she said. Aldi had advertised \"Australia Est 1788\" shirts as part of its Australia Day range, but issued a statement on Wednesday confirming they would not go on sale on Saturday as planned \"following comments by a limited number of concerned customers\". \"Aldi Australia wants its customers to know it puts the community and their wishes first,\" the Aldi statement said. One Twitter user suggested the \"est\" be changed to \"invaded\" while others urged people to complain to Aldi directly. The announcement was welcomed by some but angered others who did not believe the T-shirt was offensive and argued it was a case of \"political correctness\". It came as the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet confirmed it had approved the representation of the Australian flag on the Aldi shirt in July 2013, but had considered no other elements of the design. \"In regard to the importation of items bearing an image of the Australian national flag, such items are a restricted import under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956,\" a departmental spokesman said on Thursday. \"Prior to any importation, importers require approval from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for the use or design of the Australian national flag on the relevant items. \"In this case the department provided approval on the basis that the flag was reproduced completely and accurately. In assessing requests for approval, the department considers only the representation of the flag and no other matters.\"",
