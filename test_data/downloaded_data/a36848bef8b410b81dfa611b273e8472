  "content": "We expect a round of reports about Twitter every time there's a major news event, so yesterday's earthquake on southern California was no exception. Even Twitter themselves wrote about it this time, showing the spike in tweets that mentioned 'earthquake' in the few minutes after the quake... and the mainstream press catching on nearly ten minutes later. I've said it before, but much of the breathless amazement that people using Twitter to talk about these events is really, well, a little overblown. There's a perception of these tools as publishing platforms, which they are in some ways, but they also return to the core function of the web - communication. If you use Twitter regularly, then of course you'd tweet if you found yourself in an earthquake. It's not that surprising. The interesting phenomenon is that because this communication is public, it can be used as a source. The problem for news organisations is that Twitter is relatively easy to search if you know what you're looking for, hearing that first crack as the news breaks is much harder and relies on buzz. It did give Twitterers the opportunity to be very smug about being first, though. CNN got the raw end of this for posting something about the earthquakes to their 'breaking news' feed - five hours after it was first discussed on Twitter. \u2022 Update: The CNN feed wasn't actually an official CNN feed, but more on that shortly...
