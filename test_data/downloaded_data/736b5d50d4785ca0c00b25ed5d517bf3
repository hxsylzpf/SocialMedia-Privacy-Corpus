  "content": "Ministers have admitted to frustration with the intelligence services over their failure to find the source of a series of leaks from government: one of the longest since the second world war. There is also suspicion in Whitehall that the leaks to the Sunday Times - now lasting nearly a year - are being encouraged by payments, but no evidence exists to substantiate this. Ministers including the home secretary, David Blunkett, had thought the leaks were politically motivated, with one minister out to damage another, but they now believe they are coming from the civil service. Most of the papers relate to domestic policy. At the weekend the Sunday Times published confidential letters from John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, on efforts to stop the leaks. Ministers admit privately that failure to find the culprit is slowing down government. Some want to cut out the normal posting system for controversial papers because they are convinced they are being copied in the Whitehall system.",
