  "content": "How much do you spend, and where? It's the question most marketing tools try to answer, and there has been plenty of attention give to extracting this information in various forms from the activity on social networks. Wouldn't it be easier if people just said how much they'd spent, and where? Well there is, and it's called Blippy. It has some seriously high-profile backers - not least Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, serial entrepreneur Jason Calacanis and Sequoia Capital. It's clear this is a business idea that makes sense, and its string of investors can easily see where the money bit begins. Consequently the site just announced $11.2m in funding, announced in a New York Times story. One problem though; the credit card details of five users were found on Google last week. The guys behind the site have spent two frantic days fixing the problem - no doubt after being giving a dressing down by their new investors - and carefully explained the problem on the company blog and detailed a series of cock ups by them and by Google, thoug they did point out Google sorted the problem swiftly. The site accidentally published raw data in the site's HTML code for half a day in February. They had thought that data was harmless until someone noticed airline confirmation numbers in it, so they patched the problem... and until last Friday when Venturebeat found the card numbers, Blippy hadn't realised that Google had indexed the site during that half day \"which effectively extended a half day exposure into a three month exposure\". Worse, the Fifth Third Bank had sent credit card numbers along with that raw transaction data - hence those credit card numbers sitting on the publicly searchable web for three months, if you knew where to look.

Some rights reserved You might think the problem lies with Blippy users being stupid enough to sign up to a site that aims to their financial details on the web, but it's not quite as black and white as that. When you sign up to Blippy, you choose which services to want Blippy to access. Chose iTunes, and Blippy will log what you buy and how much you spend. You can chose whether to make that transaction private, or whether to make it public with an anonymised price. That kind of information is fairly benign and no more revealing than saying which app you liked, or how much you might have spent on a t-shirt from Threadless. Informally, those kind of statements are published in their thousands on Twitter, and Blippy formalises that by publishing transaction history at source. The service - which is still only four months old - has just a handful of partners for now, including Netflix, Threadless, Blockbuster and eBay. But it takes things a stage further. The next level is a bit more weighty, giving users the option of adding their bank URL and login details, and/or credit card details. I'm game for giving most social networks and tools a try because I want to understand them, and see if they offer a genuine benefit. With Twitter, that benefit was obvious quite quickly, while other services take a while to warm to. And then there's those that just don't feel right - that's where Blippy's at. I don't think people are ready to overcome that big counter-intuitive hurdle of sharing their financial data, and this kind of balls up is the worst possible thing that could happen to them in one way, though of course it will force them to improve their security. Finance tools aren't a new idea; Mint.com and Wesabe.com are great, for example, but are private financial management tools. That said, think about how much information we share about ourselves now that we would have been horrified about even a few years ago. Taping 'social spending' is far too lucrative to be killed off and - once it has scaled the huge challenge of building consumer trust - Blippy and dozens of rivals will become a permanent part of the social media landscape.",
