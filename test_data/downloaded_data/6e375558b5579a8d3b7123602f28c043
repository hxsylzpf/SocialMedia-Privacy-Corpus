  "content": "It's probably entirely coincidental that since rumours recently ripped through the internet of the CIA being 'behind' Facebook many folk have started posting photos of themselves with album covers in front of their faces. They may successfully mask their visages from any agency wishing to collect headshots of everyone in the world, but the main motivation behind such 'Sleevefacers' is to create larfs (in some cases 'awesome larfs'), while letting it be known they are groovingly cool enough to collect vinyl. 'Sleevefacing' is any obscuring of a face with an album cover which 'matches in' with, say, the holder's shoulders or torso, to create a visual illusion. DJs are said to have started this craze. One in particular, Carl Morris, held Macca's face, on the cover of McCartney II, in front of his mug while manning turntables in Cardiff. Then he decided it was 'childish', yet went on to form sleeveface.com. On Facebook 3,000 such illusionists are experimenting with the medium - photographing images in which fists or limbs on album covers seem to impact on those holding them, 'romantic sleeve portraits' (of canoodling couples obscured by Lennon and Ono's Double Fantasy cover or Crippled Dick Hot Wax's Popshopping 2), or playing with transgender and interspecies ideas. Some snap sophisticated group portraits or domestic tableaus in which ever greater numbers of sleeves are cleverly incorporated. Others attempt to use two gatefold sleeves, or tricky little seven-inch single or CD covers, or just turn to Bookfacing, which makes them look more intellectual, literally. But some drink one too many Stellas and find themselves producing 'sleeverotica'. Musical artistes who've ever displayed their bottoms or open mouths on album sleeves will likely find themselves shuddering this year.",
