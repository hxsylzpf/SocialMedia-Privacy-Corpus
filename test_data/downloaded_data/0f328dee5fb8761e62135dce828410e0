For the first time, the label \"live tweeted\" the show on Monday from backstage, posting photographs of each look on Twitter moments before the model stepped on to the catwalk. At 4.15pm Burberry was the third most popular topic globally on the social media, as fashion-watchers compared notes. When you consider that it was not long ago that high street stores smuggled spies into catwalk shows in order to glean clues as to what might be in stores in six months' time, this is quite a turnaround. But still \u2013 live stream or no live stream \u2013 you had to be there. Kensington Gore, where the show was staged under the shadow of the Albert Memorial, was a scene. The seating arrangements alone at a major catwalk show are a piece of theatre, complete with A-list improv: Anna Wintour directly opposite Andy Murray; Paul Weller and Kanye West bookending a phalanx of blondes. Ben Kingsley was there for cultural gravitas, and the MP Ed Vaizey to defend the sartorial honour of London's mayor after recent sniping in this paper. (Vaizey also weighed in on the hot debate currently gripping the front row. He suggests: watch Downton Abbey, record Spooks.) Christopher Bailey now considers himself a provider of multiple media content rather than simply a fashion designer but this collection proved he is still a dab hand at the day job. In recent seasons there have been whispers of dissent about the mega brand that Burberry has become: that in finding the megabucks it had lost the humanity, humour and warmth with which Bailey initially imbued it. But this collection, inspired by Henry Moore's textiles, had colour and energy, an instantly desirable silhouette \u2013 and, of course, those trench coats, which are as much a status symbol as a Rolex these days. It was a fashion-crowd pleaser but also, as Green said \u2013 and this, presumably, is as high as praise gets from Green \u2013 \"very wearable, very commercial\". For a label whose heritage is as British as a wet bank holiday weekend, the Indonesian and African references in the prints and beading were a surprise. Bailey was at pains to explain that the message was in the craftsmanship, not the multiculturalism. \"I love the contradiction between the digital world, of which we at Burberry are a part, and these hugely time-consuming crafts which rely on skilled people,\" he explained backstage after the show, in brief air pockets between air kisses with supermodels and guy-hugs with rock stars. \"Both of those things are part of Burberry, and today I wanted to bring them together.\" With the fashion industry moving so fast it is trickier than ever for designers without the muscle of Burberry to keep themselves in the frame. But Christopher Kane, who celebrates five years at London fashion week, has hit upon a strategy that works. There is no logo on his clothes, nor any overarching aesthetic threading collections together. Each season is a short story, complete in its own right. For spring 2012, the heroine is \"the girl you hated at school, because she got all the boys\" and her look is a netball-court silhouette, in luxurious pastel brocades so densely woven with silver they glittered like a sequinned dress at a school prom. All traces of last season's futuristic mermaid were banished. Kane's approach is smart on two counts. Instead of pouring his creativity into building a brand signature, he has made a label at which creativity itself is what the Christopher Kane brand is about. The DNA of the label is inside his head, from where no hostile takeover can annexe it. And his fans \u2013 whose numbers swell every season \u2013 are motivated to buy a piece every season, because each collection offers something new. The new black, at London fashion week, is business sense.",
