  "content": "Jarvis Cocker built a career out of sharp observations that strike a chord: it's no surprise he's still capable of it. \"Music's changed,\" he said in a wide-ranging Guardian interview this week. \"It's more like a scented candle.\" It's a lovely phrase, and echoes an argument I've been hearing for years now, that for young listeners music isn't as important as it used to be. Something else \u2013 a new technology, from Sega Mega Drives in the 90s to Facebook today \u2013 has stolen the pop culture spotlight. It feels true, but is it? According to Jenny Owen, of youth research agency Ruby Pseudo, it's half-right but it confuses a casual attitude with a lack of importance. The history of music is laid out digitally for kids to browse at leisure: \"There is no franticness to their consumption,\" she tells me. \"They're fans, not freaks.\" But once young people do find a favourite song, their attachment is just as fierce: \"Music is music,\" says Owen, \"and kids are kids.\" So if individual attachment to music is just as strong, what's changed? If you flip Cocker's argument, it's our generation \u2013 his and mine \u2013 that looks odd. The intense focus of our fandom was a function of scarcity \u2013 finding the only copy of an album in your local backwoods Our Price; listening to disappointing records hundreds of times because you'd spent big money on them. And rather than wax nostalgic about the music we listened to, we fetishise these rituals of scarcity. We've become the pop equivalent of a cargo cult confusing planes with the goods they brought. That's not to say the changes aren't real. Technological shifts alter the ways we listen, but not always in obvious directions. In his entertaining and mistitled book How the Beatles Destroyed Rock'n'Roll, historian Elijah Wald explores how every time a way of listening comes to seem natural, technology undermines it. He discusses, for instance, how one initial driver of the LP format was mood music. In its day, the LP was an unwelcome innovation, reviled by some fans as a biz-driven rip-off. Collections of themed songs or instrumental exotica showed off how good albums were in sustaining a mood. This was scented-candle listening if anything is, but its demonstration of the LP's power helped establish the format in time for the rock era, with its concentrated individual exploration of music. That in turn created a market for headphone listening, which turned into portable headphone listening, which dovetailed with the age of \"multitasking\" Cocker talks about. All these shifts seem logical with hindsight: all had significant, unintended effects on the culture of music. If teenagers now feel that a grazing, sharing, friend- and cloud-driven way of relating to music is the norm, it's a safe bet that something will come along to upend it. Individual ways of listening change, but how about the public's relation to music? Owen's \"fans not freaks\" phrase captures something important. Back when music fandom required major pocket money investment, it became a hobby, in competition with others: Airfix, football, stamp collecting. This hobbyist element \u2013 the \"freaks\" who stand out because of the proportion of their time and money they invest in music \u2013 may be dwindling. But it was never large. Cocker, like me and many others, misses the days when the singles chart seemed to matter. But that chart played a dual role. It reflected, on a good day, the music fans loved, but it was also a colossal pop-culture seismograph, easily overloaded by film soundtracks, comedians, dead princesses and the like. Those things could get more people buying music at once than even the hottest song could. The people who were really into music \u2013 who defined themselves by it \u2013 were a minority. To love music was to find yourself perpetually embattled \u2013 by people who don't get it, by people who relate intensely to music you can't stand, by the cruel forces of marketing that could \u2013 for example \u2013 send Robson &amp; Jerome to No 1 instead of Common People. If it's this public dimension of music that's fading in importance, is that such a bad thing?",
