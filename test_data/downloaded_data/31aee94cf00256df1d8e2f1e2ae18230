  "content": "It was targeted by the US Marines, vetoed by decades-old Japanese election law, and now Twitter has been ruled out by officials at the US Open. \"Important. Player Notice. Twitter Warning\" signs have gone up in the players' lounge and locker rooms that say: \"Many of you will have Twitter accounts in order for your fans to follow you and to become more engaged in you and the sport \u2013 and this is great ... However popular it is, it is important to warn you of some of the dangers posed by Twittering as it relates to the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program Rules.\" The move has not gone down well with the many players who have found that the social networking site has gone someway to alleviate the boredom of the tennis circuit. Andy Roddick, who more typically uses Twitter to tell fans he is meeting up with Elton John on 31 November \u2013 he later realised that the month is only 30 days long \u2013 has taken particular umbrage. He wrote: \"I think it's lame the US Open is trying to regulate our tweeting ... I understand the on-court issue but not sure they can tell us if we can.\" Later he added: \"I definitely respect the rule about inside info and on court, but you would seriously have to be a moron to send 'inside info' through a tweet.\" Moron or not, it was effectively what the Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes did when he revealed on Twitter that he had been dropped for the third Ashes test. Others, such as footballer Darren Bent, have apparently found the site suited to raging about the boss. Or, in Lance Armstrong's case, their rival (no doubt others have found Twitter a useful tool in keeping close tabs on their competitors). Or, in Andy Murray's case, the drug testers. Not everyone uses Twitter to get something off their chest, of course. Serena Williams \u2013 who with nearly a million followers is a grand slam champion user of the site \u2013 finds it helps as a memory jog.",
