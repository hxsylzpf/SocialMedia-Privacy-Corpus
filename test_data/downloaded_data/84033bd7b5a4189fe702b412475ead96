Wearing my Twitter shirt. Photograph: lu_lu/Flickr/Some rights reserved But what next? Apart from the pressure to finally start making money this year, the brevity and ubiquity of Twitter will start seeping into established web features, predicts Rachel Cunliffe on Mashable. Feedback sections of blogs will start to include 'Tweetbacks', which could show the number of times the links had been forwarded via Twitter (that would be complicated by URL shorteners though, like TinyURL) or mixing Tweet comments with regular comments. Twitter will become a staple part of the 'share this link' tab, and stats like 'most Tweeted' will become part of the sidebar. Lastly, she predicts that Tweets will move out of their owners' sidebar and into the main blog feed, just like Tumblr. Other blog conventions, like links to favourite bloggers or sidebar tools, will also start to give Twitter users a higher profile. It seems inevitable that blogs will become more 'Twittercentric'. What seemed an impossibly brief method of communicating - just 140 characters - is actually much of the appealof Twitter in our information-saturated online routine. What is important, however, is that Tweets retain their context. This is essentially a communication tool rather than a publishing method, and as such each message is typically part of a longer conversation. I wouldn't welcome a return to the cluttered web forum format but if Tweets are to be included alongside standalone blog posts, they need to be contextualised.",
