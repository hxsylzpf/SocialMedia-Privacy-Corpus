  "content": "The event was particularly topical given what's happened with the referendum over the past week. I've felt quite overwhelmed and have read so much in the press and on social media it can be quite unsettling. This was a nice chance to step back from the headlines and look at the wider picture. Lydia Nicholas was fantastic. She summed up a lot of my thoughts on the destructive nature of social media bubbles \u2013 how we get our own thoughts reflected back at us and are never challenged. She referred to the filter bubble becoming \"heartbreakingly real\" this week \u2013 something which I totally agree with. I work in digital marketing so social media is part of my everyday life. Since the event I've consciously tried to take a step back. Before the referendum, my Facebook feed was 100% about how staying in the EU was the obvious thing to do. Now it is a bit more nuanced but there's still not a wide range of opinions. It's interesting to imagine what other networks of people are feeling, which is why Lydia's points really resonated. There was a discussion about the volume of information now available and the paradox of how this leads to less trust in experts or data. People are making decisions based purely on emotion as a reaction to the overwhelming number of opinions, facts and untruths they face everyday. Having more access to information is actually causing people to make more knee-jerk decisions. Technology is also affecting the way we work. Paul Mason gave an interesting example of how automation is affecting education. There's already software for spotting plagiarism and it won't be long before computers will be able to grade papers. This is widening the education gap, meaning there will be fewer jobs for people moving up into the middle classes. There will be highly skilled jobs working on artificial intelligence but fewer in administration, for example. While there's no obvious solution, the panel said children need to be taught to consider things critically. But that's a solution for the next generation. There's still a whole population that is overwhelmed with views and opinions \u2013 and will always find someone who agrees with them. Lydia mentioned how studies show that people who start relationships online are more likely to end up with someone aligned to their beliefs. That's a concern, and goes back to us all reinforcing our own beliefs through social media. Ruth lives in Brighton and works in digital strategy. She has a degree in photography and an MA in cultural and critical theory. The event was chaired by by the Guardian's special projects editor, Mark Rice-Oxley. On the panel were writer and broadcaster Paul Mason, research fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute Anders Sandberg, digital anthropologist Lydia Nicholas, and writer and broadcaster Gaia Vince.
