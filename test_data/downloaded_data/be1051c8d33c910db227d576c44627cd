The editor of the Independent was attacked by the Daily Mirror's editor, Piers Morgan, for an \"extraordinary clarion call to actively seek further shackles on our already massively over-manacled press freedom\". And Roger Alton, the editor of the Observer, quipped that Kelner should be \"taken out and shot\" for his remarks. Morgan said: \"I haven't been so disturbed by a series of public utterances since David Icke appeared on Wogan. \"Mr Kelner needs to work out rather quickly whether his extraordinary clarion call to actively seek further shackles on our already massively over-manacled press freedom sits easily with his position as a national newspaper editor - particularly one called the Independent. The Mirror editor was reacting to remarks made by Kelner last night to the culture select commitee, which is investigating the power of the press complaints commission to protect the privacy of the public. Kelner is an outspoken critic of the PCC and believes that it \"cosies up to the rich and powerful\" and that Ofcom should be given a \"court of appeal\" role. He told the committee yesterday he believed this would help demonstrate the independence of the PCC. His view is completely at odds with other editors. Paul Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail, has said regulation by any organisation funded by the government would be \"repugnant and impractical\". Morgan is also in favour of retaining self-regulation: \"Broadsheet newspapers don't like the PCC because it reacts sensibly and unhysterically to stories involving tabloid newspapers, rather than publishing endless leader articles about what ghastly uncontrollable sub-human imbeciles we all are, compiled over fresh organic lychees and chilled carrot juice in Islington cafes by middle-aged poets in clogs. I look forward to responding more fully to Mr Kelner when I give evidence next week.\" Despite his initial light-hearted reaction, Alton firmly believes a role for Ofcom spells the end of press freedom. The Observer editor has just been appointed to the PCC following the resignation of Neil Wallis, the editor of the People. \"That's [a role for Ofcom] totally wrong. We absolutely don't want it. We don't want the PCC under some statutory body. We either have self-regulation or we don't. It works very well. \"If newspaper editors want more statutory control, then we are all doomed. That's such a bad idea,\" he added. Giving evidence to a Commons' inquiry into privacy and press intrusion, Kelner called for a court of appeal to the press complaints commission which is accessible to ordinary people, and suggested that this could come under the umbrella of Ofcom. However, he made it clear that he was not in favour of any further statutory regulation of the press. \"My point is a narrow point in that while I'm fully supportive of self-regulation and believe that not to have a regulated press and not to have a privacy law is one of the fundaments of a free press, I do feel that for ordinary members of the public there needs to be come court of appeal and I'm open minded as to how that's set up. I wouldn't have a serious problem if it was under the umbrella of Ofcom,\" Kelner said today.",
