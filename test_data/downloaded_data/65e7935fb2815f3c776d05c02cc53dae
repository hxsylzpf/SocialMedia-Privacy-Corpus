  "content": "Eat Tweet, by Maureen Evans, is the world's first Twitter cookbook, containing 1,200 recipes each written in 140 characters of twitterese, as dictated by the microblogging site. They're cute to look at, stuffed with pleasingly graphic symbols such as @, &amp;, &lt;, / and ~, but a challenge to decipher, featuring as they do abbreviations such as rmv, mltdbuttr, s+p, srcrm, bkgpdr, simmr and rdwine, to say nothing of waxytater. Then there's that mysterious measurement \u2013 if you're British \u2013 the cup. If I tweeted, a pastime that I have regrettably yet to indulge in, I might feel obliged to contribute the following: \"&gt;1000 dishs in 1 ckbk good/hvng 2 trnslt rcpes b4 can use bad. sry this looks like lots mor fun 4 u than 4 me &amp; how bigs a bldy cup anyway?\" Sorry.",
