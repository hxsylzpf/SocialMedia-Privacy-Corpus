So its no surprise that identifying the best social media platform to engage with this much sought after demographic has become a Holy Grail for the marketing world. Unfortunately, having meaningful dialogue with kids and young people online can often be as challenging as that epic religious quest. The first question for the knights of brand marketing and consumer trends is where to find young people? Just a few years ago the answer was pretty simple: gallop over to Facebook, set up a brand group and wait for over 13-year olds to arrive. Back then the novelty of being a brand on Facebook, often accompanied with freebies and other promotional offers, was enough to generate legions of likes. That was when the kids were still keen on The Book. As Facebook's own data attests, young people are no longer so enamoured of the big daddy of social networks and are seeking new online destinations. Certainly many, many millions of young people still maintain a Facebook presence but it's clear that a generation native to living through mobile phones are embracing social platforms geared to that fast-paced, more disposable mobile experience like Instagram, Vine and Snapchat along with closed network messaging services like Kik, Line and Whatsapp. These platforms offer new opportunities for brands but they also present challenges in terms of analysing and learning from young people's social media activity. \"The truth is that few companies are availing themselves of the opportunity to understand their customers, young or old, using social media and big data. They are thinking in old models, using old research approaches, and not in a customer-first mindset where they can realise the opportunity to get close to the people that matter most to them,\" says Antony Mayfield, director of digital strategy agency, Brilliant Noise. So how can brands use social networks and platforms in a responsible yet effective manner to obtain the insight they crave about youth trends and what young people think about their products? One way is to create a dedicated and closed social media community centred around a brand experience. Brands catering to children under 10, such as Moshi Monsters and Disney's Club Penguin use safe-space communities to chat with kids, offer tips and advice and, in turn, learn what kids really think of their products. \"When it comes to safeguarding children online, best practice dictates there are no shortcuts,\" says Dominic Sparkes, CEO at Tempero an agency that specialises in moderating social media content for companies. He explains that clear guidelines and policies are critical, as are experienced, CRB-checked moderators to implement and manage the process. Pre-moderation (reviewing content before it is publicly available) is often preferable, and escalation policies should be in place should a child disclose information regarding their safety. Some of the most successful brand efforts to connect with young people through social media have coalesced around a specific social issue or cause. Last year Microsoft, through its citizenship sustainability initiative, launched Youthspark, a three-year online programme to create opportunities for 300 million young people. In the US, Procter &amp; Gamble' s Secret deodorant brand launched Mean Stinks, a social media driven campaign against bullying. Part call to action, part education resource and part a way of gauging and cataloging the way teenage girls are bullied, Mean Stinks established its own aggregated online hub of tweets, Instagram photos, YouTube videos and even Google+ hangout chats to build a concerned community of over two million people. While utilising social media to advocate a youth-oriented cause is laudable, things get more complicated for brands when they try to engage young people online to gain pure brand or business insight. Not only do they run the risk of appearing un-authentic, they also risk using social media for youth data mining, which raises obvious moral issues. In this case Sparkes suggest companies look to the non-profit sector for best practice in engaging young people to help business goals. He cites the NSPCC (a client of Tempero) which has used social media to encourage interaction to help develop the charity's website and canvass opinion about its activities. \"In their case the campaigns were fun, useful and sensitive to data protection,\" says Sparkes. Ultimately social media platforms are only as good as the way they are used. Which is why, whether it's a Facebook page, a bespoke social community, Instagram feed or any other platform, creating an environment where the members feel comfortable conversing with each other is crucial to gaining the respect of that community. It's also where the best insight can be gained. Matthew Yeomans is the founder of the Social Media Sustainability Index. Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.
