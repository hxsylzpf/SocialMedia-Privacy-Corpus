  "content": "The Daily Sport is to publish a front-page apology and pay substantial libel damages to Desperate Housewives star Teri Hatcher after publishing \"grossly defamatory\" allegations about her private life. Hatcher's lawyer told a high court judge that an article headlined \"Teri's Passion Wagon\" published in the tabloid newspaper on July 25 had been \"entirely false, deeply offensive and utterly without foundation\". The story falsely claimed that the actor had regular sex with a series of men in a van parked outside her home. The allegations were repeated in full in a second article published on August. Hatcher's solicitor advocate Simon Smith told Mr Justice Tugendhat the allegations were \"extremely insulting\". \"The truth is that the claimant is a proud single mother to her seven-year-old daughter and naturally finds extremely insulting the lurid suggestion that she neglects her daughter in order to have regular sex with a series of men in a van parked outside her home. Such allegations are without any substance at all,\" he said. Hatcher began libel proceedings against the Sport last month. Today Mr Smith said the paper had agreed to publish a prominent front-page retraction and to apologise for the \"deep distress and acute embarrassment\" caused by its allegations. \"The defendant has also agreed to pay very substantial damages to the claimant for the libel and to reimburse the claimant's legal costs in full,\" he added. David Hirst, counsel for the Sport, told the judge it accepted the articles were entirely false. \"The defendant received the story from a source who it trusted, who in turn read the allegation elsewhere. The defendant was not alone in publishing the allegations, but accepts that this does not relieve it of liablity for its own publication,\" he said. In a statement, Hatcher said she had tolerated \"many ridiculous and fabricated lies and gossip in the tabloids\" but felt she had to draw the line at accusations of irresponsible parenting. \"I will never allow any tabloid to so egregiously attack the area of my life which I give top priority, and that is my parenting,\" she said. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
