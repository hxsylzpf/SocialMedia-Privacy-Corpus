  "content": "Executives at the Daily Mirror have criticised Clarence House after Prince William's girlfriend Kate Middleton lodged her first complaint with the Press Complaints Commission. Yesterday, Ms Middleton complained to the PCC, saying a photograph in the Daily Mirror had been obtained as a result of harassment. The photograph was taken by one of a number of paparazzi that followed Ms Middleton, 25, while she was on her way to work and was printed in the Mirror yesterday. A senior executive on the Mirror criticised the way the matter had been handled, pointing the finger at Clarence House, the royal household for Princes William and Harry and also Prince Charles. \"There had been no contact since the original problem with pictures of Kate Middleton [on her birthday],\" the executive said. \"Clarence House have handled this in a provocative way.\" Clarence House has no formal links with Ms Middleton, who used the law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis to lodge her complaint with the PCC. It is believed that Middleton's lawyers demanded that they should be contacted if the Mirror were considering using any Kate Middleton pictures in the future. A Daily Mirror spokesman said: \"We will provide the necessary thoughts and comments to the PCC. We will not be commenting any further at this stage.\" The PCC said in a statement yesterday: \"The Press Complaints Commission has today received a formal complaint from Kate Middleton that a photograph of her in today's Daily Mirror was obtained as a result of harassment in breach of clause 4 (harassment) of the code of practice. \"The complaint will now be investigated in the normal way and the commission will not be making any further statement on the subject until the matter has been dealt with.\" Yesterday's complaint represents a tougher stance on the part of Ms Middleton and her lawyers. Previously they have relied on private appeals to newspaper editors. The Mirror ran the story on page 22 with a photograph that showed Ms Middleton on a footpath carrying her handbag and a cup of coffee, with a caption: \"Smouldering: Kate heading for work yesterday\". Yesterday's story detailed the prince's alleged \"laddish escapades\" with several women at a Bournemouth nightclub and speculated that the incidents had led to her looking \"stoney-faced\" as she made her way to work. The Mirror then advised the 25-year-old to \"give him hell - just go easy on the crown jewels\". Ms Middleton instructed her lawyers to act two months after her law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis wrote a \"last warning\" letter to newspapers editors after the paparazzi scrum outside her flat on her 25th birthday. At least 20 photographers and five TV crews were in attendance, some of whom followed her down the street. As a result, the Sun and the News of the World have banned the use of paparazzi pictures of Ms Middleton, as has Hello! magazine. \"She wants to be left alone to get on with her life,\" a source close to Ms Middleton said. \"There's no excuse for not knowing the harassment she has been suffering. \"Over the past few days she has had some serious aggression from them. \"She has been chased all over the land both to and from work every moment of the day, both on foot and in cars.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
