  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission chair, Baroness Buscombe, has claimed the organisation would have helped stop publication of allegations that Ryan Giggs had an affair with a former reality TV star. Buscombe appeared to make a bid for the newspaper industry's self-regulatory body to become a solution to the thorny issue over how the government can resolve the injunction crisis. Buscombe told BBC2's Newsnight that if Giggs had asked for the PCC's help it would have stopped newspapers publishing the story. She was speaking late on Monday after an MP used parliamentary privilege earlier to name Giggs as the footballer identified on Twitter as having secured an injunction to prevent publication of allegations regarding his private life. The injunction remains in place, despite the media reporting that MP John Hemming had named the footballer in the Commons. On Monday evening, shortly after Hemming had spoken in parliament, Mr Justice Tugendhat ruled in the high court that \"this is not about secrecy this is about intrusion\". Tugendhat added that even if the level of protection now offered was limited, it was still potentially worthwhile: \"If a court can stop one person or five people [from harassing the player] \u2013 not 50,000 \u2013 is there not something to be achieved?\" The Newsnight presenter, Gavin Esler, questioned the authority of the PCC, the newspaper industry's self-regulatory body, and said to Buscombe: \"You couldn't have helped Ryan Giggs.\" However, she replied: \"We could have ... If he'd come to us, as people do every day. We have people coming to us all the time to ask us to stop information being published. We have an almost 100% success rate in that. \"We've had a desist notice going out this evening. I can't give you the details of that. The press will not publish what we've asked them to refrain from in tomorrow's press.\" Esler added: \"But I still don't understand what you'd have done for Ryan Giggs, would you have told them not to publish and they'd have agreed?\" Buscombe said: \"Yes. Yes and that's what we do. They do agree all the time ... and that is something where maybe in the past the PCC has not been good enough at explaining itself.\" Esler then said: \"You are telling us the Sun would not have published this story because the PCC would have told them not to?\" Buscombe responded: \"No. The whole point is we would have talked to them about the whole issue of public interest. That is what is so important in all these cases. We stop the press if we think they're interfering with people's privacy where the bar of public interest has not been met we stop them ... intrusion into grief, health issues.\" A spokeswoman for the Sun declined to comment on whether or not it would have agreed not to publish if the PCC had requested it. Esler challenged Buscombe, saying: \"If Ryan Giggs has access to some of the brightest lawyers in the country and he chose to go down this route, that's a vote of absolutely no confidence in you because otherwise he would've used you.\" Buscombe responded: \"Many more people are using us than are going to the courts. We dealt with 600 privacy complaints in the last year.\" Esler then said: \"If there's someone worried about a kiss and tell issue tonight and they contact the PCC it'll all be fine?\" Buscombe replied: \"It depends on the whole issue. Most of the time when we get issues like that coming to us we send out a desist notice and we say to the press, 'Look, there's an issue here, you may be in breach of the code, you got those photographs by harassment, you've got an issue to do with the privacy of that family, hold back' and they do. \"But I can't talk about those cases because they're private and we actually are being effective where the law is failing at the moment ... David Cameron has just been talking how effective we are.\" The prime minister reiterated his belief that one potential way to deal with the issues surrounding privacy and freedom of speech would be to \"look again at the Press Complaints Commission\", in an interview broadcast by ITV1's Daybreak on Monday, before Giggs was named in parliament. \"If people can have more confidence in [the PCC] then we can have less of this current approach,\" Cameron said. However, speaking on Tuesday on Radio 4's The World at One, the Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger agreed that because the PCC was \"pathetic\" over the issue of phone hacking, \"people are pretty sceptical when Peta Buscombe says, 'Come to the PCC and not the courts', but it's a chance for the PCC to show that they've got some teeth.\" Rusbridger also said the PCC has to decide if it is a \"regulator or a mediator\". He added: \"As Nick Clegg said this morning, you either have to change the rules for the judges, which means parliament are going to have to have a proper discussion about privacy or you're going to have to accept the sort of twin or triple track situation that we've got at the moment.\" Rusbridger pointed out that the problem with suggestions that a privacy law be created is that it could have far-reaching constitutional consequences, ultimately leading to Britain having to leave \"the Council of Europe, which means, in the view of some QCs, that we'd have to leave Europe itself\". When EsFormer deputy prime minister John Prescott \u2013 whose affair with one of his secretaries was exposed in the press in 2006 \u2013 challenged the PCC's usefulness on Newsnight. During a heated exchange with Buscombe, he said: \"Instead of the judges making a decision about what is the right of privacy and public and freedom it's the editors. Who the hell are the editors to make that judgment and attack the judges for doing that ... and you've got no control over the editors ... you're useless.\" Buscombe replied: \"We're not useless. We've helped you.\" She added: \"The whole point about the PCC is we're a fast, free service for the public. Our focus is on the public and we're more active on privacy issues.\" Buscombe said the newspaper industry's self-regulatory body has sent out around 100 desist notices within the last few months. The PCC received \"well over\" 7,000 complaints from celebrities and members of the public last year, according to its annual report, published earlier this month. Any move to beef up the PCC's role is likely to focus on the editors' code of practice, which the self-regulatory body enforces and journalists are expected to abide by. The code has sections on privacy and harassment. The privacy guidelines state editors \"will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the complainants own public disclosures of information\". The code is reviewed periodically by the editor's code of practice committee. The committee is independent of the PCC and is made up of editors from national and regional newspapers and the magazine sector and chaired by the Daily Mail editor, Paul Dacre. Meanwhile, Giles Coren, who was named by Hemming as the journalist and BBC television presenter who used Twitter to make a joke referring to a different footballer who has also taken out an injunction, told The World at One that he did not believe he had broken the law. \"As far as I can see... an injunction prevents newspapers from publishing things that courts don't want them to publish. I didn't write it in the Times, I didn't write it in my newspaper,\" said Coren. \"I didn't mean to become a martyr for free speech, I was a martyr for smutty gags.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
