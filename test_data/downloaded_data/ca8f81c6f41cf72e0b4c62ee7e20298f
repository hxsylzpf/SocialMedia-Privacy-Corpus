  "content": "An investor group involving the chief executive of games publisher Activision Blizzard, Bobby Kotick, is in advanced talks to acquire a controlling stake in News Corporation's troubled social network Myspace, according to reports. Kotick's involvement, reported on the Wall Street Journal blog All Things D, would be as an individual investor and not on behalf of Activision Blizzard, which is controlled by French media and entertainment conglomerate Vivendi. He would not take a management role in the new company. Universal Music, part of the Vivendi group, is an investor in Myspace Music, which streams songs online. Under the terms of the proposed deal News Corp is understood to want to retain a 20% stake in MySpace, which remains the number two social networking site after Facebook, but with far fewer users. In April, Facebook drew nearly 700 million users, while the Myspace following fell to 77 million. Kotick is the latest in a string of names to be linked to MySpace, after News Corp appointed investment bank Allen &amp; Co to look at strategic options for the business in March. Vevo, the music video venture owned by Vivendi's Universal Music, Sony Music and the Abu Dhabi Media Company, was reported to be in talks. Talks with other potential bidders, including Myspace founder Chris DeWolfe, current chief executive Mike Jones and several private equity firms are reported to have \"not worked out\". Activision Blizzard is an online and console game publisher that makes Guitar Hero, Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, as well as games for film franchises including Spider-Man, X-Men, Shrek and James Bond. In January Myspace cut 500 jobs, nearly half its workforce, and handed responsibility for UK advertising and sponsorship to News Corp company Fox Networks. Facebook overtook Myspace as the leading social network in the US in May 2009, and that summer it cut about 1,100 jobs and closed some of its international offices.",
