It's quite simple, according to Siva Yam, the president of the US-China Chamber of Commerce, which principally represents the interests of American companies in China. \"As long as you aren't involved in politics, the media or pornography, the government will leave you alone.\" His words come after Google and 30 other western companies were targeted by hackers who tried to obtain program codes and access the emails of political activists. Google has declined to say 'one way or the other' whether it believes the attacks were sponsored or supported by the state. Eric Schmidt, the chairman and chief executive of Google, had insisted that the company should set up inside the country in order to get the maximum benefit and to open up the regime there, and accept the compromise of self-censorship or government blocking \u2013 which it did in 2006. Sergey Brin, its Russian-born co-founder, disliked the compromise, according to a report last week in the Wall Street Journal. After the latest series of attacks, Brin has clearly prevailed. Finger-pointing Some have suggested that Google wasn't making enough money in China \u2013 it trailed far behind Baidu, the domestic leader \u2013 and that its post about censorship and hacking was a cover for an entirely business-based withdrawal. But Nick Carr, whose book The Big Switch details how our lives are moving online, says that it is key for Google's long-term strategy that people trust the net completely, and that anything which undermines that endangers Google, long term. Hence its finger-pointing at China for the hacking: the Chinese market is less valuable to Google than the rest of the world market. The likely consequence is that Google will be kicked out for failing to censor its content. Yet some echo Yam's view, and are confident that China is not a quagmire for western media companies. Dan Serfaty, the chief executive and founder of Viadeo \u2013 which owns what it claims is China's largest social network, Tianji.com (which has about 2 million users) \u2013 says: \"The future for digital media in China is still bright. It's a huge economy with a huge population and increasing global influence. Will Google stay? Who knows, but it won't really affect the country's online development.\" With 450m TV sets and 384 million people online, China is a very juicy-looking media target. Added to which, its government is very gradually altering its media landscape: it is cutting down the subsidies it pays to home-grown media companies, meaning that to expand rapidly they have to bring in western partners. And there are still plenty of western media companies there. Yahoo, Microsoft's Bing search engine and Hotmail email, along with MySpace, are all accessible in China; Microsoft and MySpace have offices there. (Though there is a Facebook.cn page \u2013 suggesting it is registered in China \u2013 it reroutes back to the main Facebook.com site, based in the US. Similarly Twitter.cn has been registered by Twitter, but isn't active.) The most visible presence though is Rupert Murdoch's Star TV, the Hong Kong-based company that he bought in 1993 \u2013 though at the time, with Hong Kong still in British hands, he declared that satellite TV networks posed \"an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere\". China's leaders clearly took note and ordered the removal of the BBC's TV feed from the Star TV menu. The alternative for Murdoch was having the signal blocked and Star TV frozen out of the Chinese domestic market. News Corporation has made repeated concessions in the rest of the world to keep China happy, with the benefit that would-be western rivals have been kept out: Disney, which has been trying to get its content on to Chinese TV screens for years, is still limited to a few blocks of programmes on local TV stations. It did announce last November that it will set up an amusement park \u2013 though it will only own 40% of it. \"Local knowledge is imperative,\" says Serfaty. \"Google is a US firm and history has proven that foreign businesses in China always struggle. If [Tianji] wasn't Chinese, run by Chinese staff with Chinese ethics and etiquette, then it would have struggled too.\" But another opinion, repeatedly heard, is that China does not want to open itself up to western influence or ownership. Mark Kitto's recent book China Cuckoo describes how he built up a successful listings magazine business with a turnover of \u00a32.5m \u2013 only to lose it all to his former partner, a state-run firm. \"What Google has gone through sounds awfully familiar,\" he says. \"A lot of people tell me that since my problem \u2013 or personal disaster \u2013 it's much better and it wouldn't happen now. I think it's got much worse and Google is a perfect example. The fundamental problem is that the Chinese government is never going to allow any kind of free market economics to operate within the media. Ever.\" Jeremy Goldkorn of Beijing-based danwei.org, a partner of the Guardian, has had his media website blocked in China since July last year. (Within China, the letters \"danwei.org\" in any URL lead to a page saying \"Connection Reset\".) So is coming to China a doomed endeavour for media firms? \"I don't think it's doomed,\" says Goldkorn. \"I do think it's handicapped, castrated and crippled. It doesn't matter whether it's print, TV, internet or movies \u2013 foreign companies can make money but it's very difficult. There are enough regulations in China that potentially anything you do is illegal. If you annoy anybody, a competitor or a regulatory body, they can take you down. The environment is terrible here.\" He notes, however, that Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, and Cond\u00e9 Nast, the owner of Vogue, are both doing well; Google had been \"making a go of it \u2013 they weren't tremendously successful by their global standards but they weren't failing\". The most successful, he thinks, is the publisher IDG: \"If anyone has made a ton of money it's probably them. They've been here since the 80s.\" Strategic reasons Kaiser Kuo, a Beijing-based technology watcher, says: \"Commercial success is possible if you keep your heads down and play by the rules.\" But \"there hasn't been a single unequivocal success I can point to. There are a combination of regulatory and commercial and strategic reasons. I wouldn't say abandon hope all ye who enter here.\" There are also the problems of adapting to a very different market. The News Corporation-owned social network MySpace, Kuo points out, struggled to figure out what its \"animating idea\" was, given that the indie music scene which first propelled it to fame in the US doesn't exist in the same way in China. The reality is that media companies operating in China have either to self-censor \u2013 or they will be censored. In the past year YouTube, Facebook and Twitter \u2013 and their users \u2013 have reported that access to their sites has been blocked within China, notably after the riots in Xinjiang last July. It didn't matter whether the companies had servers inside China or not; the government, which controls the internet there, shut off access. As a tip for those looking to invest in China, the classic business book Beijing Jeep (subtitled The Short, Unhappy Romance of American Business in China) points out that people pressured by the Chinese authorities may mistakenly see the manoeuvrings against them as monolithic \u2013 when in fact they may just be getting squeezed between government bodies that are jockeying for position. Quite possibly the attacks against Google and other western companies have dismayed some part of the Chinese administration, but it is overshadowed by those parts which see benefit from hacking. But the problem with media is that ultimately they are about information. And as Kitto notes: \"Information is power and Google's business is giving information. The Communist Party of China wants to keep power. So you have a contradiction.\" The outcome of Google's Chinese business may show us how the contradiction is resolved. But the answer is probably clear already. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 January 2010. The original referred to \"government-sponsored\" hackers. This is not an accusation Google has made. China was also said in the original piece to have 300 million internet users. This figure has been newly updated.",
