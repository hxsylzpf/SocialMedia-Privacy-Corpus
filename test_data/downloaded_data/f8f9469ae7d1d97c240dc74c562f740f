  "content": "Actress Kate Winslet is to sue women's weekly Grazia over claims she visited a diet doctor in California. The magazine claimed Winslet had visited the Chinese Healing Institute in Santa Monica for help with neck pain and also to lose weight. But the 32-year-old Hollywood star said it was \"categorically untrue\" and was a \"complete lie\". \"I am very upset,\" she told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat programme. \"I am going to take legal action. I am not going to let a publication get away with writing something that is so completely untrue.\" She added she did not want people thinking she would \"ever go to a diet doctor\" as she had always spoken out on the issue. \"I know I am a role model to young women, it's a role I take very, very seriously,\" she said. \"I would never want anyone to think I was a hypocrite in doing something like going to a diet doctor.\" Winslet's agent, Sarah Keene, told the BBC the actress had met the doctor \"several years ago\" but for a \"completely separate issue\". Winslet, who has been nominated for an Oscar for her role in the film Little Children, recently criticised the \"size zero\" culture in the fashion industry. A Grazia spokeswoman said the matter was with the magazine's lawyers. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
