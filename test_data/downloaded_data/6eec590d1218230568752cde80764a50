  "content": "Over the past two months, the unlocked iPhone has become the hi-tech equivalent of Bigfoot: chased around north America by geeks, but rarely seen and possibly completely fictitious. That all changed last week when Apple's flagship touchscreen mobile phone was finally hacked to run on any mobile network, not just America's AT&amp;T. The breakthrough came in the unlikely shape of New Jersey teenager George Hotz. Armed with a soldering iron and a suite of software, the 17-year-old became an instant celebrity when he managed to get his iPhone running with a T-Mobile Sim card. But his hack was daunting and dangerous - so it was no surprise when two other sources claimed they had easier alternatives. One website, iPhoneSimFree.com, said it had a working unlocking process. So far the only confirmation has come from the website Engadget, which claims to have seen it in action. Another group, Uniquephone, boasted that it would make an unlocking code public - before pulling out at the last minute, claiming legal pressure from AT&amp;T. Some pundits say they smell a rat, and it would not be surprising if these remain shrouded in mystery. There is, after all, plenty of reason for hackers to claim an iPhone; with gadget-hounds in Europe and the US desperate to use their existing Sim cards in an iPhone, the promise of easy unlocking could prove very lucrative indeed. But the prospect of a few dollars won't bother Hotz, who has already cashed in by auctioning off his hacked handset. \"I traded it for a sweet Nissan 350Z and three 8GB iPhones,\" he said, making the deal worth in the region of \u00a325,000. \"I leave for college tomorrow, and this has been a great end to a great summer.\" \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com",
