  "content": "The BBC is creating a \"crystal mark\" charter for the use of data on the web. The charter is due to be unveiled within a couple of months and will allow viewers to choose if they want the BBC to delete information the corporation has collected about them via websites such as the iPlayer. Speaking at the Oxford Media Convention, BBC director of policy and strategy John Tate said: \"Essentially it's like a crystal mark for the use of data on the web.\" He said that the charter will have a special logo and hopes that other media companies might use it. The BBC's research and development department is a \"couple of months away from having a version that is deployable\" said Tate, adding that one of the issues to be resolved is whether viewers will be given the choice of different levels of deletion. He reiterated that the BBC does not pass on the data to third parties and it is used to determine what kind of content people might want to watch. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
