So far we've heard from Politicalbaaba, The Frustrated Indian, the East India Comedy company, political novelist and blogger Krishan Partap Singh. Now we hear from Rohit Saxena, who blogs about politics at WahSarkar. Saxena, 28, lives in Toronto, Canada, but is from Noida near New Delhi and was born in Cochin, Kerala. While living in India he was involved in developing electoral reforms, He said: \"I had access to a lot of information on parliamentarians and political parties due to the nature of my job. While this was public information, few in the general public were accessing it. This was the main motivation for WahSarkar. I packaged this information in a way (often satirically) that made it consumable for India's growing internet users.\" What is the most important issue for you in the forthcoming election? One fifth of the current candidates are facing criminal convictions [according to research from the Association of Democratic Reforms]. This is the most important issue for me \u2013 it feeds into the larger issue of political parties being obsessed with winning and hence compromising on the quality of parliamentarians. Does it make a difference to you how active politicians are online? Yes, but India's internet penetration is still less than 15%. This will grow rapidly in the years ahead. Hence it is important for politicians to embrace the online world. That said, I would rather see technology being increasingly used in fields such as e-governance because the implications of that for the general public are far more beneficial. How would you like to see political parties using social media? For direct interaction with the electorate. There are still a lot of barriers between political party 'high commands' and the electorate. These can be broken down using social media. Who are the online voices in India that help provide an alternative perspective on the election?
