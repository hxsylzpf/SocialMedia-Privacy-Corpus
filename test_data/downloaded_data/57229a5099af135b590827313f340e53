  "content": "It would be fair to call Jim Gamble a divisive figure in the wider campaign to secure safety for children online. While you might think that every government agency and responsible company had the same goal in protecting children from sexual predators, and in addressing the far more widespread problem of cyberbullying, there were differing opinions on how that should be achieved. Gamble announced late last night that he is stepping down as chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre. The announcement isn't surprising, given that Gamble has spent months unsuccessfully maneuvering to reorganise Ceop as a non-departmental government body, or quango \u2013 rather than have it merged into the new National Crime Agency as the home secretary, Theresa May, has proposed. He has lost that argument, and is stepping down as a result. While Gamble was seen as a ferocious deterrent to predatory sexual behaviour online, his combative style was problematic for many of the industry figures he needed to negotiate with, and led to needlessly protracted wrangling with Facebook, for one, over his insistence that the Ceop logo and link be added to every page on the site. In the US, where Gamble did much of his lobbying, Family Online Safety Institute chief Stephen Balkam said: \"I welcome any change which brings about a more conciliatory atmosphere, that will encourage industry and colleagues to engage much more readily with Ceop.\" Ceop eventually took a more collaborative route with Facebook and introduced a child safety app. But the hope among campaigners is that a new Ceop chief could introduce a new era of more sophisticated and effective methods of educating and equipping children and parents to better navigate the internet, and that will be done far better by working with the industry's expertise rather than trying to steamroll the Ceop brand across it.",
