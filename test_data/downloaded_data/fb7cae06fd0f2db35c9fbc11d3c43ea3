The updated document says broadcasters should consult with children and their families before going into production, as well as helping ensure they do not suffer negative impacts after broadcast. The new section on social media says: \"Broadcasters should consider the impact of social media and the risk of bullying (including online bullying) on the child participant and take appropriate steps to advise the young person(s) and/or their parents/carers in advance of transmission. \"This advice might include guidance on privacy settings on social media sites and/or providing a designated contact to assist the young person/parents/carers with any media attention post-transmission.\" The new guidelines, which build on previous guidance published in 2007 and updated in 2009, are designed to give greater consideration to the psychological impact for people under 18 appearing on TV and radio \u2013 especially factual programming, as well as reflecting technological changes. They suggest broadcasters should consider carrying out risk assessments before, during and after the production process, and whether to bring in experts to help assess the impact participation could have on a child. The regulator said the changes were the result of consultation with a range of experts on child welfare and broadcasters as well as its own investigations into a number of shows such as reality TV programme Benefits Street and CBBC show Dick and Dom's Hoopla. The regulator received 23 complaints from viewers worried about the depiction of under-18s in Benefits Street, but did not find the programme in breach of its code. However, it deemed Dick and Dom's Hoopla to be in breach of its code for a segment in which two small children were \"encouraged to drink 'vile concoctions' in front of a live audience\". Tony Close, Ofcom director of content standards, licensing and enforcement, said: \"Ofcom takes the protection of children extremely seriously, whether they are viewers or listeners, or actively taking part in programmes. \"This guidance follows careful analysis of our past investigations and decisions. It's an important step in protecting the physical and emotional welfare as well as the dignity of children who take part, or are involved, in TV and radio programmes.\"",
