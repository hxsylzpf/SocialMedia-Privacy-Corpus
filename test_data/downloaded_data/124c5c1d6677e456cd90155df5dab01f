In a survey of 249 primary and secondary teachers in state and private schools across the UK nearly 10% say CCTV is operating in toilets, and almost a quarter worry that hidden cameras have been installed within the building. The survey, conducted by the Association of Teachers and Lectures (ATL), found that most of the CCTV cameras in schools cover the grounds and entrances to building, although 85% of schools have CCTV in their buildings. While more than half of teachers (52.9%) say they feel safer as a result of CCTV, the general consensus from the survey was that classroom surveillance is an invasion of privacy, disrupts education and leads to teachers feeling constantly watched and judged. An ATL working group is looking into the use of CCTV in schools and colleges and will produce best practice guidance at the end of the year. According to the survey, 97.6% of teachers feel CCTV is primarily used for security and monitoring vandalism around the building. However, half of the teachers reported that the surveillance is also present inside the school to monitor the behaviour of the pupils within school hours. Some 16% said it was used for controlling student behaviour, while 10.4% said CCTV was used to control truancy and 72.6% said it was used to monitor and control vandalism. Teachers are concerned that regular use of cameras in class would be intimidating, ATL found. But 42.3% thought that streaming CCTV footage over the internet for controlled groups such as parents was a \"useful development only to be used in limited circumstances\". Most teachers questioned believed that CCTV made them safer at school and 60.7% of teachers said CCTV could have positive uses, such as reducing the level of abuse against staff and students. Tonia Matthews, a teacher at Trinity secondary school in west Berkshire, said: \"Students feel secure to know that if there has been an incident, ie bullying, we can then go back and look what happened.\" Elaine Brown, from Portchester secondary school in Bournemouth, said the use of CCTV had \"helped to reduce bullying considerably\". However, more than half of the teachers involved in the survey thought the presence of CCTV cameras would not result in students behaving any differently. And nearly two-thirds of teachers surveyed did not know what security measures their school has for use of CCTV within their schools, and are not sure about the policies for restricting the use of surveillance data. Louise Davies, a teacher from a secondary school in Brighton, said: \"Where there is not a high level of trust, staff may have concerns that evidence may be gathered against them.\" Mary Bousted, ATL's general secretary, said: \"No one really knows enough about the use of CCTV in schools \u2013 it's a very new issue. \"Certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of CCTV in schools, and strict safeguards for its use. \"Although surveillance in schools can have some positive outcomes, such as discouraging vandalism and violence, we think there are some instances where it should be strictly controlled.\"",
