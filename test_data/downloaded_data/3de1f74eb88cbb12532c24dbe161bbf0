Responding to the Guardian's revelations, Andy Coulson issued a statement insisting he was unaware of any of the illegal activities that took place at the paper while he was editor: \"I took full responsibility at the time for what happened on my watch but without my knowledge.\" In an opening statement to the Commons culture select committee which was investigating phone hacking, Coulson said: \"I have never condoned the use of phone hacking and nor do I have any recollection of incidences where phone hacking took place.\" He was asked by committee member Janet Anderson MP: \"Do you believe that phone hacking is ever in the public interest?\" Coulson said: \"I do not, as I said, have any recollection of there being any instances... where it was used.\" In his opening statement to the committee Coulson also said he was unaware the paper's publisher, News International, had reached an out-of-court settlement with Gordon Taylor. \"I have no knowledge of a News International settlement with Gordon Taylor,\" he said. Asked by MPs about the paper's coverage of Gordon Taylor during his time as editor of the paper, Coulson replied: \"I do not recall ever commissioning a Gordon Taylor news story... I never read a Gordon Taylor story, to the best of my recollection.\" Paul Farrelly MP asked Coulson about Operation Motormouth, an investigation carried out by the information commissioner into the activities of private investigator Steve Whittamore. It found that journalists had been using him to obtain information about public figures illegally. \"Were you aware of any relationship between the News of the World and Stephen Whittamore?\" Farrelly asked. Coulson replied: \"As for the involvement of individual News of the World journalists, I knew very little about that.\" Pressed by Farrelly about whether he was aware that News of the World journalists were using Whittamore's services, Coulson said: \"I do not recall any conversations specifically about Whittamore.\" Plaid Cymru MP Adam Price asked about a News of the World story published on page seven of an edition of the paper during Coulson's editorship, which referred to a message left on Prince Harry's phone. \"It also appeared on the front in an inset\", Price said. \"Are you saying that... you as an editor of a national newspaper... would not have checked the provenance of that story?\" Coulson said: \"Not necessarily, no, and I do not remember the story... I can only tell you what I remember, and I do not remember the story at all.\" Coulson was asked about the relationship between Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator used by the News of the World, and the relationship Mulcaire's companies, which included Nine Consultancy, had with the paper. Tom Watson, Labour MP for West Bromwich East, said: \"Did it surprise you that Mulcaire had worked for the company since the late 1990s?\" Coulson said: \"I do not remember when I first learned about Nine Consultancy... and I do not have any recollection of the other companies either.\" Tom Watson MP asked Coulson whether, following inquiries he made after Mulcaire's arrest, he could remember when Mulcaire first started working for the News of the World. \"I am afraid not, no,\" Coulson said. Labour MP Mike Hall wondered how Coulson could be sure that Goodman was the only News of the World reporter engaged in phone hacking, asking: \"How can you be so certain if you were not aware of the Goodman case, which has reached the public domain, that there were not others.\" Coulson answered: \"I only know what I know.\" \"There is a distinct possibility that there are lots of other things you don't know about,\" Hall observed. Coulson responded by revealing he had his own phone hacked. \"I clearly did not know what Glenn Mulcaire was up to.\" Coulson conceded he was aware the paper had a \u00a3100,000 contract with Mulcaire but said he was unaware Mulcaire was receiving extra payments from the News of the World's former royal editor Clive Goodman. \"The cash arrangements with Clive Goodman I knew nothing about.\" He was asked by Tory MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the committee, about a contract between Mulcaire and the News of the World's former assistant editor Greg Miskiw \"to find a story about Gordon Taylor\". Whittingdale said this suggested other employees were using information obtained by Mulcaire through phone hacking: \"Clearly it was not just Clive Goodman.\" Coulson replied: \"The first time I saw that document was when the Guardian produced it. I have no knowledge of it whatsoever.\" Adam Price MP said that the information commissioner's investigation revealed that Miskiw used Wittamore's agency 90 times. \"Are you surprised that an associate editor under your editorship was actually responsible for this level of illegal activity?\" Price added. Coulson said: \"I have no evidence... as to whether or not this is correct... I do not know. I know as much as you do, and you may know even more.\" Price also asked Coulson about a quote he had given to Press Gazette, when he said that one of the first questions he asked when a journalist came to him with a story was: \"How did you get it?\" Price said: \"Did you ever ask that question of Clive Goodman?\", to which Coulson replied: \"I do not recall specific circumstances where I did.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
