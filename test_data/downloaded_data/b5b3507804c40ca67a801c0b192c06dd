  "content": "Lord Justice Leveson might like to note the rise in privacy cases over the past three years. According to research by the legal publishers Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 50 privacy cases were launched in the 12 months up to the end of May this year compared to 43 in the same period the previous year. The number of public figures using privacy arguments to protect their identity in court actions rose to 24 from nine in 2010 (and just two in 2009). In recent months it appeared as if the use of anonymised injunctions (sometimes known as superinjunctions) had come to a halt. But last week it was revealed that two had been issued by the high court on 24 November by Mr Justice Tugendhat. The orders may be the first to be issued since the Master of the Rolls, Lord Neuberger, announced a year-long review into the use of privacy injunctions in May. As part of that review, a statistical monitoring pilot scheme began on 1 August (until 31 July 2012) to establish the use and scope of privacy injunctions. The results are to be published. Neuberger also issued guidance on privacy applications, which includes a model draft order. It emphasises that privacy injunctions should only be granted when \"strictly necessary to secure the proper administration of justice.\" Sources: The Lawyer/FT/Press Gazette/ACC",
