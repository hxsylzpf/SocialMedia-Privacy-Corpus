  "content": "\"We expected a deceleration of the business and it is actually accelerating,\" said YouTube's content boss Robert Kyncl this month, during an appearance at the Code/Media conference in California. The quote summed up YouTube's position at the start of 2015, when it finds itself with more competition than ever, yet when Google's online video service is also growing faster than ever, from an already impressive base. Growth? YouTube's total viewing time \u2013 its current favoured metric \u2013 has increased by 50% year-on-year. Competition? Facebook's growing emphasis on \"native\" video \u2013 footage uploaded directly to the social network rather than embedded in posts from services like YouTube \u2013 has seen it race from 1bn to 3bn daily views in a matter of months. Meanwhile, startup Vessel is trying to persuade prominent YouTubers to give it 72-hour exclusives on their new videos, promising higher payouts in return. Twitter is doing more with native video \u2013 albeit for now at much shorter lengths than successful YouTube content \u2013 while Yahoo also has ambitions to attract top YouTube creators to its service. How is YouTube responding to this intensifying competitive landscape? For now, one thing it's not doing is launching a paid subscription tier for people who want YouTube without ads. Recent reports suggesting that it was were misinterpretations of other Kyncl comments at Code/Media, when he talked about subscriptions for YouTube's new streaming music service Music Key, rather than any general plans. Music Key will be YouTube's first serious push into monthly subscriptions, although with a free, ad-supported version of the service too. Music Key remains in a trial period. \"We've invited our best users \u2013 it will launch in a few months to the public,\" said Kyncl. \"It is a very important part of business. There are audiences who just don't want to see ads in music \u2013 they want things like offline access.\" In its general business, if anything YouTube is doubling down on its advertising model. Its Google Preferred initiative, launched in October 2014, packages up its most popular channels into more appealing media buys for big brands. Meanwhile, YouTube is fighting back against Vessel and any other rival trying to poach its stars by exploring new initiatives to help fund their content. \"We'll experiment with new formats and ideas. We'll get our hands dirty,\" explained Alex Carloss, head of YouTube's Originals division, last September. The overall sense is of YouTube sharpening its focus on its most popular content, both in terms of individual channels and entire categories. Music Key covers its huge audience of music fans, and a new YouTube Kids app launched on Monday is targeting YouTube's huge audience of children. Released initially in the US only, as an Android app, YouTube Kids will only include \"family-friendly\" videos, channels and playlists, with parental controls and partners including The Jim Henson Company, National Geographic and Thomas the Tank Engine producer HIT Entertainment. There will be plenty of scrutiny around issues like advertising and data collection, but a walled-off children's version of YouTube makes sense \u2013 especially given that seven of its 20 most popular channels in December (and three of the top five: DC Toys Collector, LittleBabyBum and Stampy) were aimed at kids. YouTube's strategy in 2015 isn't so startling: capitalising on its strengths like music and kids, and protecting its potential Achilles heel \u2013 concerns that creators could make more money elsewhere \u2013 as rivals ready their arrows.",
