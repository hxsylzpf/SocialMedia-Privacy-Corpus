The News International row finds many echoes across Europe and the US. The way things are going, it's not such a big jump from Chipping Norton to Chappaquiddick. Unlike the late US senator Edward Kennedy, David Cameron has not driven his car into a Martha's Vineyard tidal channel. There is no innocent victim to compare with Mary Joe Kopechne. But Cameron, wandering round Africa this week, can fairly be accused of leaving the scene of an accident. The furore over the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident all but terminated Kennedy's presidential ambitions. It suggested the fabled era of Camelot, when President John F Kennedy and his other brother Robert held sway in Washington, was well and truly banished. In those days, reporters, editors and fellow politicians who knew about sexual shenanigans in the White House kept the knowledge to themselves. Ted Kennedy's downfall punctured this culture of impunity. In contrast, Bill Clinton's humiliation in 1998 arising from exposure of his affair with Monica Lewinsky suggested the public's prurience pendulum had swung fully in the other direction. No detail of Bubba's lewd Oval Office encounters with Lewinsky was left unpublished. The people, it was said, had the right to know everything \u2013 and while proclaiming themselves shocked and appalled, they lapped up every word. As Howard Kurtz, the American media commentator, noted recently, this hypocritical appetite for gossip, sleaze and scandal has grown exponentially. In close imitation of Fleet Street, for example, ABC television last month paid $15,000 to Meagan Broussard, one of the women who was texted by the so-called \"internet flasher\", former congressman Anthony Wiener. When it was revealed former Democrat senator John Edwards had fathered a child out of wedlock, his presidential hopes were instantly dashed. While Britain and America's political and business elites may face increasingly ruthless public scrutiny (witness the debagging of rogue financier Bernard Madoff), the same is not really true of their European equivalents. In France, former IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has denied an accusation of rape, is still regarded with some sympathy, despite media chit-chat about how the case has \"revolutionised\" attitudes to women. It has now emerged that Francois Hollande, the leading Socialist presidential contender, knew about allegations against Strauss-Kahn of a sexual assault in 2003, but did not report it. Such upper-crust solidarity remains par for the course in France. Other countries have experienced their own variations of NI-type scandals. Recent election and referendum results indicate Italians have finally decided to be rid of Silvio Berlusconi. The wonder is that he, an antediluvian chauvinist TV magnate who manipulated the political process, twisted the news, rewrote the law, intimidated the courts and was accused of associating with prostitutes, has lasted so long. The main reason must be his Murdoch-like influence over the levers of political, legal and media power. In Germany, always more staid, outrage has focused on cover-ups concerning academic plagiarism by leading public figures and perceived conflicts of interest, such as when former chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der went to work for Russia's Gazprom. But the penalties have been light. Schr\u00f6der got away with it. And when a Bundesbank board member, Thilo Sarrazin, was accused of venting racist and antisemitic remarks, he gained establishment defenders and a big book deal. Spaniards have their own experience of phone hacking. In the mid-90s, it emerged the military's secret service had intercepted and recorded thousands of phone conversations of businessmen, politicians, and even those of King Juan Carlos. The scandal came on top of claims, later substantiated, of a government-approved death squad targeting Basque separatists. The independent journalist most responsible for exposing this scandal, Pedro Ramirez of El Mundo, was set up in a video sex sting, for which the perpetrators were later jailed. Of all Europe's recent establishment insider scandals, perhaps the most egregious \u2013 and the one which took the most time to expose \u2013 was the Catholic church's long-running cover-up of sexual abuse. Several years on, investigators have still not got to the bottom of the all the crimes committed, nor have they numbered all the victims of priestly predators. Despite their leadership position of trust, Vatican higher-ups and bevvies of bishops persistently refused to acknowledge a systemic problem. It was not until his visit to Britain last autumn that Pope Benedict XVI finally expressed personal sorrow for the \"unspeakable crimes\" of child abuse committed within the Catholic church. Judging by today's ever so humble Commons testimony, it was Benedict's \"Murdoch moment\".",
