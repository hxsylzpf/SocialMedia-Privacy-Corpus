Mr Justice Lindsay came down in favour of Hollywood stars Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas, who brought a legal action against Hello! for publishing unauthorised pictures of their wedding. The couple had struck an exclusive \u00a31m deal with OK!, which was a co-claimant in the court case, won on the grounds of commercial confidentiality. Paul Ashford, the editorial director of Northern &amp; Shell, the owner of OK!, said Hello! had acted with \"a measure of dishonesty\" that the court had recognised. \"This is a resounding and historic victory for OK! magazine, Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones,\" he said. \"We are delighted that the courts have endorsed the absolute validity of the relationships of trust in which OK! magazine's dealings with major stars are built. \"We are satisfied too that Mr Justice Lindsay has recognised that Hello! magazine acted with a measure of dishonesty which included their senior officers giving false evidence in court. \"This ruling will enable OK! to maintain its dominant market position against Hello! as we continue to offer our readers the major exclusives which rivals cannot match,\" Mr Ashford added. One of the judge's key findings - which will be taken into account when assessing the amount of damages Hello! must pay to the Douglases and OK! - was that Hello!'s owners had \"knowingly provided false evidence during the course of these proceedings\". He described the placing of false evidence before the court of appeal as \"lamentable, as is also the fact that, despite privilege having been waived, material questions remain incapable of answer\". The false evidence in question included a faxed statement signed by Hello!'s former celebrity fixer, the Marquesa de Varela, wrongly stating that she had sold the sneaked pictures to Hello!, a move that would have distanced the magazine from the purchase. The marquesa signed the statement as part of Hello!'s bid to overturn a temporary injunction obtained by the Douglases in the immediate aftermath of their wedding to prevent the unauthorised pictures from appearing. Hello!'s appeal against the injunction was successful and the magazine went ahead and published the pictures, However, today's judgement means the couple are now entitled to an injunction to prevent any further publication of the photographs. Hello!'s owners claimed in court that the false statement was simply the result of an error. However, the marquesa told the judge she had felt pressurised into signing the statement because she feared for her livelihood.",
