  "content": "Max Mosley and Greta Garbo have something in common, not least the fact that they both \"want to be left alone\". However, while Mosley mounts as his defence of a right to privacy the fact that he had got away with his sadomasochistic party lifestyle for four decades, I suspect that a realist such as Garbo would just have popped the champagne corks in celebration of her lengthy triumph over the odds of exposure. It's hard to feel sorry for Mosley, a seemingly vain fellow who considers the preservation of his own \"dignity\" more important than honesty in his marriage. However, Mosley has a point - in that the public interest being served by the revelation of his sexual predilection is slim to non-existent. That is unless what we mean by public interest is nowadays better described as public appetite. There's no question that we have a big stomach for it. What a ravenous hunger we display to live vicariously the traumas, trials and tribulations of those on whom the media spotlight falls: no detail is too intimate, no indignity too cruel, no private affair too sacred. Spiced by spurious comment and hypocritical judgments from a press chorus not famous for its own blemish-free morality, we relish every last detail. The irony of the evidence presented to the Commons media select committee is that while Mosley is hard to pity, Gerry McCann and his wife, Kate, are not; it's impossible not to empathise with the McCanns' anguish over the still unsolved mystery of their daughter's disappearance and to sympathise with their determination to exploit all avenues to find her. Indicative of the emotion surrounding this debate was the MP on the panel who, after shaking her head when Gerry McCann had described his experiences with the media, said, \"I don't know how some of them live with themselves\" - displaying what was surely an unhealthy bias. Double standards are the order of the day. Minnows in the fame shallows like myself complain when a paparazzo leaps out from behind a bollard on a bad hair day, but then exchange family photos for free tickets to Madagascar 2. It's a dirty business and few emerge with principles entirely intact. Most of those featured critically in the public domain complain of not having experience of dealing with the press; but unless you're born a Windsor, who does? The only way to gain expertise is when the spotlight homes in on you. Perhaps unsurprisingly when the publicity is good, career-enhancing or relevant to a cause, it's rare to hear a dissenting victim. In the McCanns' desperate and unrelenting quest to find their little girl they invited a pack of wolves to join them at the table, and perhaps naively seem surprised that the beasts weren't content with titbits. The orgy of headlines that splurged forth around the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine may have been unseemly, irresponsible and downright misleading at times, but it kept her on the front page long after jaded hacks would normally have moved on. Gerry McCann said on BBC2's Newsnight only a couple of days ago that the search for Madeleine was ongoing, and he would go \"public when we feel we need more in the public arena\". It seems he hasn't learned his lesson. The media don't just sit there waiting to publicise what they're told, they set their own agenda - not that of those hoping to bend it to their advantage, however worthy the cause. Occasionally the two combine and a happy marriage of subject and story is achieved. This would appear to be the case with Jade Goody. Her desire to live out her final days in the full frontal flash of the cameras should come as no surprise to the audience for her every last poignant, Max Clifford-manipulated moment. The tabloid fame she achieved post Big Brother gave meaning to her life; now she's exploiting those who once exploited her, employing their appetite for documenting her demise to fund the future of her soon to be motherless sons. It's a dog-eat-dog environment, so most perplexing of the whole bunch is Julie Myerson, currently at the centre of a media storm surrounding the publication of her memoir about her son's drug use. Both she and her husband are journalists and should know that there's no such thing as a free headline. Claiming an artistic compulsion, which Myerson continues to do, as vindication for exposing your kid's private problems is a risky business. Most novelists will argue that their lives provide essential raw material - and when it comes to adults, consenting or otherwise, I agree. Children, on the other hand, need protecting, and if parents can't live up to the challenge then the law should protect their right to privacy. I recently allowed my kids to appear in a travel piece, thinking that the benefit of a trip to the Caribbean would be greater than the harm done by the appearance of a couple of holiday snaps in a national newspaper. I've subsequently convinced myself that when the kids are falling out of West End nightclubs and being blinded by flashbulbs at the age of 13, I will have sown the seeds of their demise. Legislating against parents' bad judgment in exposing their children may be no bad idea, but draconian privacy laws protecting adults are another matter. Such laws might protect us from newspapers filled with drivel about the lives of complete strangers but they would also protect those whose hypocrisies and shady activities are of definite public interest. What's needed is a free press with a capacity for restraint and with reason to fear the regulatory bodies when it fails to police itself properly. Sadly, in my experience the Press Complaints Commission causes not a tremor of trepidation when newspapers step out of line. Fines, public humiliation and fear of litigation are the tools best employed in the battle against bad journalism. It's a shame, then, that funding a libel case is such an expensive and risky business that only the likes of Max Mosley can afford in order to protect their \"dignity\". You can't always litigate against human nature, but you can certainly mitigate against its worst transgressions with the right tools. mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk",
