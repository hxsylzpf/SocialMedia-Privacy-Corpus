  "content": "I met Simon Amstell in 2011 when I was cast in series two of his sitcom, Grandma's House. I liked him. I discovered that he was not on Twitter. Or YouTube. This seemed ridiculous and upsetting. I feel social networking has improved my life in ways I could never have imagined and so began Project Amstell. I have been following Simon around with a camera to his warm-up gigs as he prepares for his new stand-up tour Numb and despite his deep reluctance, I have been doing my very best to get him fully involved in Twitter. This first video is a short introduction to a whole series of forthcoming clips.   \u2022 Grandma's House series two will be on BBC2 this Spring. \u2022 Follow Jessie on Twitter (@PinDippyCave) and visit pindippy.com Mobile users: please visit the desktop site to view the video",
