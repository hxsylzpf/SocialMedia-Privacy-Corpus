  "content": "Groupon, the online discount firm, reportedly plans to make its Wall Street debut within two months after resolving a regulatory dispute. The Chicago-based company is expected to go public in one of the biggest share offerings in the next 12 months. However, an even bigger technology flotation by Facebook is reported to have been delayed until late 2012. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has shelved plans to go public until September 2012, the Financial Times reported, in order to keep employees focused on product development amid increased competition from Google and Twitter. The social networking giant, which has attracted a $66.5bn (\u00a342.1bn) valuation from trading on secondary markets according to the FT, had been due to float before April 2012, when the company will disclose its first set of financial results because of US regulatory rules. Facebook is reported to have made revenues of between $1.6bn and $2bn in the first half of this year, roughly double reported figures for the first six months of 2010. The Facebook flotation delay opens the door for Groupon to become the biggest of the new generation of internet firms to go public. According to the New York Times, the online discount firm plans to go public in late October or early November after it resolved an issue with US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The $25bn-valued company delayed its IPO plans last week reportedly because of recent stock market volatility. However, Groupon chief executive Andrew Mason has faced some criticism after the leaking of an internal memo in which he blasted the company's growing army of critics. The leak came during the supposed \"quiet period\" when companies planning to go public are restricted from talking publicly about their financial performance. \"While we've bitten our tongues and allowed insane accusations (like in the article above) to go unchallenged publicly, it's important to me that you have the context necessary to brush this stuff off,\" Mason said in the memo, before listing four reasons why he has \"never been more confident and excited about the future of [the] business\". Mason, who founded Groupon in November 2008, is expected to begin a roadshow to attract potential investors by mid-October. But he is likely to face tough questioning on the company's long-term prospects amid concern about its valuation and unorthodox accounting methods. Groupon previously had to amend its IPO documents to abandon an accounting method that eliminated its substantial marketing and subscriber-acquisition costs following intense scrutiny from regulators and analysts. By some metrics the fastest growing company of all time, Groupon had 35 million registered users last Octover. But its vast marketing spend has seen the company burn through mountains of cash even as sales soared, losing $180m last year and a further $102.7m in the second quarter of this year alone. Revenue at the online discount firm rose to $878m in the second quarter of 2011, compared with $645m in the first quarter and up from $87m in the second quarter of 2010. Many of the hottest fledgling internet firms \u2013 including the maker of popular Facebook games, Zynga \u2013 had been due to go public this year but the volatility in financial markets has stalled their plans. Tim Curry, an IPO lawyer for Jones Day based in Silicon Valley, said: \"It's not so much the level of the market but this kind of volatility that makes it difficult to price [IPOs]\". Of the 97 companies to have floated in the US this year, 64% of them currently trade below their share offer price, according to data from Thomson Reuters.",
