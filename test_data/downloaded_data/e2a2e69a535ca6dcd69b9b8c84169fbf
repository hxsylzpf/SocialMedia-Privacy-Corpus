Rupert Thorpe was one of a group of four paparazzi photographers who were part of a plot to gatecrash the wedding and take unauthorised photographs, Michael Tugendhat, the QC acting for the Hollywood couple, told the high court in London. The Hollywood couple, which had sold the rights to their wedding to rival celebrity magazine OK!, are suing Hello! for publishing the unauthorised photographs. Mr Tugendhat described the cover picture of the issue of Hello! containing the sneaked photographs to the court. \"It's not an image you would expect a bride to release as the main photo of her wedding,\" he said. He described the six photographs that appeared in Hello! as \"lop-sided\", \"out of focus\" and of \"very poor quality\". Mr Tugendhat also claimed that Zeta Jones had been ridiculed by one of the pictures that showed her eating. The picture was reprinted in the Sun with the headline \"Catherine Eater Jones\". \"Nobody has ever seen a picture of a bride in which she's shown eating. Such a thing doesn't exist,\" Mr Tugendhat told the court. He added that such pictures only appeared in \"tacky yoghurt and ice cream adverts\". However, Mr Tugendhat said the content of the photographs was not the main subject of the action. At first they suspected a member of the staff at the hotel \"or to the great distress of the Douglases, one of their own friends or family members,\" Mr Tugendhat, their QC told the high court on the first day of action. But he said it appeared the pictures were taken by one of a group of four paparazzi who gatecrashed the wedding. Hello! started printing the first edition of an increased print run - 750,000 instead of 650,000 - while the wedding was still being celebrated. Mr Tugendhat said it did not take long before the couple realised that Hello! was bringing into the UK its first planeload of magazines that had \"very poor quality set of photographs of their wedding\". He said: \"Anyone would be upset on discovering marriage celebrations - something everyone would wish to be conducted amongst friends in an atmosphere of trust - should be exploited in this way.\" In a case that will test a celebrity's right to privacy under European law, the stars are suing for stress, loss of income and damage to their professional careers. They are pursuing Hello!, its Spanish counterpart Hola!, their proprietor Eduardo Sanchez-Junco, media consultant the Marquesa De Varela, her company, Neneta Overseas Ltd, and freelance photographer Philip Ramey. Mr Tugendhat said the couple had wanted to be \"free to choose with whom to celebrate their wedding\". It had been suggested by some that, if they did not want the publicity, they should have \"locked themselves away in Skibo Castle\" or a place so remote that no journalists could find it. The Douglases' wish to have the wedding of their choice was \"no more than any couple would want\". They did not want to hide away from family and friends, and they wanted their guests to be able to enjoy themselves without worrying about media intrusion. \"There is one way we behave in public and another way we behave in private,\" said Mr Tugendhat. Wedding guests might not be able to relax if they knew the paparazzi were present. But the Douglases accepted, as celebrities, that there was a legitimate interest in what they did. That was why they arranged for the release of photographs of which they approved. \"They did not wish to appear aloof and shun their public,\" he added.",
