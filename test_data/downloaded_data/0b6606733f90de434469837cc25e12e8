I am satisfied that she lied on oath about the reasons for her rushed admission to hospital in Gran Canaria and I have doubts about the accuracy of her accounts of the assault on her assistant and her dealings with Mr Matthew Freud, the publicist. \"Nevertheless, I am satisfied that she genuinely suffered the distress and injury to feelings caused by the justified publication and disclosure of details of her therapy in the two articles of the first and second of February 2001.",
