That's why it's so easy to meet. Someday we'll evaporate together.\" \u2013 Yoko Ono has taken to the social network site to offer a more visceral message, tweeting an image of John Lennon's bloodstained glasses as part of a call for greater gun control. The 80-year-old artist and musician tweeted a picture of the glasses worn by Lennon on the night he was shot dead coupled with the message: \"Over 1,057,000 people have been killed by guns in the USA since John Lennon was shot and killed on 8 Dec 1980.\" The photo, showing the glasses on a windowsill with New York's Central Park in the background, was the cover of Ono's 1981 album Season of Glass, her first recording after her then husband was murdered by Mark Chapman outside their apartment building in the city. Over 1,057,000 people have been killed by guns in the USA since John Lennon was shot and killed on 8 Dec 1980. twitter.com/yokoono/status\u2026 \u2014 Yoko Ono (@yokoono) March 20, 2013 Ono tweeted the image a further three times, with the messages: \"31,537 people are killed by guns in the USA every year. We are turning this beautiful country into war zone\"; \"Together, let's bring back America, the green land of peace\"; and finally, \"The death of a loved one is a hollowing experience. After 33 years our son Sean and I still miss him. Yoko Ono Lennon\". Ono has been a political activist for decades, but her contribution to the gun control debate is notable in the aftermath of the shooting in December last year in which 20 young children were killed at a primary school in Newtown, Connecticut.",
