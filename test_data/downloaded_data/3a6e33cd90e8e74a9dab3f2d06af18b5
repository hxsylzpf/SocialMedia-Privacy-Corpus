  "content": "Less than a year after he was parachuted in to run MySpace, Owen Van Natta is out of a job as the ailing social network tries once again to revitalise itself. Van Natta, who spent several years as a senior executive at Facebook, was brought in by News Corporation last April to replace ousted MySpace founder Chris DeWolfe. But in a surprise move late on Wednesday, the company said that Van Natta himself was being replaced by two other executives brought in alongside him, Mike Jones and Jason Hirschorn. The duo are now MySpace's co-presidents, reporting to News Corp's digital chief, Jon Miller. Miller, himself a former chief executive of AOL, was hired by Rupert Murdoch to reorganise the mogul's internet businesses. In a statement, he said that Van Natta's contribution had been an important one. \"Owen took on an incredible challenge in working to refocus and revitalise MySpace, and the business has shown very positive signs recently as a result of his dedicated work,\" he said. \"However, in talking to Owen about his priorities both personally and professionally going forward, we both agreed that it was best for him to step down at this time. I want to thank Owen for all of his efforts.\" Once seen as a darling of the dotcom world, and bought by Murdoch in 2005 for $580m, MySpace has struggled in recent years to match the explosive growth of Facebook. Since the shakeup which brought Van Natta on board, the company has undergone drastic reorganisation as News Corp's digital businesses have come under increasing pressure to reap more financial benefits for their parent company. Despite redesigning and relaunching the site, however, things have remained problematic at the Los Angeles-based company. Last year MySpace cut 30% of its US workforce and then slashed its global operations by two-thirds. \"MySpace is an incredibly unique place and we're made real gains,\" said Van Natta in a statement. \"I'm proud of the work we've all accomplished together and look forward to watching its continued growth.\"",
