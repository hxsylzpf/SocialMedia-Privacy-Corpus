  "content": "A new course is offering members of the public the chance to learn how to become a professional computer hacker \u2013 without ever leaving the house. The lessons in so-called \"ethical hacking\", which is used by internet security companies to counter computer crime, are being offered for the first time as a distance learning course by the International Correspondence School. The 300-hour accredited programme is operated from the company's Glasgow offices, but teaching is conducted through the post and online. It is even supported by a series of iPod-compatible downloads. \"We are very excited,\" said the ICS education services director, Julie Hepburn. \"Students can study on the move and at hours to suit themselves.\" The discipline of ethical hacking has grown in recent years, as more companies become concerned over the threat of criminal strikes on their computer systems. Ethical hackers \u2013 also known as \"white hats\" \u2013 focus on understanding the methods used by criminals, and test computer systems for weaknesses that could leave them open to attack. They often conduct dummy raids and penetration tests to discover the security of a client's system. During the \u00a31,800 course, students will be taught a number of skills, including how to run denial-of-service attacks and the tricks of social engineering often used by hackers \u2013 as well as being shown how to create viruses. However, since the skills learned during the \"Certified Ethical Hacking\" course could easily be used for criminal gain, ICS said it is operating a strict set of rules about who can apply to gain the qualification. All students applying to take the course will be vetted by New York's International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants, and they will require the backing of a legitimate company before being allowed to proceed. Students will also have their references checked again before sitting any exams. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
