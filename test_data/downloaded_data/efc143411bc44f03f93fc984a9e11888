  "content": "Posh Spice (@victoriabeckham) \u2013 when you joined Twitter I thought you might have finally found your \"thing\". An indiscreet Spice Girl with insider scoop on the Tom-Kat marriage has a Twitter account? Sign me up! But your tweets have been a mix of overexcited weather reports (\"Sun is shining in London!!!!!! X vb x\") and dull fashion blurbs (\"I want Prada nails!!!!! X vb\"). Nearly 900,000 followers have signed up to see a show, Posh. Let's give them what they came for. Trial by Twitter You and David seem to spend a lot of time taking legal action to quash one rumour or another. This must be eating into valuable hours that could otherwise be used to nibble on a salad with Eva Longoria. Follow the example of Lily Allen (@lilyroseallen) in dealing with showbiz journalists: \"I THINK you're a cunt, leave me out of your shitty column, you know nothing about the intimate details of my life.\" Tweet sent. Case closed. Time to buy some shoes. Cull the #fashionbunnies You're nobody these days if you don't have a name to call your followers by. But #fashionbunnies? Change it to #goldenballers immediately. You can have that one on me, V. Chill out with the \"!!!!\" Nobody is this \"OMG!!!!a visitor just arrived!!!!Guess who????!!!!! X vb\" excited. Lots of love, @scouserachel",
