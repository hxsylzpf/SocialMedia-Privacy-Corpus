  "content": "Facebook announced this morning via a release that Russian investment group Digital Sky Technologies had purchased a 1.96% stake in the company for $200m, putting a $10bn valuation on the company. Digital Sky's interest had first been reported on Friday by the WSJ. Digital Sky is also offering to purchase $100m of Facebook common stock held by current shareholders. It will not receive a seat on Facebook's board. For months now, Facebook has been rumored to be on the lookout for new funds to buy back employee stock and finance the lease of new servers, although chief operating officer Cheryl Sandberg insisted earlier this month that the company did not need to raise money. \"We could not be doing better financially ... We might take money - but it doesn't mean we need to,\" she told Bloomberg. In a statement, Facebook chief operating officer Mark Zuckerberg said a number of investment firms had approached the company, although Digital Sky \"stood out because of the global perspective they bring - backed up by the impressive growth and financial achievements of their internet investments.\" The company is holding a call at 9:45 PDT. Look for updates here.",
