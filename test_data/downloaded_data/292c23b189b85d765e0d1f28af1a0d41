The site, which allows users to send messages to individuals or friends over the web, text or instant messaging, will continue to allow people to send messages to Twitter by mobile, but will no longer deliver updates and messages to people over SMS. The move does not affect users in the US, Canada and India. In an email to users last night, co-founder Biz Stone explained that the company could no longer afford to support outbound SMS until it had made better billing arrangements with Britain's mobile phone operators. \"It pains us to take this measure. However, we need to avoid placing undue burden on our company and our service,\" he said. \"Even with a limit of 250 messages received per week, it could cost Twitter about $1,000 per user, per year to send SMS outside of Canada, India, or the US. It makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users.\" The announcement was met with confusion and anger among Twitter's large British contingent. One user said that they thought the move was \"too much\", but that they hadn't decided to leave yet. \"I'm still here tweeting ... so obviously I'm not narked off enough to leave altogether.\" \"Too much of a downgrade, but at least I have an iPhone now,\" said another. Yet another suggested that recent improvements to Twitter's notoriously mercurial website had softened some of the impact. \"The end of SMS is a blow but won't be fatal now the patchy service has improved.\" The move comes as a setback for the hotly-tipped startup, which has grown to an estimated 2.2 million users since launching in 2006, and last year raised $15m in funding from investors including Union Square Ventures and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But working out how to make the service pay has always been a difficult question for the company's creators. In an interview with the Guardian last month, co-founder Ev Williams said that making the system profitable was a high priority. \"We don't have any specific plans for a payment system, though that's interesting,\" he said. \"But we definitely are striving for (and believe we can achieve) a built-in revenue model that is compatible with the open nature of Twitter and its ecosystem, rather than something tacked-on.\"",
