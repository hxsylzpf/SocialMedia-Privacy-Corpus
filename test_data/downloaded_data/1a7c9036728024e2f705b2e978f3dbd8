  "content": "Snapchat chief executive Evan Spiegel has hinted at plans to do more with music in his company's popular messaging app, describing it as \"a really interesting opportunity\" \"Music is really appealing to us right now because it has some of the same attributes that communication had when we were working on Snapchat in the beginning,\" said Spiegel during an on-stage interview at the University of Southern California, reported by Daily Trojan. Snapchat's main features involve sharing photos and videos with friends that disappear either as soon as they're viewed, or after 24 hours. However, the app has added several music features in recent months. They include major label Warner Music Group signing on as one of the launch partners for the app's Snapchat Discover feature; Madonna debuting her new music video within the same section of the app; and most recently a feature enabling people to use the music playing on their smartphone as the soundtrack for their videos. Judging by Spiegel's comments, Snapchat is mulling more music-related features. \"Right now on your mobile phone, music is largely non-differentiated, so you usually search for a song and you can play it. It plays from four of five different places, they roughly cost the same, but it's also high frequency,\" he said. \"After communication, [music is] the highest frequency behaviour on your phone and so that in our view, makes it a really interesting opportunity and it's something that we are thinking about.\" Emails leaked as part of the Sony Pictures hack in December suggested that Snapchat \u2013 and Spiegel \u2013 has been thinking about music for some time: \"He thinks every music service in the market is shit and he wants to be a curator. He doesn't want to build a music service but he would like to have a record label so he could focus on the artists that he wants to use the platform to promote.\" Snapchat also held talks with music videos service Vevo about it becoming a launch partner in Snapchat Discover, but they broke down after the two companies couldn't agree on how to split advertising revenues from the deal.",
