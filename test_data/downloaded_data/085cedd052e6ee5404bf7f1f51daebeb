Please Leave The McClain's In Peace. Justice in Court.\" David and Elaine McClain, who are both in their 70s, say they were forced to leave their home after the director's tweet was picked up by his 250,000 followers. According to the Daily Mail, the couple have a son called William George Zimmerman who lived with them in the mid-90s, but he is no relation to the George Zimmerman who has been at the centre of the Trayvon Martin case since Martin's killing on 26 February. The details of the shooting, which has divided America and damaged race relations, are still unclear. Martin was shot and killed by George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida, on 26 February. Zimmerman was on a neighbourhood watch patrol at the time and has not been arrested for the shooting due to Florida's controversial \"stand your ground\" law, which states that any person who is attacked \"has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force\". Zimmerman claims he was acting in self-defence after Martin launch an unprovoked attack on him and that Martin was shot in the chest in the struggle that ensued. His account has been contested by many, who say Zimmerman initiated the confrontation. These include Martin's girlfriend, who was on the phone to the teenager at the time of the struggle. The aftermath of Lee's retweet has seen the director racially abused via Twitter. The film-maker has been retweeting those comments in full on his feed. \"People, The Thinking Behind Me Retweeting These Insane Racist Rants Is Because This Sickness Must Be Exposed,\" he tweeted on Tuesday. \"USA: Post Racial Society?????????\"",
