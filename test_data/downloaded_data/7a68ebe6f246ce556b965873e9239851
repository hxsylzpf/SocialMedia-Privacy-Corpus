It will be interesting to see who its minister is. Twitter spam and motivation to report it &gt;&gt; Marco.org \"Fundamentally, I believe Twitter's priorities here are wrong. Twitter needs a far more aggressive, automated, proactive, heuristic-based anti-spam system. And if someone has trouble legitimately tweeting a link with no text to 100 people in a row who don't follow them at precise 1-minute intervals, that's just the price we'll have to pay. \"In the meantime, I'm never using the \"Report Spam\" feature again, because it just seems like I'm wasting my time.\" Though this does assume that spam on Twitter actively annoys people. There's not a lot of evidence that it does, though, because unlike email it hasn't reached the point where it's any significant proportion of a timeline - and has any single spam account actually tweeted the same person twice? US mobile map audience grows 39% in past year as fixed-internet map audience softens slightly &gt;&gt; comScore \"More than 48m mobile users accessed maps on their device in May, marking an increase of 39% from the previous year. A comparative look at map usage among fixed-Internet users (i.e. accessing from a home or work computer) found that map visitation saw a slight decline in total audience in May 2011 versus the previous year, dipping 2%, while still maintaining a substantially larger audience of 93.8m visitors.\" Give it a few quarters and mobile will outdistance desktop. It is time for Google to take control of Android &gt;&gt; ZDNet \"I have been using Android phones and tablets since the beginning, and for the most part I love them. They work well most of the time and are a joy to use. That is the case until something goes wrong, and as [ZDNet colleague] Scott discovered it usually is the result of one of Google's partners changing something on a given device that jams up the pipes. \"I always suspected this was the case and it was proven to me when I switched to the Samsung Nexus S 4G recently. The Nexus S is Google's flagship phone, and as such it bypasses all of the Samsung customizations in favor of running stock Android. This has resulted in a user experience better than I have experienced with all other Android devices. The operation of the phone is perfect, and the performance is stellar in every way.\" Perfect? Wow, that's quite a benchmark. Analyst suggests RIM to discontinue Wi-Fi BlackBerry PlayBook &gt;&gt; BGR \"In a note to investors Monday afternoon, RBC Capital Markets Managing Director Mike Abramsky reiterated an OTR Global report that Research In Motion is possibly planning to stop production of the BlackBerry PlayBook's Wi-Fi model. The Wi-Fi version of RIM's tablet is the only version Research In Motion currently manufacturers. The reasons for the discontinuation of the Wi-Fi edition, Abramsky states, could be related to a pullback in production, a move that would align channel inventory with slower than expected sell-through, in addition to RIM focusing on upcoming cellularly-connected PlayBook versions.\" *Possibly* considering. But some commenters on the post point out that you can get a used PlayBook for quite a lot less than the retail price. Note: RIM has denied this completely, tweeting: \"Pure fiction. No plan to discontinue. In fact, WiFi PlayBook is launching in new countries practically every week.\" Apple set to release Lion, new MacBook Airs as soon as Wednesday &gt;&gt; Apple Insider As soon as Wednesday what? Oh, you mean.. sure. Wonder if it will instead delay a day, to let its financial results wash over the papers on Wednesday morning, and then hit again on Thursday. ZTE Skate Android phone gets UK price and launch date &gt;&gt; Electricpig \"According to British etailer Clove, the ZTE Skate will go on sale in the UK on September 19th, and it's available now for pre-order, priced up at an enticing \u00a3250. That's a solid \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 cheaper than similar sized rivals such as the HTC Desire HD and Samsung Galaxy S2, and it's likely to be even cheaper on Orange, where it will be subsidised on Pay As You Go for a still to be confirmed price.\" ZTE (a Chinese ODM-turned-OEM) is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the smartphone market. Microsoft and Apple have probably booked their patent lawyers' appointments already. Astronomers discover habitable exo-Earth orbiting binary star &gt;&gt; Technology Review \"Today, we can add another strange planet to the list [of exoplanets that maybe we could live on]: 55 Cancri f, one of five planets known to orbit an orange dwarf star some 40 light years away in the constellation of Cancer. \"Kaspar von Braun at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and a few pals have measured its orbit accurately for the first time. These guys are able to confirm that 55 Cancri f is a genuine candidate to support liquid water. \"They say that although this planet's orbit is much more elliptical than Earth's, it still spends most of its time (74 per cent) in the habitable zone.\" So we'd only freeze/boil to death three months of its year? Save us a seat. reddit gold, one year later &gt;&gt; Reddit A year ago, Reddit introduced a \"subscription\" program, Reddit Gold. Turn off ads, more comments visible, certain other interaction benefits, for $4/month, or $30 to start. So, how has it gone? SeaMicro drops its third atom bomb on server makers &gt;&gt; VentureBeat \"SeaMicro shook up the world of data center computing by making energy-efficient servers built around Intel's low-power Atom chips, which are usually used in netbooks and laptops. Now, for the third time in nine months, SeaMicro is introducing another line of servers that can pack an awful lot of computing power in a sixth of the usual space and a quarter of the electricity.\" Impressive: the key is that it doesn't just go after the CPU but also the other chips that burn electricity, which take 2/3 of consumption.
