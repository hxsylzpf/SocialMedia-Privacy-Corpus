  "content": "Ashley Cole's lawyer today accused the Sun and the News of the World of \"cowardly journalism\" as he confirmed that the footballer is taking legal action. Solicitor Graham Shear's statement said that the Arsenal defender, 25, was trying to focus on this summer's World Cup, adding that it was \"disgraceful\" the England player should face such \"insinuation and innuendo\" before his wedding to singer Cheryl Tweedy. He said: \"These proceedings were commenced because these newspapers published false and offensive articles designed to tell readers that Ashley had behaved in what the News of the World described as a 'perverted' way with other professional footballers. \"The newspapers knew there was no basis to name Ashley but arranged the articles and pictures in such a way that readers would identify him. \"There is no truth whatever in these allegations. Ashley Cole will not tolerate this kind of cowardly journalism or let it go unchallenged. \"It is disgraceful that he should be faced with this kind of unpleasant insinuation and innuendo at a time when he is trying to focus on this summer's World Cup and his forthcoming wedding. \"These proceedings will be vigourously and actively pursued.\" In a story published on February 12, the News of the World claimed two Premiership footballers used a mobile phone as a sex toy. The story did not name the players allegedly involved but the internet has been awash with rumours about their identity. A follow-up story was published by the News of the World on February 19, and similar allegations appeared in The Sun. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
