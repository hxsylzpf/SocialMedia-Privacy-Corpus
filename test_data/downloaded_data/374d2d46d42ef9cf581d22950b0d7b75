  "content": "A nurse who secretly filmed for a Panorama programme exposing neglect of elderly patients in a hospital has been struck off the register with immediate effect. Nurse Margaret Haywood wept as she was found guilty of misconduct at a hearing of the Nursing and Midwifery Council in central London today. The chair of the tribunal panel, Linda Read, said Haywood's secret filming for Panorama was a \"major breach\" of the nursing code of conduct. \"The panel is of the view that the misconduct found is fundamentally incompatible with being a nurse,\" Read added. \"The registrant embarked upon filming many vulnerable, elderly patients in the last stages of their lives, knowing that it was unlikely that they would be able to given any meaningful consent to the process, in circumstances where their dignity was most compromised.\" She added: \"Although the conditions on the ward were dreadful, it was not necessary to breach confidentiality to seek to improve them by the method chosen.\" Haywood, 58, from Liverpool, filmed undercover at the Royal Sussex hospital in Brighton for an episode of the flagship current affairs programme screened on BBC1 in July 2005. She said she was \"absolutely devastated and upset\" by the verdict. \"I think I have been treated very harshly. It is a serious issue and I knew it was a risk I was taking but I thought the filming was justified and it was in the public interest,\" Haywood said after the hearing. \"I always made it clear to the BBC that patients would come first at all times. I did voice my concerns through my immediate line manager and I also went to my ward manager but nothing was really taken on board. There was no other way of getting the full picture,\" she added. \"I was convinced that it was the right thing to do at the time as, in fact, I had reported the issues and nothing had been done. I felt I owed it to the people on the ward.\" Haywood said nurses were \"afraid to speak out about what is happening and the whole process needs to be reviewed so nurses can make it easier to voice their concerns\". Dr Karen Johnson, representing Haywood, said the episode of Panorama had \"immense\" impact. \"It is through programmes like Panorama that awareness is raised,\" she added. A Royal College of Nursing spokesman said: \"It is absolutely vital that healthcare staff at all levels feel they can raise concerns about poor patient care with their managers. \"However, it is clear that there are parts of the health service which do not have such systems or working environments in place. This can put staff in an extremely difficult position and when staff concerns are discouraged or ignored, it can often lead to poor patient care getting worse.\" A BBC spokesman said: \"There was clearly a strong public interest in revealing that some elderly people were not receiving the level of care we expect from our national health service. Panorama believes that Margaret Haywood has done the elderly population of this country a great service.\" The National Union of Journalists added that Haywood should be applauded, not sacked. NUJ official Tim Gopsill said: \"Sometimes the only way to get anything done is to go to the media. No-one could possibly argue that this story was not in the public interest.\" The Liberal Democrat health spokesman, Norman Lamb, said: \"While no member of staff should breach patient confidentiality, the bottom line is that Margaret Haywood has exposed the horrifying and disgraceful way many elderly patients are treated. \"It is simply outrageous that this is going on in today's NHS. This neglect, which verges on abuse, is utterly intolerable in this day and age and must be exposed and eradicated. \"The Government must make an absolute commitment to dignity and respect in the way the elderly are treated. We need a massive injection of extra funding to prevent unnecessary hospital admissions.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
