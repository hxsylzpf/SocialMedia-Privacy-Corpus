  "content": "He's a geeky Harvard dropout with a penchant for hooded sweatshirts who cheerfully admits he is \"awkward\". He once described his own customers as \"dumb fucks\". Yet the rise of 26-year-old Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg appears to be unstoppable. Yesterday it was revealed that his wealth has tripled in a year, making him richer than the mighty Rupert Murdoch and even Apple's Steve Jobs. A ranking of America's wealthiest individuals by Forbes magazine estimates Zuckerberg's current fortune at $6.9bn, up by $4.9bn in a year. He's still only 35th in the rankings, but he's rising up the list faster than anyone else. And in a sign that the young social networking tycoon is attempting to take control of his rocketing public profile \u2013 and perhaps even the responsibility that comes with it \u2013 Zuckerberg will appear on Oprah today to announce a $100m personal gift to urban schools in the city of Newark. A dentist's son who grew up in New York's commuter belt, Zuckerberg is the man who introduced the world to the charms of online poking, friend requests and writing on people's virtual \"walls\". But like other technology pioneers such as Bill Gates \u2013 who remains the richest person in America \u2013 he is far from universally popular, with his success dogged by accusations of disloyalty and ruthlessness. Facebook, which was born in a Harvard dorm just six years ago and is now valued at $23bn, has been plagued by controversy over its approach towards members' privacy. Zuckerberg's personal reputation, which has already taken some knocks, is receiving a fresh hammering from a newly released Hollywood film, The Social Network. The film, by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, best known for the television drama The West Wing, portrays the Facebook founder as an insecure social climber who brutally cuts loose friends who collaborated in the venture's early days. \"Despite his youth, he's smart and determined and he's willing to do what's necessary \u2013 including replacing some of his original team, who were college friends,\" says Ray Valdes, a technology analyst at Gartner Research in California. Valdes says Facebook's willingness to take unpopular risks has pushed its rise to online dominance. With 500 million active users worldwide, it has leapfrogged rivals such as MySpace, owned by Murdoch's News Corporation, to become by far the planet's biggest social networking site. \"They had a single-minded vision of the social web that they pursued,\" says Valdes. \"They were willing to take risks \u2013 including risks with their own users \u2013 by introducing new aspects to the Facebook experience that users were sometimes not ready for.\" Known as Zuck to his friends, Zuckerberg has until now kept a low profile. He drives a black Honda Acura, and lives in a rented house in Silicon Valley with his college sweetheart, Priscilla Chan. His Facebook page gives an indication of his personal tastes \u2013 it reveals he is a fan of Lady Gaga, Star Wars, Barack Obama, Bill Gates and a page called \"I stay longer in the shower because the water is so warm\". His harsher side \u2013 and that famous quote about his customers \u2013 emerged recently in a leaked exchange of instant messages from Facebook's early days in which he boasted to a friend that he had over 4,000 email addresses, pictures and other bits of personal information about members, and admitted he didn't know why people had submitted so much. \"They 'trust me',\" he wrote, adding: \"Dumb fucks.\" In the new film, which stars actor Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake, there is a party scene in which women offer lines of cocaine off their breasts. To put that in context, the film draws heavily on claims from disillusioned Harvard peers who sued Zuckerberg for stealing the original concept of Facebook. Nonetheless, it appears to have stung the entrepreneur into a charm offensive. This week's pledge to Newark's cash-strapped education system, to be delivered in Facebook shares, is Zuckerberg's first step into large-scale public philanthropy. In a rare interview in the New Yorker this week, Zuckerberg expressed regret for youthful missteps, including his boastfully arrogant instant messages, and insisted he had since grown up: \"If you're going to go on to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, you need to be mature, right?\" Explaining the ultimate goal behind Facebook, Zuckerberg said he wanted to move beyond search engines such as Google by mapping real-world social information, rather than web content, to tap into \"hardwired\" curiosity about the people surrounding us: \"Most of the information that we care about is things that are in our heads, right? And that's not out there to be indexed, right?\"",
