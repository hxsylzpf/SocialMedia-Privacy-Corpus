  "content": "Mamma mia! Mario and Luigi are on Instagram! Kind of. Charles Martinet, the veteran character actor who voices Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi for Nintendo's video games, joined Instagram two weeks ago. Armed with a smartphone, figurines of Mario and Luigi, and a mischievous sense of humor, Martinet has been posting short videos showing the world through the Brothers' eyes. Wherever Martinet goes, Mario and Luigi go too. Recently, they've been traveling in Chile. Wario even makes the occasional cameo. This week, Martinet has also been posting mini-nature documentaries, as told by Mario and Luigi, about a colony of ants that's been busy devouring a tree. It is adorable. Here's to hoping Princess Peach stops by for a visit.",
