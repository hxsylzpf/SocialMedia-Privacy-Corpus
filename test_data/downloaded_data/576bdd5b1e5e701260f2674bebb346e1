  "content": "Almost two years since INQ won the coveted GSMA award for its Social Mobile, the London-based mobile manufacturer will next week unveil its latest smartphone range \u2013 and confirm many of the rumours about a so-called 'Facebook phone'. The INQ Cloud Touch and INQ Cloud Q are the manufacturer's first Android-based phones, \"ruthlessly focussed\" on 18-28 year old Facebook users. \"Writing on a [Facebook] wall is as easy as sending text messages,\" says Ken Johnstone, INQ's co-founder. If any firm was to build a 'Facebook phone', it would be INQ \u2013 the three-year-old company which made its name through integration with social platforms including Windows Live Messenger and Skype. TechCrunch kickstarted five months of fevered speculation last September when it reported that Facebook was building software for a Facebook-branded mobile phone. Mark Zuckerberg's sprawling social network has consistently knocked down that charge, saying that it works with lots of partners and that its API is open to anyone. Dan Rose, Facebook's vice president of partnerships and platform marketing at Facebook, said just this week: \"The rumours about an HTC phone show just one example of the use of the Facebook platform where manufacturers have taken the API and used it in that way. It's very important for us to have a horizontal platform that is as widely available as possible.\" Speaking to the Guardian on Wednesday, Johnstone said: \"It was never intended to be a Facebook phone. But Facebook has been very heavily involved with it and it's been a collaborative process.\" The 600 million-strong social network is \"everywhere\" on INQ's new range, Johnstone says \u2013 and he's not wrong. Booting up the phone for the first time, you're invited to log in to a Wi-Fi connection \u2013 \"this phone is for people who may not be on high-end data tariffs\" \u2013 and then invited to log in to Facebook. There's no stand-alone Facebook app; it's your homepage. Status updates, wall posts, Places check-ins \u2013 all appear on the page traditionally populated by space or apps. Phone calls can also be made via Facebook and its API, to friends whose numbers are stored in your phone. Even the music streaming service Spotify gets its own launch button. If Facebook isn't for you, INQ's new range isn't for you. That particular refrain may well have grown tiresome by this time next week, as manufacturer after manufacturer doles out deeper integrations with the world's most popular social network. For INQ, it took \"five minutes of heated debate\" around 18 months ago over whether to build upon Google's burgeoning Android platform. The company's sit-back-and-see approach to adding to Google's range should pay dividends, Johnstone says: \"We think this is the opposite to what everyone else is doing. A lot of Android phones I love but they're all quite complicated, all noise, and very much alike. We wanted to deliver the authentic Facebook experience.\" The Cloud Touch, which has a 5MP camera on board, will be sold through the Carphone Warehouse and Best Buy in April on all major networks. The handset will be free on \u00a320 a month contracts. The Cloud Q \u2013 essentially the Cloud Touch but with a QWERTY keyboard and a 3MP camera \u2013 will be available through the same outlets with the pricing still to be decided.",
