  "content": "The story Blue-sky thinking Steve Hilton's bizarre plans to boost the economy caught many unawares this week. The Financial Times revealed that David Cameron's shaven-headed strategist had some \"blue-sky ideas\" for the economy. The story could have come straight from an Armando Iannucci script, with the guru suggesting that the government should ignore European labour regulations by scrapping maternity leave and bin all consumer rights for nine months.

The tweet @tweetbox360 Tasteless tweeting came to the fore again this week after the death of Amy Winehouse. The Microsoft account was attacked after it urged fans of the star to \"Remember Amy Winehouse by downloading the ground-breaking Back to Black over at Zune\". An apology followed after fans bombarded the Twitter address with outraged messages criticising the opportunistic move.",
