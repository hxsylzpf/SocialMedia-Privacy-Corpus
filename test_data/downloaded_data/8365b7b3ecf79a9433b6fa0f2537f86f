In an open letter to Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, 28 signatories have called on Google to suspend plans for the free Gmail service until it has addressed concerns about its privacy and data retention policies. Gmail is currently being tested by a small group of users, and Google has not announced a launch date for the service. The authors, including the US-based World Privacy Forum, the Electronic Privacy Information Centre and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, as well as the UK-based Foundation for Information Policy Research, argue that Gmail raises \"significant and troubling questions\" about how users' data will be used and stored. Gmail, which Google unveiled via a light-hearted April 1 press release, will offer users an unprecedented 1gigabyte of email storage: ten times more than rivals Hotmail and Yahoo, who both currently charge customers \u00a339.99 for 100 megabytes. But privacy groups are uneasy about Google's plans to scan all incoming emails to deliver targeted advertising, fearing that the move is \"letting the proverbial genie out of the bottle\". \"Google could - tomorrow - by choice or by court order, employ its scanning system for law enforcement purposes,\" the letter reads. Maurice Wessling of Bits of Freedom, a Netherlands-based privacy organisation that was among the letter's signatories, said Google's plans are \"a big step towards an unwanted development where people really don't have an expectation of secrecy for their communications\". The letter also tears holes in Google's privacy policy, which they claim does not set specific limits on how long users' data will be held, or make clear its policies about data sharing between the company's business units. It urges Google to suspend implementation of email scanning for advertising purposes, and asks for clarification of the firm's policies on use of data. Google's response to such criticisms was brief. Spokeswoman Ema Linaker told Guardian Unlimited: \"Our response is that we believe that we are fully compliant with the law.\" Ian Brown, of the UK internet policy thinktank, the Foundation for Information Policy Research, another signatory to the letter, has urged potential Gmail users to think about whether they want their entire email communication record to be held by Google and potentially used by the government and the courts. Meanwhile, another signatory, the London-based human rights group Privacy International has made a submission to the UK's Information Commissioner, voicing concerns about Google's plans for Gmail. A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said that it had talked to Google about its plans, but it would not be investigating because Gmail was still at the trial stage. \"If they launch the service we would expect Google to be very transparent about what they are doing, so that people know when they sign up they are opting in to being monitored,\" she said. A Google source said that the company had been surprised to face such brickbats when the Gmail service is still being tested and has not been launched to the public. The tone of the April 1 press release with which the US internet firm launched its latest innovation suggests that its founders had little inkling of the chorus of disapproval that would follow. The release boasts that Gmail will \"[turn] annoying spam email messages into the equivalent of canned meat\" and quotes co-founder Mr Page as saying: \"Gmail solves all of my communication needs. It's fast and easy and has all the storage I need. And I can use it from anywhere. I love it!\" Mr Brown said Google appeared to be \"chewing over\" the criticisms of the past week. \"People are starting to see them in a less flattering light. I don't think they were ready for that,\" he said. Google's image as an employee-friendly, ethical firm - cemented in its belief that \"you can make money without doing evil\" - has been challenged by rumours that the firm will go to the market with an initial public offering that could be worth $25bn later this year, and by accusations that the firm is gaining an unhealthily firm grasp on the search engine industry. Mr Wessling said he sensed Google is \"a little bit overwhelmed\" about the reaction to Gmail. \"If they had expected criticism, they would have had a FAQ on the site with 10 common questions and criticisms. I sense they didn't expect this kind of reaction.\" Gmail's launch has also been marred by a copyright row. The Market Age, a British investment research house, has claimed it has been using the name since June 2002. The Market Age's chief executive, Shane Smith, said he registered the name with the US patents and trademark office website last Saturday. Google told Guardian Unlimited that it was \"not aware of any trademark registrations for Gmail for email services\". Google declined to put a figure on how many people have registered an interest in Gmail so far. The company is at pains to remind users that Gmail is an \"experiment in a new kind of webmail\", and has refused to put a date on when the current limited tests will become a full-blown service.",
