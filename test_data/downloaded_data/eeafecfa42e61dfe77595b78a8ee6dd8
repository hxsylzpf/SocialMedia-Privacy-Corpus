  "content": "The continual drizzle of pre-release hype and pre-release publicity can be a confusing business for a film critic. Two years ago, there was an awful lot of buzz around a forthcoming film called Middle Men, starring Luke Wilson, about the wild-west world of 1990s internet pornography, when mavericks, sleazeballs and computer geeks figured out how to become seriously filthy rich overnight with web-based smut. It was based on the not-especially-reliable reminiscences of the movie's own producer, Christopher Mallick, former chief of a digital company called Paycom, a \"middleman\" internet supplier that hooked up porn producers with porn consumers without, theoretically, sullying its dainty hands with the porn business itself. I remember receiving a lot of advance publicity for this movie in Cannes in 2009, and reading a positive review by Todd McCarthy in Variety the following February. Boogie Nights meets GoodFellas? It sounded great. Surely at any moment this super-cool movie would be released in the UK. But nothing happened. And then, weirdly, it crept out as a \"video premiere\", scheduled to land with a sickening thud on Blockbuster shelves at the end of this month. Straight to DVD? What happened? Well, Middle Men, with its elaborate flashback structure and gravelly Ray Liotta-ish voiceover by Luke Wilson, clearly does owe something to GoodFellas, though something more to Ted Demme's Blow (2001), a slightly wearisome film about the beginnings of the cocaine trade in the 1970s. There is something self-congratulatory in the endless descriptions of how rich they were getting and how scary were the Russian mobsters they had to deal with. The subplot about the FBI asking the web porn magnates to help track down porn-addicted terrorists looks very much like a piece of self-serving exaggeration or fantasy. But surely this interesting film deserved a theatrical release? What sank it? My theory is that The Social Network sank it. David Fincher's brilliant film came along with a compelling story to tell about Facebook, the creditable web resource that everyone admits to using: a very classy film that the dinner party-going classes could see and talk about. Middle Men had, by comparison, a very nasty, sleazy, yucky story to tell. It was about porn, that great unacknowledged driving force behind the internet. Many will 'fess up, with a grin or a grimace, to being Facebook or Twitter addicts; but about internet porn use they are silent. The Social Network, in its high-mindedness, monopolised the subject of the web and stole Middle Men's thunder, making it look dated and unrespectable. In both Middle Men and The Social Network, web pioneers are candidly turned on by the idea of getting rich. Sean Parker, played by Justin Timberlake, famously tells his Facebook colleagues: \"You know what's cool? A billion dollars!\" In Middle Men, the grubby business of gouging cash out of internet porn users is very much to the fore. The movie shows an addle-brained geek become inspired by the online porn gold-rush and write, in about 15 minutes, the computer code needed to pay for anything on the net. The movie claims that this is the basic code still in use for all internet commerce, and I'm inclined to believe it. There's a similar \"eureka\" scene in The Social Network, but here Mark Zuckerberg is motivated by romantic agony and status shame, not money. The entrepreneurial porn magnates in Middle Men rig up their computer to buzz every time someone pays them $9.99 for their painfully slow provision of pre-broadband nudie pics. It's a fantastically crass yet funny and fascinating scene, and a compelling vision of the early days of Web 1.0, when people were still expected to pay for stuff, as opposed to the free-access world of Web 2.0, to which Facebook and its movie depiction The Social Network belong. Middle Men isn't a masterpiece, but as everyone in the media ponders the digital future, it's an interesting portrait of the digital past.",
