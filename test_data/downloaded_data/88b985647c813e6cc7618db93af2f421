The column I was supposed to write this week was a jealousy-filled pseudo-rant about my friends Alex and Josh and the amazing entrepreneurs ski trip to Verbier they organised, and which, at the last minute, I couldn't attend. The \"column I was supposed to write\" went on to say that, despite following the Twitter updates and the various other social media reports coming from the mountain, it could never be a substitute for actually being there; something that the makers of Second Life and any other \"virtual meeting technology\" would do well to realise. That column \u2013 the column I was supposed to write \u2013 was nearly finished. I was just waiting for the attendees \u2013 many of whom I've spent happy times travelling the world with \u2013 to get home so I could wrap the whole thing up with an amusing quote or two about what a ball they'd all had. Certainly, judging by their Twitter streams, it has been a brilliant trip. And then, late on Monday afternoon, the updates coming out of Verbier changed dramatically. Tom Boardman, co-founder of Firebox and one of the entrepreneurs on the trip, posted a series of messages saying that the weather on the mountain had taken a turn for the worst. Apparently, he'd only just managed to make it safe back to his chalet in total white-out conditions. He was worried, though, because Rob Williams and Jason Tavaria \u2013 the two founders of Dolphin Music \u2013 were still lost out in the blizzard. As time went on, the updates from Tom and the rest of the group became more and more frantic. As has now been widely reported, contact was eventually made with Jason and, using GPS coordinates from his iPhone, he was able to be rescued by the Verbier mountain rescue service. Rob was still missing but everyone seemed confident that he couldn't have strayed far from where he and Jason lost contact. Josh tweeted that he was ordering hot pizza ahead of their safe return. And then came the hideous silence. Abruptly the updates from the mountain stopped and Twittered requests for news went unanswered. Those of us who were in phone or text contact with the group were asked to keep the horrific news to ourselves until Rob's family had been contacted, but it didn't take a genius to figure out what the silence meant. Since confirmation of Rob's death was made public, numerous news outlets \u2013 including the Mail, the Telegraph, Sky News, the BBC and the Guardian \u2013 have reported the story. The Mail, curiously, chose to lead with the fact that \"Apprentice winner\" Michelle Dewberry was part of the group, as if a celebrity's horror at the events was somehow more important that that of all of his other friends on the trip, or somehow made the death of a 29-year-old man more newsworthy. But there was one key element of the story that all outlets could agree on: this was a very modern story about how \"micro\u2013blogging service\" Twitter was used to trigger a dramatic mountain rescue. Nonsense. Twitter may be popular and it may be sexy and it may have news editors salivating at the chance to name-check it on their front pages, but it had nothing whatsoever to do with the rescue of Jason. GPS, his iPhone, some quick thinking by other members of the group, and the skill and professionalism of the Verbier mountain rescue service take all of the credit there. Likewise, with the exception of trying to track down Rob's mobile number (eventually found on his website), social networking played no part in \"triggering\" the attempt to rescue him. If any technology deserves credit here, then it's the myriad electronic tools the mountain rescue service had at their disposal. No \u2013 at its core, Rob's tragic \u2013 and tragically young \u2013 death is a human story, not a digital one. And yet, that's not to say that the role of Twitter doesn't deserve examination, and credit. It deserves both \u2013 but in their enthusiasm to somehow cram the latest techno-news fad into their stories, most journalists failed to realize why. Horrible accidents happen every day around the world. So much so that, as humans, we've learned to filter out the emotions we're supposed to feel about them, unless we are somehow directly involved. In our heads, we know a plane crash in Africa is tragic, but unless we knew anyone on board, we find it hard to actually feel empathy in our hearts for the victims. It's this same need for a personal connection that has made Jade Goody the country's most famous cancer patient \u2013we all feel like we know her so her plight feels real to us \u2013 and it's the same need that lead the Mail, to their shame, to focus on Michelle's presence in Verbier. Most Mail readers didn't know Rob, but they feel like they know Michelle \u2013 so they decide to run a photograph of her, and not him. I didn't know Rob either, but the fact that his accident so directly affected so many of my friends made the events feel horribly real from the outset. What was remarkable though is how many other people \u2013 people with absolutely no real connection whatsoever to members of the group \u2013 became emotionally involved in the search, simply because they followed Alex, or Josh, or Tom or Michelle or any of the others on Twitter. Countless people \"retweeted\" the updates from the mountain, others expressed real concern when things went quiet, and many, many more expressed their heart-felt sorrow when the worst was confirmed. It's easy to argue, as one friend did yesterday, that there was an element of voyeurism involved, like a real life episode of \"999\" being played out with social media. There certainly was \u2013 but that's only half of it. Like Facebook, and to a lesser extent MySpace, Twitter encourages users to use their real names and photos when registering and to post real updates about they are really doing at any given time. As a result, even if we have never met many of the people we \"follow\", we feel engaged, on some level, with their lives. These people become almost micro-micro celebrities to us, with even their most mundane activities \u2013 buying bread, going skiing \u2013 becoming utterly fascinating, if only for 15 seconds. As we cast our online social net wider and wider, so the odds increase that when a tragic event occurs, we'll have a connection \u2013 no matter how small \u2013 to someone involved. And, as was made clear this week, these increased connections with our fellow human beings bring an increased sense of empathy when bad things happen to them. A small example: I Twittered a slightly tasteless joke about Leah Betts the other day and immediately felt horrible about it \u2013 not because I know anyone who knew her, but because, thanks to technology, I feel like I could do. She wasn't just a face in a newspaper, she was a real human being \u2013 and that changes the rules. A bigger example: this time last year, at the SXSW festival in Austin, Mark Zuckerberg was mocked for saying that, by bringing together Israelis and Palestinian teenagers, Facebook could contribute to bringing peace to the Middle East. \"Oh, please,\" we all groaned. But, you know what, I'm starting to think he had a point. When you connect with people, and start to understand them, it's much, much harder to feel blind hatred. Social media may not have averted tragedy this week, and I can't imagine amount of well wishing from strangers can take away the sense of loss that Rob's family and friends must be feeling now. But hopefully they can take some comfort in the fact that, thanks to Twitter, those well wishes aren't the usual platitudes expressed by strangers but a genuinely felt sense of shock and sympathy over a good and inspiringly successful man's life, cut so tragically short. Twitter is making us all care just a little bit more \u2013 and a little bit more genuinely \u2013 about strangers, and that can only be a good thing. After all, there but for the grace of God goes any one of us. Paul Carr is author of Bringing Nothing To The Party: True Confessions of a New Media Whore. He blogs at paulcarr.com",
