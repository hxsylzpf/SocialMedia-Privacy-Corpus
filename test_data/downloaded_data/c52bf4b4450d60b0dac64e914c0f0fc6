Hatcher has instructed law firm Schillings to issue libel proceedings against the newspaper over the allegations, which she denies. \"The legal proceedings will concern recent articles which Ms Hatcher maintains falsely alleged that she engages in sex romps on a regular basis with a series of men in a VW van parked outside her LA home for this purpose,\" said Schillings in a statement issued today. Schillings added that the actor \"bitterly refutes\" the allegations, which have been repeated extensively abroad. The law firm said the case would go to trial at the high court next year, if it is not settled earlier. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
