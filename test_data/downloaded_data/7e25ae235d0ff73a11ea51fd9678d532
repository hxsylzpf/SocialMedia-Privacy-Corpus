  "content": "We're closing this live blog now but coverage of the Leveson report will continue on Friday. In the meantime here's a round up of Thursday's main developments: \u2022 David Cameron has rejected the central point of Lord Justice Leveson's report into the press: that a new press regulator should be recognised by law. The PM told the Commons that legislation could ultimately infringe on free speech and a free press. However, he did say that the status quo was not an option and that he would only give the press a limited amount of time to set up a new regulatory system. \u2022 Nick Clegg, breaking with precedent, delivered his own statement to the Commons saying he was convinced of the need for legislation. Ed Miliband also said he backed statutory underpinning of a new regulator. Cross-party talks between the three leaders are due to begin this afternoon. \u2022 Following cross party talks a government source said that work will soon start on the drafting of a Leveson bill. But the source told Sky News that this was only being done to demonstrate how difficult it would be to implement Leveson's recommendation for statutory underpinning of a new regulator. \u2022 Hacked Off, the campaign group that represents many of the victims of press intrusion and phone hacking, said the prime minister had not done his job and called for Leveson's recommendations to be implemented in full. Ed Blum, a spokesman for the group, said Cameron had \"ripped out the heart and soul\" of Leveson's report by rejecting legislation. \u2022 Leveson called for a new press watchdog to replace the PCC, independent of the press and politicians, but underpinned by statute. He said the legislation to set this up should also explicitly protect the freedom of the press. It should be able to levy fines of up to \u00a31m and carry out investigations off its own back. It should also have an arbitration process for civil legal claims. Membership would not be legally obligatory, but Leveson recommends that if publishers opt out they should be regulated by Ofcom. He rejected the Hunt-Black self-regulation proposals many in the industry had been hoping to adopt. \u2022 The judge said he felt phone hacking was not confined to one or two people. He said famous people also had rights to privacy. He condemned covert surveillance. \u2022 The report said that Jeremy Hunt, the former culture secretary, handled the News Corporation bid for full control of BSkyB properly and that he was not appointed with the intention of helping the bid go through. The business secretary, Vince Cable, escapes with low-key censure for the way in which he spoke to perceived constituents about declaring \"war on Murdoch\". \u2022 Leveson said there was a perception senior Metropolitan police figures were too close to News International. But he found no evidence that decisions to limit the hacking inquiry were due to undue influence and corruption, and did not challenge the police's integrity. He said it should be mandatory for chief police officers to record and publish their contacts with the media. Thanks for reading and for your comments below. The Guardian's lead story on Friday reports that David Cameron found himself accused of betrayal by the victims of phone hacking and isolated from his coalition partners when he opposed Leveson's proposal to underpin a new independent press regulator with legislation. The paper's editorial states that Leveson's report is \"an immensely seriously argued and comprehensive document.\" The prime minister, who commissioned it and who has had very little time in which to study it, should think carefully before dismissing significant parts of it. The press should treat it with respect \u2013 and not a little humility. (...) He doesn't tar all journalists with the same brush, but nor does he accept that there was one rogue reporter, or even one rogue newspaper group. He describes a widespread indifference to ethical concerns, professional standards, or the effects of intrusion, whether criminal or legal. The cumulative picture \u2013 from phone-hacking through to the \"industrial\" use of private detectives, with no legitimate case by numerous titles \u2013 is darker than anyone can have suspected at the start of the inquiry. There will be many in the press who disagree with the judge's conclusions, but no journalist should fool themselves. The fact that the industry is now threatened with statutory controls is no one else's fault. My colleague Dan Sabbagh writes that while Cameron met the demands of the press to oppose statutory regulation, the often squabbling newspaper industry must now try to find the best way forward. My colleague Esther Addley has also compiled a summary of the key points of the inquiry report. Former Sunday Times editor Harold Evans commends Leveson for delivering a clever report but questions why he has failed to tackle the issue of media ownership: The biggest disappointment in Leveson is how far he skates over the crucial issue of ownership. It matters very much that the law on competition was broken by Margaret Thatcher's participation in 1981 in a secret deal by which Times Newspapers came under News International's control. All Leveson's fine language in his report about the need for future transparency is justified by the vaguest of references to what made it necessary in the first place. It surely matters a great deal that the greatest concentration of the British press was achieved by a backroom deal that gave News International such sway over British public life. My colleague David Leigh suggests that Leveson is \"highly cautious, even timorous\" on how the power of some media proprietors might be curbed. Here's my colleague Vikram Dodd's report on Leveson's recommendations about the relationship between the press and the police. He writies that Leveson warns police whistleblowers against going to journalists with stories and instead advises them to seek out other \"confidential avenues in which they may have faith\", such as the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The report also calls for a record kept of meetings between journalists and police chiefs, as well as tighter curbs on media briefings. David Cameron has been accused of \"ripping the heart and soul\" out of Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry, writes my colleague Sam Jones. He adds that the prime minister's rejection of the judge's recommendation for a statutory body to oversee the new independent press regulator has been taken as a betrayal of victims of press abuse. Speaking at a press conference organised by the Hacked Off campaign, the filmmaker Ed Blum \u2013 himself a victim of hacking \u2013 accused Cameron of abandoning those he had pledged to help. (...) Mark Lewis, the solicitor who represents a number of phone-hacking victims, including the family of the murdered teenager Milly Dowler, said some of his clients were struggling to understand the prime minister's behaviour. John Tulloch, who was injured in the 7/7 bombings and subsequently had his phone hacked, told my colleague Amelia Hill he was disgusted with Cameron's failure to back Leveson's findings: I'm disgusted with the prime minister and very disappointed. ... Cameron has undoubtedly sided with the [press] barons and that's outrageous. The Guardian's media commentator Roy Greenslade warns Leveson to expect a rising torrent of criticism from the right wing press: Some editors may be prepared to accept the force of Leveson's arguments, though they will wish to explore in more detail exactly what happens should Ofcom be displeased with the regulator. No journalist will take even a \"dab of statute\" lying down. But we can expect rightwing papers to take to the barricades. They will rail against the statutory element. Expect headlines of hate about Leveson along with more conspiracy theories about the people who formed the judge's team of assessors. The Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Express and The Sun will not be happy with the Leveson proposals. They will read them as a way of curbing their freedoms. (...) For the moment, newspaper editors outraged by an inhibition to the freedom will use the best weapon at their disposal \u2013 their skill at making propaganda for their own cause. Too much can be made of newspapers' influence over their readers' views. It is highly doubtful that people vote as their papers tell them, for instance. But popular papers can be very persuasive indeed when they hammer away single-mindedly at a subject day after day, week after week. They have the capability to create a compelling narrative that brooks no opposition. They have already sought to turn \"Leveson\" into a dirty word. More press ordure will be poured over him as his name is used as a short-form for censorship. He will be excoriated as a press freedom denier. Leveson says that some newspapers seem ready to relax their attitude towards harassment when they are pursuing a big story. It seems that where a story is too big, as in the case of the McCanns, or where a readership's interest in a celebrity is too great, as in the case of Mr Grant, the general principles applied to avoid harassment are relaxed, or even set to one side. But he added that most newspapers do check photographs submitted to them to see whether they follow ethical practice: The preponderance of the evidence provided by newspaper photo-editors suggested that most newspaper titles do scrutinise the photographs submitted to them by agencies and freelancers, do reject those photographs which appear to have been taken in breach of the Editors' Code, and do seek to regulate the behaviour of their employed photographers. Leveson confirms that Coulson was being paid by News International whilst working for the Tories:  There has been speculation as to whether Mr Coulson had continued to be paid by News International whilst working for the Conservative Party. Disclosure by Mr Coulson of a compromise agreement by which his employment with News Group Newspapers Limited was terminated explained what had happened. Mr Coulson did not resign unilaterally without regard to his contractual entitlements. His employment was terminated on terms which he agreed with his employer and which were set out in the compromise agreement. Mr Coulson was paid in lieu of his employer's contractual notice period and compensated for the termination of his employment. The sums due to him pursuant to the compromise agreement were paid in two tranches, the second of which was in November 2007, after Mr Coulson had started work for the Conservative Party. He also received a quantity of restricted News Corp stock units which vested in him in August 2007, again after the commencement of his employment with the Conservative Party. In other words, Mr Coulson did receive both cash and shares from his former employer whilst he was working for the Conservative Party, but these were payments made in respect of the termination of his employment with News International and agreed at the time of his departure from that company. There was no evidence that he was receiving a retainer from News International whilst he worked for the Conservative Party. Leveson is highly critical of the cosy relationship that exists between the press and politicians: In these relationships, there is what I have described as an inevitable 'trading' element. The politicians have exclusive news and exclusive relationships, private advocacies and personal titbits to offer; and, in return, the press has partisanship, personal favours, the protection of sources and not holding to account. Potential promises and threats hang in the air. It all means, in short, that politicians have a particular susceptibility to being lobbied when they get close to the opinion-makers of the press.  The public, in turn, stand to be the losers. They have a reason to worry that public debate may be being manipulated behind their backs, public policy decided unaccountably, and the ethics of both press and politicians compromised in the process. He recommends there should be a record of contacts between politicians and newspaper editors, their junior political colleagues, newspaper owners, and senior executives:  As I have said, while the focus must be firmly on the policy-makers and decision-takers, and while it is important to leave plenty of unrestricted space for the ordinary transactions of political journalism, the public would be entitled to be sceptical if measures designed to increase transparency were circumvented by the use of third-party agents or 'back channels'. Needless to say, these measures should apply to such third party agents only where they are acting in that capacity, that is to say on behalf of their principals in matters of policy. Leveson suggests that this record should also include opposition front bench spokesmen, meetings between politicians, media principals and their \"agents\". Here's what the Guardian's Michael White has to say on the issue: What Leveson seeks to force out of the shadows ... [is] ... no more back door visits to No 10 for Murdoch or the Mail's Paul Dacre. No one complained about that in the Commons on Thursday afternoon. The dividing line is between Lib-Lab pressure for a statutory floor under the Leveson model of regulation and Tory fears that a Pandora's box bill will cripple a free press. In 2012 it is more ideological than venal. The Financial Times' editorial on the Leveson report describes it as \"a damning indictment of the culture and practices of the newspaper industry.\" The first task must be to fix the industry's broken system of regulation, which contributed to the excesses documented by Lord Justice Leveson. The Press Complaints Commission has palpably failed to protect the public. While it was never created to tackle criminal behaviour, the PCC suffered from being dominated by industry insiders and serving editors. But it supports Cameron's opposition to state regulation: The bigger conundrum is how to ensure that the whole industry signs up to a system that is nominally voluntary. ... [Leveson's] novel idea is to encourage participation through incentives, notably by offering some protection against excessive legal costs in libel actions. This form of arbitration has merit, though it comes at a price. The functions of the new regulator would have to be enshrined in statute, with some entity given the power to oversee the mechanism. In this case, Lord Justice Leveson recommends considering Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, for this role. The sweetener, at least in the judge's view, would be a recognition in the new law that the government has a duty to promote press freedom. The Financial Times has reservations about this approach. While there may be merit in a grand bargain that trades the incentives to participate for some measure of statutory underpinning, the idea of handing oversight power to Ofcom is wrong-headed. Ofcom is charged with regulating television broadcasters that have a legal obligation to impartiality. It reports directly to government. This is a step down the road towards state licensing of a press that, of course, has no obligation to provide balance. This newspaper is also worried about Lord Justice Leveson's proposals for a \"backstop regulator\" that would step in if news organisations did not join the new body. This explodes the concept of voluntarism that lies at the centre of his recommendations. It is a press law by the back door and one that pays scant attention to the revolutionary changes in the media landscape. This is increasingly dominated by digital innovators and social media. Leveson says he is not wholly opposed to journalists paying for information, but he raises particular concern about newspapers paying for intrusive 'kill and tell' stories. I should make it absolutely clear that I am not advocating the banning of payments for information, even payments for private information. What concerns me is the degree to which some newspapers appear to rely on the provision of private information to fill their pages, and therefore actively encourage the disclosure of private information via eye-catching advertisements which offer monetary reward. This approach risks the wholesale disclosure of private information without consideration of the public interest in doing so. Even if the newspaper does not subsequently publish the disclosed information, the disclosure is itself a breach of privacy. While Leveson praises the Guardian's stance of not paying for stories, he says this does not mean it is the only legitimate approach to the issue, particularly when the information bought is in the public interest. The Guardian's approach is admirable and, by adopting a hard line on payments for information, the risk of fabrication and/or exaggeration is substantially limited. However, in saying that, I should not be interpreted as saying that the Guardian's approach is the only legitimate approach and should therefore be adopted by all titles. As noted above, the Daily Telegraph paid a substantial sum of money for the information which led to the MPs' expenses scandal and I have made no criticism of the Telegraph's decision to pay that money. I accept that there may be many circumstances in which payments for information are justified in the public interest. The evidence received by the Inquiry suggests that some improvements have been introduced to address the supervision of cash payments, but there was certainly some evidence to suggest that more could be done in some titles. Without engaging in the evidence relating to payments to public officials, which for reasons already described cannot be addressed in any detail, it is not possible to conclude in this Report that the supervision and control of cash payments is a practice for which the press, or parts of the press, deserve criticism as a whole. On the matter of independent regulation, Leveson stresses that he wants the press to organise such a system. But he adds he believes it needs to be backed up by legislation to ensure the press is fully accountable. I repeat the refrain that what I want is for the industry to come together to organise their own independent regulatory system. If they cannot agree on a single regulatory system, I have left the door open, however undesirable it might be, to there being more than one such independent regulatory system. As for the challenge that this goes too far, I simply do not accept that these provisions will have a chilling effect on free speech or press freedom. Neither do I accept that politicians will be more willing and able to amend the provisions which I have suggested (as opposed to legislating afresh which is always open to them). I reject the suggestion that it will cause a degeneration of the rights of the press or a descent into state control. I have made it clear that I firmly believe it is in the best interest of the public and the industry that an independent self organised regulatory body is set up, and recognised in statute ... Given the public appetite for some accountability of the press, I do not think that either the victims or the public would understand if the industry did not grasp this opportunity.  Unfortunately there may be some in the industry who it presently appears would not consider going beyond the present PCC proposals ... It would be a great pity if the intransigence of a few resulted in the imposition of a system which everyone in the industry has said they do not want and which, in all probability, very few others would actually want to see in place. Leveson also raises concern about the adverse influence a newspaper's worldview can have on its reporting The fusion of news and comment in the press is not necessarily a practice that is harmful or worthy of criticism. What is harmful and what is worthy of criticism is a practice identified in sections of the press of prioritising the worldview of a title over the accuracy of a story. There can be no objection to agenda journalism (which necessarily involves the fusion of fact and comment), but that cannot trump a requirement to report stories accurately. On the future regulation of the press, Leveson concludes that self-regulation is not up to the task: From the outset, I have encouraged the industry to come together to create an independent regulatory regime that satisfies the need to provide public confidence. In my judgment, the proposals so far put forward by the industry do not do that ... they fail in respect of independence and inclusiveness. I have therefore set out a vision of a voluntary independent self-organised regulatory system that would provide an appropriate degree of independence from the industry, coupled with satisfactory powers to handle complaints, promote and enforce standards, and deal with dispute resolution. I have recommended a series of incentives that will provide benefits to those who sign up to the system ... In order to give effect to those incentives I have recommended legislation that underpins the independent self-organised regulatory system and facilitates its recognition in legal processes. This legislative proposal does no more than ensure an appropriate degree of independence and effectiveness on the part of the self-regulatory body if the incentives described are to be made use of. This is not, and cannot be characterised as, regulation of the press. If you can't bring yourself to plough through the 1,987 pages of the full Leveson report, we've put together a five-minute guide to its key recommendations. Christopher Jefferies, the former public school teacher whose arrest over the murder of Joanna Yeates sparked a tabloid frenzy, has criticised David Cameron for failing to back Leveson's recommendations. In an interview with ITV News, he says: I think he is very much mistaken. ... I mean the Prime Minister makes a great show of saying that he agrees with very much of what is in Lord Justice Leveson's report but he thinks it can be achieved without legislation. I think the Prime Minister leaves himself open to the accusation that what he is doing is simply once again, as too many Prime Ministers have done in the past, is bowing to illegitimate pressure from a body which does not want to have its power curtailed in any shape or form. Leveson concluded that some newspapers were knowingly inventing stories in a bid to boost their circulation: The Inquiry heard sufficient evidence to conclude that some sections of the press have deliberately invented stories with no factual basis in order to satisfy the demands of a readership. He had this to say about what made a story a 'big story': In respect of stories that become \"big stories\" followed by all the press, and generally involving crime or a very high profile individual, there is a tendency amongst large parts of the press to disregard the rule book. The pressure on journalists to deliver scoops can also exacerbate the problem, he adds: I have come to the conclusion that there does exist a cultural strand or tendency within a section of the press to practice journalism which on occasion is deliberately, recklessly or negligently inaccurate. In other words, this is not simply a matter of accidental (or co-incidental) understandable human error. The pressures I am particularly concerned about are of a different nature: specifically, the commercial and personal pressures operating on journalists in an extremely competitive market to be the first to achieve the 'scoop', to place a novel slant on a story which otherwise lacks punch, or at worst to manufacture the facts or detail of a story to maintain the interest of the readership. On the issue of confidential information, he says: Although there was no clear evidence that the press remain directly involved in the trade in confidential information, there was ample evidence to suggest that large parts of the press were willing to publish confidential, private or sensitive information, without regard to the impact on the individuals concerned and without consideration of the public interest. Adam Boulton of Sky News reports that the government has agreed to start work on drafting a Leveson bill. But the report added that a spokesman for the prime minister they were doing the work to show how difficult it would be to implement the recommendations of the report. Boulton said all three party leaders met to discuss the report and their areas of agreement. Where they continue to disagree is on whether politicians should legislate now. Culture Secretary Maria Miller told Channel 4 News that the cross party talks went well. The government has accepted in full the Leveson principles. We're moving forward to see how we put them in practice. We have grave concerns and that's why tonight we've started cross-party talks. I'm glad to say those talks went well. Leveson concludes there is evidence of systemic discrimination against ethnic minorities in the press: When assessed as a whole, the evidence of discriminatory, sensational or unbalanced reporting in relation to ethnic minorities, immigrants and/or asylum seekers, is concerning. Although the majority of the press appear to discharge this responsibility with care, there are enough examples of careless or reckless reporting to conclude that discriminatory, sensational or unbalanced reporting in relation to ethnic minorities, immigrants and/or asylum seekers is a feature of journalistic practice in parts of the press, rather than an aberration. The report avoids tackling complaints of media sexism leveled against The Sun's Page 3, contending theis was outside of the inquiry's remit: Dominic Mohan, the editor of The Sun, made a spirited defence of Page 3. He is not to be criticised for doing so, and many will feel that Page 3 of The Sun raises a taste and decency issue and none other. The impact of discriminatory or prejudicial representations of women in the Page 3 tabloids is difficult to judge. Suffice to say, that this Inquiry is not the place to analyse, let alone reach conclusions on these matters. That said, these are important and sensitive issues which merit further consideration by any new regulator. The point I am seeking to make at this stage is that I am alive to all the arguments and to the fact that, on what might be called the central ground, there is room for reasonable, opposing points of view. Leveson calls what happened with the Sun's coverage of the Hillsborough stadium disaster an \"egregious failure\": [It] exemplifies many of the concerns which have been ventilated in the inquiry, not the least in relation to the intrusion into grief and shock, but also in relation to accuracy. The experiences of the McCanns, the Dowlers and the Bowles family, all of which occurred much more recently [than Hillsborough], suggest that parts of the press can continue, on occasion, to display a cavalier attitude to intrusions into shock or grief\". It also underlines the enormous power of the press and, as a consequence, its absolute obligation to exercise that power responsibly. The press has real influence in our society and is given privileges in law in order to fulfill its function. The story underlines the need for a regulatory mechanism to challenge the press and to require it to justify itself. Lord Sugar has added his voice to those criticising Cameron for failing to accept Leveson's recommendations on future press regulation: My colleague Josh Halliday writes that Leveson proposed one key change to existing law that would affect how journalists use material \u2013 including ex-directory telephone numbers \u2013 that could be an invasion of someone's privacy. He wants the government to further restrict the public interest defence available to journalists under the Data Protection Act 1998. Presently, journalists are able to legally defend processing personal data if there is \"a view to publication\" and that the story is in the public interest. Leveson says this defence should be limited to occasions where it is \"necessary for publication\" and that the likely invasion of privacy is outweighed by the public interest. My colleague Owen Bowcott writes that changes to the DPA and 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act (Pace) proposed by Leveson could have far-reaching consequences for the way newspaper investigations handle information and protect their sources. Leveson calls for an increase in the maximum penalty available under section 55 of the Data Protection Act which governs data theft and makes it an offence \"knowingly or recklessly\" to obtain or disclose personal data. He also proposes narrowing the defence available to reporters, under section 32 of the act, for obtaining personal data for investigations so that it would only apply to journalistic information \"necessary for publication\" rather than material held with \"a view to publication\". The inquiry chairman concludes that the regulator lacks independence and the necessary clout to enforce its code of conduct or to punish those newspapers that break it. Constrained by serious structural deficiencies ... far from being an independent body ... barely given enough money to perform its key function of complaints handling ... has been seen to associate itself with the interests of the press ... failed to initiate its own investigations [or] investigate where press actions might give rise to a criminal charge or civil claim ... does not have sufficient powers to investigate alleged breaches of the code ... does not have adequate sanctions to dissuade newspapers from repeating their transgressions and satisfy complainants [who] tend to feel pressurised into accepting a negotiated settlement. Leveson goes on the criticise the PCC for dismissing the Guardian's investigation into phone hacking: The effect of the 2009 investigation was to alienate and anger the sole newspaper [the Guardian] which had taken this issue seriously. The report and a subsequent speech by Baroness Buscombe to the Society of Editors also angered Mr Taylor's former solicitor Mr Lewis to the extent that he successfully pursued proceedings for libel.  It was not too late, even in 2009, for the PCC to have been more open with the public and to have said that it lacked the powers and was not competent to carry out an effective investigation into allegations of phone hacking. That would have avoided the danger that politicians, the public and potential claimants might conclude that a competent regulator had investigated the allegations and found them to be baseless. It is completely unconvincing to contend that the PCC had to be seen to do something in order to maintain public confidence in the self-regulatory system. There was no public interest in the PCC purporting to exonerate the NoTW when it did not have the proper evidence to do so, still less to uphold the values of self-regulation. In particular as regards the disparaging conclusion about the Guardian, the PCC was clearly taking an enormous risk. That risk was that the situation would speedily unravel against it if (as happened) it was contradicted by subsequent events. Leveson is particularly damning of the regulator's failure to act over the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World: Nor did the PCC move to address in any meaningful sense the concerns raised by revelations of mobile phone voicemail hacking by journalists working at the NoTW in 2006  It was only following the sustained public outcry in response to continued revelations of phone hacking that the PCC announced that it intended to address the fundamental weaknesses in self-regulatory system. There is no reason why in principle the PCC should not have investigated or sought to publish a report into allegations of phone hacking. There were no pitfalls so long as the PCC was clear and open about the extent of the powers it had, the extent of the investigations it was able to carry out, and the nature of the investigations it had carried out. The 2007 and 2009 investigations, leading to the reports respectively entitled \"Report on Subterfuge and Newsgathering\" and \"Report on Phone Message Tapping Allegations\", both suffered from similar flaws. Ignoring the issue as to its ability to obtain accurate answers, the PCC did not ask the right questions to discover the true extent of the practice of phone hacking, or whether it was more widespread than had previously emerged; neither did it pay sufficient attention to evidence which suggested that what was being asserted was not the full picture. In both reports, the PCC concluded that there was no evidence that phone hacking was widespread, when at best it should have expressed itself in far more non-committal (if not wholly non committal) terms. In the 2009 report, there was the additional feature of the belittling of those who were contending that hacking was widespread. Leveson is clearly unimpressed with the PCC's track record: The self-presentation of the PCC as a competent regulator with adequate powers perpetuated the unsatisfactory status quo. The PCC gave the public a false impression of what it could do and never acknowledged the limitations of its powers. Through acquiescent silence, the PCC permitted policy-makers and the public to make mistaken assumptions about the breadth and depth of the powers and capacity of self-regulation. It is damning of the PCC that it was only when the system of regulation was under unprecedented scrutiny and extreme threat, that a programme of reform was announced that asked questions of import directed squarely at the system's failings. There is no evidence that even the most severe sanctions available to the PCC had a real impact on those who transgressed. Although much emphasis was placed on the editors' fear of an adverse adjudication, the impact of such an adjudication did not go beyond this; newspapers did not lose circulation as a consequence of criticism by the PCC nor is there much evidence that editors or journalists were disciplined in any significant manner or that their careers were in any way affected by PCC criticism. \u2022 On surveillance: It does appear that, in respect of the vast majority of the instances in which surveillance has been used, inadequate consideration has been given to whether such surveillance is itself justified in the public interest, let alone whether it is likely to produce any relevant information which  goes to a story which is being contemplated. Michael Wolff writing in GQ. He's not a fan: After nine months of hearings, the inquiry calls for a goopy, bureaucratic, obfuscating oversight board, which could be perilous to the freedom of the press or as likely toothless. And, in an extraordinary flourish, Lord Justice Leveson, a man of obvious stature but perhaps less-than-it-might-seem intellect, dismissed the entirety of the Internet, judging the impact of newspapers as \"uniquely powerful\" in a way that, he inexplicably suggested, the Internet was not. As an American, I have found it difficult to bridge the gap between our understanding of a free press and the British view. It is true that in America we have it easy. There is a constitutional prohibition against press regulation. \"Congress shall make no law\u2026\" Boom. No law. That's our default definition of a free press: it necessarily exists without the interference of politicians or government. We are therefore precluded from tinkering or fixing or trying to make it better. The press is as it is. Like nature. Or the marketplace. The Economist on why the Leveson report is already dated: Social media, blogs and news websites\u2014some of them run by newspapers\u2014are rising, bringing new problems. Should an offensive blog post be treated in the same way as an offensive article on a newspaper website? How about a comment\u2014or a tweet? Does it still make sense to regulate the press, as opposed to all public writing? The lawyers and politicians grappling with these questions got little guidance from Lord Justice Leveson, who describes online regulation as \"problematic\". His report already seems dated. John Rentoul at the Independent on the ensuing political tangle: Cameron understands the principle of a free press, and will defend it; Ed Miliband does not and will not. Cameron accepted the \"principles\" of the Leveson Report but will not legislate; Miliband accepted the lot and wants to force a vote in January to legislate. But Nick Clegg tried again to split the difference. He accepted more of the report than Cameron and less than Miliband, supporting legislation but disagreeing with Leveson about whether Ofcom is the right body to do the \"statutory verification\"... So I suspect that Miliband, Clegg and the State Regulation Conservatives will line up in favour of statutory regulation, and Cameron and the Free Press Labour MPs (such as Gerald Kaufman and Eric Joyce, although the latter is not currently Labour) will line up in favour of freedom of expression. Staying with nude royals for a moment, Leveson also looks at the issue of the topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge published overseas (and by the Irish Daily Star) but not in the UK: Nobody at all has suggested that publishing the photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge would be anything other than a breach of the [PCC] Code, notwithstanding the widespread availability of the images in other jurisdictions. So, at least for the Royal Family, widespread availability of an image on the internet on its own is not sufficient. There has to be some other public interest in publication of that image in order to justify it. For the Duchess, there clearly is not.  But that equally means that playing the card of widespread availability is not good enough in relation to the Prince Harry photographs either, particularly when the public interest points that arise from the Las Vegas holiday do not depend on sight of the photographs.  Nor can a distinction be drawn between the paparazzo who took the long lens photographs and whoever sold the mobile phone photographs in Las Vegas: both did what they did for money. True, the paparazzo was not known about and had not been trusted not to betray the confidence which followed the invitation to visit Prince Harry in his suite, but it is difficult to argue that this is not a distinction without a difference. Leveson reaches this weary conclusion about those pictures of Prince Harry cavorting naked in Las Vegas: The fact that something is on the internet does not justify its publication in a newspaper. The internet is an uncontrolled space with material upon it which I anticipate the Sun would not wish to publish because it is pornographic, racist or offends one of the many other codes of decency to which most people aspire.  In the context of this Inquiry, what this episode illuminates is the adequacy (or otherwise) of the mechanism for maintaining the standards to which the press loudly asserts it adheres. It has since been announced that, in the light of his deployment to Afghanistan, Prince Harry will not pursue a complaint but there was, in truth, no point in St James's Palace making a complaint to the PCC. If such a complaint was rejected, it will signal the very free for all based on what is available on the web; if one had been made and upheld, it is abundantly clear from the various press reports that followed the publication that the adjudication will be rejected and blamed on what is said to be the effect of the Inquiry. In truth, the moment has been lost and the right to publish effectively endorsed without the contrary argument having been analysed. To say that guidance will be issued in the future does not carry the issue any further. Mary Riddell at the Telegraph: As David Cameron (who emerges pretty unscathed from the inquiry) prepares for one of the most difficult decisions of his political life, all politicians should reflect on past legislation that once seemed a good idea. From the Dangerous Dogs Act to anti-terror laws, the statute book is blotted by misconceived bills that seemed, in the heat of outrage, to be burning necessities. Now, as press freedom faces its biggest test for centuries, politicians of every party should proceed with the greatest caution. Legislate in haste, repent at leisure. Gary Gibbon at Channel 4 News on Cameron and Clegg's uneasy unity: David Cameron looked up at Nick Clegg throughout the latter's statement to the House with a gooey respectfulness rarely seen since Nancy Reagan used to look doe-eyed upon her husband, the president. He nodded, when the arguments permitted. It was all meant to remind any doubters that the coalition continues as usual, it just happens to have two different stated ways forward on what it thinks is a central matter of politics and our national life. He raised his own doubts about some of the details of the Leveson proposals \u2013 is Ofcom the right body to regulate and are his data protection law changes a good idea? But he said he fundamentally approved of the central idea \u2013 strengthen self-regulation through statute. And so the question is how far he is willing to make mischief on that front with Labour and Tory rebels. James Forsyth at the Spectator wonders why Ed Miliband is so behind Leveson's proposals: Just before the statement, a visibly agitated Miliband walked over to Cameron to talk to him. When he rose to spoke, Miliband was passionate and sincere. But I do find it odd how keen Miliband is to simply take Leveson whole, saying that 'we should put our trust in Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations' and that he wanted Leveson 'accepted in its entirety. Carl Bernstein, one of the investigative journalists who broke the Watergate scandal, said the British press was right to resist legislation. He told Channel 4 News there were already enough laws in the UK to put journalists who hacked phones in jail. The answer is find the proper way to put them in jail for the horrible offences that they are guilty of, not to try and restrain free speech, freedom of the press - that is going to come back and bite British democracy in the ass because that is what this is about. It's an easy answer to a tough problem. Tom Mockridge, who replaced Rebekah Brooks as CEO of News International, has put out this statement: We are grateful to Lord Justice Leveson for his thorough and comprehensive report, and will be studying its recommendations and comments in detail. As a company we are keen to play our full part, with others in our industry, in creating a new body that commands the confidence of the public. We believe that this can be achieved without statutory regulation \u2013 and welcome the prime minister's rejection of that proposal.  We accept that a new system should be independent, have a standards code, a means of resolving disputes, the power to demand prominent apologies and the ability to levy heavy fines. We have spent 18 months reflecting upon these issues and are determined to move on as soon as possible with others in our sector to set up a new body that will ensure British journalism is both responsible and robust. Leveson says the Daily Mail went too far when it accused Hugh Grant of a \"mendacious smear\": The various written submissions of ANL [Associated Newspapers Limited] maintained that the adjective 'mendacious' possesses a number of possible meanings, and argued that the term taken in context and properly understood in law amounts to nothing more than 'honest comment'. In my judgment, however, reading the article in the manner in which I have been invited, the Daily Mail was accusing Mr Grant of lying. Mr Grant would only be lying if, in speculating as he did, he did not believe that his evidence had any foundation.  However, equally in my judgment, in making that accusation the Daily Mail was increasing the temperature and went too far. [Editor Paul] Dacre ... acted precipitately, in particular in failing to ascertain exactly what Mr Grant had said when he testified. A response which defended the Mail's position in regard to phone hacking and stating words to the effect that Mr Grant's speculation was just wrong, while robustly defending the Mail's position, would have achieved the same outcome without the accusation of perjury. Of course, Mr Dacre was perfectly entitled to decide what he wanted to put in the paper for which he had ultimate editorial control. He is entitled to challenge my view (as he has in robust and trenchant terms). As far as I am concerned, however, the point of this case study is that it is a good example of the phenomenon of 'aggressive defence' identified above. Speaking in the House of Lords this afternoon, Lord Black of Brentwood, Chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance said: There is much in the Leveson principles we agree on and they can be fully deployed in the industry's own proposals. As the Report says on p. 1768: \"There is no reason why [the industry] model should not be capable of adaptation to meet the requirements set down here \u2026 if the other \u2026 changes around independence and effectiveness were made.\" I concur. Could I finally echo the great caution he expressed about the role of the statutory regulator OFCOM in the new system? Such involvement may sound benign but it is state control by any other name. Could I draw his attention to para 6.16 of Volume IV of the report which states that \"the recognition body would be required to determine whether the standards code meets the statutory requirements\".That would take a state regulator to the very heart of the newsroom. Would he agree with me that, if the industry can make rapid progress in the task of establishing a new system, such a move would not be just be profoundly dangerous but completely unnecessary? Charles Dance as Paul Dacre. Hugh Bonneville as Hugh Grant. Mark Gatiss as, um, Rebekah Brooks. Guardian Film's casting for Leveson the movie mustn't be missed... Here is Leveson's conclusion on phone hacking, blagging, and other illegal or unethical practices: The slow and often inadequate response by large parts of the press to the widely known practice of phone hacking, considered alongside the inadequate response to the Operation Motorman revelations, indicates an industry which, in general, did not find it noteworthy or particularly problematic that parts of the press were regularly breaching individual privacy, not to mention the criminal law. In addition, the fact that large parts of the press continue to employ private investigators to carry out covert surveillance without any clear public interest supports the conclusion that... the press retains a casual (or less than robust) attitude to the use of unethical methods of acquiring private information. I have concluded that the evidence seen and heard by the Inquiry is inconclusive, or insufficient, to find that bribery and corruption, blagging, theft and/or email hacking are cultural problems within the press today but there is sufficient arising out of what has been said and the present criminal investigation to merit concern. This is what Leveson writes about the controversy over the Sun's revelations about Gordon and Sarah Brown's son's illness: [Then-Sun editor Rebekah] Brooks is to be criticised in two interconnected respects, but only to the extent necessary to address the culture, practices and ethics of the press. I do not find (as Mrs Brooks asserted) that the Browns were absolutely committed to making the fact of their four month old son's illness public, nor do I accept that their press release the night before publication evidences that fact. However, it should be made clear that I am not thereby holding that Mrs Brooks deliberately misled the Inquiry. Mrs Brown is highly unlikely to have said anything expressly along the lines that she was \"absolutely committed\" to making the fact of their son's illness public, and insofar as Mrs Brooks drew that inference from Mrs Brown's acquiescence or failure to remonstrate, she is guilty of a degree of blinkeredness if not self persuasion. Had she stopped to place herself in Mrs Brown's situation, she would have begun to understand the predicament in which she had been placed. In all the circumstances, Mrs Brooks should have asked a series of direct questions of Mrs Brown to satisfy herself that consent was fully and freely given, and should have given her the express option of vetoing publication.  The mayor of London, a fierce critic of statutory regulation, has backed David Cameron's stance on Leveson. Speaking from a visit to India, Johnson said: I haven't read all of Lord [Justice] Leveson's report but I have got the gist of it and I must say that the tenor of what the prime minister has said this afternoon is absolutely right. I think he puts his finger on the real difficulty of framing any sort of legislation to underpin the independent commission that would end up bettering the freedom of the press. That for me is the key difficulty and the prime minister has got it right. Kate McCann, the mother of missing child Madeleine, said she hoped the Leveson report would \"mark the start of a new era\" for the press, in which it treats those in the news \"with care and consideration\". Leveson writes of former Daily Express editor Peter Hill and owner Richard Desmond: Overall the justifications advanced by Messrs Hill and Desmond for the frankly appalling treatment of the McCanns were, as has been clearly demonstrated, both self-serving and without foundation.  Leveson writes of Paul Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail: Although Mr Dacre does not merit being singled out in this regard, his belief that his journalists were acting lawfully is something of a concern and certainly ought to have been put into question by the Operation Motorman disclosures ... In fairness to Associated Newspapers Ltd, I accept that it would have been impossible to investigate or discipline employees so many years after the events in question. A fairer criticism of these titles relates to the lack of any investigation at an earlier stage. Here is Leveson on \"blagging\" information: Looking at blagging more widely, it is impossible to reach any firm conclusions. Blagging has been a practice of some considerable pedigree and extent. It certainly formed part of the culture, practices and ethics of the press for many years and was frequently not justified by the public interest. Is it plausible that such an ingrained practice has been totally eliminated, except where justified by the public interest? The short answer, notwithstanding the paucity of recent evidence bearing on any particular title, is no. Here is Leveson on Express owner Richard Desmond: Mr Desmond revealed what I consider to be a very disturbing philosophical approach to the concepts of free speech and a free press. For him, at the end of the day, the issue was all about free speech and the threat of excessive regulation. On this approach, press standards and ethics were close to being irrelevant. Mr Desmond had made that clear towards the start of his evidence, when he disputed that ethical lines could be drawn. Finally, it should be noted in this context that Mr Desmond was inclined to blame the PCC for failing to give his paper guidance rather than accept that his editor should accept at least some responsibility.  Leveson on the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone and the cause of the \"false hope\" moment: Whereas it is true that a definitive conclusion is not possible on the existing state of the evidence, and may never be, the Inquiry does conclude on the lower standard of proof of the balance of probabilities that tampering with or illegal interception of Milly Dowler's voicemail was not the cause of the 'false hope moment': this resulted from nothing less banal than the automatic deletion of messages in the ordinary course of the workings of the system.  But it remains worthwhile to underline that the essential gravamen of the Guardian's original story of 4 July 2011, namely that Milly Dowler's phone was hacked by or on the instructions of journalists employed by the NoTW, was correct, and is now the subject of criminal charges. Harris, a partner at Mishcon de Reya who represented 7/7 victim John Tulloch as well as phone hacking victims Sky Andrew, Ulrika Jonsson and Mark Oaten, wrote in a statement: Mishcon de Reya welcomes the recommendation of an independent self-regulatory body governed by an independent board. We likewise welcome the categorical statement that neither government nor parliament should be involved in regulating the press. However, the Report also provokes pressing questions. The recommendations must be backed up in statute, but will this be by tinkering with existing legislation or creating new legislation? The absence of a draft bill or draft code are both notable - even more so is the lack of a statutory timetable. Lord Justice Leveson made it clear the ball is now in the politicians' court. For the inquiry to serve its purpose, addressing the culture, practices and ethics of the press and protecting individuals as well as free speech, it must not be kicked in the long grass. Here are today's key points so far: \u2022 David Cameron has rejected the central point of Lord Justice Leveson's report into the press: that a new press regulator should be recognised by law. The PM told the Commons that legislation could ultimately infringe on free speech and a free press. However, he did say that the status quo was not an option and that he would only give the press a limited amount of time to set up a new regulatory system. \u2022 Nick Clegg, breaking with precedent, delivered his own statement to the Commons saying he was convinced of the need for legislation. Ed Miliband also said he backed statutory underpinning of a new regulator. Cross-party talks between the three leaders are due to begin this afternoon. \u2022 Hacked Off, the campaign group that represents many of the victims of press intrusion and phone hacking, said the prime minister had not done his job and called for Leveson's recommendations to be implemented in full. Ed Blum, a spokesman for the group, said Cameron had \"ripped out the heart and soul\" of Leveson's report by rejecting legislation. \u2022 Leveson called for a new press watchdog to replace the PCC, independent of the press and politicians, but underpinned by statute. He said the legislation to set this up should also explicitly protect the freedom of the press. It should be able to levy fines of up to \u00a31m and carry out investigations off its own back. It should also have an arbitration process for civil legal claims. Membership would not be legally obligatory, but Leveson recommends that if publishers opt out they should be regulated by Ofcom. He rejected the Hunt-Black self-regulation proposals many in the industry had been hoping to adopt. \u2022 The judge said he felt phone hacking was not confined to one or two people. He said famous people also had rights to privacy. He condemned covert surveillance. \u2022 The report said that Jeremy Hunt, the former culture secretary, handled the News Corporation bid for full control of BSkyB properly and that he was not appointed with the intention of helping the bid go through. The business secretary, Vince Cable, escapes with low-key censure for the way in which he spoke to perceived constituents about declaring \"war on Murdoch\". \u2022 Leveson said there was a perception senior Metropolitan police figures were too close to News International. But he found no evidence that decisions to limit the hacking inquiry were due to undue influence and corruption, and did not challenge the police's integrity. He said it should be mandatory for chief police officers to record and publish their contacts with the media. \u2022 On failure in News International governance: Lord Justice Leveson writes that there was a \"serious failure of governance within the NotW, NI and News Corporation\" when the company secretly settled a phone-hacking claim brought by PFA chairman Gordon Taylor in 2008. In a passage helpfully described as \"Who knew what?\", Leveson says: \"There was a failure on the part of the management at the NoTW to take appropriate steps to investigate whether there was evidence of wrongdoing within the organisation. Although I endorse the right of any business to seek to protect its reputation, it surely must first take every step to get to the bottom of what had happened.\" He adds that, if the evidence of Rupert and James Murdoch is correct, then \"one or more parts of the management at the NoTW was engaged in a determined cover-up to keep relevant information about potential  criminal activity within the organisation from senior management within NI.\" \u2022 On industry inaction over phone-hacking rumours: Leveson talks of \"minimal steps\" being taken and \"serious concerns\" about hacking as an industry \"in joke\", writes Mark Sweney. It is to my mind both striking and of serious concern that despite that knowledge and the rumours circulating through Fleet Street, nothing public was said or done about this issue beyond a series of 'in-jokes' at award ceremonies and unguarded references in memoirs. Further, in the aftermath of convictions which definitively established that phone hacking had occurred within at least one title, minimal steps were taken within the industry to identify whether phone hacking had occurred elsewhere or to investigate the extent of these practices.  The lethargy on the part of the industry to recognise the gravity of this conduct, the reticence in conducting thorough investigations in relation to past and present conduct of journalists and the lack of a rather clearer steer from editors than has been evidenced, is disappointing and tends to support the view that phone hacking was simply not taken seriously by the industry. It is not difficult to imagine what the reaction of the press would have been if a similar scandal had been exposed in another industry. Leveson criticises Northern &amp; Shell for taking \"inadequate steps\" to look into hacking at its titles. Leveson says of the fact that Nicole Patterson, head of legal at Express Newspapers, said that no analysis was done of financial records to see if Mulcaire or his associated companies had been used by Northern &amp; Shell. Some form of investigation could easily have identified whether journalists had used Mr Mulcaire to obtained information. This is not to suggest that phone hacking did take place at any of the Northern &amp; Shell titles; the point being made is that inadequate steps were taken  to establish that it had not. Leveson raises issues about ex-Mirror man James Hipwell's credibility, given his criminal record and the \"real risk that he bears a grudge towards his former employer\", but nonetheless says his account of phone hacking at the Mirror was \"clear, firm and convincing\". \"His evidence cannot do more than serve to demonstrate that phone hacking as a practice may well have been occurring at the Mirror titles when Mr Hipwell was working there [1998 to 2000]\". Overall, the available evidence does not allow me to conclude to the requisite standard of proof that the practice of phone hacking occurred at any specific individual title other than the NoTW and, to the extent already discussed, the Mirror titles. In my view the evidence which the Inquiry has received, viewed in the round, strongly suggests that phone hacking was a practice which, over the period from the late 1990s to the arrest of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire in 2006, was occurring within the industry on a more than localised basis. The nature of the evidence currently available does not permit any more robust conclusion. Save for the evidence relating to the Mirror titles which has already been examined, it is not possible, and indeed is unnecessary, to seek to identify particular titles or to quantify the extent of the practice. To speak only of rumours being rife underplays the extent of the understanding and knowledge. \u2022 On Dominic Mohan: Leveson says it is not possible to reach \"critical conclusions\" about Mohan's evidence, but that \"aspects of it gave cause for concern\". \u2022 Leveson on his measuring his own role I have always been keenly aware of the dangers of going too far; and I have been continually reminded as the Inquiry has progressed. In short, it has not been difficult for me to remain alive to this critical risk. I go further. The public interest in a press which is free, which is viable, and which is diverse cannot be too highly valued. Without investigative journalism, and the ability of the press to scour hidden places, the domain of the powerful, for potential wrongdoing, our democracy would be severely impoverished. Nothing I shall recommend will fail to hold to these principles. \u2022 On the Dowlers: Subjected to intrusive and insensitive press reporting at a time of intense personal distress. Such was the appetite in certain sections of the press to acquire information and photographs which would enable 'the story' to be kept alive as one of ongoing human interest to readers, these sections of the press often overlooked the privacy rights and personal feelings of the Dowler family. Thus, the family came to be treated as little more than a commodity in which the press had an unrestricted interest. \u2022 On the McCanns: By the summer of 2007 what begun as a sympathetic approach by the press to an ongoing personal tragedy had altered ... Like the Dowlers, the McCanns were treated as if they were a commodity in which the public, and by extension the press, had an interest or stake that effectively trumped their individual rights to privacy, dignity or basic respect. The press believed that the public's legitimate interest in the story was insatiable, and that belief required it to sustain that interest by following every possible development or turn, however implausible or apparently defamatory. Also like the Dowlers, the McCanns were the victims of grossly intrusive reporting, prying photographers and an ongoing 'media scrum' which paid little or no regard to their personal space, their own personal distress and, in particular, the interests of Madeleine's younger siblings. \u2022 On Hugh Grant and the Daily Mail: The day after he had appeared before the Inquiry, on 22 November 2011, the Daily Mail published a piece which accused Mr Grant of making a 'mendacious smear' against the Mail titles. It is of value because it is a good example of the strategy of 'defensive attack' (although the Mail titles argue that the story was entirely justified) which itself represents a strand within the culture of the press. It is also of interest since the relevant evidence grew out of the Inquiry's proceedings themselves. Salmond claims Leveson's proposals are close to his own, writes Severin Carrell: Salmond declined to respond directly to Leveson's criticisms of his conduct, although he insisted the ministerial code did require him to fight for Scottish jobs. A spokesman for the first minister claimed the report was a \"complete vindication\" of Salmond's actions. Salmond said he believed Leveson's recommendations to have independent regulation underpinned by the law, as opposed to full statutory control, were very close to his proposals for a new Scottish regulatory body using the Irish model of an independent ombudsman. Unlike control over broadcasting in Scotland, which is controlled by the UK government, the Scottish parliament is able to set up independent press regulation.  He has urged opposition leaders to hold cross-party talks, and then appoint a Scottish judge to propose a Scottish regulatory system. But opposition leaders said Leveson's criticisms of Salmond raised real doubts over the first minister's fitness to lead those talks. Salmond said Leveson's report \"puts us very much in the territory of the Press Council of Ireland, which I think might well provide a good template for the way forward. Clearly, we will have to be satisfied that this can be done within the necessary context of a free press.\" The Metropolitan Police position, it said today, is that the decision to end the original 2006 phone-hacking investigation was justified, and this was vindicated by Leveson. A new agenda brought in by Commissioner Bernard Hogan-How means clearer policies on gifts and hospitality, business interests and associations that might cause conflicts of interest. We accept that there were failings about implementing a workable victim strategy. Likewise, the decision not to subsequently re-open the investigation was taken too quickly and with a defensive mindset. Although there were incidents that left a perception of cosiness between particular senior officers and some journalists, Lord Justice Leveson found that that did not influence or taint decision-making. Indeed the Inquiry has said that the integrity of our officers directly involved in the 2006 investigation \"shone through\" and is not doubted. Lord Justice Leveson found that there was no evidence that police corruption is a widespread problem. \u2022 On Morgan saying hacking was widespread: Leveson comments on Morgan's attempt to downplay his comments to Press Gazette in 2007 \u2013 where he says that hacking was an investigative practice that everyone knows was going on at almost every paper in Fleet Street for years. Overall, Mr Morgan's attempt to push back from his own bullish statement to the Press Gazette was utterly unpersuasive. (That's 'bullish', not 'bullshit' as I first read it.) \u2022 Leveson on politicians: Lisa O'Carroll writes that Leveson is not sharply critical of any politician in his report but he condemns all parties for seeking too intimate a relationship with the press. [They] have developed too close a relationship with the press. Although this relationship has fluctuated over time, the evidence suggests there has been a perceptible increase in the proximity of the relationship over this period. I do not believe this has been in the public interest. He says they have \"failed to conduct their relationship with sufficient transparency and accountability\" and to put themselves in a position where they risked becoming vulnerable to unaccountable influences ... which was, at least, partially in conflict with their responsibilities in relation to the conduct of public affairs\". \u2022 On Colin Myler: Josh Halliday writes that Colin Myler, the New York Daily News editor, faces criticism from Lord Justice Leveson over what the judge suggests was a failure to fully investigate suspicions of wider phone hacking at the News of the World when he took over as editor in 2007. Leveson says: There were steps that Mr Myler could have taken in an attempt to locate and defuse 'the bombs'. He had the ability to analyse every single payment to Mr Mulcaire and to require every single journalist who had employed him to justify every single request or task that Mr Mulcaire had been set and every story that Mulcaire had provided. Although in the light of the way in which the paper had dealt with the police investigation, it may have been difficult or embarrassing, he could have sought the assistance of the police not to encourage further investigation but to see whether there were any strands which they had considered which an internal investigation might pursue thereby demonstrating his determination to root out what had happened. Some of these steps might not have been practicable and the impact on morale had to be considered: but some must have been. In the event, he did little to assuage his own 'discomfort' except lay down rules for the future. As to the what had happened, he vigorously and forcefully followed a line which, to pursue the analogy of a bomb under the newsroom floor, simply ignored his privately held fear of an impending explosion. With European markets now closed, Trinity Mirror has finished 3.35% lower at 79.25p, a situation which prevailed for most of the day, Nick Fletcher reports. Daily Mail &amp; General Trust ended 1.35% higher at 524.5p, while in the US, News Corporation is currently up 0.86% at $24.58. There are just five paragraphs dedicated to the \"relevance of the internet\" in the Leveson report, according to Politico. Note: the entire report is 1,987 pages long. Readers can find the section on the \"relevance of the internet\" on pages 736-737. In it, Lord Justice Brian Leveson writes that save a few publications, \"the internet does not claim to operate by any particular ethical standards, still less high ones. Some have called it a 'wild west' but I would prefer to use the term 'ethical vacuum'.\" \"This is not to say for one moment that everything on the internet is therefore unethical. That would be a gross mischaracterisation of the work of very many bloggers and websites which should rightly and fairly be characterised as valuable and professional. The point I am making is a more modest one, namely that the internet does not claim to operate by express ethical standards, so that bloggers and others may, if they choose, act with impunity,\" Leveson wrote. On the other hand, he stated, the printed press does \"claim to operate by and adhere to an ethical code of conduct\" \u2014 unlike, of course, the ethical vacuum of the internet. \u2022 On Rupert Murdoch and the emails sent by News of the World reporter Neville Thurlbeck to the women involved in the Max Mosley case, likened by Mr Justice Eady to \"blackmail\". Although Mr Murdoch would no doubt not wish to countenance the deployment of tactics tantamount to blackmail, his more general observations about the doing of favours and back-scratching are extremely revealing as to the culture, practices and ethics of the press more generally, and far more so than simply in the circumstances which he was then discussing. It is also revealing that the judgment of Mr Justice Eady had not been brought to Mr Murdoch's attention prior to his giving evidence to the Inquiry, or that he had chosen not to read it. It was, after all, a judgment in which the NoTW had been found to be guilty not only of practices tantamount to blackmail, but also of casual and cavalier journalism. It was costly for the NoTW and, according to many of the NoTW witnesses, it had led to a change in approach to privacy generally. That Mr Murdoch was not apparently familiar with it says something about the degree to which his organisation engages with the ethical direction of its newspapers.  \u2022 A big up for the Guardian: With the exception of the sterling investigative journalism conducted at the Guardian, most other titles were slow to give prominence to the story, that is to say until the Milly Dowler story broke in July 2011. \u2022 On the News of the World's surveillance of Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris, lawyers representing the victims of phone hacking: This whole saga reflects poorly on all involved. The use of covert surveillance against solicitors representing the opposition in damaging litigation is dubious at best, particularly when it seems clear that the surveillance was commissioned in order to put pressure on the solicitors to withdraw from the litigation. It is a case of attacking the man and not the ball. Mr [Tom] Crone must, ultimately, take final responsibility. Despite his efforts to persuade the Inquiry to the contrary, in my judgment he well knew that Mr Webb was not carrying out proper journalistic functions. Additionally, it was primarily his decision to engage Mr Webb to conduct discreet surveillance of Mr Lewis and Ms Harris in circumstances where there was no conceivable journalistic or other justification to do so: this was clearly in breach of their Article 8 rights. FranzSherbet finds more exoneration for News International: The evidence does not, of course, establish anything resembling a 'deal' whereby News International's support was traded for the expectation of policy favours. All of those involved strenuously deny that there was a deal whether express or implied. The documents do not gainsay them. Nor do the Coalition Government's actions in Government. And some reaction from a self-confessed (brave) hack among our commenting readers, philbunt: As a lifelong tabloid hack (not hacker) \u2013 with the Sun and various American tabloids \u2013 I've got to ask: What is the public interest? The tabs \u2013 and other newspapers \u2013 would argue that if a story boosts sales, then that shows it's of interest to the public. I admit it's a slightly specious argument. But can a third party really decide what IS in the public interest? Is a celebrity in the public interest \u2013 and a High Court judge not? And RobertSnozers: I think Leveson's proposals are as good as we're going to get. I would have liked to have seen an Ofcom-like solution, but I think Leveson's compromise should please everyone sensible - predictably, it hasn't pleased the libertarian frontiersman brigade, who seem to care more about freedom to spout lies and innuendo than they do about the lives of innocent victims. As far as the Hunt/Black scheme, Leveson called it absolutely right. It's ultimately still a sop to Cerberus, whereas what we need is a collar. (I think the expression was 'marking its own homework', by the way). My colleague Sam Jones asks if they have spoken to victims of press intrusion. Yes, Mark Lewis says. They feel they have been let down. Lewis says there was no point in the judicial inquiry unless the results were going to be implemented. We're going back down to where we started from, says Lewis: the press regulating themselves.  Hugh Grant was notably absent from the Hacked Off press conference, perhaps responding to public feeling (in particular comments by Graham Foukes, whose son died in the 7/7 attacks) that Leveson had become too celebrity focused and less about victims of the press among the general public. Ben Bradshaw wasted no time turning Cameron's position to political advantage: Stephen Fry, confirming his national treasure status: Evan Harris of Hacked Off says the public is in favour of statutory regulation. Harris is asked if he is certain the PM is dead against self-regulation. No, says Harris. We hope he will change his mind. But it was pretty clear in the debate he was opposed to statutory underpinning. Without that we're just back to self-regulation. Underpinning is important so that those in the regulatory scheme are held to it and the regulator has powers and standards, Harris says.  Cathcart says it is there to make sure the new PCC is up to scratch. If you don't have that, what you have is the PCC. Over the years it received more and more complaints and made fewer and fewer adjudications. He says some measure of compulsion was necessary. Leveson disagrees \u2013 his view is to apply carrots and sticks to make people take part. Hacked Off is happy with that. But Cameron can't even accept that, Cathcart says.  The local press had nothing to do with the phone-hacking scandal, points out Newspaper Society president Adrian Jeakings, but would be affected by regulation. We believe the industry is in a position to establish the sort of tough new system of independent, accountable press regulation with the power to investigate wrongdoing and levy fines, envisaged by the report. All major news publishers \u2013 and some internet news providers \u2013 have indicated they will join such a system provided there is no statutory backstop. In practice, this independent self-regulatory system would almost certainly be stronger and more effective than any statutory model could ever be and could be put into place very quickly.  Newspapers are ultimately accountable to their readers and must abide by the laws of the land. But, as the Prime Minister has today acknowledged, a free press cannot be free if it is dependent on and accountable to a regulatory body recognized by the state. Kirsty Hughes, chief executive of Index on Censorship said: The statutory-voluntary approach to independent press regulation would undermine press freedom in the UK. However, we support the proposal for cheap, effective arbitration, which would help victims get swift redress to their complaints. Index welcomed the response of the Prime Minister to the Inquiry's findings. In a statement to parliament, David Cameron said that he had \"serious concerns\" about passing legislation in relation to the press, which he rightly said would be an \"enormous\" step. Kirsty Hughes said: \"We share David Cameron's concerns that statutory underpinning would undermine free speech, and could be the start of a slippery slope of government interference in the media.\" The proposed system can only work \u2013 and be recognised in the way the statute would demand \u2013 if no-one exercises their right not to join. If they do exercise this right, then the regulator will fail to meet the required standards. Trans Media Watch, who gave evidence to the inquiry as a minority group routinely misrepresented by the press, welcomed the proposals. Chair Jennie Kermode said: The abuses of press freedom considered by the Inquiry have damaged the reputation of journalism as well as the lives of individuals. Today should be a moment for the industry to take stock and to move forward with a renewed sense of responsibility and purpose. Let journalism be about speaking truth to power, not about exploiting the powerless. Read the executive summary Read volume one Read volume two Read volume three Read volume four Cathcart says the group was never planning to disband after the report and is \"still up for this fight\".  He describes Cameron as having \"rejected\" the report - a report designed to be helpful to him, Cathcart says.  Cameron's idea leaves us with a self-regulatory press. That's where we've been for the last 60 or 70 years, Cathcart says.  This is a very important moment. We do not want to let it slip. Jacqui Hames of Hacked Off thanks Clegg, Miliband and Tories who support statutory regulation. She found the PM's statement today \"rather depressing\". It really does all start to fall apart without the statutory underpinning, she says. Mark Lewis of Hacked Off recalls the PM's evidence to Leveson. He referred to \"the victim test\" or \"the Dowler test\" and he's failed that himself. \"Maybe he needs to resit.\" Northern Ireland human rights campaigner Jane Winter says the PM has gone back on his word and she feels betrayed. Joan Smith of Hacked Off reads out a petition to Cameron and Clegg calling on them to implement the Leveson proposals. Ed Blum of Hacked Off says Cameron has let down the victims of press abuse and has \"ripped out the heart and soul\" of the Leveson report.  The slippery slope towards self-regulation has also let the public down, he says.  Dr Matthew Ashton at Nottingham Trent University says the outcome is not as bad as the press have feared: While they'll clearly not be overjoyed, I suspect that underneath the rhetoric and outrage they'll be thinking carefully about their next steps. What starts now will be a concerted and combined effort to pick as many holes in the findings of the report as possible, combined with fierce lobbying, both public and private, to shape the future regulatory body, or law if it's introduced, to suit themselves. In trying to satisfy both those who want regulation and those who don't, Leveson may end up satisfying neither, says Ivor Gaber, professor of political journalism at London's City University: Whilst neither side will be wholly satisfied with the proposal it is likely that those arguing for the end of self-regulation in favour of a statutory backed system will feel happier, but even they will look on the proposed new self-regulatory body with a jaundiced eye. The press will no doubt claim that this signals the end of the freedom of the press in the UK, something even they probably don't really believe. Brian Cathcart says Leveson has done his job. The prime minister has not done his job. His failure to accept the full recommendations is unfair and regrettable, he says. Leveson's recommendations should be implemented properly. The PM still trusts the editors and proprieters to behave themselves. He seems to want self-regulation all over again, Cathcart says.  Andrew Sparrow will continue to live-blog the parliamentary debate here.  Meanwhile Hacked Off have begun a press conference in central London. Labour are hugging Clegg close on this issue, reckons James Forsyth of the Spectator: The ongoing and mutually beneficial Twitter spat between Lord Sugar and Piers Morgan seems to have reached a new low. Sugar is tweeting a photoshopped picture suggesting that Leveson has recommended finding Morgan and killing him. Steady on. \u2022 On bullying at News of the World: There can be little doubt that the NoTW was a tough working environment, that the staff collectively felt that challenge from superiors was not welcomed, and that bullying was a problem. The evidence which Mr Driscoll gave to the Employment Tribunal, repeated to me, along with the confirmation of witnesses (both identified and anonymous) satisfies me that, at least on occasion, individuals were, indeed, victimised and bullied. Whilst Mr Myler took steps to address the culture that he obviously perceived as being harmful, there was no evidence that any individuals responsible for bullying, or creating a climate at the paper which was unhealthy and oppressive, were disciplined in any way or that the victims were offered any support.  \u2022 On the Mirror, and what Piers knew Leveson, writes Mark Sweney, commenting on a range of evidence about alleged incidents at the Mirror including Heather Mills, Ulrika Jonsson as well as evidence from Paxman about how Morgan told him how to access a phone message. This evidence does not establish that Mr Morgan authorised the hacking of voicemails or that journalists employed by TMG were indulging in this practice. What it does, however, clearly prove is that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was  sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it. \u2022 On the press's cultural unwillingness to change Leveson says there is evidence for a\"general conclusion that there is a cultural unwillingness in parts of the press to consider the consequences of publication on the individuals involved. the fact that a story might be hurtful, damaging or intrusive to the subjects of a story is not necessarily a reason not to publish that story. It may not even be a reason to amend the story. But it is difficult to see why the consequences on the individuals who are likely to be affected by publication should not both be relevant and factored into the overall decision\". Clegg is asked to set out the differences in approach between him and Cameron. Clegg says the difference is that he, Clegg, believes the case for legislation has been made. Slightly nervously, and turning to face the PM, who is sitting next to him, Clegg says that Cameron has expressed his serious misgivings thoughtfully about legislation but has not entirely excluded that possibility in the absence of other viable alternatives. Cameron nods seriously.  Here's my colleague Simon Hoggart's sketch of the debates on Leveson's report in parliament. \u2022 On web publishing and consequent cultural change: In my view, parts of the press require a cultural, rather than a systemic, change to ensure that the privacy and dignity of individuals is appropriately respected, and to ensure that the public interest in, and consequences of, and publication are considered when titles decide how and whether to investigate, and publish, details of individuals' private lives. The need for such a change in culture is all the more urgent in a technological age which allows for unprecedented access to private information and unprecedented means to distribute that private information. In the absence of such cultures, the temptation to use the technology that is now available to invade privacy and to publish private information, when not in the public interest, may be irresistible. \u2022 Mark Sweney refers us to Leveson's thoughts on Dacre's attitude to the two separate stories published on the alleged drunken behaviour of actor Neil Morrissey and an attack on someone called Ms Witchall. Leveson said he showed a complete \"failure to consider personal consequences of publishing information about an individual's private life\". What was concerning about Mr Dacre's evidence on both the Ms Witchall and Mr Morrissey stories was not his editorial judgment on whether the articles should have been published or not. Instead, the concern related to Mr Dacre's unwillingness to entertain the idea that each of these stories might have been hurtful, upsetting and/or damaging to the individuals involved. If such a possibility is not even recognised post publication, despite evidence to the contrary from the subjects of the stories, then it seems unlikely to have been the subject of any consideration pre-publication. \u2022 Unethical practice: One of the main complaints advanced by those who testified during the first two weeks of evidence, and subsequently, was that a cultural strand exists within the press betraying an unethical cultural indifference to the consequences of exposing private lives, and a failure to treat individuals with appropriate dignity and respect. Phone hacking, blagging, the widespread use of covert surveillance, harassment, and the publication of private and confidential information all reflect, to varying extents, this cultural indifference. Andrew Sparrow summarises Clegg's statement: Clegg says he believes the report's core proposals - new regulation underpined by statute - is workable. He always said he would support the Leveson proposals if they were workable. These ones are. But he has some concerns about the Data Protection Act proposals, and about giving Ofcom the new scrutiny role. Ofcom is already very powerful, he says. Clegg says he has thought deeply about using legislation. As a liberal, he has concerns. But Leveson has looked at this and concluded that using law is the only way of ensuring this works. This is not statutory regulation of the press, he says. It is not \"illiberal state regulation\". Clegg says the press does not operate in a vacuum. It has to abide by the law. He agrees with the recommendation about enshrining freedom of the press in law. He says many UK newspapers already accept regulation with statutory underpinning in Ireland. He has not heard any of these papers complaining about this. The Lib Dems want to ensure that proposals are \"workable and proportionate\". If they do not, he will \"sound the alarm\". The worst thing would be to do nothing. He says the Commons needs \"to get on with this without delay\". For Labour, Harriet Harman congratulates Clegg on his statement. Harman says the wrongdoing of the press brought shame on it and brought misery to families already suffering. The system Leveson proposes is independent both of politicians and of the press, Harman says. That can only be guaranteed through legislation, she says. Does Clegg agree? Does he agree that what Cameron says amounts to a craven acceptance of the status quo? If Cameron does not think again he will have betrayed the victims. Clegg says he and the PM come at this from different angles. He does not share Cameron's misgivings, but they are legitimate, he says. Nick Clegg tells MPs cross-party talks on Leveson will be taking place later this afternoon. He tells the Commons he believes legislation to establish a new self-regulatory body for the press \"can be done in a proportionate and workable way\". He says: Changing the law is the only way to give us all the assurance that the new regulator isn't just independent for a few months or years, but is independent for good. The victims have waited too long, Clegg says. More Twitter reaction in our Storified piece. Clegg says he agrees with \"a lot\" of what the PM and Ed Miliband have said on the principles of the Leveson report. He says the cross-party talks must establish an early and clear timetable. He says there are two big liberal principles at play: protecting the innocent, and allowing free speech. A free press does not mean a press that is free to bully innocent people and grieving families, Clegg says. Nick Clegg is speaking now in the House of Commons.  Before Clegg stood up, Peter Bone MP suggested the house should adjourn because the last time two government spokesman in this way was in the 1930s, after which there was a vote of confidence. The Speaker rejects this. David Cameron seems to have been tweeting at the same time as addressing the house. Impressive. On phone hacking at the News of the World, Leveson says it is \"clear that these practices were not limited to a single journalist. It would not be unfair to describe the practice of voicemail interception within a part or parts of the NoTW as cultural.\" Mark Sweney has pulled out this quote on lack of legal advice on privacy: It appears that, until recently, in house legal advisors were rarely asked to advise on privacy issues at all, but focused almost exclusively on libel. It appears that, in the majority of titles, there is no formal system in place for that team to consider, decide and minute the difficult questions of whether publication of private information is in the public interest. Those titles that do have such systems have only introduced them very recently. \u2022 On the press closing ranks: Quite apart from the extent to which titles do, in fact, write critically about those who have challenged them (all in the name of the exercise of free speech), the climate is such that that there is an undeniable perception that this is precisely what will happen.  Witnesses were reluctant to give evidence because of the fear of press retribution; some overcame that expression of fear but others did not. I do not make any finding or reach any conclusion based upon what is not part of the evidence but the same inference may be drawn from the unwillingness of journalists to speak out (which resulted in the necessity to hear evidence anonymously through the National Union of Journalists). The fear of journalists was not merely that the relevant title would not employ them: it was that a consequence of speaking out would be that they would no longer be able to obtain any employment in the national press. This feature alone raises real concerns about the culture and practices of the press, in closing ranks and refusing to accept and recognise that legitimate debate about its own role and methods of working is not to be shut down but encouraged. \u2022 On fear of retaliation by the press: Numerous individuals in public life have complained in evidence to the Inquiry that they have been afraid or unwilling to confront the power of the press ... owing to concerns about personal attack and vilification. A significant number of the witnesses ... gave evidence of their fears of, or actual retaliation, by the press in response to complaints. JK Rowling made the point very compellingly in these terms. Her experience was consistent with a body of evidence received by the Inquiry suggesting that a practice has existed within the press of obtaining or publishing material about individuals or organisations with whom they have been in dispute or disagreement, in circumstances where it is legitimate to conclude that the aim was to 'pay back' or 'punish' for the disagreement by causing distress, embarrassment or discomfort, rather than because the article had a public interest for the readership. The News of the World's Paul McMullan's amoral testimony made him a bete noir of the inquiry. Leveson writes: In one of the most provocative statements made to the Inquiry, Mr McMullan said that: \"In a bizarre way, I felt slightly proud that I'd written something that created a riot and got a paediatrician beaten up, or whatever was the case,\" as if he was delighted to feel (or glorified in the fact) that he had written an article that had moved people to action, even if the action itself had been utterly misguided and wrong.  He adds: Mr McMullan's evidence needs to be treated with very real caution given his tendency to exaggerate and sensationalise. He was not an attractive witness, although ultimately I conclude that his evidence did contain a substantial kernel of truth, once the elaboration is removed. Secondly, and notwithstanding my reservations about certain aspects of Mr [Mazher] Mahmood's evidence which I address elsewhere, I am prepared to accept that he personally felt that he was discharging some sort a public function rather than merely generating commercial gain for himself and his employer. Lord Justice Leveson is deeply critical of News International's management in a passage on the company's lack of cooperation with Scotland Yard's 2006 investigation into phone hacking, Josh Halliday has drawn out of the report. The report refers to Rupert Murdoch's evidence that he was unaware that News International had been accused of obstructing the police investigation through their law firm Burton Copeland, then adds: This raises two issues about local management at NI, its internal governance and its relationship with News Corporation. First, if Rupert Murdoch's evidence is correct, it appears that there was a lack of full transparency between the local management at NI and senior management at News Corporation or, alternatively, a very different understanding of the meaning of the word co-operation. Second the approach taken by NI is far from what might be expected of a well-run corporation. Leveson continues: An organisational culture that is founded on integrity and honesty would require not only full co-operation with law enforcement, but also a determination to expose behaviour that failed to comply with the law. That would normally be achieved through a thorough internal investigation of any allegation, unaffected by the legal constraints that the police might face, in order to ensure that any wrongdoing in the company was uncovered, stopped and dealt with appropriately. What happened at the NoTW in relation to voicemail interception in this context is particularly informative about the culture that pertained both within the corporate and editorial operations. \u2022 On 'one rogue title': There is an extent to which News International (NI) and the rest of the press have sought to draw a line between the practices that are alleged to have taken place at the News of the World (the NoTW) and the newsrooms of all other newspapers. Having argued originally that phone hacking was limited to one rogue reporter, one may be forgiven for thinking that the company and sections of the industry are now arguing that it was limited to one rogue title.  \u2022 On Piers Morgan ripping off rival stories: Leveson refers to Piers Morgan saying in the Insider that it was worth paying out legally for deliberately ripping off a massive story from a rival newspaper as \"further evidence of unethical or unlawful publication based on the calculation of legal risk versus potential profits. \u2022 On dirt digging by the People into Gary Flitcroft: The People showed an 'apparent lack of consideration of the consequences of publication on Mr Flitcroft and his family by those responsible for publication. the response of the newspaper to Mr Flitcroft's attempt to prevent publication does at least appear to have been consistent with a practice identified later in this Report whereby parts of the press seek to intimidate, attack or punish those who challenge the right of the press to publish what they choose'. \u2022 On Christopher Jefferies and contempt of court: The story about Mr Jefferies is a prime example of why the elision of the public interest with what interests the public is dangerous. It may well interest the public to read private, scandalous and defamatory material about a suspect to a murder, but it is clearly not in the wider public interest for newspapers to act in contempt of court, let alone erroneously to destroy a man's reputation. Paul Waugh of PoliticsHome tweets this from the No 10 lobby briefing: Labour MP Barry Gardiner just asked Cameron which parts of the report he considered bonkers, since he wasn't going to implement it in full. The PM said the principles of the report \"are absolutely right\" but MPs would not be doing their duty if they just \"wave through\" any changes without examining and analysing them properly. \u2022 On the need for a regulator: The need for a regulator and the scope of its authority is not dictated by issues that arise from the vast majority of stories. But that is not the same as saying that there is no need for a regulator. Most doctors behave impeccably towards their patients but a regulatory mechanism is necessary for those who do not, whether on a serial basis or because of a single lapse. \u2022 On statutory controls and freedom of the press: There is no necessary connection between statutory underpinning of a regulatory system, on the one hand, and state censorship on the other, nor in my view is there some sort of slippery slope gliding from the first to the second. He says the suggestion that \"any change to the law by act of parliament to require or restrict any behaviour by the press ... is intolerable in a democracy as an act of state control ... completely lacks merit. There are many forms of statute law which already restrict the activities of the press. \u2022 On abuse of 'anonymous sources': The issue of journalistic sources is more controversial ... There is a wider concern here, namely that journalists may not always act ethically when invoking what protections they should properly enjoy. The evidence ... raised the strong suspicion, even if it did not provide conclusive evidence, that some journalists habitually refer to 'sources' even where the latter do not exist or where they have never said that which is attributed to them. But readers will never know where the truth lies, and will never acquire the means of finding out, because abuses of the system are extremely difficult to prove The full text of Cameron's statement is now on the No 10 website. Mark Sweney points us to Leveson's findings on the Daily Express publishing 38 defamatory and intrusive stories about the McCanns. [Express editor Peter] Hill's evidence to the Inquiry betrayed a distinct lack of consideration for the dignity and privacy of the McCanns, and showed instead a focus on the circulation of his newspaper. His evidence suggested a remarkable elision between what was justified in the public interest, and what would interest his readership. Such elision leaves little room for the protection of privacy if a readership is interested in reading about the private lives of others. The Daily Express's Hugh Whittow and the Daily Star's Dawn Neesom considered the readers' views to be a primary factor in the consideration of whether to publish private information. Similarly, the Daily Mirror's then editor Richard Wallace thought the public interest was very strongly influenced by what interests the public. Nick Fletcher sends more stock market reaction: News Corporation shares have shaken off any worries about Leveson, and are currently 1.1% higher at $24.65 in New York. Meanwhile Trinity Mirror is still down around 3.3% at 79.25p while Daily Mail &amp; General Trust is up 1.26% at 524p. City analysts said there did not appear to be anything in the report which came as a massive surprise to investors. John Plunkett sends these extracts in which Lord Justice Leveson discusses phone-hacking: It is still not clear just how widespread the practice of phone hacking was, or the extent to which it may have extended beyond one title; and, in the light of the limitations which necessarily impact on this aspect of the Inquiry because of the ongoing investigation and impending prosecutions, it is simply not possible to be definitive. The evidence of Paul McMullan, Sharon Marshall and James Hipwell points to phone hacking being a common and known practice at the NoTW and elsewhere. In relation to other titles, the degree of knowledge, acquiescence and turning of the metaphorical blind eye may be difficult to assess quantitatively on the basis of the evidence the Inquiry has received (although a fuller analysis of this issue will be conducted below); in qualitative terms, however, valuable evidence was obtained from witnesses such as Piers Morgan, Heather Mills, Jeremy Paxman and Dominic Mohan.  Although the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) contains no defence of acting in the public interest, the Inquiry has examined the extent to which it could be argued that the hacking of voicemails was carried out in pursuit of stories which could properly and fairly be characterised as being in the public interest. There is no evidence that this is so: to such extent as the evidence has been ventilated, the hacking of voicemails was systematically deployed to garner pieces of gossip and tittle-tattle about the lives of celebrities and those otherwise in the public eye whether as victims of crime, politicians or potential sources for stories; in other words, to intrude into their privacy without any conceivable justification that could truly be argued to be in the public interest. Whereas in other contexts it has been argued by the press, or sections of the press, that there is a public interest in freedom of speech itself, and that an editor should be permitted to decide where the ethical balance falls, no such argument has been aired in this particular context.  Leveson adds: Put at its very lowest, the Inquiry will need to consider whether, at least until 2006, there existed a culture within the press of indifference to the unlawfulness of the practice of phone hacking (or a lack of understanding of its unlawfulness, which itself is difficult to justify) and to its unethical nature. It will also be necessary to consider whether the evidence received is sufficient to reach conclusions in respect of the use of phone hacking at titles other than the NoTW.  And on \"blagging\" private information, Leveson says: Overall, and in a similar manner to phone hacking, the Inquiry will need to consider whether there was a culture of indifference within the press as to the lawfulness of blagging (or a lack of understanding as to its unlawfulness), and to its unethical nature. The Free Speech Network speaks, through Lord Black: Lord Justice Leveson has issued a challenge to the press to establish a new, tough system of regulation. I believe that the plan that the industry has put forward goes a long way to meeting that challenge. In those areas where the report expresses concern \u2013 such as independence and appointments procedures \u2013 we will study his proposals and I believe respond positively. However, there is no need to subject the new regulatory body to the statutory regime of OFCOM in order to achieve this. Any form of statutory press control in a free society is fraught with danger, totally impractical and would take far too long to implement.\" Reporter whose investigations on phone hacking led to David Cameron setting up the Leveson inquiry, gives his immediate reaction to the report. Looks like Leveson has another job on his hands, reports Lisa O'Carroll. Earlier David Cameron announced that part two of the Leveson inquiry would go ahead. This was due to look at alleged phone hacking and corruption on newspapers but could not be scheduled until after the criminal trials of Rebekah Brooks and others facing charges are complete. This may not be for two or three years down the line as these trials are not due to go ahead until September next year. \"One of the things the victims have been most concerned about is that part two of this investigation should go ahead ... It is right that it goes ahead and that is fully our intention,\" the prime minister told the house. \u2022 Pier's Morgan and the rock star's worst hits: I am conscious that focussing on criticisms of the press will cause (and has, indeed, caused) many to criticise the Inquiry on the basis that it has been slanted to the poor practices and has paid insufficient attention to good practices. Piers Morgan, the former editor of the Daily Mirror, for instance, complained at the conclusion of his evidence that a lot of the very good things that newspapers have done and continue to do were not being highlighted by the Inquiry. He said it was \"like a rock star having an album brought out from his back catalogue of all his worst-ever hits\". To some extent, that is the inevitable consequence of the Inquiry's Terms of Reference and its focus on public concerns and complaints rather than on the successes and achievements of the press ... I have no doubt that the press can take pride in most of its work. However, good practices do not require a public inquiry and do not require regulation. \u2022 Tom Stoppard comes to mind: The submissions of News International have reminded the Inquiry of an exchange in Sir Tom Stoppard's satire on the British news media, Night and Day, published in 1978. Milne says to Ruth: 'No matter how imperfect things are, if you've got a free press everything is correctable, and without it everything is concealable'. Ruth replies: 'I'm with you on the free press. It's the newspapers I cannot stand'.  \u2022 Fact versus comment: We know about the editorial inflection, the world-view, of the newspaper we read. We want a measure of balance and context, but we also want a perspective. We want the truth, but we understand that there are many versions of the truth, and incompleteness in all versions ... The very act of describing a fact is to comment on it. But in some cases, it will be neither easy nor obvious for readers to orientate themselves in relation to material they read in the press ... They include, for example ... science and health reporting ... consumer journalism such as property or travel reporting ... PR journalism, in which what is effectively commercially produced advertising material is reproduced as editorial without mediation at all ... the reporting of identity issues (gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, appearance and so on) where the fact and manner of bringing such issues into coverage has a potential to implant a relevance for them in readers which they have not chosen. Leveson endorses the original police investigation into phone hacking at the News of the World in 2006, reports Josh Halliday. The investigation has faced criticism from some quarters because it was not expanded beyond the royal household, despite evidence that the journalists (who were eventually convicted) at at least attempted to target the celebrity PR agent Max Clifford. However, Leveson says this criticism is unjustified. He adds in his report: \"I recognise that the decision (which was revisited on a number of occasions) not to expand the investigation beyond the Royal Household gives rise to concern but there is no basis for arguing that it was based on oblique motives consequent on any relationship with NI. Again, in the light of the circumstances prevailing (especially related to the extensive demands on police time in relation to terrorism), it was understandable, justified and appropriate\" David Cameron said previously that he would implement Leveson's proposals unless they were \"bonkers\". Alastair Campbell is calling him on that: Mark Sweney points us to Leveson's comments on the Sun's Gordon Smart and Hugh Grant. Leveson says Smart's comment that Hugh Grant stories were justified purely because Grant is a celebrity \"was a surprising approach, which revealed a lack of respect for the privacy of anyone who might be considered a celebrity\". I acknowledged that there is a class of person with a public profile \u2013 those who actively engage in the \"celebrity industry\" \u2013 who may enjoy a lower level of protection when it comes to privacy. However, in my view at least, Mr Grant does not fall within that class. A run-of-the-mill \"kiss and tell\" may not be a big story to a newspaper, but it will always be a big story to the subjects of the story and their families. On p469 of the report, John Plunkett points out, Leveson calls the Daily Telegraph's MPs' expenses scoop \"an example of journalism at its best\": The Daily Telegraph's detractors might say that the story brought the paper a huge publicity coup and the inevitable increases in circulation and sales: all the ingredients of a modern succ\u00e8s du scandale. Rupert Murdoch expressed his 'disappointment' that the Times had not felt able to buy up the story from the middleman when he was touting it around the market place. Overall, however, the Daily Telegraph earned whatever commercial advantages it secured from its substantial financial investment.  Although it might be stretching language somewhat to call this a case of investigative journalism in the exact sense of the term (the material was effectively handed to the Daily Telegraph on a metaphorical plate and did not need to be rooted out in the manner of a Thalidomide investigation) the obvious public interest in the story and the fact that it was undeniably 'laced with risk' deserve full recognition. The data might have been bogus; there was certainly an issue as to whether some breach of the criminal law had occurred (or, at the very least, ethical concerns surrounding the manner in which the data had been extracted and supplied); and a vast amount of work had to be undertaken to analyse and review the raw material not least to ensure accuracy. The legal and ethical issues were properly and responsibly addressed, and the inquiry is fully satisfied that no corners were cut. This, as I am pleased to repeat, is an example of journalism at its best. \u2022 On celebrities and the right to privacy:  At the same time, the nature of commercial 'celebrity culture' continues to be pondered even as it evolves with great rapidity; again, there is as yet no settled understanding or consensus about this. A celebrity obviously gives up his or her right to privacy if he or she sells an intimate photograph to a newspaper. How far this goes is another question. The right is clearly ceded as regards the transaction in question, but does that give the newspaper or even the press in general, a blank cheque for all purposes or for all time? Put in those terms, the answer, in my view, is clearly not.  \u2022 On the power of the press: There is no doubt that the press is considered a voice of authority in society. In many quarters, it has rightly earned a reputation for accurate and vigorous reporting, independence and holding power to account. It is because of the authoritative quality of the press, combined with its access to mass audiences, that communication by the press, as an institution of considerable power, has a significant impact on society. It can set the news agenda, shape culture and change perceptions. \u2022 On the Telegraph's MP's expenses scandal: The Daily Telegraph's detractors might say that the story brought the paper a huge publicity coup and the inevitable increases in circulation and sales: all the ingredients of a modern succ\u00e8s du scandale. Rupert Murdoch expressed his 'disappointment' that The Times had not felt able to buy up the story from the middleman when he was touting it around the market place. Overall, however, the Daily Telegraph earned whatever commercial advantages it secured from its substantial financial investment.  Although it might be stretching language somewhat to call this a case of investigative journalism in the exact sense of the term (the material was effectively handed to the Daily Telegraph on a metaphorical plate and did not need to be rooted out in the manner of a Thalidomide investigation) the obvious public interest in the story and the fact that it was undeniably 'laced with risk' deserve full recognition. The data might have been bogus; there was certainly an issue as to whether some breach of the criminal law had occurred (or, at the very least, ethical concerns surrounding the manner in which the data had been extracted and supplied); and a vast amount of work had to be undertaken to analyse and review the raw material not least to ensure accuracy. The legal and ethical issues were properly and responsibly addressed, and the Inquiry is fully satisfied that no corners were cut. This, as I am pleased to repeat, is an example of journalism at its best. Leveson wants to bring about real change, says Amber Melville-Brown, partner in the reputation management at law firm Withers: The report raises various questions. What might happen if the media as a whole, doesn't agree to buy in to the scheme? And how will a two tier approach, with on the one hand a form of arbitration under the new proposed regulator and the traditional ambit of the courts on the other, play out.  There was cross- party support for a new Defamation Act  favouring publishers and the result of a vociferous campaign by defamation law detractors, anticipated in 2013. Whether  government - to whom the ball has now been firmly passed by Leveson -  will show support for  the essential regulation he asserts is required, or whether he will bow under the pressure of powerful, publishing scaremongers and ignore or delay Leveson's recommendations, remains to be seen. Katherine Eyres at LexisPSL says: The reforms proposed by the Leveson report are about as palatable as the press and the politicians could have hoped for: a more formidable regulator underpinned by legislation, with self-regulation remaining intact and checks and balances to maintain independence from parliamentary and press interference. Eversheds' Andrew Terry says: The detail will need to be scrutinised to understand whether or not Lord Justice Leveson has done enough to address the \"Desmond Problem\"; i.e. are these proposals really strong enough to guarantee that all major news publishers participate meaningfully in the new regime in the long term? Leveson also discusses public-interest journalism in the Sun, where it often takes the form of explaining \"extremely complex concepts of vital importance\": By way of example, [Sun editor Dominic] Mohan referred to an article published on 27 July 2011 in which the Sun gave a succinct description of the state of the eurozone bailout crisis, saying that the majority of working people in the UK preferred to read \"a really concise and well-executed spread ... which gives them very quick, digestible summary of very, very complex issues\". He said that such reporting in the Sun was how \"millions of people learn of serious issues on a daily basis\". Nobody can pretend that the issues at stake are straightforward and there is no doubt that journalism of this type is of a very high order.  And here is Leveson on Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Daily Mail: It may readily be understood that Associated Newspapers Ltd's examples of \"public interest journalism\" are examples of campaigns which it has pursued with enormous vigour over the years, in each case in the public interest and with ultimate vindication. John Plunkett turns to page 457 of the report, where Leveson discusses the Guardian's submission to the inquiry, outlining recent public interest investigations, including the death of newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson, Trafigura and Wikileaks. The Guardian might also have drawn specific attention to the work of Nick Davies in investigating the phone-hacking story over a number of years ... In my view, these are all excellent examples of public interest investigative journalism, properly so called: in other words, the unearthing of the often unpalatable truth by dogged hard work and persistence. MPs are continuing to debate the Leveson report. If you would like to follow the debate in detail, Andrew Sparrow is covering it on his blog here.  This blog will continue to cover the reaction to the report and analyse its proposals. We will return to the Commons for Nick Clegg's statement in about half an hour. Cameron replies, saying Leveson has rejected statutory regulation. We shouldn't rush into this, he says. This report needs to be implemented by the press - putting in place the independent regulation Leveson speaks about. They should do that right now, Cameron says.  Miliband talks about the victims of phone-hacking and press intrusion, the McCanns and the Dowlers. A free press is essential to a functioning democracy, he says. But \"at the same time I do not want to live in a country where innocent families like the McCanns and the Dowlers can see their lives torn apart simply for the sake of profit\".  The press have to be held to account.  He backs Leveson's proposals for a statutory underpinning of the new press regulator: He provides a crucial new guarantee which we have never had before. He builds in a role for the media regulator Ofcom, to ensure that the system that is established passes the test we would all want applied to it: that it is truly independent and provides effective protection for people like the McCanns and the Dowlers. And to make this guarantee real, he recommends that both Ofcom's role and these criteria of independence and effectiveness will be set out in statute, a law of this Parliament. A truly independent regulation of the press, guaranteed by law. He welcomes cross-party talks.  A new regulation system must be up and running by 2015 at the latest, he says. Leveson's conclusions on evidence given by Charlotte Church: Ms Church has, to some extent, courted press attention. As part of her promotional obligations, she appears in the press, on radio and on television and has spoken about her relationships and private life in this context. In addition, she has chosen to appear in magazines such as OK! and Hello with her children. However, on any construction of the Editors' Code of Conduct, those facts alone cannot justify the persistent and intrusive level of press interest to which she has been subjected, nor can it justify the publication of private information without regard to the public interest or the consequences of publication. An appearance in a magazine such as OK! or Hello does not necessarily indicate a desire to expose her entire private live or the lives of her family to public view. Steve Coogan: Mr Coogan has a personal life which, by his own admission, may not command the moral approval of all. While it may be correct that some people in the public eye trade on their wholesome image or status as a family man, that is not the case with Mr Coogan. Despite this, sections of the press have treated his private life as fair game for publication. No clear public interest justification has been offered for the many stories published about Mr Coogan's sex life. The stories are mere tittle-tattle. But as Mr Coogan noted, such gossip is not necessarily harmless and, even when true, can be extremely damaging to the parties involved, as well as innocent third parties. JK Rowling: Ms Rowling's evidence suggested that parts of the press have shown a casual disregard of her desire to protect her children's privacy. the PCC Code requires editors not to use the fame, notoriety or position of a parent or guardian as sole justification for publishing details of a child's private life, but it appears that in the case of Ms Rowling's children, this was the only justification for the pursuit and publication of their photos. the decision of some titles to publish information which revealed her address, demonstrates what appears to be a casual disregard for her privacy, and a carelessness with regard to the consequences of publishing private information... sections of the press chose to ignore the fact that she had consistently and unequivocally sought to protect her privacy. Our man in Scotland, Severin Carrell, reports that Leveson noted Salmond's 'striking' willingness to lobby the UK government in favour of Rupert Murdoch's proposed BSkyB buyout. Leveson said Salmond, who insisted throughout his inquiry evidence that he had a duty to protect Scottish jobs, was saved from criticism for acting improperly essentially because he failed to carry through with his promised lobbying of either Vince Cable, the business secretary, or Jeremy Hunt, then culture secretary. Even so, it was wrong for Salmond to make that offer because it breached the ministerial code's rules forbidding partisan activity to support a specific firm's business interests. It was wrong for Salmond, Leveson ruled, to lobby UK ministers who were acting in a quasi-judicial capacity on the Sky bid. 'Mr Salmond's duty to promote the Scottish economy and Scottish jobs cannot sensibly be understood as requiring irrelevant submissions to be made to a quasi-judicial decision maker.' No comment from Salmond's office yet, but he was ultimately let off by Leveson, despite the criticism. Judged by what he did, as opposed to what he said he was prepared to do, therefore, he cannot be criticised. Ed Miliband is speaking to the Commons now. Here's Andrew Sparrow's write-up of Cameron's statement: He says this has been the most thorough investigation into the press ever. On the press and the police, he says Leveson found no basis to challenge the integrity of the policy. But he made various recommendations to address the allegation that their relationship with the press was too cosy. The government accepts those recommendations, he says. He says the second stage of the Leveson inquiry, looking at the detail of the phone hacking case, is still due to go ahead. But it won't go ahead until after the court cases. On the relationship between the press and politicians, Cameron says he said last year that politicians of all parties had got too close to the press. The report makes recommendations on this. The government accepts them. The report also says there was no deal between the Conservatives and News International. Cameron says those who made that allegation, including Gordon Brown, should withdraw it. The report also said that Jeremy Hunt handled the News Corporation bid for BSkyB properly and that he was not appointed with the intention of helping the bid go through. Cameron says he was right to stand by Hunt. Hunt has handled the affair with great dignity. On the behaviour of the press generally, Cameron says the report says some parts of the press behaved recklessly, with disregard for privacy or accuracy. The press are subject to privacy law and data law. But there should be proper regulation too. The PCC is not a regulator, nor is it \"fit for purpose\". Cameron says the government agrees with Leveson that the proposals put forward by the press do not \"yet\" go far enough. (That \"yet\" could be very important.) Cameron summarises Leveson's regulatory principles. He says he accepts them. He hopes the House will come behind them. The onus is now on the press to implement them. Leveson suggests taking away some of the protection journalists enjoy under the Data Protection Act. Cameron says he is wary of this. Leveson also recommends giving papers incentives to sign up to the new body. Cameron says he has 'some serious concerns and misgivings\" on this. This would involve writing press regulation into the law of the land. \"We should think very, very carefully before crossing this line,\" he says. On the practicalities, he says he thinks it could become too complicated. He cites page 1,172 in volume four as an example. Leveson's proposals could be used in future by politicians to put conditions on the press. He says that the wants to start cross-party talks on this. But he wants the press to implement the Leveson principles. They should start that immediately, he says. The system of press regulation is broken. A new system needs to be built. Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging David Cameron's statement in full here.  Cameron is saying the Commons should think very, very carefully before legislating on press regulation. He is worried about this as a matter of principle. He is also worried about using statute in practical terms and he also thinks what Leveson wants can be put in place without statute. He has invited Clegg and Miliband to cross-party talks on the issue. He wants to give the press a limited amount of time to look at this. While no one wants to see full statutory regulation, \"the status quo is not an option\", he says. Josh Halliday has dug out Leveson's comments on the Operation Motorman investigation into the unlawful trade of personal data. It revealed a \"cavalier, if not worse\" attitude to the law by journalists, according to the lord justice. In one chapter on the 2006 investigation, Leveson concludes that there was enough evidence to prove that \"many journalists either knew precisely how the information was being obtained [by private investigators] or turned a Nelsonian eye to the obvious\". He adds: Without condemning any journalist (none of whom were ever even interviewed by the ICO), it is sufficient for me to conclude that, at least in part, what has been revealed by some of the Operation Motorman evidence demonstrates an attitude to compliance with the law relating to data protection which can only be described as cavalier, if not worse: it is certainly revealing of what, at that time at least, were the practices of parts of the press. Patrick Wintour detects some disruption on the Conservative right, which could cause problems for Cameron: The initial signs from the Tory Right is that the proposals may be rejected and this places David Cameron under a pressure. It is clear that Downing Street is going to support the tougher independent regulator, proposed in the report one that is tougher than the one proposed by Lord Hunt, the chair of the press complaints commission. But one suspects that in the thicket of the proposals about the role of Ofcom will cause Cameron difficulties, and will be seen as too powerful. He may argue something can be done by other means such as civil law. Nick Clegg will be using this opportunity to assert the voice of the Liberal Democrats after Leveson criticised both Labour and the Conservatives for three decades spent too close to the press. Privately both Labour and Liberal Democrats will probably regard the proposals as at the end minimalist end of the spectrum, but they have also stressed they did not want to see state regulation, but instead state underpinning of regulation to make sure the regulator was permanent, and did not retreat from its duties to regulate once the heat of the current media battle had died. Leveson has delivered his version of that. Neither party is realistically in the mood to suggest the reforms should go further than Leveson. The sight of two political parties pressing parties to now go further than the judge in regulating the press would be politically implausible for both Miliband and Clegg. And what now for Ofcom? There was some frustration amongst some leaders that Leveson had not been more prescriptive about the powers Ofcom might have over the independent body if Ofcom believes the body is not carrying out its duties properly. Amongst the purist advocates of a free press, there will be concern about the basis on which the voluntary body is being established, and whether there is a statutory element to the appointments process to the body or to the monitoring role of Ofcom. They might also question whether Leveson is setting out a system of licenced and unlicenced newspapers. Press refresh to watch Cameron's statement live. David Cameron is now speaking about the Leveson report in the Commons. Here are Lord Justice Leveson's key findings on the police, courtesy of Lisa O'Carroll: \u2022 There is a perception that senior Met officers were \"too close\" to News International which was \"entirely understandable\", given police actions and decision-making. \"Poor decisions, poorly executed, all came together to contribute to the perception.\" \u2022 Hospitality police received from media, lavish restaurants and champagne did not enhance the Met's reputation. \u2022 The Met's decision not to reopen the criminal inquiry into hacking was \"incredibly swift\" and resulted in a \"defensive mindset\". \u2022 Some police decisions from 2006-10 were \"insufficiently thought through \u2026 wrong and unduly defensive (and not merely with the benefit of hindsight)\". \u2022 The Met hacking review, led by John Yates, failed in its strategy to inform potential victims of hacking, including Lord Prescott. \u2022 Given his friendship with a senior News International executive, Yates should have recused himself from the inquiry. \u2022 No evidence decisions to limit the hacking inquiry were due to undue influence or corruption. Integrity of police not challenged. \u2022 It should be mandatory for chief police officers to record all of their contact with the media, and for that record to be available publicly for transparency and audit purposes. \u2022 Chief officers should also be the subject of regular independent scrutiny by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, including through unannounced inspections. The judge has rightly condemned the outrageous conduct of the press in the recent years. The crucial point is the importance he places on the complete independence of regulation from politicians and from the editors and proprietors, who run the wholly discredited PCC.  He has proposed a system of voluntary and independent self-regulation. The proposals made by the industry do not come close to this ideal. What is needed is a regulator which can properly and effectively protect the victims of press misconduct... The press must be given a deadline. The Inquiry is over. Now is the time for action. Lord Justice Leveson delivered his report with a short statement, which you can listen to here. The purpose of this inquiry has been twofold. First, it is to expose precisely what has been happening. Secondly, it is to make recommendations for change. As for change, almost everybody accepts that the Press Complaints Commission has failed in its task - if indeed it ever saw itself as having such a task - of keeping the press to its responsibilities to the public generally and to the individuals unfairly damaged. Not a single witness proposed that government or politicians, all of whom the press hold to account, should be involved in regulation of the press. Neither would I make any such suggestion.  Let me deal with the idea that this inquiry would not have been necessary had criminal law worked effectively. There were aspects of the way the phone hacking investigation was managed in 2006, and the failure to undertake reviews, and there are problems with criminal and civil laws, and data protection.  in particular, exemplary damages should be available for all media torts including breach of privacy. In the end however, law enforcement could never be the answer, because law breaking this area is typically hidden with victims unaware of what has happened. Even if possible, and it certainly isn't desirable, putting a policeman in every newsroom is not an answer. The powers of law enforcement are limited because of the privileges the law affords to the press to protect sources, so that it can perform its role in the public interest. What is needed is a genuinely independent body with obligations in the public interest.  On BBC News, Alastair Campbell, the former Labour press chief, says he doesn't really understand why Cameron and Clegg cannot agree a common position on this. From the Guardian's commenters: Hottentot says: I think Lord Leveson's presentation and the substance of his comments were fair, balanced and right! wireless99\"  .... so the 'good' members of the press that participate in the new self-regulatory body can print their version of the 'fair trade' logo on the front on their papers? smileydog:  What an impressively logical mind Leveson has. He ruthlessly chops down all the counter-arguments one by one. Up4grabs: So much heat and light. If the newspapers can currently drive a juggernaut through the rule of law, the police, the government, and the PCC, what is a little man in an \"ofpress\" office going to do? The regulator with teeth is the customer. Why do people always look to the government to fix things when the real power sits with them and their buying choices? Newspapers are finished anyway in the age of realtime news and interactive opinion. Leveson and the reaction is just the final death throes. Read those comments here Newspaper shares have reacted calmly so far to the Leveson findings, and have hardly changed since the report was unveiled, writes Nick Fletcher. However, the publishers had seen contrasting fortunes this morning in the run-up to Leveson's announcement. Trinity Mirror shares are down 2.5p at 79.5p, a 3% fall, while Daily Mail &amp; General Trust is up 7.5p at 525p or 1.45%. In the US, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has yet to start trading for the day but is forecast to open flat. So far this year, Daily Mail is up around 29%, Trinity Mirror has risen 71% and NewsCorp has climbed 34%. Here's News Corp's share price live: Jacqui Hames of Hacked Off is on BBC News now welcoming the report. The proposals made by the industry do not come close to the idea of a regulator that can properly protect the victims of press misconduct, she says. David Sherborne, the lawyer representing the 51 victims of the press, says there is a clear recognition in the report of widespread failings of the press. Leveson recommends strong regulation of the press, underpinned by statute. The Hunt-Black proposals are \"utterly unworkable\", he says. It is time now to implement these recommendations within a timeframe so that if the press fails to create an independent regulator, this parliament must impose one, he says. Thanks to Guardian reader oharar for this Wordle of Leveson's statement: Lisa O'Carroll has added to her roundup of Lord Justice Leveson's key findings and recommendations, with the following points: \u2022 On the Dowlers The Guardian's revelation that messages had been deleted from 13-year-old Milly Dowler's phone when it was hacked turned out to be an error that \"was significant enough\". But had it been couched in \"more cautious terms or less certain terms may not have been capable of criticism at all\". Leveson says the fact remained that the News of the World hacked the phone of a dead schoolgirl. \"The revelation of that story rightly shocked the public conscience in a way that other stories of phone hacking may not have, but it also gave momentum to growing calls for light to be shed on an unethical and unlawful practice of which there were literally thousands of victims. In that context, whether or not NoW journalists had caused the 'false hope' moment is almost irrelevant.\" \u2022 On the McCanns Leveson devoted almost 12 pages to the McCann family. Some of the reporting of the disappearance of three-year-old Madeleine McCann from Praia da Luz in Portugal in May 2007 was, Leveson says, \"outrageous\". A number of newspapers were \"guilty of gross libels\", with the Daily Star singled out for its headline claiming the McCanns had sold their child, in a piece headlined: \"Maddie sold by hard up McCanns\". \u2022 On Jeremy Hunt On the press lobbying for self-regulation, Leveson is withering, saying he does not find \"the self-interested lobbying of the press to be an appropriate matter for press regulation\". He says he has some sympathy for politicians who are lobbied. \"Not only are the press powerful lobbyists in their own interests, but they wield a powerful megaphone with considerable influence.\" Max Mosley, former Formula One chief, successfully sued the now defunct News of the World over a false story that he was involved in a 'sick Nazi orgy'. He said it would be 'astonishing' if the government did not act on Leveson's recommendations. It certainly is a very thorough document and it's in many respects better than one could have hoped. It would make the situation much better than it is now and what he has done is more or less give the press what the Hunt-Black proposals would want, but underpinning with a statutory to make sure there's no backsliding and no cheating.  The only real omission is that if you want to stop something coming out because you find that they are going to breach your privacy, you would still have to go to court to do that, which of course is very expensive. I think it would be astonishing if the politicians didn't implement the report because no responsible politician could allow the current situation to continue. I do not want the message to go out from this country that the UK is bringing in a press law but we do have to make a fresh start with a new body and that is what I'm going to reveal. I did sense that Brian Leveson wants the press now to get on with it. He embraced a free press. What we have to make sure now is the press do not let him down. There is a huge opportunity here and we must seize it. Civil liberties group Liberty - whose director Shami Chakrabarti served as an assessor in the inquiry team - welcomed the principal recommendation of a more robust and independent press self-regulator, but said it was unable to back the last-resort alternative of compulsory statutory regulation. Chakrabarti said: Leveson's main proposal makes sense for the public, press and politicians alike. The press sets up a robust body \u2013 independent of government and serving editors \u2013 and earns legal protections from needless challenges in court. The public gets confidence of greater access to justice and redress when things go wrong. What nobody needs and Liberty cannot support is any last-resort compulsory statutory press regulation - coming at too high a price in a free society. The Spectator's editor, who vowed yesterday not to comply with any statutory regulator, is not impressed: And here is some more industry reaction: The prime minister says he will give a \"clear sense of direction\" in his Commons statement this afternoon. For over 40 years, as a barrister and judge I have watched the press in action. I know how vital the press is - all of it - as guardian of the interests of the public, as a critical witness of events, as a standard bearer for those who have no one else to speak up to them. Nothing has changed that view. The press operating freely is one of the true safeguards of our democracy. As a result it holds a privileged and powerful place in our society.  But this power and influence carries with it responsibility to the public interest in whose name it exercises these privileges. Unfortunately as the evidence has shown beyond doubt, on too many occasions those responsible along with the editors code of conduct - which the press wrote and promoted - have simply been ignored. This had damaged the public interest, caused real hardship and on occasion wreaked havoc on the lives of innocent people. What the press do and say is no ordinary exercise of free speech; it operates very differently to blogs on the internet and other social media such as Twitter. Its impact is uniquely powerful. A free press in a democracy holds power to account but, with a few honourable exceptions, the UK press has not performed that vital role in the case of its own power. None of this however is to conclude that press freedom in Britain, hard won over 300 years ago, should be jeopardised. On the contrary - it should not. I remain firmly believe that press, all of it, serves the public very well well most of the time. The are truly countless examples of great journalism, great investigations and great campaigns. Not that it is necessary for the press to be pursuing serious stories for it to be acting in the public interest. Some its most important functions are to inform, educate and entertain, and when doing so to be irreverent, unruly and opinionated. But none of that means that the press is beyond challenge. I know of no organised profession, industry or trade in which the serious failings of the few are overlooked because of the good done by the many. In any other case the press would be the first to expose such practices. Here are links to the different sections of the Leveson report: Executive summary  Volume 1 Volume 2 Volume 3 Volume 4 Here are the report's key recommendations, courtesy of Lisa O'Carroll: \u2022 New watchdog independent of MPs and newspapers, with statutory underpinning An independent self-regulatory body underpinned by statute. It should be free of \"any influence from industry and government\". Leveson said: \"It should be governed by an independent board. The chair and the members of the board must be appointed in a genuinely open, transparent and independent way.\" \u2022 The possibility of a First Amendment-style law Leveson says the legislation should allow for an independent regulator to be organised by the industry, but it \"should also place an explicit duty on the government to uphold and protect the freedom of the press\". \u2022 Powers, remedies and sanctions of the new watchdog Fines of 1% of turnover with a maximum of \u00a31m. It should have \"sufficient powers to carry out investigations both into suspected serious or systemic breaches of the code\". Had the Press Complaints Commission had this power it could have gone into the News of the World newsroom to investigate allegations of widespread phone-hacking. \u2022 Libel resolution unit The new watchdog should have an arbitration process in relation to civil legal claims against subscribers. The process should be fair, quick and inexpensive. \"Frivolous or vexatious claims\" could be struck out at an early stage. \u2022 Membership This is not legally obligatory, which means the likes of Richard Desmond, owner of the Express could continue to opt out of the regulatory body. But Leveson recommends that if they do not join the independent regulator, they should be policed by the broadcast watchdog, Ofcom. And here are its key findings: \u2022 On phone hacking Leveson makes no findings on any individual but says he is not convinced hacking was confined to one or two individuals. \"The evidence drives me to conclude that this was far more than a covert, secret activity, known to nobody, save or or two practitioners of the 'dark arts'.\" \u2022 Newspapers have recklessly pursued sensational stories \"There has been a recklessness in prioritising sensational stories, almost irrespective of the harm the the stories may cause and the rights of those who would be affected.\" The damage to people like the Dowlers, the McCanns and Elle Macpherson's former adviser has been \"devastating\". \u2022 Families of actors and footballers also have rights to privacy Families of famous people have had some of their lives destroyed by the relentless pursuit of the press. Leveson says he found \"ample evidence\" that parts of the press decided actors, footballers, writers, pop stars were \"fair game, public property with little, if any entitlement to any sort of private life or respect for dignity\". He adds: \"Their families, including their children, are pursued and important personal moments are destroyed.\" \u2022 Condemns covert surveillance Leveson finds that there has been \"a willingness to deploy covert surveillance, blagging and deception in circumstances where it is extremely difficult to see any public interest justification\". He notes the News of the World was even prepared to put a surveillance team on two lawyers, Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris, acting for phone hacking victims. \u2022 Failure of compliance and governance at the News of the World Few would subscribe to the view of Paul McMullan, the former feature writer, who told the inquiry that \"privacy is for paedos\", says Leveson, but he said the paper's \"casual attitude to privacy and the lip service it paid to consent demonstrated a far more general loss of direction\". \u2022 Complainants not taken seriously enough Leveson found \"there is a cultural tendency within parts of the press vigorously to resist or dismiss complainants almost as a matter of course\". He says some papers are defensive and even when an apology is agreed, they get their own back by resorting to \"high-volume extremely personal attacks on those who challenge them\". This is the seventh time in less than 70 years that these issues have been addressed. No one can think that it makes any sense to contemplate an eighth. He hopes he will get a cross-party response. The report will speak for itself and he will make no further comments. The ball moves back into the politicians' court. They must now decide who guards the guardians. He thanks everybody involved in the inquiry. The press is entitled to lobby in its own interests, through its writing and through access. But the extent to which politicians are lobbied should be open and transparent so the public understands the process. He suggests a number of steps to increase transparency. A good start would be for those steps to be taken in relation to press lobbying about this report, Leveson says. Similar considerations apply to politicians when taking decisions about media ownerships. Democratically elected politicians are the right people to take these decisions, he says. But they must be made in a more transparent way. The competition authorities should have the means to keep levels of plurality under review, Leveson says. \u2022 Inquiry recommends new regulator with statutory backstop \u2022 McCanns and Dowlers had 'devastating' experiences \u2022 Hunt gave a 'perception of bias' in contacts with News Corp Dan Sabbagh and Lisa O'Carroll offer their first take on Leveson's findings here Lord Justice Leveson has recommended the introduction of the first press law in Britain since the 17th century \u2013 proposing that a statutory body such as Ofcom should take responsibility for monitoring an overhauled Press Complaints Commission. The proposal \u2013 made despite the fierce opposition of Fleet Street to the introduction of statute \u2013 is designed to reassure the public that newspapers are subject to an effective and independent regulator to prevent a repetition of phone hacking or other scandals. He turns to the police - the press have an important part to play in policing by consent. There has been a limit to how far the inquiry could go because of ongoing court cases, Leveson says. There is no evidence to suggest that corruption by the press is a widespread problem in relation to the police, he says. Every day interactions between journalists and politicians cause no concern, but in a number of respects the relationship between politicians and the press has been too close - he is referring to policy lobbying outside of the public eye. That gives rise to the understandable perception that the power of the press is being used to influence policy. That undermines the perception of media policy being made in the public interest, Leveson says. The body should not include any serving politician or current editor. An appointments body could include a current editor, Leveson allows. He has made recommendations but it is not his role to establish a new press standards code or to decide how a new PCC would go about its business, he says. He also addresses the need for incentives to be put in place to encourage all in the industry to sign up to the new body. This cannot be realised without legislation, he says. There has been so much misinformation about legislation, Leveson says. He is proposing it only for the narrow purpose of recognising a new independent self-regulatory system, he says. It would not establish a body to regulate the press. That is for the press itself to organise and to do, Leveson says. It would enshrine a legal duty on the government to protect the freedom of the press. It would provide an independent process to recognise the new body. It would provide new benefits for the press - as members, newspapers could show they acted in good faith and had sought to comply with public interest standards. Decisions of the new regulator could form precedent. A formally recognised, free arbitration system would also be part of it, he says. This cannot be characterised as statutory regulation of the press, he says. The statutory part is to provide for press freedom and support, he says. On Monday he heard that most of the industry was prepared to sign up to that. He cannot back the Hunt-Black model, though \u2013 it does not come close to delivering regulation that is genuinely free and independent both of the industry and political control, Leveson says. Any model with editors on the main board does not come close. It is still the industry marking its own homework, he says. The press needs to establish a new independent regulatory body independent of the media and parliament, he says. The privilege the law provides to the press, for example in protection of sources, must also be taken into account. So a system of independent self-regulation is needed. He has asked the press to try to do this. Lord Hunt and Lord Black tried to do this, he says, with their plan for a contractual body. Not a single witness proposed government or politicians should be involved with the regulation of the press, Leveson says. He turns to the idea the criminal law could have dealt with everything raised by the inquiry. Exemplary damages should be available for all media torts, including breach of privacy. But law enforcement cannot be the only answer, because lawbreaking in this area is typically hidden, with the victims unaware, he says. Putting a policeman in every newsroom is no sort of answer. Almost everyone accepts the PCC has failed in the task of keeping the press to its responsibilities to the public and to individuals, he says. There must be change. But none of that means the press is beyond challenge, he says. He knows of no organisation where the serious failings of the few are overlooked because of good done by the many. In other industries, the press would criticise that, Leveson says. Press freedom should not be jeopardised, he says. The British press serves the country well most of the time, Leveson says. The press operates very differently to blogs, Twitter and other websites, he says. A free press holds power to account. But with a few honourable exceptions the UK press has not performed this vital role in the case of its own power. He says it is the standard bearer for those who have no one else to speak up for them. Nothing he has read has changed that view. The press is one of the true safeguards of democracy, he says. But this power and influence carries responsibilities. On too many occasions, those responsibilities, along with the editors' code of conduct, have simply been ignored, Leveson says. On occasion that has \"wreaked havoc\" on the lives of innocent people. He says he is grateful to all who have contributed to his inquiry. For over 40 years he has watched the press in action in his courts. He knows how vital it is, he says - all of it. Leveson says his investigation started with the hacking of the phone of a murdered girl and expanded to cover politicians, the press and the police. Lord Justice Leveson has started speaking.

Lord Justice Leveson today recommended the introduction of the first press law in Britain since the 17th century \u2013 proposing that a statutory body such as Ofcom should take responsibility for monitoring an overhauled Press Complaints Commission. The proposal \u2013 made despite the fierce opposition of Fleet Street to the introduction of statute \u2013 is designed to reassure the public that newspapers were subject to an effective and independent regulator to prevent a repetition of phone-hacking or other scandals. Lord Justice Leveson, in the 56-page summary to his 2,000 page report, said that the purpose of legislation was \"not to establish a body to regulate the press\". But he warned that if newspapers were not prepared to join a revamped PCC it would be necessary to force Ofcom to act as a \"backstop regulator\". He also said he \"cannot recommend\" the model of PCC reform drawn up by Lords Black and Hunt, because it would be insufficiently independent of the press. The appointment of the chair of a revamped PCC would have to be done by a \"fair and open process\" with a majority on the appointments commission who are \"independent of the press\". The proposed press law was one of a string of conclusions in a summary that contains withering criticism of standards in the industry \u2013 but the shorter document rarely singles out individual newspapers.  \"There have been too many times when, chasing the story, parts of the press have acted as if its own code, which it wrote, simply did not exist. This has caused real hardship and, on occasion, wreaked havoc with the lives of innocent people whose rights and liberties have been disdained,\" the judge wrote. Leveson said that people such as the McCanns and the parents of Milly Dowler had \"devastating\" experiences at the hands of the press, and that parts of the industry viewed celebrities as little more than \"fair game\". However, there was specific criticism leveled at the News of the World, and by implication, its owner Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Leveson said that \"most responsible corporate entities would be appalled that employees were or could be involved in the commission of crime in order to further their business. Not so at the News of the World.\" In its summary there was little criticism of individual politicians or media owners. But the political handling of News Corp's BSkyB bid was singled out, and while there was no evidence that Jeremy Hunt, the then culture secretary, displayed \"actual bias\" \u2013 the exchanges between his former special adviser Adam Smith and James Murdoch's special adviser, Fred Michel, did give rise to \"a perception of bias\". The press responded to the last regulatory crisis with a 22-year pub crawl, John Prescott blogged today. He supports a stronger regulatory framework: The European Convention on Human Rights already balances freedom of expression and press regulation adequately. Articles 8 and 10 on the rights to privacy and expression should be the reference points for any new regulatory framework. Furthermore, the courts are best placed to continue to be the final arbiter in resolving these tensions. We should leave these legal calls to judges not editors. The scope of the Editors' Code of Practice should also be widened to address how each press organisation operates as an entity, in terms of its ethics and its governance. Finally, the new regulator should have real teeth to oversee the efforts of editors to achieve compliance with the code through robust internal governance measures. The Press Association quotes this fair and balanced comment from Arnie Grundberg, 73, an American visiting Westminster today: We should have strict regulation of Rupert Murdoch but a free press for everyone else.  One Twitter user explores a line of argument strangely avoided by much of the media so far: In the lunchtime calm before the storm, some Leveson carols floating around Twitter: Here's Angela Eagle, the shadow leader of the Commons, on Clegg's decision to make a rival statement to Cameron's. Yesterday the deputy prime minister requested to make a separate statement from the prime minister on the Leveson report and I see today that this has been granted. What on earth is happening to collective responsibility? I see the play Yes, Prime Minister is leaving the Trafalgar Theatre to go on a UK tour, but with this government there will at least be one farce running in Whitehall. Martin Hill at the Belfast Telegraph explains that during the paper's twice-daily editorial meetings, there will regularly be stories that would see the editor arrested, or worse, in the countries listed on the bottom half of the Press Freedom Index.  One thing that unites this grisly band is their detestation of the free press. It's a club David Cameron is going to be asked to join tomorrow...  \"Scaremongering\", supporters of statutory control of the press will cry. And, of course, no one is suggesting that Belfast, or London, is going to turn into downtown Pyongyang any time soon. But make no mistake: if Cameron's response to Lord Justice Leveson's long-awaited report is to bow to demands for 'statutory underpinning' of newspaper regulation, he will be taking one step closer to shackling Britain's free press. Of course, no one who took even passing notice of Leveson's 100 days of public hearings could doubt that elements of the press need to clean up their act. This map on Wikimedia Commons, based on the Press Freedom Index, maps how democratic countries and press freedoms are connected. At the Downing Street press briefing this morning, David Cameron's spokeswoman was repeatedly asked whether the PM would be speaking for the whole government when he makes his statement today. She declined to answer directly, saying instead: \"The prime minister is making a statement in his role as prime minister.\" She added: It is a lengthy report. They are still working through it ... There is a lot to work through in a short period of time. Both the prime minister and deputy prime minister want to make a statement on the report. We are in a coalition government and sometimes things are done differently in a coalition government. The spokeswoman said Clegg had made his request to the Speaker, John Bercow, and it had been Bercow's decision to grant it. David Cameron's former communications director, Andy Coulson, and the ex-News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks have appeared in court over alleged illegal payments to public officials, Josh Halliday reports. In two short hearings at Westminster magistrates court in central London on Thursday morning, the pair spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and that they understood the charges. They appeared alongside the former News of the World royal correspondent Clive Goodman, the veteran Sun journalist John Kay and a Ministry of Defence official, Bettina Jordan-Barber. The chief magistrate, Howard Riddle, sent the five for a directions hearing at Southwark crown court on 6 December. Click here for full details. Prominent figures who took part in the inquiry arrived this morning at the Queen Elizabeth II centre by Parliament Square. Among them were phone-hacking victims including the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, Kate McCann, the mother of missing Madeleine, Max Mosley, who took on the News of the World over an intrusive story, as well as Hugh Grant. Protesters also gathered outside \u2013 one dressed as a bound and gagged David Cameron and others holding placards declaring \"End the Murdoch mafia\". Both Cameron and Clegg will be speaking \"on government policy\" this afternoon, the Conservative leader of the Commons, Andrew Lansley, has said. He said the decision by Cameron and Clegg to make separate statements on Leveson was \"perfectly reasonable in immediate response to a wide-ranging inquiry as the Leveson inquiry, for a sense of how the coalition government is pursuing the process of considering a response to this report\". That suggests we won't get any firm policy from either of them \u2013 instead it sounds like the start of a process of negotiation. Lansley added: The house will be better informed by virtue of two statements than by one. Dan Sabbagh has written the definitive guide to everything you need to know about the story of press regulation up to now: what Leveson is doing, the arguments for and against statutory regulation, what all this means for internet publishing and what happens next. It is unclear exactly how the prime minister will react, but one outcome being canvassed is that the coalition gives the press time to come up with a reformed PCC, and leaves hanging over the industry the threat of statutory Ofcom regulation if Britain's highly politicised and factionalised newspapers cannot agree. A noisy few weeks is expected as campaigners, politicians and the press itself fight to introduce the model that they want. The precise outcome is far from certain \u2013 but nobody believes that the status quo is an option. Andrew Sparrow has been speaking to a Lib Dem source about Nick Clegg's decision to make a separate statement to David Cameron on Leveson. This is what his source told him: Do not look at this as some massive split on the issue, or the coalition at loggerheads. That's not where we are. Nick slept on this overnight and took the final decision this morning. He [took the decision to make a separate statement in the Commons] because, regardless of how the coalition committee goes, people are going to be looking ahead to cross-party talks and they are going to be talking about where the different parties and the different party leaders stand, and Nick thought it was right to seek an opportunity to set out his stall as one of the three main party leaders. And here's Andrew's view of that: Fair enough. But it's still hard to see how Clegg can produce a rival statement without people inevitably deciding that he and Cameron have failed to agree. Because, in practice, Clegg is deciding to speak in his capacity as Lib Dem leader (so that he can emphasis his party's position) rather than in his capacity as deputy prime minister (where you would expect him to defend the government position, set out by Cameron). Here's our our news story on David Cameron and Nick Clegg's decision to offer separate statements to parliament. David Batty and Patrick Wintour write: Clegg met Cameron on Wednesday to discuss their approach to the report. Cameron is expected to call for a tough new independent press complaints body capable of imposing fines, while keeping the option of statutory regulation on the table for a later date if the new regulatory body is not working ... Cameron is minded to demand a toughened up form of independent regulation, but to give the newspaper industry six months to put its house in order or face statutory controls. There are key figures in No 10 advising him that he cannot be seen to be soft on Tory-inclined newspapers, even if it sours relations between him and their proprietors. Back to Hugh Grant for a second... Patrick Wintour gives us the latest Whitehall predictions of what the report will say, but adds that you should take some of this with a pinch of salt: Hugh Grant and other phone-hacking victims are about to get their copies of the report: These protesters outside the QE2 conference centre for Leveson today will know the Rupert Murdoch story, but here's some pertinent detail for those of you in the mood for a refresh. And here's a summary of the Leveson inquiry itself. Lord Justice Leveson and his chief attack dog Robert Jay QC emerged as a formidable double act. Their candid demeanour was punctuated by long, uncomfortable silences, creating a challenging atmosphere for even the most self-assured operators. Here are some clips of the most interesting political evidence to the Leveson inquiry, including David Cameron, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. And here are some of the most interesting media figures speaking at the inquiry, including Rupert Murdoch, Rebekah Brooks, Kelvin MacKenzie, Paul McMullan, Piers Morgan, Jeremy Paxman and Alan Rusbridger. Broadcast reporter Jake Kanter has the stats on Grant's documentary last night, which may or may not have elicited some sympathy as he battled to find anyone on 'the other side' to take part. From our review: The actor's enemies in the press will like to present this project as the most boring movie of Hugh Grant's career. In reality, that would be difficult to achieve \u2013 as his credits include the 2007 rom-com Music and Lyrics \u2013 and the truth is that he played the role of David efficiently and interestingly. Grant's problem is, as the film seemed to become ever more gloomily aware as it continued, that whatever Leveson says, the prime minister seems likely to side with Goliath. Andrew Sparrow has more on Nick Clegg's statement to parliament. Cameron will make his statement at 3pm. Miliband will respond for Labour, and then MPs will get the chance to ask questions. The exchanges should last for an hour or more. And then Clegg will stand up and give his own statement. It is expected that Harriet Harman will respond for Labour. And then MPs will also get the chance to question Clegg. Harriet Harman will definitely respond to the Nick Clegg statement, Labour has confirmed. Over on Andrew Sparrow's blog, political experts are exploring what Clegg's separate Leveson statement might mean: Tom Watson MP is revelling in his image as a Clint Eastwood-style rumble-tumble scourge of Murdoch: Hunt is silent on Twitter today, but there's plenty of comment on his speech on quality of care yesterday. Leveson's verdict on Hunt will be a key outcome of the report, as we detailed yesterday: Did Jeremy Hunt handle his ministerial duties properly? The culture (now health) secretary was accused of acting as a cheerleader for News Corp's \u00a38bn bid for full control of BSkyB, and his adviser Adam Smith resigned, admitting that his emails to the News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel had been inappropriate in \"volume and tone\". The Speaker's office has confirmed that Nick Clegg will make his own statement on Leveson. It is probably reasonable to assume that that is because Cameron is not going to propose a system of press regulation that Clegg can agree to. That suggests that Cameron may not be going to propose a system backed up by statute. But the truth is we don't know. Andrew Sparrow writes on his politics blog: This is unprecedented. We've never had two coalition ministers making rival statements in the Commons on the same subject since the coalition was formed (although, of course, the coalition ministers have frequently made separate policy statements outside the chamber \u2013 just ask Ed Davey and John Hayes). Has this ever happened in previous coalitions? I don't know, but I will try to find out. It means that the coalition is officially split over Leveson. Sky and the BBC are both reporting that Nick Clegg will make a separate statement on the Leveson report today. More details soon ... With impeccable timing, Sally Bercow has returned to Twitter after leaving apresumably acceptable amount of time (10 days) since both lawyers and her husband 'whipped her ass'. Has been retweeting kittens and puppies to be safe, but there has been the odd quip: Robert Jay QC, the Leveson inquiry's lead counsel, made a name for himself during the hearings for his sesquipedalian vocabulary. Here's a video of him deploying some of his most impressively abstruse words. New Statesman points out that Leveson has not scrutinised media ownership as much as ethics, yet the two are intertwined: It was News International's overweening dominance of the market that enabled it to remain above the law for so long. Even after the closure of the News of the World, the company still accounts for 34% of UK newspaper circulation and, had it not been for the Milly Dowler phone-hacking allegations, News Corporation would surely have acquired full control of BSkyB to add to its HarperCollins book publishing empire. To ensure that no media organisation can ever wield such political power again, a cap should be placed on ownership as is the case in France...  Emily Bell's column today on what Leveson doesn't cover - online publications, US publications read by UK audiences, freelance journalists ... in short, 21st century media. The free press of the 21st century consists of the distributed social platforms, the WordPress blogging software and the \"dark social\" matter of the hidden web, as much as it is the venerable institutions that have local accountability to whatever regulator the UK government should seek to appoint... Leveson deals with the nefarious ways of publishing personal information; it deals with the fallout of incestuous relationships run from the heart of government; and it deals with the personal cost of people crushed by journalism-as-showbusiness. What it cannot deal with is the regulation of the press in the 21st century. What is the solution? To put \"the internet\" within the scope of Leveson would be as daft as it would be futile, and to regulate the press further, without having a broader definition of who \"the press\" might be, is a recipe for irrelevance. Perhaps more interesting in his opposition to statutory regulation is Graham Foulkes, whose son David was killed in the 7/7 attacks. It is thought he may have been a phone-hacking victim. What mustn't happen, under any circumstances, is for parliament and government to start interfering and passing laws to regulate the press and the media in any shape or form. A free press and a free media is a cornerstone of democracy and we should not allow the government to interfere. I'm hoping that Leveson comes up with a process which will restore public confidence in the media by forcing the media to behave themselves. He was also critical of the inquiry itself, which he said turned into the \"Rebekah Brooks and David Cameron Show\". The celebrity circus arrived didn't it? And Leveson went from being a really serious piece of work for Joe Public to OK! magazine overnight.  The whole focus of the issue was which celebrity was on, what was he saying, what was she saying? And then it became the Rebekah Brooks show and the David Cameron show and the horse-riding show. Here are Nick Clegg's quotes on Leveson this morning in full: Everybody wants two things: firstly, a strong, independent, raucous press who can hold people in positions of power to account, and secondly to protect ordinary people \u2013 the vulnerable, the innocent \u2013 when the press overstep the mark. That's the balance that we are trying to strike and I am sure we will. Rabid anticipation of Leveson on Twitter. Turns out the press standards debate can actually be quite funny: As Dan Sabbagh mentioned earlier, in the Sun this morning Boris Johnson restates his case against statutory regulation of the press. The mayor of London, a former journalist, writes: Today Lord Justice Leveson will be under huge pressure to propose some form of statutory control of the press. I hope and pray that the government will not take that step backwards. It is one of the glories of this country that we have a free, exuberant and sometimes feral media. They keep public life far cleaner than many other places in the world \u2014 and that makes this country a wonderful place to live and invest in. As for the journalists. Well, we already have a system of regulation. It is called the law. If they break it, I say bang 'em up. But to pass a law controlling the media would be to go back on three centuries of press freedom. I am writing this on a plane in India, where they have a riotously free press. They would be amazed and shocked by what is being proposed in Britain. Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian's head of media, tweets some early intelligence on what the report may contain: Financial Times journalists have been ordered not to tweet commentary on the Leveson report by their editor, Lionel Barber, Lisa O'Carroll reports. \"We will have commentary but it will stretch beyond 140 characters,\" he told staff in a memo. The publication of the Leveson report is also keenly anticipated in the US, where some politicians remain concerned that Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation may have violated local laws on corruption, reports Lisa O'Carroll. Jay Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate committee on commerce, science and transportation, wrote to Leveson earlier this year to find out if any of the evidence suggested \"unethical\" or \"illegal business practices\". On Wednesday night Rockefeller said: \"While I understand that the main goal of this report is to make policy recommendations, the core of the inquiry remains the illegal and unethical practices of newspapers owned by the News Corporation. I remain deeply concerned that these companies may have violated US laws and injured US citizens. I hope that Lord [Justice] Leveson's new report and other ongoing investigations will continue to clear the air and hold the companies accountable for their deplorable conduct.\" The Sun and the Mirror devote plenty of space to their Leveson coverage today, reports Dan Sabbagh, and by contrast there is very little in either the Daily Mail or the Daily Express. Rupert Murdoch's red-top opts for two spreads, starting on page eight, concentrating on the paper's opposition to statutory regulation. It lines up a series of famous names to reinforce the point, with comment pieces reserved for Richard Taylor, father of Damilola, Katie Price, aka Jordan, and \u2013 with the largest slot of all \u2013 Boris Johnson, the mayor of London whose former head of press Guto Harri is now News International's director of communications. A restrained leader on page 10 argues that \"state control would destroy free speech - a freedom millions died to protect\". There are apologies, too, for some of the \"abhorrent\" behaviour of the News of the World (which it notes has now shut) and an admission that the Sun \"has made mistakes in the past\", although it adds that it believes they have been \"corrected\". But there is little sign of the title's historic stridency, even if the leader ends with a warning: \"How much of Britain's most popular paper would be left if everybody with an axe to grind had been through the pages?\" A punchy Lloyd Embley, the editor-in-chief of the Daily Mirror, writes under his own name on page eight on the topic. Where the Sun treads lightly, he comes out swinging, in a piece that will speak for many who work or have worked on the red-tops. Embley references the emotional reaction to the Guardian's revelation that Milly Dowler's voicemail had been hacked and that messages left for her had been deleted, giving her family false hope she was still alive. Embley goes onto note that it turned out that \"the single most stomach-churning element of the whole saga\" \u2013 the deletions \u2013 turned out to be incorrect, but says Fleet Street still \"needed to take a long, hard look at itself\" and that the PCC needs to be replaced. Embley then criticises Cameron for having to launch the Leveson inquiry, because he was desperate to distance himself from Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks. But he worries that the PM is in a tight corner: \"I believe he appreciates the absolute necessity of a free press within a healthy democracy. The nightmare for him is he maybe damned if does and damned if he doesn't.\" The Hacked Off campaign \u2013 which has campaigned for greater regulation of the press \u2013 will hold a press conference at 4pm today, with some phone-hacking victims in attendance. Nick Clegg has said this morning that we need a \"raucous press\" that holds people in power to account, but the press also needs to be held to account when it oversteps the mark. \"That's the balance we need to strike,\" he said. As mentioned earlier, the public's view of whether there should be statutory regulation of the press can vary depending on how the question is framed. Peter Kellner of YouGov explains that when a question refers to such regulation as being \"independent\" and grounded in \"law\", people tend to favour it. But when the question refers to \"parliament\" or \"MPs\" setting the terms of this regulation \u2013 essentially the same thing \u2013 support for the proposal plummets. Kellner writes: Ideally, we would like a new law to force the media to behave better \u2013 but don't want MPs making that law. The trouble with that, of course, is that law-making is the central function of MPs. Yesterday two polls by ComRes, one for ITV and another for BBC Radio 5 Live, both showed support for independent regulation of the press backed by law. The ITV poll showed 51% of the public thought the government should \"introduce statutory regulation of the media\". Only 20% disagreed. The BBC poll showed that 47% want \"a regulatory body with rules agreed and enforced by the courts\". Only 12% wanted \"a regulatory body with rules agreed and enforced by newspaper owners\". Good morning. Today, 16 months after the Guardian revealed that the News of the World had hacked murder victim Milly Dowler's phone and David Cameron established the Leveson inquiry, Lord Justice Leveson will publish his report into the culture and ethics of the press. Here's a rough timetable for today: 9am/10am: Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks are due to appear in court, facing charges linked to alleged bribery of public officials. Coulson, Cameron's former communications chief and the ex-editor of the News of the World, and Brooks, the former CEO of News International and ex-editor of the NoW and the Sun, will appear at Westminster magistrates court alongside former Sun chief reporter John Kay, Ministry of Defence employee Bettina Jordan-Barber and former News of the World royal correspondent Clive Goodman. 1.30pm: Lord Justice Leveson's report will be published. At the same time, Leveson will make his statement on his findings and recommendations at the Queen Elizabeth II centre in Westminster. 3pm: David Cameron, who took delivery of the report yesterday, will make his Commons statement on Leveson. Ed Miliband will reply. Nick Clegg may also make a statement if he and Cameron have failed to agree on a response. 4pm: The Hacked Off campaign will hold a press conference, with some phone-hacking victims in attendance. In the run-up to the publication of the report, debate among politicians and the media has focused on whether Leveson will recommend statutory regulation of the press - ie a system of regulation established in law. The newspaper industry considers this an unacceptable violation of the freedom of the press \u2013 the Spectator vowed yesterday never to take part in any such scheme \u2013 and has largely coalesced around a proposal made by Lord Hunt, the head of the Press Complaints Comission, and Lord Black, chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, for a beefed-up version of the PCC based around five-year rolling contracts. Hunt has said \"all\" publishers are willing to sign up to this; however, the Guardian, Financial Times and Independent say that while they back the principle of a regulator based on contracts they cannot agree to the detail of the two peers' plan as it stands. In an editorial, the Guardian said the Hunt-Black plan amounted to continued self-regulation rather than truly independent regulation, and suggested ways it could be improved to make it acceptable. Cameron is expected to reject the Hunt-Black plan and is thought to back a more independent form of regulation \u2013 although it is not clear whether or not he supports legal underpinning for this. The Tory party is openly split on the issue, with scores of Conservative MPs calling for statutory regulation of the press, and similar numbers publicly opposing it. Labour and the Lib Dems, with some exceptions, seem more united in backing independent regulation enshrined, if necessary, in law. Ed Miliband wrote in the Guardian this week that he supports \"independent regulation \u2026 made possible by statute\". Nick Clegg may make a Commons statement of his own today if he and Cameron are unable to come to a common position on Leveson. There were signs yesterday, however, that all three main parties are keen to find cross-party consensus on the issue. The public, meanwhile, seem to reject self-regulation of the press \u2013 but either back or oppose statutory regulation depending on how the question is framed. All this debate has taken place before Lord Justice Leveson has revealed a word of his conclusions. It may prove to lay the groundwork for months of brutal negotiations between press and parliament \u2013 or it may all have been barking up the wrong tree. We'll find out at 1.30pm. And it's not just the press that are nervously awaiting the report. The Metropolitan police has been formally warned that it faces criticism into its handling of the phone-hacking scandal and relations with the media. Leveson may also make some kind of judgment on the actions of Jeremy Hunt, the former culture secretary now at Health, during News Corporation's bid for full control of BSkyB. Here are 14 questions the judge may answer. To refresh your memory of the last year Esther Addley runs through the key events that led us to this point, from the Guardian's revelation that the News of the World hacked Milly Dowler's phone through the closure of the NoW and the withdrawal of News Corporation's bid for BSkyB to all the highs and lows of the Leveson inquiry. And we'll be covering all today's events right here as they happen.",
