Photo by tsevis on Flickr. Some rights reserved Charis Tsevis created this image of Mark Zuckerberg for the latest UK Wired magazine. He's done the same for Steve Jobs and Apple icons, as published in FOCUS Italia - the density and detail in that picture is quite incredible. His work for Esquire magazine - an image of Greek designer Giannis Kouroudis is particulalrly impressive. And best of all is the portrait of President Obama using Ndebele tribal designs, Tsevis says, and Madiba presidential shirts. Photo by tsevis on Flickr. Some rights reserved",
