  "content": "The News of the World has today lost its key witness in the Max Mosley privacy case after one of the five women involved in sadomasochistic sex parties with the formula one boss withdrew from giving evidence. The dominatrix, identified in court as Woman E, who secretly filmed the S&amp;M sessions at a Chelsea flat on March 8 and 28 on behalf of the News of the World, was expected to testify along with her husband before Mr Justice Eady in the high court today. However, earlier today the paper's QC, Mark Warby, told the court that Woman E would not be giving evidence because of her \"emotional and mental state\". \"This morning, at about ten to eight, I received information which has later been elaborated on which leads those instructing me and my clients to take the view that her emotional and mental state is such that it would not be fair or reasonable to call her to give evidence,\" Warby said. The loss of the testimony of Woman E has forced the newspaper to drop one of its central arguments - that another of the five women, Woman A, had given instructions that the scenarios would have a Nazi theme at Mosley's request. \"We will not persist in that case. It is a most regrettable situation to have arrived at,\" Warby said. However, Warby argued that the News of the World would continue to argue that the S&amp;M role play at the parties featured in its video had a Nazi theme on the basis of other evidence, adding that the footage had an \"overwhelming, absolutely overwhelming Nazi theme\". Earlier, the court heard testimony from the newspaper's chief reporter, Neville Thurlbeck, who told the court that Woman E told him she was instructed by Woman A that the orgy was to have a Nazi theme and that two of the women were expected to wear German uniforms. News of the World editor Colin Myler also testified on the paper's behalf, defending the story as \"legitimate\". Myler said the story was in the public interest because of Mosley's position as an elected official in the motor sport industry and the fact that he is the son of British 1930s Fascist leader Oswald Mosley. Mosley and four of the five women earlier gave evidence that the S&amp;M scenes were straightforward prison scenarios without any Nazi overtones. He said he believed his sex life should remain private and the expos\u00e9 in the News of the World had been \"devastating\" and \"humiliating\" for him and his family. The case has been adjourned until Monday to allow preparation of closing speeches. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
