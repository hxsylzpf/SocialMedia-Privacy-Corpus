  "content": "As far back as December 2011, the Lord Chief Justice issued guidance that allowed journalists to tweet from courtrooms. Lord Judge's document about the use of Twitter - and all hand-held digital devices, including lap-tops - was sensible and based on the public's right to know. It said: \"A fundamental aspect of the proper administration of justice is the principle of open justice. Fair and accurate reporting of court proceedings forms part of that principle.\" Of course, journalists still had to take account of the contempt of court laws that govern reporting, which was fine. So, if the practice of tweeting in a court of law is sanctioned, then why is at least one council refusing to allow journalists to tweet from their meetings? A reporter from the Daily Post in north Wales was banned from tweeting from a Wrexham county borough council committee meeting during a discussion on price rises for school buses. He was ordered to put his phone away. The Post's editor, Alison Gow, responded by calling the decision \"undemocratic\", adding: \"When you consider some local councils 'live stream' their debates, ad hoc Twitter lockdowns are crazy.\" The council explained that journalists could tweet, but only if they gained permission from the chairman first. That was a clear inhibition of press freedom and Gow launched a right to tweet campaign. A bizarre episode followed. A committee chairman gave the Post's reporter permission to tweet but banned anyone else - including his fellow councillors - from doing the same. Post reporter Steve Bagnall, underlining the need for transparency in local government, wrote that the paper wanted everybody to have the right to use social media. All seemed set fair for a sensible outcome\u2026 until the council debated the issue on Monday. In time-honoured bureaucratic fashion, Wrexham's silly burghers decided to set up a cross-party scrutiny committee to look into the use of Twitter, Facebook and cameras and report back in - wait for it - May. Councillor Arfon Jones urged his colleagues to allow tweeting. He pointed out that politicians tweeted from the Welsh Assembly and from the Westminster parliament. He also explained that Wrexham's neighbouring counties in Wales - such as Ynys M\u00f4n, Gwynedd, Conwy and Denbighshire - do not prohibit the use of social media. But his fellow councillors wouldn't budge. Off to committee it goes and with it yet another example of the failure of people to grasp the digital revolution's democratic spirit. And democratic practice. Sources: Daily Post/HoldTheFrontPage here and here",
