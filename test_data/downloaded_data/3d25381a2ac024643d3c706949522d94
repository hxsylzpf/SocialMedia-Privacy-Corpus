  "content": "Guardian Australia, which on Wednesday broke the story of the government's massive data breach whereby the private information of almost 10,000 people in immigration detention in Australia was published on the Department of Immigration website, welcomes Scott Morrison's admission that this is an \"unacceptable incident\" and \"a serious breach of privacy by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection\". We welcome the review into how the breach occurred, and the privacy commissioner's announced investigation. However there are a few points in the immigration minister's statement which require a response. Morrison says the information was not \"in an easily accessible format within the public domain\". Guardian Australia can confirm that the document was freely available for download from a public area of the department's website, along with many other public files. The document and the data contained within it were straightforward to access. In his statement, Morrison reveals details about the document, including the date of its publication and the type of file. In a subsequent television interview, he named the document. Guardian Australia has not released the name or date of the document, to ensure no further breach of privacy. Morrison concludes his statement with this paragraph: \"My department will also be requesting that the media organisation that published this data advise if they have disseminated the information to any other parties and to return all copies of the information to the department.\" No such requests have yet been received by Guardian Australia from the department, but we can confirm that we have never published the data, including in our original story; that we have refused all requests for the data from other news organisations, to protect the privacy of those named; and that we have not disseminated the data in any way. Guardian Australia notified the department of the breach before publication, and did not publish until the document had been removed from the department's website. We also notified the privacy commissioner of the breach.",
