  "content": "Travel social network Dopplr's founding design director Matt Jones is stepping back from the company to join Jack Schulze and Matt Webb's design agency. Accordingly, the outfit is renaming from Schulze &amp; Webb to Berg (standing loosely for British Experimental Rocket Group) - \"Schulze, Webb &amp; Jones\" sounded a bit long. Now that Dopplr is up and running, there is less design-intensive work needed; Jones will continue working with Dopplr as a design advisor, one day a month. He has known and worked with the well-thought-of pair over a number of years, and the fit is natural - all three are creative lateral thinkers. Jones was previously BBC News Online's founding design director and a concept design manager at Nokia (NYSE: NOK) amongst other roles.",
