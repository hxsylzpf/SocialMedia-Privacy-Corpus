  "content": "What is Nuji? Nuji is a community of design and fashion enthusiasts who curate the internet's best fashion and lifestyle goods. Anyone can create a profile or boutique others can follow. Our users can add products from any online store or brand. If they have a blog or website, it can also be embedded in their profile. What's the appeal of Nuji for retailers? The whole point of Nuji is that consumers can discover high quality products they wouldn't see elsewhere, so it's a great opportunity for retailers to compete based on their products instead of their marketing budgets. We've seen the tiniest of stores rise to the top based purely on their quality of what they produce. Nuji sits at the meeting point of retail and technology \u2013 what other products, trends or devices are you excited about in this area? The reduction to the barriers to entry for consumers to become makers is really interesting. It's a long way away and the verdict is still out whether this is something consumers are actually interested in. Computers, the internet and blogging software enabled people to become makers in the form of blogging, and I wonder whether a similar thing will happen to products with the advent of 3D printing and more accessible design software. In terms of technology's relationship to fashion, there are two particular developments I'm interested in. First, the rise of Instagram and its influence in shopping and fashion. Lots of people and companies are trying to figure out how to hijack the platform and turn it into a shopping destination. It will be very interesting to see how this turns out. The other is the merging of technology and clothing. Everyone is talking about smart watches, but I think the integration of very discrete sensors in other clothing items is going to be fascinating. There are no companies that I'm aware of that are experts in hardware, software and fashion design. Nike came the closest but, it looks like they have stepped away from the Fuelband. What's next for Nuji? We are big believers in the merging of commerce and content. This is why we are now rolling out lots of tools to enable our users to embed any part of Nuji into their blog or website. Think of embedding YouTube videos or SoundCloud music clips \u2013 this is what we're focusing on doing with Nuji shoppable widgets. There's an interesting future in a more distributed version of Nuji; the .com will become less important as this happens. What tips do you have for other retail tech platforms? There are lots of real, fundamental technical problems that need to be solved. Bridging together online and offline shopping still seems so far away, and I think it would be great if more technical minds were focused on solving deep infrastructure problems that could unleash much needed innovation in a very short period of time.
