Now open to \"conversations\" across four social media platforms, I feel the need to do more networking of the face-to-face variety. So the call from Will \u2013 one of a number of social media gurus in the St Albans area \u2013 came at just the right time. \"You must try Networking for Business Inc,\" he said. \"The St Albans chapter has an opening for a coach just now.\" American in origin, NBI \u2013 as it is known to its devotees \u2013 seems all the rage. Started by the revered networking guru Dr Ira Persky, it operates through exclusivity. \"Because there's only one coach allowed,\" Will explained, \"all coaching referrals go straight to you.\" This sounded quite persuasive so I popped along this week to the St Albans chapter's fortnightly breakfast \u2013 at the Red Lion Inn, naturally. Much more structured than any other networking meeting I've attended, NBI appears to be all about \"referrals\". Indeed, \"referrers reap\" was a mantra I heard repeatedly. Each member has to bring referrals to the meeting which are then passed out in the form of little paper slips. At one point, the meeting becomes a flurry of frenzied slip-passing, although I couldn't help observing that they were all getting passed between a small group of tradesmen. \"I'm working on a new development in Chiswell Green,\" said Phil, the affable roofer. \"They need a sparks.\" \"Sweet,\" said Barry the electrician, picking up the slip. \"My developer in Chipperfield needs a plumber.\" Barry in turn passed another slip to Stuart the plumber. And so it went on. Before that, we were asked to stand up and do our \"60 seconds\" \u2013 a snappy \"elevator pitch\" that sticks in the mind of other members so they can refer business to us more easily. I waffled hopelessly about executive coaching and reaching your goals. Then there was an \"expert slot\" filled on this occasion by Will who showed us the Erik Qualman video. Although I'd seen it before, it remains impactful. Towards the end of the meeting, Harvey, the chairman, asked me \u2013 as the sole guest \u2013 to go with two of the \"directors\" into an adjoining meeting room to hear more about the benefits of membership. \"Please have your credit card ready,\" he added, smiling. The next 20 minutes were a blur as I was presented with a series of forms for signature. I emerged as the sole coach in the St Albans chapter (\u00a342.50 plus VAT a month) to rapturous applause from the other members. I drove back through driving rain feeling rather bleak in spite of my welcome into NBI. Ollie was still in bed, having just finished his mocks the week before, and Sandra was on the phone talking animatedly about the ladies' team selection at the tennis club. I gently moved a dozing Rocky from my laptop and switched it on, hoping for something uplifting on my Twitterfeed. The first tweet was from Myles, my highly successful coaching neighbour: \"Just landed in Dubai for a week's coaching. 32 degrees. Lovely!\"",
