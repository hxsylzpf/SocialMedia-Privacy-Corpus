Darling is due to outline the preliminary findings of a review of HMRC's data security ordered after two discs containing the bank details, addresses and phone numbers of every family in the country went missing. But he faces tough questions after the discovery by MPs investigating the lapse that at least two senior officials at HMRC knew about the flawed data-management systems - undermining the chancellor's claim that a single junior official was to blame. The transport secretary, Ruth Kelly, is also preparing to face MPs over the loss of more than 7,000 motorists' details by the Northern Ireland Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA). Last week it emerged that two discs had gone missing between the DVA and the offices of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea. A Department for Transport spokeswoman confirmed that Kelly would be making a statement, but refused to be drawn on reports over the weekend that an even more serious loss had now been uncovered. Following the HMRC data loss in October, Kieran Poynter, the chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers, was brought in to head an inquiry. His interim report, published by Darling today, is expected to set out what he has learned so far about the loss and any immediate changes he has advised HMRC to make. The lost data was downloaded onto two CDs and put in the post at an HMRC office in Washington, Tyne and Wear, in October following a request for information from the National Audit Office. The cabinet secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell's findings on data production across government will also be published today. Dave Hartnett, HMRC's acting chairman, who took over after the resignation of Paul Gray, will give evidence later today to the public accounts committee on the loss of child benefit data. Initially ministers sought to blame a failure by junior officials to follow proper security procedures. But, when he appeared before another Commons committee two weeks ago, Hartnett acknowledged that the loss could represent a \"systemic\" failure within the HMRC. He told the Treasury subcommittee that there had been seven significant breaches of security involving the loss of personal data since Gordon Brown merged the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise into a single department in 2005.",
