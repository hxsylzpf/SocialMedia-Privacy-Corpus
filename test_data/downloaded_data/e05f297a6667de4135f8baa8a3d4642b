Three years after the web search giant bought the site for $1.65bn (\u00a31.01bn), it has yet to turn a profit \u2013 and the company has struggled to sell online advertising against the YouTube's eclectic content. As a result, analysts have said that it is losing the company at least $175m a year \u2013 less conservative estimates suggest it could be as high as $470m. That, they suggest, means the household name could end up being a millstone around Google's neck. But speaking at the annual Allen &amp; Co Sun Valley conference in the US this weekend, Google co-founder Larry Page said he had no doubts that YouTube would eventually be extremely valuable to the company's bottom line. \"It's not that important,\" said Page of YouTube's heavy spending. \"I'm not worried that it will be profitable \u2013 we want it to be very profitable.\" Google chief executive Eric Schmidt was more circumspect, however, saying that a selection of new advertising formats \u2013 such as pre-roll spots and paid placements \u2013 were the key that would eventually unlock serious income. \"We're optimistic that YouTube will be a strong revenue business for us because of these products,\" he told reporters. The comments came after a week of informal, private discussions between the world's leading media magnates at Sun Valley, an annual gathering for the great and good of the entertainment world. Held in the shadow of Idaho's Smoky Mountains at a resort made famous in the 1940s by Ernest Hemingway, the event has been described as a summer camp for moguls; a place where some of the planet's most influential executives let it all hang out in the rarified air of one of America's ski resorts. Conference attendees including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch are encouraged to indulge in activities such as biking, hiking, golf and riding \u2013 leading to the bizarre sight of groups of billionaire chief executives wandering the exclusive ski resort with their spouses and children, decked out in Sun Valley branded body-warmers and baseball caps. Despite the collegiate atmosphere, however, it was clear that the 300 attendees at this year's Sun Valley had serious business on their minds. In between their leisurely activities, the great and the good used their time to chew over the impact of the recession and the rise of the internet; a double whammy that has left many of them reeling. Though the event itself takes place behind closed doors \u2013 ironically enough considering that the owners of almost every major news business are in town \u2013 the attendees have shared a few thoughts with the press during the week. Murdoch himself made an appearance to say that the conference chatter was \"very bearish, very bearish\" and largely preoccupied with how to cope with the economic slump. \"I'm shocked at the business mood, which is talking about either that we're at the bottom or going lower, or that it's going to take years and years \u2013 like five years at least \u2013 before we see any real growth coming out of this,\" he told Fox Business. That gloomy outlook was reflected in panel discussions with grave titles like \"Managing a global company through a downturn\" and \"The internet: what tomorrow holds\", where attendees apparently wrangled with the difficult truths facing the global media. Those desperate for advice from the new guard did not have to look far: the guest list included the trio who run Google, as well as Facebook's young Mark Zuckerberg and Evan Williams, the chief executive of hot internet startup Twitter. Even the technologists who graced the conference were in competition with each other, however. A hotdog-munching lunch between Google's Schmidt and Microsoft chairman Gates took on added significance in the wake of the internet giant's announcement that it would be building its own computer operating system that could challenge Microsoft's Windows. But while one of the biggest draws for the conference in the past has been deal-making \u2013 most famously when a meeting in the car park led to Disney's $20bn purchase of US television network ABC in 1995 \u2013 that appeared to be put to one side this year in the face of the recession. Early suggestions that the conference could see a deal to buy internet messaging company Twitter were quickly scotched, while some said the grim economic outlook left few chances to turn this week's meetings into serious deals. \"Buyers are looking for bargains, sellers are looking to get what they think they were worth a year ago,\" said Jeff Zucker, the chief executive of NBC Universal. \"I think that makes it difficult to get anything done in this climate. I think you'll probably see nothing in the media space for the rest of this year.\"",
