  "content": "Cuban blogger Yoani S\u00e1nchez spent 30 hours in custody - during which she lost a tooth - after being detained while travelling to cover the controversial trial of a Spanish politician. After her release, S\u00e1nchez tweeted: \"A little feminine vanity: no remember me without a tooth, remember me flying free on blue bird of Twitter, complete!\" She travelled to Bayamo in eastern Cuba to attend the trial of Angel Carromero, the leader of the youth wing of Spain's ruling Popular Party, who crashed a car into a tree in July, killing two people. The Cuban government claims Carromero was speeding at the time, an allegation he denies. The family of one of the crash victims has called for Carromero's release, saying they do not believe the government's version of events. Since founding the blog Generaci\u00f3n Y in 2007, S\u00e1nchez has upset the Cuban authorities on numerous occasions. She was named as a world press freedom hero by the International Press Institute (IPI) in 2010. Detaining activists for brief periods before releasing them is a common tactic used by the Cuban authorities. In September, IPI reported on the arrest and beating of Roberto de Jes\u00fas Guerra, editor of the news website Hablemos Press, along with one of the site's photographers. As I reported a couple of weeks ago, another journalist working for Hablemos Press, Calixto Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez Arias, has been in custody since 16 September on charges of insulting Fidel and Ram\u00f3n Castro under the country's desacato (contempt of authority) laws.
