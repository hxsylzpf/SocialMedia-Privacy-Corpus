  "content": "Vanessa Feltz has made a plea to the press to give celebrities the same \"basic human rights\" as those not in the public eye. The former TV presenter, who recently considered suing the Mirror under the Human Rights Act following its reports of an alleged affair, says Naomi Campbell deserved a modicum of privacy from the press even if she has used the media to further her career. \"Why, merely because we've admired her picture and her sashay down a catwalk, should we be entitled to know the secret details of her physical or mental health,\" she says in a newspaper column. \"We may be fascinated to find out that she is a drug addict in recovery,\" continues Feltz. \"We may be titillated, entertained and moved to chat about it. There is, however, a vast difference between what the public is interested in, and what is in the public interest.\" Feltz claims that despite being a public figure, Campbell's public life should not be subject to the degree of scrutiny appropriate to a politician. \"If Naomi Campbell were a politician, trading on the 'upright pillar of the community' ticket, deliberately hoodwinking the voters and being paid public money for the privilege, it would be in our interest to expose her as a former user of illegal drugs,\" she writes. \"If Naomi Campbell made a living as a fitness expert, extolling abstinence and flogging us health-related products, it would be in our interests to unmask her hypocrisy.\" But. unlike these figures, \"Naomi has not set herself up as an icon of sobriety,\" she says. \"Naomi's fame should not mean she forfeits the right to all privacy.\" \"The side-effects of a high profile - being trailed by paparazzi, snapped as you arrive at a restaurant with someone you shouldn't, seeing pictures of yourself in a bikini or less, splashed across the newsstands - are tiresome but par for the course. \"Some matters, though, should remain private. Medical records, mental health treatment, attendance at addiction recovery programmes must remain, as it does for the rest of the community, confidential.\" \"So should consensual sexual relationships which do no one else any harm. So, too, should anything to do with children or other relatives.\" Feltz recently came close to sueing the Mirror and Sunday Mirror over a series of articles about her sexual relationships with former trainer Dennis Duhaney and another man, Fitzroy Charles. However, her complaint to the press complaints commission was rejected on the grounds that she had \"compromised\" her privacy by discussing her private life in the newspapers. This came despite denials that she had had an affair with Fitzroy Charles. She considered suing the Mirror but decided she didn't have the stomach for such a public fight. Lawyers acting for the Mirror - which is being sued by Campbell - are claiming that the model has similarly put too many aspects of her private life in the public domain to bar the press from discussing her addiction. Last week the editor of the Mirror, Piers Morgan, said Campbell had \"relentlessly invaded her own privacy\" by discussing her relationships with high profile boyfriends including Hollywood actor Robert de Niro, U2 bassist Adam Clayton and dancer Joaquin Cortes.",
