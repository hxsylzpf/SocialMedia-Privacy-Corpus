The announcement swept across the world. Individuals from all countries and backgrounds flooded Facebook, Twitter and Instagram with rainbow-filtered images to celebrate the decision and show support for the adoption of marriage equality. In today's digital age, access to social media means that millions can communicate their passion for a cause without leaving their homes. Imagery is fundamental to this \u2013 it's a medium that is easily shared and distributed through social media, enabling a diverse network of people to speak out, join in and be heard. We are becoming an audience of what we at Getty Images like to call vanguardians: intrepid individuals who foster global citizenship and drive change. On Getty Images, use of the search term \"social responsibility\" has risen 73% in the past five years. The beauty of social media is that it creates a global community, uniting people who might otherwise never have known one another, raising greater awareness of global issues and causes. Instant impact Why do people often get behind images more than words? According to researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the human brain can process entire images in as little as 13 milliseconds. Social media and content analysts will also tell you that visuals increase user engagement \u2013 in some reports, by as much as 94%. Images have the power to connect with people instantly and emotionally. Image advocacy uses the visual medium to share an opinion or movement. An example of this growing phenomenon was seen earlier this year, when scientist and Nobel laureate Tim Hunt caused controversy by saying at a science journalism conference in South Korea: \"Let me tell you about my trouble with girls \u2026 three things happen when they are in the lab \u2026 You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticise them, they cry.\" Hunt stood down from his position at University College London and has since said he made the comment in a jocular, ironic way, but the whole affair also created one of the wittiest hashtag of 2015: #DistractinglySexy. With more than 10,000 tweets using the hashtag in a matter of hours, female scientists across the world banded together to share images of themselves at work to respond to Hunt's comments. These images put faces to the issue in a way that words could not. Those viewing the images had a person to empathise with and relate to. These people took a stance on gender equality using imagery as their tool for change. Tips for marketers How can brands and marketers tap into this movement? For starters, take inspiration from the best. Dove's Campaign for Real Beauty is a perfect example of a brand using imagery to powerful effect \u2013 in this case, challenging stereotypes around beauty. By showcasing real women in its advertising, Dove focused on making women feel more comfortable with their bodies, demonstrating that the norm is not necessarily the slim women we often see in glossy magazines and advertisements. Although the campaign doesn't directly promote a specific product, it demonstrates that Dove understands the issue and how its customers and feel about it. Another great example is something in which we're involved: writer and director Richard Curtis's Project Everyone campaign, which aims to raise awareness of the UN's global goals, including ending poverty, hunger and making clean water and sanitation available to all by 2030. The campaign launches on 25 September and, as a founding partner, Getty Images will be supplying all images, using their power to help the campaign reach, connect and engage groups across the world. How will we decide which images to select? How to select the perfect image for driving change Think global: If you want to drive change on an international scale, choose imagery that resonates globally and doesn't just work in one region. Don't be too literal: Real images are powerful and shocking, but try to strike a balance; metaphorical imagery can also be very evocative at communicating why change is needed. Be authentic: Use photographers and visuals from a region where the issues exist; they can create the most authentic imagery. Choice composition: Use a graphic and powerful composition that works across different media, from a mobile screen through to a big billboard.
