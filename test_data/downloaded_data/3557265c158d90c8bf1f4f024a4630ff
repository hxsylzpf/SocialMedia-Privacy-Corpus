  "content": "In the 1930s, newspapers around the world reported on the romance between Britain's king, Edward VIII, and Mrs Wallis Simpson. UK newspapers stayed silent, their journalists constrained by a cabal of their conniving owners. Some 80 years on, Americans are able to read about a British celebrity's sexual shenanigans while British newspapers are silenced by court order. Now it is possible to discover the identity of the people involved because they can be found on various US-based social networking sites, just as the Sun predicted weeks ago. This, according to Thursday's Daily Mail front page story, makes British law an ass. Judges have compromised the public's right to know by banning publication of the story, which had been planned to appear in the Sun on Sunday. Now I'd better make it clear that I genuinely haven't the slightest interest in knowing who did what to whom. I imagine, however, that I'm in the minority. For years, I have argued that the popular press agenda is warped by its desire to reveal what consenting adults do in private. It is, with some exceptions, the participants' business and theirs alone. Arguments that such revelations are \"in the public interest\" ring hollow. In what way does society benefit from knowing that X or Y broke their marital vows with Z? There are certain occasions when disclosure can be justified, most obviously if a woman is coerced or if one of the people involved has taken a public position against the behaviour in which they are involved. One of the public interest clauses of the editors' code of practice supports the exposure of hypocrisy: papers are welcome to \"protect the public from being misled by an action or statement of an individual or organisation\". Having read the appeal court judgment, I note that the couple at the heart of the matter argue that they have not misled the public because they had not adopted a moral stance that conflicted with their private behaviour. Neither had they \"courted publicity about their private life.\" The Sun on Sunday's counsel contended, however, that the fact the couple had \"portrayed an image of commitment\" offered a public interest justification to publish. At the initial hearing, the judge, Mr Justice Cranston, accepted that argument. \"It seems to me,\" he said, \"that having promoted that particular public image there is a public interest in correcting it when the claimant has engaged in the sort of casual sexual relationships as demonstrated in the evidence.\" But the two appeal court judges took a different view, in part because of another interesting facet of the case: the couple's school-age children. The claimant, known in court simply as PJS, argued that the children would suffer if the sexual relationship was made public. Those children had privacy rights (under article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights). Again there was a disagreement between the high court judge and the appeal court judges. Cranston said he could \"appreciate\" the difficulties faced by the children of \"a well-known couple\" should the truth emerge. But he ruled: \"The article 8 rights of the children cannot operate as a trump card.\" By contrast, the appeal court judges, in trying to balance privacy rights with those of freedom of expression, thought it important to \"have regard to the interests of other family members who may suffer as a result of the proposed publication\" adding: \"This is certainly not a trump card, but it can on occasions be significant.\" If the article were published, it would \"generate a media storm and much public interest in the claimant's family\", said the judges. \"The children would become the subject of increased press attention, with all that that entails. \"Furthermore, even if the children do not suffer harassment in the short-term, they are bound to learn about these matters from school friends and the internet in due course.\" I understand from a legal source at the Sun on Sunday's publisher, News Group Newspapers, that this argument - which, after all, did prove to be a trump card - went down badly at the paper. Its journalists and legal team believed the couple were \"using their kids as an excuse\" to prevent disclosure. Consider, said the source, the reality: \"The children of celebrities generally go to schools with the children of other celebrities. Those 'school playgrounds' are hardly representative and - rather than being the cauldron of a bullying culture - are likely to [engender] peer-group support and counselling forums for such children.\" In its leading article, the Mail said the hypocrisy \"stinks\" because \"celebrities spend fortunes on promoting an image of happy family life to appeal to their fans, who in turn buy their products and enrich them beyond dreams. \"Yet the moment an uncomfortable truth threatens to shake the fans' trust, they run screaming for an injunction. Whatever happened to the public's right to know?\" I must admit I find myself conflicted over this matter. I accept that the online world makes a monkey of UK courts' injunctions. I accept that in many jurisdictions, notably the United States, no such injunction would ever be granted. I am also firmly committed to press freedom. So, reluctantly, I must side with the Sun on Sunday and the Mail. I just wish, when fighting for press freedom, we didn't have to stoop as low as exposing people's private sexual behaviour.",
