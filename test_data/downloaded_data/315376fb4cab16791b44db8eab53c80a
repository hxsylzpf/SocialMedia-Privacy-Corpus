These contrasts can be seen quite clearly in a new study and visualisation of Instagram photos called \"The Exceptional &amp; The Everyday: 144 Hours in Kiev\", which was created by a research team led by Lev Manovich, professor of computer science at The Graduate Center, City University of New York. It includes over 13,000 photos by 6,165 different users geo-located to Independence Square in Kiev between February 17 and 22 this year - hence 144 hours in Kiev. Zooming into the images reveals a mixture of both photos of the day's tumultuous political events and everyday images you could expect from any Instagram user such as selfies and animal pictures. This first snapshot below shows a closeup of images uploaded during the evening of 18 February, one of the worst days for clashes between protestors and government forces. A lot of the pictures pulled out display the violent scenes that were taking place, drowning out much of the non-protest-related content. However, looking at the next closeup from the following morning shows that while some scenes from the previous night's events are still present, a lot of the activity on Instagram has returned to normal. If you want to know more, researchers have created a dedicated site for the project, providing many more insights about the geography, timing and tagging of the images.",
