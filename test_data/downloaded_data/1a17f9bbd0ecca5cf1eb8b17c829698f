Had he been white, his opinions in his recent article for Prospect magazine might have got him denounced as a Nazi head-measurer. The son of Caribbean migrants, Sewell claims that institutionalised racism in British schools is not failing black children. He says that the routinely disquieting exam results, particularly from boys (in 2008, only 27% of black boys achieved five or more A*-C GCSE grades), are because of the pupils themselves. As well as being poorly parented, these children are disrespectful, lazy and badly behaved. This is why they fail their exams, not because they are being held back. In decades gone by, such children may have been \"burned out in a racist school system\", but times have changed. These days, says Sewell, school leaders are so afraid of being branded racist, they prefer to cast black children as victims. Meanwhile, black boys in particular rush to embrace victimhood. Sewell has wide-ranging experience of educating black children \u2013 one of his hats is director of the charity, Generating Genius, which targets African-Caribbean children, to get them to university. Sewell is also one for tossing flare bombs into race debates: a few months ago, he argued on these pages that absent fathers were a bigger problem for black boys than racism. So is Sewell right? Is there such a thing as an obsolete racial victimhood thriving in our school system? Victimhood as comfort blanket, an excuse for bone-idle black kids, who don't seem to have noticed that Asian children tend to do pretty well in British schools? In turn, is there what could be described as a \"racism excuse\" in schools? A chilling attitude of: \"Nothing is your fault or your own responsibility \u2013 you're just black, you poor thing.\" It's difficult to tell. Maybe we should ask the hordes of failing white kids. One presumes that Sewell realises that his descriptions of failing black children could just as easily be applied to failing white children, in particular poor white boys who sometimes do even worse than their black counterparts (girls, whatever their race, tend to do better). Moving away from the hot topic of Asbo-toting hooligans, there are the other kinds of white children who rarely get mentioned in these debates \u2013 children who are much better off in material terms, but who are lazy, disrespectful and balls up exams. The difference is not that these children are white, which means little if you're extremely poor, it's that they are middle class, which means that when they start sliding towards the cliff edge of educational failure, their parents often have the resources to rescue them. Having gone through exams with a child, it has been an eye-opener to see the complex, expensive series of educational safety nets (tutors, retakes, courses, crammers) that are in place for children whose parents can just about afford it. Then there is the middle-class culture of 24/7 involvement in the child's education. This sort of behaviour takes time, energy and, all too frequently, money. These are resources that poor families, black and white alike, simply don't have. All children have the capacity to be disrespectful, lazy screw-ups. The difference is that when better-off kids start drowning, they tend to be rescued, while poorer kids sink straight to the seabed. No one is judging the middle-class way (I'm as guilty of the exam rescue mission as anybody). However, this is a crucial class factor, which dovetails inexorably into race. Sewell makes a valuable point that black children, or their parents and teachers, must not use \"racism\" as an excuse to embrace victimhood. However, we should still acknowledge that for all children the social status of their parents is often a deciding factor in their education success and whatever the intricate details of UK wealth distribution these days, it's not likely to be concentrated in black communities. Indeed, while class remains the headline for educational outcome, more often than not, race will be writhing about in the subtext somewhere. Facebook? Strictly for the deluded According to the new Forbes 400 list, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is the world's fastest-rising billionaire. At 35 in the list, which is topped by Bill Gates, Zuckerberg has increased his worth by 245% and is wealthier than Rupert Murdoch and Apple's Steve Jobs. Less happily for him, the film, The Social Network, due for UK release next month, is said to show Zuckerberg's behaviour during the early days of Facebook in a less than favourable light. Oh goodie! I haven't had much to do with Zuckerberg's brainchild \u2013 I am too old to post photos of myself in a push-up bra or type \"LOL\" without feeling unclean. In common with most social networking sites, Facebook has always seemed like a kind of yapping gallery of the lost, the deluded and the damned; if I fancy any of that, I can go to the pub with friends. I also have an irrational dislike of Zuckerberg. The clue might well be in the statement \"the world's fastest-rising billionaire\". Then there's his age \u2013 he's 26 \u2013 and the fact that he's one of those super-rich people who dresses as though they've been rummaging in the sales bins at Gap, which is, to my mind, an act as ostentatious as being decked out head to foot in Versace, with diamond shoes and goldplated eyebrows. First popularised by Gates, this state of \"perma-dress down Friday\" is, in truth, a dress code as strict as any uniform. It's the mega-rich person's way of saying: \"This is how I got so rich, suckers, by having an inner life and focus and not caring about clothes.\" Oh wotevva! as someone on Facebook might say. The rest of us are scruffy for no reason. The rich always have a reason. That's why they're rich. Beckham says he didn't do it. Well, I believe him. David Beckham has exploded with righteous indignation over sex worker Irma Nici's allegations of a threesome. He's threatening writs and going after six-figure damages. Translation: he's innocent this time. (At this point, the writer is taken to one side by Observer lawyers and roughed up. Her fingers are bent back, a Chinese burn administered. The writer is then returned to her keyboard.) To recap \u2013 both the (highly litigious) Beckhams have always been innocent, about everything in the world, ever. They also have a fabulous fragrance range, which doesn't smell remotely of floor cleaner and cat wee. Joking apart, Beckham does seem to be relishing being conspicuous in his outrage. He gets to be fiery and handsome and, best of all, wronged. By contrast, when the Rebecca Loos story broke, both Beckhams were much more subdued. All one recalls is a \"skiing togetherness\" photoshoot, where Victoria's \"loving smiles\" were curiously reminiscent of portraits of Lucrezia Borgia. The Beckham camp said none of the Loos allegations was true either, so why weren't there writs flying around then, just as there are now? It is a mystery.",
