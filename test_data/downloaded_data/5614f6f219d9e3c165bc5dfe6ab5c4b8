  "content": "Journalism is in Paul Dacre's bloodstream. His father, Peter, was a journalist on the Sunday Express, and the family used to analyse the Sunday papers over lunch. At school, a liberal private school in Hampstead to which he won a scholarship, he edited the magazine, and when he went on to Leeds University he immediately got involved in the student newspaper, becoming features editor within five weeks. Although Dacre, who is 60 on Friday, believes there is a continuity between his work then and his stance at the Mail - in his abiding concern about official surveillance, for example - his views were surprisingly leftwing: drug users were sympathetically portrayed and Enoch Powell's warnings about immigration scorned. It was a stint in the United States as correspondent for the Daily Express that changed him. Swayed by America's prosperity and devotion to the free market, he returned to Britain in the early 1980s as a Thatcherite. Although his wealth distinguishes him from most Mail readers - his annual salary passed \u00a31m for the first time last year, and his total remuneration is just short of \u00a31.5m - Dacre lives a quiet life that revolves around long hours in the office. He believes editors who court a public profile do so at the expense of their newspapers, and restricts his social life to a quiet drink after work before being driven home to his wife, Kathleen, and their two children. Rumours about a possible departure from the editor's chair came to a head last year after Dacre suffered several bouts of illness. But friends said he was in good health, putting his weight loss down to a heart operation. Dacre's booming voice may be rarely heard by outsiders, but he frequently airs his views in the Mail's newsroom, delivering instructions to the newsdesk in forthright language, dictating leading articles on topics close to his heart, and demanding to see early page proofs. The morality that drives his product derives from him: a vision of the world that can champion unexpected causes, such as Stephen Lawrence, but always takes a clearcut view of right and wrong. After years of scorning Tony Blair, Dacre is close to Gordon Brown. He has described Brown as \"remarkable\" and \"touched by the mantle of greatness\". One of Brown's first acts in office was to abandon proposals for supercasinos, a plan which had been the target of a fierce campaign in the Mail.",
