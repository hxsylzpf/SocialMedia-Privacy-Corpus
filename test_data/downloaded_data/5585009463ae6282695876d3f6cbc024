Andr\u00e9s Sep\u00falveda, an online campaign strategist, claimed he had also helped to manipulate elections in nine countries across Latin America by stealing data, installing malware and creating fake waves of enthusiasm and derision on social media. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, the Colombian \u2013 who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence \u2013 boasted of his ability to hack into campaign networks and manipulate opinion. \"My job was to do actions of dirty war and psychological operations, black propaganda, rumours \u2013 the whole dark side of politics that nobody knows exists but everyone can see,\" the 31-year-old told Bloomberg. However, Sep\u00falveda's claims are fiercely contested by some of those he accuses. Juan Jos\u00e9 Rend\u00f3n, the Miami-based political consultant who allegedly hired the hacker, told the Guardian he had only met him once and used his service only indirectly via subcontractors for website design in 2005. \"He is delusional,\" Rend\u00f3n said in a phone call. \"All the things he describes are exactly like the TV show Mr Robot.\" Denying all accusations of wrongdoing, Rend\u00f3n challenged Sep\u00falveda and Bloomberg to provide evidence of the claims in the form of emails or CCTV footage. He also cast doubt on the suggestion that the Internet is decisive in shaping public opinion. \"Can you really change the will of the people through social networks? Maybe in Ukraine or Syria where there is no alternatives. But here (in the Americas) where there is TV, a free press and door to door campaigns, it is not so influential,\" he said. Although he was well paid for his work, Sep\u00falveda said his primary motive was political. He supported right and centre-right candidates against what he called \"dictatorships and socialists governments\". In Mexico, however, he reportedly had a $600,000 budget to undermine the campaigns of Pe\u00f1a Nieto's two main opponents on either side of the political spectrum: the ruling National Action party's Josefina V\u00e1zquez Mota and the Democratic Revolution party's Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. His team are said to have installed malware at the headquarters of the two candidates, which let them monitor phones and computers. According to the report, Sep\u00falveda saw speech drafts, meetings plans and campaign schedules as they were typed into the keyboard. Using this information, he used a \"virtual army\" of fake Twitter accounts to direct public debate towards subjects that would strengthen Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2013 for example by acclaiming his plan to crack down on drug violence \u2013 or embarrass rivals. Sep\u00falveda said he brought high-quality fake accounts that had been maintained for more than a year to make them look genuine, as well as generating 30,000 low-end Twitter bots that bumped up numbers of \"likes\" and \"follows\", thereby creating memes and shaping discussion. \"When I realized that people believe what the internet says more than reality, I discovered that I had the power to make people believe almost anything,\" he told Bloomberg. The black propaganda could also be more focussed. To alienate the conservative Catholic supporters of a regional candidate in Tabasco, Sep\u00falveda claims he set up fake Facebook accounts of gay men to provide unwelcome support. In the swing state of Jalisco, he deliberately upset voters with automated 3am campaign calls purportedly coming from leftwing gubernatorial candidate Enrique Alfaro Ram\u00edrez \u2013 who subsequently lost by a narrow margin. To varying degrees, he said he applied similar tactics in other elections over an eight-year period in in Venezuela, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Costa Rica and Guatemala. Sep\u00falveda is now in jail for hacking crimes related to Colombia's 2014 presidential election, when he tried to help rightwing opposition candidate \u00d3scar Iv\u00e1n Zuluaga who opposed peace talks with the leftwing rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). After several attempts on his life, he reportedly choose to go public with his allegations so he can win support for a reduced sentence. Sep\u00falveda said he destroyed most of the evidence and that many of the candidates he helped may be unaware of his role, which was organised via middlemen. Chief among them is Rend\u00f3n, dubbed the \"Karl Rove of Latin America\". The article cites email between the two men. But Rend\u00f3n said the emails had not come from any of his accounts. Pe\u00f1a Nieto's office issued a statement on Thursday night, saying: \"We reject any relationship between the 2012 presidential campaign team and Andr\u00e9s Sep\u00falveda or that there was a contract with the consultant J.J. Rend\u00f3n.\" The statement also disavowed the use of the \"information and methods outlined by the said article\", and that, \"the actions of the campaign abided by the rules and restrictions established in the applicable electoral legislation\". Jorge Ram\u00edrez Mar\u00edn, a member of the Institutional Revolutionary party (PR) and vice-coordinator of the 2012 campaign, called the story: \"Absolutely false. It has no basis in reality. It's frankly fantasy.\" He also pointed out the PRI was the federal opposition in 2012, though it dominated a majority of the increasingly influential and opaque Mexican state governments. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who also finished second in a 2006 election he considers to have been rigged, said via Facebook the allegations were \"nothing new, although it's repugnant and evil\". Rend\u00f3n told Bloomberg he had worked on behalf of PRI candidates for 16 years.",
