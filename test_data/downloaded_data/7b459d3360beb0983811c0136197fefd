Zuckerberg, who is 23, and his company, Facebook, are rarely out of the headlines. If it isn't about the huge success of the site - which, with more than 30 million users, is one of the most rapidly expanding social networking sites on the web - then it is coverage of a court case in which he is accused of stealing the idea. Earlier this week, the case, which is being heard in Massachusetts, was adjourned until August - but it is being closely watched throughout Silicon Valley and across the world. The arguments hinge around a lawsuit brought by the founders of a similar website called ConnectU, which alleges that Zuckerberg stole his concept and execution when he was in fact supposed to be working for them. In 2002 Divya Narendra and twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss asked Zuckerberg to program some parts of the nascent online service. But instead of helping them, they claim, he stole their ideas and turned them into Facebook. Zuckerberg's lawyers filed a counterclaim that it was just an attempt to hijack the site's success. There is plenty at stake - some investors in Facebook are pinning the company's value at $10bn (\u00a3489m). Despite the publicity, Zuckerberg remains relatively aloof. The laid-back college dropout - famous for his dishevelled appearance and dress code of T-shirt and sandals - is focused on his work at the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, California. His life started on the other side of the US in Westchester County, New York. He attended state schools before being sent to the exclusive Phillips Exeter Academy boarding school, fictionalised by the novelist John Irving in some of his most famous books. It was at Harvard, where he enrolled in 2002, that things really started to come together. After becoming interested in computer programming, he tried a handful of attempts to create networking software for the college population (including one that saw him reprimanded for hacking into the official student database). Then he came up with The Facebook - a website that allowed users to share information and keep in touch with friends; a virtual meeting place. In a fortnight, half of the student body had signed up, and before long there were Facebooks at colleges all over the north-eastern United States. Things galloped onwards and he quickly moved to California, inspired by another Harvard dropout, Bill Gates, and the Ivy League college's policy of allowing students to take indefinite leave. Friends and acquaintances say he remains down to earth and slightly awkward, in the fashion typical of technologists. Yet underneath the shyness, there is a confidence that has many in awe. \"I sense that he doesn't get impressed by new surroundings,\" says Jeff Jarvis, the blogger and Guardian columnist, who has met Zuckerberg several times. \"Some people think it's hubristic, but I think it's just him being himself.\" His confidence and success have brought attention from media moguls such as Rupert Murdoch, but Zuckerberg remains adamant that Facebook is a software company and not a media operation (although he does say that it is the biggest publisher of news in the world, thanks to the way it publishes the actions of all its members). This sets him apart from rivals such as Tom Anderson and Chris DeWolfe, the co-founders of Murdoch's MySpace website, who specifically set out to create a site that would be attractive to advertisers. Still, it doesn't stop old media bosses looking for advice when they meet him. There are continuing rumours about the company's future, including potential interest from Murdoch and his News Corporation empire - the businessman has even joked about Facebook overtaking his MySpace site. Indeed, Jarvis recounts one occasion when the owner of the Times and Fox News was locked in conversation with Zuckerberg over dinner - and as soon as the 23-year-old got up, his place was filled by DeWolfe, who seemed keen to regain the affections of his boss. But while the rumours about a potential buyout continue, Zuckerberg seems unlikely to be tempted - he is said to have turned down offers of $750m from Viacom and $1bn from Yahoo!. The youngster's belief in the future of his company is critical, according to Peter Thiel, a co-founder of online payments service PayPal, who was one of the venture capitalists who invested early in Facebook. \"It will remain a standalone business for a while, because the gap is enormous between what Mark and the rest of the board thinks the company is worth, and what the outside world thinks,\" he says. Sometimes, the confidence appears to stretch towards a kind of arrogance. Zuckerberg refuses to call Facebook a social networking site. Instead he says it is a \"social utility\", making the sort of hair's-breadth distinction that is prone to lead to accusations of hubris. But those who look for signs of an inflated ego fail to find much to grab hold of. Nick Denton, founder of dotcom gossip website Valleywag, calls him \"the new internet prince\". Denton delights in puncturing the Silicon Valley bubble whenever he can, but despite the attempts to draw out Zuckerberg's personality, there seems to be little scandal on the cards. Indeed, his only vice appears to be an addiction to open-toed Adidas sport sandals. Still, there are signs that, with success and influence, Zuckerberg may be starting to change. After all, he recently admitted to wearing a proper pair of shoes at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
