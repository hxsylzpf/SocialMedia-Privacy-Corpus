  "content": "I have listened again to the prime minister's radio interview yesterday morning because I was intrigued by his comments about privacy and press self-regulation. During a 21-minute interview with John Humphrys on Radio 4's Today programme, David Cameron was asked about his \"inappropriate\" dinner with Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News International. Naturally enough, that section dominated the media reports. But we shouldn't let that divert us from his comments on a privacy law. \"I think we should have a discussion and a debate about it,\" Cameron began, continuing: \"This is an issue that needs further reflection because it seems at the moment that law is effectively being made by judges in response to cases using the European convention on human rights, so I think we should discuss what is the right way forward.\" So there was no change of emphasis from his original statement on this issue, on 21 April while touring a Luton car factory, when he said: \"I need to do some more thinking about it.\" However, some related thinking had been done because his follow-up sentence was a truly new departure - a defence of press self-regulation, which was also reported by the Daily Mail. He said: \"I sense that there's still more to be done to recognise that actually the Press Complaints Commission has come on a lot in recent years, and we should be working with that organisation to make sure that people get the protection that they need.... while still having a free and vibrant press.\" He added: \"We don't want statutory regulation of the press.\" And, pushed further on the whether there was a need for a specific privacy law, he reiterated his support for the PCC. It's a long time since a prime minister went in to bat for the PCC. Indeed, it may be the only time it has ever happened. Cameron's supportive statement was clearly at odds with the negative views on the PCC in recent reports by the media, culture and sport select committee, chaired by Tory MP John Whittingdale. I must admit wondering if Cameron had been briefed by Lord (Guy) Black, Tory peer, chairman of the PCC's overseer, the Press Standards Board of Finance (PressBof) and executive director the Telegraph Media Group. Whether he was or not, PressBof and the PCC must be delighted with such a statement because the commission has been under consistent fire in recent months. Surely, it also indicates a subtle change of line by Cameron over the question of intrusions into privacy. He may say what he likes about the need for a debate, but he must know that a privacy law is out of the question. The newspapers that have clamoured for parliament to take action over the use of injunctions are the very ones most likely to oppose a privacy law. In truth, the prime minister's backing for the PCC shows that he has pulled back from the brink. Should we congratulate him or Lord Black? Sources: Today/The Guardian/Daily Mail",
