As a result, private organisations and policymakers everywhere are clambering to get-to-grips with the topic, as consumers take action (pdf). With this in mind, what can we expect from digital media and advertising in 2015? Facebook will bring the fight to Google Much is made of these two companies in the fight for brand cash, but lest we forget there is an ocean of difference between the two. Despite this chasm and increased scrutiny on Google and Facebook in the EU you won't see either cool their jets, particularly when it comes to mobile, which has a combined share of 75% of brand spend. Data management platforms (DMPs) \u2013 which collect, integrate, manage and activate data for marketers \u2013 will struggle under Google's expanding directive prohibiting third parties from firing tracking pixels within the Google Display Network (GDN). This filtering process between those who can and can't understand consumer interactions with Google advertising can be seen as a tightening of controls on data collection, but it also means the marketer's perspective of consumer activity will be further defined through Google's lens, leading to more money and power for Google. This polarisation will only exacerbate with Facebook's development of Atlas, increasing the propagation of the Facebook identity into publishing environments, enabling them to garner more behavourial data . Never one to give without receiving, Facebook's audience platform will take a small cut from everything the publishers do along with their data, while allowing them to compete in the world of cross device. This will only superficially increase options for marketers seeking device agnostic solutions. Identification will take centre stage At the heart of both Google and Facebook's strategy is their ability to link interactions throughout the consumer journey to a single user profile and ID (known as Omniview capabilities \u2013 a term we'll be hearing much more of). Their reliance on personally identifiable information (PII) to create a single consumer view becomes increasingly evident, and as advertisers and agencies open their minds to more privacy-friendly identification possibilities, the conversation around identification will take another dimension: how much do we need to know and how much are we allowed to know to promote a product? The changing data protection laws in the EU, which aim to drive consumer choice and control to the forefront, help frame the discussion: \u2022 Respect opt-outs: Consumers must be able to decide who collects their data and have the ability to withdraw from such services. The upcoming rollout of AdChoices to mobile is a significant step. The move was described to us by Nick Stringer, Internet Advertising Bureau's UK director of regulatory affairs as, \"extending the principles of transparency and control to the mobile environment, and providing a consistent consumer experience across the devices they use\". \u2022Deliver anonymity: As our personal lives and digital identities further converge, consumers are increasingly aware of being tracked. According to Ipsos MORI's Global Trends Survey, 59% of British adults are happy for brands to hold information on them as long as it's anonymised and can't be linked back. \u2022Put data owners in control: Google and Facebook are starting to ring fence the industry, but they are not the audience owner in every scenario and it is up to media owners to take control, for the sake of their future. Greater discourse will lead to greater progress When we talk about complex issues such as digital identity, there is a balance between establishing principles (particularly in relation to policy) and developing commercially viable practices. When it comes to identification, not all technologies are created equal; cookies, fingerprinting, login and email can all be used for good or bad \u2013 but it's up to us to turn the spotlight on the negative practices such as cookie syncing and the use of location data as means of identification, both representing the least considerate approaches to a consumer-first acquisition. Taking a more prominent role in digital advertising technology will be agencies, who will increasingly become the enablers and activation partners for brands. Organisations like the IAB, European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) and Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) will continue their roles in educating the market and policy makers, and their tech members will be pressed to share their understanding of what happens under the hood. Power to the people As individuals make better-informed digital choices, we will see a wealth of activity aimed at offering users more control. Greater emphasis will be placed on on-site content control, content access, product usage, and transparency in publisher-consumer exchanges. In connection with this, we anticipate more startups to create ad or call-blocking solutions that focus on access and control, linked to publishers marginalised by platforms such as Facebook and Google. In short, 2015 will bring the reformation of a more enlightened and consolidated marketplace, and most likely a more enlightened internet population. The digital technology market is growing in size and influence, and with this increased power will come a far greater responsibility to serve consumer interests.
