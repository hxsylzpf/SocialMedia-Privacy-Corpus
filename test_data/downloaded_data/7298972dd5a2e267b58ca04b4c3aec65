  "content": "\u2022 Google, which continued its social tear yesterday by buying search service Aardvark, has already started responding to critics of Buzz (specifically critics of its privacy settings) by making some changes. It should become easier not to parade your 'friends' publicly (though it's still the default setting), and the company's promised to make more changes soon. \u2022 Macworld 2010 is in full swing, but the questions are starting to fly about whether it can survive without Apple's presence. Film auteur and supergeek Kevin Smith was in attendance, and the New York Times gadget reviewer/impresario impressed, but it's still unclear whether the show can hit the high notes again. \u2022 If you haven't looked at Microsoft's Photosynth before - it's a system for stitching together pictures into a credible 3D portrait - then get ready. The company is now incorporating Photosynth into Bing Maps' street level viewer, but cleverly it pulls in geotagged pictures from Flickr to build better, updating viewpoints. This YouTube video shows that it's pretty impressive stuff.
