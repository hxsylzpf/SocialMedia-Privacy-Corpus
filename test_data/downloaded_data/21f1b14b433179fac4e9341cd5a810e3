  "content": "Who can you complain to? Access to information Stage one First, write to the body you believe holds the information. Give your name and contact details and describe the information you want. You do not have to say why you want it. A non-public body (private/business organisation) is required to reply to your request, usually within 40 days. If you have not heard from the organisation during this time, send them a reminder by recorded delivery (remember to keep a copy). If you still do not receive a reply, or if the information you receive is wrong or incomplete, contact the information commissioner's information line (01625 545745). The information commissioner keeps a register of all organisations that hold and utilise personal data - contact them to find out the details of the organisation that you want to reach. Public authorities generally have to respond to requests for information within 20 working days. They may charge a fee, which will be calculated according to fee regulations. They can extend the deadline for sending out information by up to three months, until the fee is paid. If you do not think your request has been dealt with properly, contact the public authority and try to resolve the problem directly. They may have an internal complaints procedure. Stage two If you are still not satisfied you should contact the information commissioner (formerly data protection registrar/commissioner) for an assessment of whether the public body has complied with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOI) or Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA): Information Commissioner, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 5AF (Information line: 01625 545745; Tel: 01625 545700; Fax: 01625 524510) Email: mail@dataprotection.gov.uk The commissioner has powers under both the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOI) and Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). Her role is intended to embody an integrated approach to information handling. The commissioner is directly responsible for implementing the FOI Act. She does not have to consider the case if you have not exhausted the internal complaints procedure, exhibited undue delay in making the application, or if the claim is considered 'frivolous or vexatious'. She will contact you and the public/non-public body with her decision. Stage three If you are not satisfied contact the independent information tribunal. (formerly the data protection tribunal). An appeal form will be enclosed in the information commissioner's decision letter. What grounds do you have to complain? Access to information Individuals have the right to access their own information held on computer, in some paper files and on CCTV, under the Data Protection Act 1998 (the \"subject access right\"). The FOI extends these rights to allow access to all the types of information held by public bodies, whether personal or non-personal. These bodies include: \u0095 government departments \u0095 local authorities \u0095 NHS bodies (such as hospitals, as well as doctors, dentists, pharmacists and opticians) \u0095 schools, colleges and universities \u0095 police \u0095 House of Commons and House of Lords \u0095 Northern Ireland assembly \u0095 Welsh assembly \u0095 other public bodies (non-governmental organisations or quangos) ranging from various official advisory and expert committees, to regulators and organisations such as the Post office, National Gallery and the Parole Board A full list is provided in Schedule 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. You have the right to: \u0095 be told whether the information exists \u0095 receive the information (and where possible, in the manner requested, ie as a copy or summary, or the applicant may ask to inspect a record) Information is exempt if it relates to: \u0095 investigations and proceedings conducted by public authorities \u0095 court records \u0095 trade secrets \u0095 or if it would prejudice national security, or law enforcement \u0095 if a disclosure would, or would be likely to prejudice the interests of the UK abroad or law enforcement \u0095 information may only be withheld if the public interest in withholding it is greater than the public interest in releasing it The FOI Act will be fully brought into force by November 30 2005 or sooner. Implementation will be gradual, with different groups of public authorities coming within the scope of the act in stages. The programme is likely to begin with government departments. Individuals' rights of access to information will be phased in at the same time. Data protection The commissioner can investigate any instances where a data controller has contravened the Data Protection Act 1998 (came into force on March 1 2000). Those who record and use personal information are required to be open about how the information is used and must follow the eight principles of 'good information handling. All information must be: \u0095 fairly and lawfully processed \u0095 processed for limited purposes \u0095 adequate, relevant and not excessive \u0095 accurate \u0095 not kept longer than necessary \u0095 processed in accordance with the data subject's rights \u0095 secure \u0095 not transferred to countries without adequate protection The main offences that can be brought under the DPA revolve around: \u0095 unlawful obtaining or selling of personal information \u0095 processing without notification (registering information with the commissioner) \u0095 failing to notify the commissioner of changes in your circumstances As the DPA has increased the organisation's responsibilities, they have been given extra time to meet their new remit. You may not have the right to see some of your information until October 24 2001. The commissioner will always try to deal with a matter informally. However, if the matter cannot be settled informally, she may decide to take enforcement action against the data controller in question. The controller is also able to appeal to the independent information tribunal. However, if the tribunal agrees with the commissioner's enforcement action and the data controller continues to break the principles, it may be a criminal offence. If the data controller has committed a criminal offence under the Data Protection Act, the commissioner can prosecute them. For copies of leaflets explaining data protection, telephone 0870 44 21 211. Allow 28 days for delivery. Scotland is planning to introduce its own Freedom of Information Act, with a separate commissioner to oversee its implementation. For more information about its progress contact the freedom of information unit, via the Scottish executive enquiry line (Tel: 08457 741741) or see the Scottish Executive website. Will you get a fair hearing? The information commissioner is an independent public official, appointed by the Queen and reporting directly to parliament. The Information Tribunal is an independent body of legal practitioners. The chair and deputy chairs are appointed by the Lord Chancellor. They represent the interests of both data subjects and data controllers, but are independent of both. What will happen if you're successful? Access to information The information commissioner may issue a decision or enforcement notice requiring disclosure of information in the public interest. However, this may be subject to an 'executive override'. Data Protection Upon conviction in the magistrates court the offender is liable to a maximum fine of \u00a35,000. In the crown court an unlimited fine may be imposed. You are entitled to claim compensation through the courts if damage has been caused as a result of a data controller not meeting any requirements of the Data Protection Act. If damage is proved, the court may also order compensation for any associated distress. You can only claim compensation for distress alone in very limited circumstances. The tribunal has the power to award costs in favour of either party. Anything else you can do? All offences under the Data Protection Act can be tried in a magistrates or crown court. In England and Wales proceedings can generally only be commenced by the commissioner. In Scotland cases can only be brought by the procurator fiscal. In Northern Ireland, cases can only be commenced by the commissioner or by (or with) the consent of the director of public prosecutions for Northern Ireland.
