  "content": "Simon Pegg has galvanised internet rumours surrounding his World's End collaborator Edgar Wright's upcoming Ant-Man movie by tweeting a picture of himself pointing at artwork of the character. The picture, apparently taken on a trip to Marvel's HQ and one of a string Pegg tweeted last night, has been widely seized on as Pegg hinting that he is in line to take the lead role in the film. Ant-Man is due to be Wright's next film after The World's End to be co-written with Attack the Block's Joe Cornish, and the director talked up the project at Comic Con, saying he would begin prepping the film in October. Ant-Man is part of the Marvel universe of characters, able to shrink himself down to the size of an insect, and Wright suggested the tone of the forthcoming film will be not dissimilar to that of the Iron Man series. Marvel say they are aiming at a 2015 release, after the second Avengers film. No official casting news for Ant-Man has been announced. However, Pegg moved quickly to scotch any suggestion that he was a contender, tweeting: \"FFS the Internet, all I did was point at the central character in my dear friend's next movie, because I'm excited for him\".",
