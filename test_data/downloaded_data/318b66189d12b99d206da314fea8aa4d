  "content": "A North Queensland man has been accused of exploiting his Facebook \"friends\" to groom 33 children \u2013 boys and girls \u2013 for child sex offences committed over two months. The 26-year-old man, from the Cairns suburb of Brinsmead, was charged with 122 child sex-related offences on Monday after a major operation by the Cairns child protection and investigation unit. His alleged victims, all from the Cairns area, were between 11 and 16 years old and included children he befriended on Facebook. Geoff Marsh, the regional crime coordinator for far north Queensland, told Guardian Australia that detectives had identified the victims mostly through investigating internet activity on computer devices. \"Police will allege the internet was used to solicit victims on a majority of occasions, mainly Facebook, Facebook friends, etc,\" Marsh said. \"Obviously a fair bit of effort has gone into taking statements [by police from alleged victims].\" The man is due to appear in Cairns magistrates court on 9 March.",
