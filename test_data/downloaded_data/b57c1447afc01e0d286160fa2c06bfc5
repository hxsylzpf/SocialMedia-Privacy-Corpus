  "content": "It's funny how things work out sometimes. Unlike previous TwiTrips, my Blackpool adventure was preceded with a request: I wanted history, tradition, and nostalgia. I finished the day watching transvestite flamenco. But it took a while getting there. As with Paris, San Francisco and Brighton, the TwiTrip format was thus: I would turn up at Blackpool station without having planned a thing. Once there, I would sling questions into the Twittersphere and wait for helpful suggestions. Here's how it panned out ... The TwiTrip tips My search for Blackpool's historic heart began on the train. I requested Blackpool facts to entertain me as my Pendolino whizzed its way towards Lancashire. MattTempest regaled the tale of when an RAF plane crashed into the main station during world war one; an event that was kept secret in order to maintain morale. Mrdavidwhitley assured me that Blackpool was the capital of Ireland ... as Dublin literally translates to \"black pool\". Top trivia. Upon arrival I was hungry. Maixu suggested ice cream at a cafe called Ashurst's in Bispham, while ITZZYBITSY suggested a fajita at modern eatery Toast in Blackpool town centre. But the winning tip came in from joolsholland67, who suggested I dash to a tea room. At Chesters on Church Street, where the dapper waiters and splendid coffee machine matched the faux Victorian interior, I joined a handful of straight-backed locals sipping tea and munching on topside beef sandwiches. A very good start indeed. Next up was one of Blackpool's blockbusters. SallyJLloyd and cliffc100 suggested I head to the ballroom under the iconic Tower, for a \"glimpse into Blackpool's glorious past\". When I arrived, I was genuinely stunned. I can't remember being as impressed by anything in England; the hand-painted murals on the ceiling, elaborate cornicing and sculpted balconies were equalled by the graceful expertise of the dozen or so couples waltzing across the dance floor to the sounds of the Wurlitzer organ. And as I watched, I was educated. One tweet informed me that the interior was the work of one Frank Matcham, who also designed the Grand Theatre, while another told me that the ballroom featured heavily in the 90s Japanese film Shall We Dance. I could have sat there all day. But StayBlackpool dared me up to the top of the tower, and on to the Walk of Faith - a panel of reinforced glass with 320 feet of nothingness beneath it. From the top of the Tower I could just about make out my next destination, a couple of miles south at Starr Gate. Katemate123 came up with one of the best tips of the day; getting away from the town centre and heading to the end of the tram lines, where beach and dune stretch for miles down the coast. I wandered in the sand and psyched myself up for the next leg of the TwiTrip. Redders32 and helenpower had suggested I ride the Big One - one of Europe's biggest roller coasters with highs of 235 feet and top speeds of over 70 mph. So I dragged myself from the beautiful natural surrounds of Starr Gate and into the bizarre artificial microcosm of the Pleasure Beach. Riklomas had dared me to tweet while on the ride ... and I did as I was told. Feeling very proud with myself for conquering the roller coaster without crying, I decided it was time for a drink. I requested a proper Blackpool pub, hoping to claw back some of the initial intentions of the TwiTrip; history. Duchessofgrange came up with the goods, suggesting the Pump and Truncheon, \"a locals pub, inhabited by market traders and sea front stall owners\". Inside I found wooden rafters pinning the ceiling and plump barrels scattered across the floor. And a smashing pint of Lytham Gold ale, sourced from a brewery just up the coast in the Blackpool Fylde. Spot on. And finally, into the night. My request for evening entertainment was met with enthusiastic responses. SwedishTwit, Maixu and AmyWoo86 all agreed ... I had to visit Funny Girls for a \"brilliant and unique Blackpool experience\". It was indeed utterly brilliant and utterly unique. Funny Girls, I discovered, is a nightly transvestite cabaret. (It's also, I've since discovered, a favourite among politicians during party conferences.) The evening was hosted by the glorious Zoe (a male plasterer by day) and her dutiful, equally glorious bar staff. Up on stage, an operatic rendition of Queen's Barcelona was followed by a Michael Jackson tribute that morphed into an Adams Family medley, finished off with an extravagant flamenco act. Best of all, I was adopted by a group of fellow onlookers: four 40-something ladies, who, one assumes, saw my wide eyes, decided I needed looking after, and bought me a drink. We sang along, giggled at Zoe's filthy puns, and drank pints of cider and blackcurrant. So while my TwiTrip to Blackpool might have ended in a rather unexpected venue, I had inadvertently succeeded in my initial quest. Mandy, Tina, Pam and Karen showed me the most time-honoured Blackpool tradition of them all... brilliant hospitality.",
