  "content": "Analysis of Tony Abbott's recent spike in Twitter followers showed accounts involved were definitely \"dodgy\" but the Liberal party was not necessarily behind the rise, according to an academic expert in social media. Over the weekend, Abbott's Twitter following rose markedly to a peak of 192,300, before dropping back to 167,000 on Monday. Axel Bruns, an associate professor at the Queensland University of Technology Media School, said his investigation of the @TonyAbbottMHR account found it had attracted 50-60,000 followers whose accounts had been created in the last two months. Under normal circumstances, natural followers on the social media platform are built with many different accounts, that range from very old accounts to very new accounts. Abbott's account raised alarm bells for specialists because so many accounts were created recently and had made very few tweets. \"Of course it is not necessarily Tony Abbott who bought the followers. It could have been a detractor who wanted a derogatory story on Abbott,\" Bruns said. \"[Twitter] follower numbers are inflated for different reasons but it is a bit of a penis contest,\" he added. \"It's all about who has more in order to gain clout.\" The Liberal party put out a statement confirming it was working with Twitter to investigate the rise but also boasted of the social media increase in an email to followers. \"Thanks to @Twitter for halting the SPAM attack on @TonyAbbottMHR so quickly and removing the attack accounts #StoptheBots,\" the party tweeted on Monday. Bruns said Kevin Rudd had also benefited from fake or unintentional followers under account settings dictated by Twitter in 2009, which strongly encouraged new accounts to follow at least three users. An Australian setting up an account at that time would receive potential accounts to follow and, as Rudd was prime minister at the time, his account was frequently suggested. \"At that time, you could virtually not continue to establish the account without following at least three different users,\" Bruns said. Those account rules have now changed yet those followers may not have dropped Rudd's account. Bruns said social media scores had become a vanity measure but the underlying assumption that more followers translated into more votes was arguable. \"It is all quite dodgy because these numbers, such as Klout scores, are being gamed,\" he said. A Klout score is a measure of online influence, based on social media presence. Rudd has a Klout score of 89. Abbott has a score of 78.",
