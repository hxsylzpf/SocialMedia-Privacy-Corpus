But with so much competition out there, how can you make sure you stand out from the crowd? Here are some tips to make your event memorable: Start marketing before you think you need to Research shows people generally need at least seven points of contact with an individual or company, before they decide to buy. So if your event marketing starts the day tickets go on sale, you could be missing a trick. Creating pre-launch content, which gives people a flavour of what they'll experience at the event, is a cost-effective way to engage with prospective clients. I've done this in various ways, including hosting free webinars, video lessons and online Q&amp;A sessions with speakers. My most successful pre-launch campaign was a free 30 day online course, which I ran ahead of a PR conference. While I had to invest a few hundred pounds, and a couple of days of my time in creating video lessons and resources, it was well worth it. I sold 50% of the tickets in the first few weeks of the booking period \u2013 a big improvement on the previous year. Create scarcity However much people like the idea of your event, most will leave it until the last possible moment to book their ticket. This can be stressful, particularly if you have to pay venue and catering costs upfront. Reducing the amount of time that tickets are on sale \u2013 or the number available at a particular price \u2013 creates a feeling of scarcity. This can give people the push they need to commit. In the run up to a recent event, I offered an early bird rate for a fortnight and raised the price by \u00a350 every 14 days. I sold most of the tickets in the first few weeks. Connect with attendees before the event Walking into a roomful of people you don't know can be daunting, even for the most outgoing person. Yet many event organisers do nothing to connect with people before their event. In the run up to a recent conference, I asked all delegates for their Twitter handle. As well as tweeting a personal thanks for booking and a \"looking forward to seeing you\" the day before the event, I hosted a live Twitter Q&amp;A featuring some of the speakers. Not only did this create a bit of buzz around the conference, it also helped shift the last few tickets. On the day of the event, most people had already met me online \u2013 along with several other delegates \u2013 which made for a much less awkward start. Even if you're not a social media buff, there are plenty of ways you can connect with delegates ahead of an event, including email, telephone or good old snail mail. I recently received a handwritten card from the organiser of an event I attended in the US, thanking me for enrolling. That personal touch that made her really memorable. Add a personal touch If you want to get people talking about your events, you need to do things that make you stand out. In the run up to a recent workshop, I emailed every delegate to ask what their favourite chocolate bar was. When they arrived at the venue, there was a surprise waiting next to their name badge. While we (well, mainly my assistant Lisa), went to a lot of trouble to get the treats (not everyone wanted chocolate \u2013 in fact one person asked for an apple), it was well worth the effort. Not only did it get people talking to each other straight away, many also shared pictures of their chocolate bar on social media, which was great publicity for the event. At my last event, we ran a photo booth, where people could dress up in silly hats, crazy glasses and wigs, in exchange for a charity donation. As well as encouraging people to have a bit of a fun, it provided some fabulous photos of the event (taken by a professional photographer \u2013 something I think is well worth investing in), which were shared on social media. It also made a change from the standard corporate pictures you get from most conference events. Don't forget to follow up After a big event \u2013 particularly one that's taken months to organise \u2013 all I want to do is kick off my shoes, order pizza and sleep for a few days. But I've learned from experience not to take my foot off the pedal too soon. The day after an event \u2013 when delegates are feeling pumped up and inspired \u2013 is the ideal time to engage with people or even upsell them to other products or services. I've recently started selling recordings of my events \u2013 both to people who didn't attend, and those who did, but want to share what they learned with colleagues. Most sales happen in the first few days after the event. It's also a good time to get feedback from your delegates. In fact, you probably shouldn't leave it that long; I've recently dropped lengthy email questionnaires in favour of postcard sized feedback cards, which invite delegates to rate their experience (based on a series of smilies) and write a 140 character summary of the event. Getting people to fill them out before they leave not only saves time, it provides instant testimonials that can be photographed and shared on social media.
