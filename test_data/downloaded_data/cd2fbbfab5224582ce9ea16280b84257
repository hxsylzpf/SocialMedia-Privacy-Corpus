  "content": "The release of the video for One Direction's Best Song Ever generated sharp growth for their official YouTube channel, with its monthly views jumping 47% to 133.8m in July. But the British boy band still weren't as popular as a 23 year-old Swede \"sharing gaming moments on YouTube with my bros\" or a \"Butter God\" sharing his Minecraft habit with millions of fans. Those channels \u2013 PewDiePie and SkyDoesMinecraft \u2013 generated 221.6m and 146.3m YouTube views respectively in July, leaving One Direction in third place in industry site Tubefilter's latest monthly chart. Both are part of multi-channel networks (MCNs) on YouTube, with PewDiePie signed to Maker Studios and SkyDoesMinecraft to Machinima. Their popularity is well known to gamers, but has been more under-the-radar for the entertainment industries whose biggest channels are being left in their wake. PewDiePie added 1.6m subscribers in July, according to Tubefilter, taking him to nearly 11.8m by the end of the month. The channel has generated 2.2bn all-time views and is still growing: views were up 6% in July. Meanwhile, SkyDoesMinecraft added more than 761k new subscribers during the month, taking its total to just under 5.1m. Its all-time views count is now nudging 1.1bn, with monthly views up 8% in July. While One Direction had a good month, adding 682k subscribers to take their total to just under 8m, the chart will make for less-comforting reading for another YouTube-fuelled star, Psy. His channel's views fell 29% in July, although his 115.7m views still put him in fourth place in Tubefilter's rankings. The Top 100 is a good snapshot of YouTube as a place where established pop stars rub shoulders with a new breed of online-video personalities: for every Rihanna (87.8m views), Miley Cyrus (80.6m) or Justin Bieber (68.2m) there's a Fine Brothers (87.3m), Smosh (84.8m) or TobyGames (70.6m). Multi-channel networks like Machinima, Maker Studios, Fullscreen and Alloy Digital are continuing to sign and develop emerging YouTubers, but YouTube itself has also been increasingly keen to package and promote them, for example with its recent Comedy Week and Geek Week events. Some industry figures see potential for tension here. US entrepreneur Jason Calacanis suggested last week that YouTube represents a threat to the businesses of the multi-channel networks. \"If you work for, or have invested in, Maker, Machinima or another MCN (multichannel network) you should understand that YouTube is taking your business out from under you RIGHT NOW!\" wrote Calacanis on his Launch blog. \"MCNs are toast. They're done. YouTube is killing them.\" The bigger threat may be to traditional TV viewing, particularly among the younger viewers flocking to the channels of PewDiePie and One Direction alike. Google has described these viewers as \"Generation C\", and claimed they are twice as likely to be a YouTube viewer than the general population in the UK, and 40% more likely to be only a \"light\" TV viewer. However, many television industry executives hope that YouTube remains complementary rather than cannibalistic to traditional TV: a view put most recently by the managing director of Thinkbox, the marketing body for commercial TV in the UK. \"To set it up as a 'battle' between TV and YouTube is wrong in the first place. Not because linear TV is so much bigger, but because TV enjoys an enormously complementary relationship with YouTube,\" wrote Lindsey Clay on the company's blog. However, her claim that \"YouTube is also TV's audition room: be talented, go viral, get into the news and you might make it into the professional world of TV and the greater legitimacy, fame and opportunity that secures\" deserves to provoke more debate. The end goal for a growing number of YouTubers may not be TV stardom, but PewDiePie-style popularity on YouTube itself, or at least a sustainable career funded partly by MCNs' sponsorship and advertising deals with the kind of brands commercial TV is keen to hang onto. The idea of a healthy flow of talent between YouTube and TV may be correct, but the power balance may be slightly different to Thinkbox's vision: in the future, TV may need the pulling power of popular YouTubers as much as those young stars want or need TV deals.",
