  "content": "A new social network launched on Thursday claims to connect people through their opinions on millions of topics. State invites users to express short opinions on anything from Justin Bieber and Syria to the new Samsung Galaxy S4 or WhatsApp, tagged with simple three-word subject labels drawn from a database of almost 11,000 descriptors. Posts can be as long or short as the user desires. \"This is low-friction opinion sharing,\" said said co-founder Alex Asseily, an entrepreneur who also founded the wearable technology firm Jawbone. \"We wanted everyone to be able to voice an opinion and have it heard without needing to have an amazing amount of followers or to be a celebrity, because everybody has opinion to share.\" Opinions are not black or white The system, he said, allows for diversity and nuance in those opinions. State's impressive background \"word web\" technology can understand, interpret and link up related terms to connect with other similar opinions. Once an opinion has been given to network, it becomes a search term as well as a statement. State can then map out related topics users might be interested in, content that has been shared through the network of opinions, as well as like-minded people and interesting connections. 'Some people who thought Snowden was a villain, also thought Prism was bad' \"For instance, we found opinions around Edward Snowden and the Prism programme to be very much shades of grey. In general terms, some people who thought Snowden was a villain, also thought Prism was bad and likewise, some thought Snowden was a hero but that Prism was a good thing,\" explained Asseily. \"Of course, some had more standard reactions, thinking Snowden was bad and Prism good, or Snowden was good and Prism bad, but it just demonstrates how complex and interesting opinions can be.\" Users can quickly share opinions on the go, both on the web and via an iPhone app with Android coming soon \u2013 a state and get out approach \u2013 but the network can also become a compelling network where one opinion leads to another, to an interesting topic or piece of content, to new friends and new world views. The product is not the person State differs in one important way from most other social networks too, because the product is not the person but the opinion users are not being sold to advertisers to support the service, unlike Twitter or Facebook or the plethora of other social networks. Anonymised, aggregated opinions are what State plans to use to fund its service in the distant future, but for now it is happy to take the route of many modern technology startups and just expand its user base in numbers and geography. \"The crazy, ambitious, technical hurdles to overcome are large, but we believe in our manifesto: 'every opinion deserves its time in the Sun',\" said Mark Asseily, co-founder of State. \"We've spent lots of time musing over our policies and privacy as it is not just a little sidenote; it drives who we are and the decisions we make.\" \u2022 Facebook, from a dorm room to 1.23 billion users in 10 years",
