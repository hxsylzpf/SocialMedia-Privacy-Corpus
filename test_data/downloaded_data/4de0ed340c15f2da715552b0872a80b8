I'm standing in a bar in downtown Palo Alto, with a beer in one hand and my other hand on the shoulder of a man so large that he could probably kill me with a single swipe. Josh, who \u2013 let me be as clear as I can be \u2013 I blame for this, has his hand on the giant's other shoulder. Our hope is that we can restrain him long enough to allow the escape of the tiny girl he's bearing down over and threatening to beat up. Her crime, apparently, was to drunkenly spill her drink on him. His response is, to say the least, disproportionate \u2013 in the way that it would be disproportionate to respond to a child kicking the back of your seat on a plane by stabbing it in the face with your plastic knife. \"Come on, man, it's over,\" says Josh, calmly, like they teach you in those \"how to break up a fight\" articles in Esquire. \"Seriously \u2013 fighting a girl? What the fuck is wrong with this crazy fat prick?\" I ask, like they don't. Seriously, where are all the bouncers? That's probably Josh's fault as well. This was supposed to be my week off. A week, between the disappointing memory of South By South West and the impending British booziness of Webmission 09, when I'd stay away from drinking and parties and cirrhosis of the liver and instead made some headway on the book my publisher thinks I'm writing. This was supposed to be one of those 'indoor' columns where rather than going out and do something, I simply trawl through Techmeme for an amusing story and pontificate on it, pegging it to being trapped in a hotel room or winding down for New Year. I thought perhaps I might write about Google Street View \u2013 maybe offering a few words of advice to the British privacy activists who are calling for it to be shut down. Assuming, of course, I could find a way to stretch \"shut up you whiny paranoid bitches\" over 1,000 words. And then Josh, who was visiting San Francisco for a couple of days from London, went and spoilt it all by saying something stupid like \"I've hired a HumVee for $50, let's go to a party in Palo Alto.\" Actually, to be fair to Josh, it was less the promise of the HumVee and the free beer that convinced me to go, and more the possibility of filling a huge gap in my knowledge of the internet industry. The party was organised by a company that develops games for MySpace and Facebook users and the guest list comprised app developers of all stripes, including people who build applications for the iPhone. As a BlackBerry user (carrying it makes people think I have a job), the world of iPhone apps has long been a fascinating mystery to me \u2013 a sector I know nothing about but which, I had a hunch, might offer an answer to the question of how to successfully sell content online. Consider the numbers: as of last week, according to Apple, over 800m applications have been downloaded from the official App Store. A majority of those were free downloads but a still huge number were paid for. Of the price of each app \u2013 usually a dollar or two \u2013 70% goes to the developer and the other 30% goes to Apple. It's that 70% that really interests me. Take, for example, Tap Tap Revenge \u2013 the iPhone's answer to Guitar Hero. Tapulous, the game's maker, claims it has been downloaded over 5,000,000 times. Of those, 100,000 people have opted to buy one of the premium versions, like the Weezer-branded edition which, for just under $5, comes complete with a number of previously-unreleased tracks from the band. Thanks in large part to sales of Tap Tap Revenge, Tapulous broke even last December, despite only having made its first sale in September. When you consider the huge sums they have to pay the record labels in licencing fees, that's an amazing achievement \u2013 especially compared to the state of almost every other sector of the paid consumer content business, outside pornography. With ad revenues in the toilet, the Seattle Post Intelligencer has just closed its print operation and gone \"online only\" \u2013 now such a common euphemism for \"died\" that my gravestone will probably read \"Here lies Paul Carr \u2013 now available online only\". Across the country, Long Island-based Newsday is preparing to replace its free site with a fully paid offering despite the near-impossibility that they'll convince readers to pay for something that was once free. In fact, with the notable exceptions of the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times (both of which are more like trade publications than mainstream newspapers), readers have shown themselves resolutely unwilling to plunk down their credit card details for news. The music sites are starting to get twitchy too. This week Last.fm annouced that, from the end of March, it will be charging users outside the UK, US and Germany \u20ac3 a month to listen to music. Stockholm-based Spotify (which can't be accessed outside Europe at any price) already charges for its ad-free service \u2013 which, given how few real ads they seem to have sold (\"Hi, I'm Roberta from Spotify...\"), is where their only hope of profitability in the downturn lies. Even at the niche end of the content spectrum, times are changing. Loren Feldman's 1938media which specialises in daily video shows featuring puppet versions of web 2.0 stars recently went from free to 'freemium' \u2013 still offering a few free taster videos but charging fans $7 a month or $50 a year to see the rest. The question everyone is asking is not whether to charge, or which paid model is best (as any heroin dealer will tell you, freemium is the way forward) but rather what content people will actually pay for. Some publishers insist that consumers will pay for quality, which is perhaps the most idiotic thing I've ever heard. If that were true then, when Sirius satellite radio launched in the US, instead of poaching Howard Stern to lure over paid listeners, they'd have hired Charlie Rose to read out Proust. Meanwhile, the idea that people will pay for quality news or investigative journalism is simply the stuff of journalism professors' wank fantasies. Which brings me to the hunch I wanted to discuss with the developers at the party: that, when it comes to what content sells online, it's Tap Tap Revenge and iPhone apps in general that tick every box. Box one: Tap Tap Revenge offers an experience you can't replace anywhere else for free. The same, weirdly, is true with Loren's puppet shows \u2013 even if someone else mimicked his style and his use of puppets, they still wouldn't be Loren. Services like Last.fm fall into a sort of murky middle ground \u2013 the tracks they play are easy to find elsewhere for free but their way of recommending them based on your listening habits will be enough for many users to quite happily pay. The experience of learning the day's news, on the other hand, can be replicated almost anywhere without paying a penny, so why bother reaching for your credit card? Box two: Tap Tap Revenge is distributed by Apple, for use on an Apple device. This creates a purchase path that takes seconds, not minutes. A lot of content producers obsess about price; how much should you charge for an article, or a song or a video? These people are idiots. In the real world, people pay the wrong amount for things all the time \u2013 \u00a31.20 for a newspaper just to read a single article, \u00a34 for a McDonald's when they're not even hungry, \u00a310 for a drink in an expensive bar. And yet many of those same people would balk at paying a single penny to read an entire newspaper online. Why? Because the real cost of an online content purchase is price + hassle, where hassle is represented by the effort it takes to dig out your credit card, fill out a lengthy form and figure out how to access your purchase. This same ease of purchase is why Amazon's Kindle will succeed too. Box three: Tap Tap Revenge customers actually own their purchases. We humans have been conditioned that when we pay for certain things, we get to keep them and take them anywhere. Newspapers, books, CDs, DVDs and games are just a few are just a few of the things that fall into that category. And yet, online subscriptions to newspapers, or access to streaming music demands that we change that behaviour. There's something that feels inherently more valuable about something we download than something stuck in the cloud \u2013 not least because we don't have to find a Wi-Fi hotspot every time we want to enjoy it. Apple and Amazon understand this, and so do people like Ze Frank whose video shows are available to watch free online, but are also sold in downloadable bundles of 50 (for $5) through the iStore to fans who want to own them on their iPhones or video iPods. My hunch \u2013 in a nut \u2013 is that producers of desirable content who can tick at least two of those three boxes will succeed in selling it, and those who can't will fail. But, knowing nothing about the apps business, it was just a hunch \u2013 which is why, when I spotted Zach Allia from Tapulous standing by the bar at the party, I headed over to pick his brains. I would have made it too, had Josh not noticed \u2013 at that exact moment \u2013 a commotion erupting between a fat bully and a terrified girl at the other side of the room. By the time we'd split up the fight, found a bouncer to throw out the fat man, calmed the crying girl and necked maybe half a dozen sambucas from the free bar to celebrate our gallantry, Zach was nowhere to be seen. Disappointed, I stuffed a couple of bottles of free beer into my coat pockets for the ride home \u2013 safe in the knowledge that if the bouncers couldn't spot a fight, they certainly wouldn't notice me breaching the licensing laws \u2013 and went in search of our designated driver. My hunch would remain a hunch and my knowledge gap a gap. But hell, it was my week off and at least I'd got to ride in a HumVee, get drunk and wade into a fight. If anyone accused me of simply pontificating about something I'd read online this week, I could distract them with the story of how I helped rescue a damsel in distress in Palo Alto. And, failing that, there was always plan B. I could just blame Josh. \u2022 Paul Carr is author of Bringing Nothing To The Party: True Confessions of a New Media Whore. He blogs at paulcarr.com",
