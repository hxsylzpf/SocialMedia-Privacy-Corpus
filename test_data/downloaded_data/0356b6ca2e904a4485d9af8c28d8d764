We're just normal people from Kent who want to help our fellow human beings with their basic needs,\" says Jasmine O'Hara, a member of the Worldwide Tribe in Calais, a grassroots social activist group set up in response to the migration crisis. The ethos behind the group, she says, is \"We are all the same. The world is our home and we believe it is imperative to have a global mindset and conscience.\" Its Facebook page, where the Worldwide Tribe's work is documented, has more than 21,000 likes. And the team of seven people, aged between 18 and 39, has raised more than \u00a350,000 in a week. The group formed on 2 August when the friends, from Tunbridge Wells, decided to make a documentary to counteract the negative portrayal of the refugees in the media. With the aim of illustrating the human stories in Calais's camp, the Worldwide Tribe started a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter to fund the filming. Four days later it had raised the \u00a318,000 needed. Overwhelmed by the response, the group decided to set up a JustGiving page to help with the relief effort. Their total already exceeds \u00a341,000. They are not alone. Across the UK, groups and individuals are raising funds or gathering supplies to take over the French border. JustGiving pages for Calais are proliferating \u2013 so far JustGiving has recorded more than 2,500 donations from 32 countries for Calais fundraising efforts. One of fundraising pages was launched by a couple from Glasgow, Diane and Bob Fotheringham. They've raised more than \u00a33,000 so far, six times their original target of \u00a3500, and are currently distributing supplies at the camp. The increased interest in Calais among UK social activists is also reflected in the Facebook pages of political groups such as Calais Migrant Solidarity. Commenters are keen to participate in any way possible, including offering transport to drop off clothes, toiletries, and tents at the camp. In addition to fundraising, the Worldwide Tribe has been collecting items to take to Calais, including bedding, clothing, sewing kits and shoes. The group has been seeking advice from French charities on how best to help and is considering collaborating with other groups to boost future fundraising efforts. One charity supporting the efforts of grassroots activists is Doctors of the World. Its UK executive director, Leigh Daynes, says: \"We understand that to make a real difference in these situations you must collaborate with these grassroots efforts. By reaching out and speaking to like-minded people and groups, voices can be made louder and more people helped. \"We are constantly in need of tents and sleeping bags as well as medical supplies such as bandages and dressings. We also always need supplies for hygiene kits, such as soap, shampoo, razors, toothbrushes, toothpaste and sanitary towels.\" While recent attempts by people to climb fences and travel through the Channel tunnel have made headlines in the UK, for many of those delivering aid in Calais this \"crisis\" is nothing new. However it is unique. Sandrine Verdelhan of French charity Secours Catholique - Caritas France says the organisation has worked in Calais for more than 15 years. She says: \"It's our first humanitarian action on French metropolitan territory. So it's quite unusual,\" she says. \"But the situation, the pitiful living conditions for migrants and the growth of migrants' numbers ... obliges NGOs, like us, to put in place an emergency system.\" Verdelhan also said that as well as co-ordinating volunteers and delivering food, the charity is providing some dignity in death. \"At least 10 people have died since beginning of July ... We help to organise their funerals,\" says Verdelhan. Grassroots groups are also lobbying for the government to help their efforts. Phillip Andrews, a volunteer nurse working in Calais for Doctors of the World, has set up a Change.org petition calling on the UK government to provide medical support. It's now approaching 60,000 signatures. Sylvie Dufosse from the French social action group Calais, Ouveture et Humanit\u00e9, has said that without government support, the current level of humanitarian relief is unsustainable. On the French website Street Press she writes: \"It's time for the state to take responsibility and help the refugees.\"",
