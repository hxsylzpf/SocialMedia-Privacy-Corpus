  "content": "3.45pm update: Since the publication of this blogpost, the report's authors have responded to a request for clarification, pointing out that the case study below is, in fact, hypothetical. _________________________________________________________ A quarter of all the largest public sector database projects are fundamentally flawed and clearly breach European data protection and rights laws, a new report finds today, offering astonishing insights into the kind of information being held and the possible implications for the people involved. Database State, claimed to be most comprehensive analysis of Britain's information hoarding, was commissioned in the wake of HM Revenue &amp; Customs losing two disks containing the entire child benefit database in October 2007. David Shutt, the chair of the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, writes in the foreword: \"The millions of people affected by this data loss, who may have thought they had nothing to hide, were shown that they do have much to fear from the failures of the database state.\" Eleven of 46 databases surveyed should be scrapped or significantly redesigned, the authors find. They also call for sensitive data to be kept on local rather than national systems, and for personal information to be shared only with the subject's consent in most situations. There's a hypothetical case study of a Nottingham teenager, which illustrates how police and employers can come to judge individuals according to what is recorded about their contact with various public services: \"Stephen is fourteen and lives with his mum in Nottingham. He is listed on all the big databases that every youngster is on nowadays: ContactPoint gives links to all the public services he has used; the NHS Care Record Service has his medical records; the National Pupil Database has his school attendance, disciplinary history and test results; he is on the Child Benefits Database, and also on the National Identity Register since he applied for a passport; the Government Gateway has a record of all his online interactions with public services; and the ITSO smartcard he uses for local bus services and discount rail fares has been tracking him ever since his mum refilled it with her bank card. His mother frets about all this \u2013 when she was a teenager in the 1980s, things like medical and school records were all kept on paper. And although the family has always kept its phone number ex-directory and always ticks the 'no information' box, they get ever more junk mail. More and more of it is for Stephen. \"Like millions of children, he is on a few more databases besides. After an operation to remove a bone tumour, he needed an orthopaedic brace for two years, which brought him into the social care system. As his teachers could see from ContactPoint that he was known to social workers, they expected less of him, and he started doing less well at school. The social care system also led to his being scanned for Onset, a Home Office system that tries to predict which children will become offenders. The Police National Database told Onset that Stephen's father \u2013 who left home when he was two and whom he does not remember \u2013 had spent six months in prison for fraud, so the computer decided that Stephen was likely to offend. \"When he was with some other youths who got in a fight, the police treated him as a suspect rather than a witness, and he got cautioned for affray. Ten years later, after he thought he had put all this behind him and completed an MSc in vehicle testing technology, Stephen finds that the government's new Extended Background Screening (EBS) programme picked up his youthful indiscretion and he cannot get the job he had hoped for at the Department of Transport. He tries to get jobs in the private sector, but the companies almost all find excuses to demand EBS checks. Two did not, but one of them picked up the fact that he had been treated for cancer; all cancer data is passed to cancer registries whether the patient likes it or not, and made available to all sorts of people and firms for research. Given the decline in the NHS since computerisation, most decent employers offer generous private health insurance \u2013 so they are not too keen to hire people who have had serious illnesses.\"",
