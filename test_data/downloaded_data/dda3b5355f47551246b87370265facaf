He has more than 20 years' experience in marketing, digital and business development, having worked for global organisations as well as smaller agencies and startups. He joined Philips in 2012. In advance of his appearance at Changing Media Summit 2015, for which he'll take part in a panel debate on the collision between digital media, privacy and consumer trust, we caught up with Blake to discuss the role of digital in marketing, over-reliance on data, and Philips' international rebrand. You've got experience in a variety of companies at different levels. What does your background bring to your current role, and what was the attraction of moving to Philips in 2012? I worked in a variety of businesses, software companies, and ran a digital agency. I was a start-up guy for a while. I think it's unusual in this space to find someone with the experience of agency life. At this level it's not about understanding how Twitter works. It's getting a huge organisation to understand the value of Twitter. I think that's actually an advantage. You have to constantly be resourceful and to drive an agile culture in a typically non-agile larger corporation. A start-up background helps, but so does the ability to know how to navigate a global organisation. In terms of the attraction of a new role, Philips is a global brand. It's the 42nd most important brand in the Interbrand listings, and it ranks up there with Google and Apple. It's a really powerful brand. We're trying to drive a transformation, and I couldn't resist the opportunity to move to Amsterdam and help to lead the digital side of the transformation here. What did you feel about the existing marketing strategy? There were many, many digital strategies.They just didn't connect into one unified plan, with all our groups and markets involved. The biggest thing that's been accomplished since I arrived is that the plan, the programme and the different teams have all been brought into a one team, one plan, one digital transformation outlook. The biggest change is going from a scattered strategy to a more ambitious, focused approach. What role has digital played in the marketing strategy of Philips? And what role will it play in the international rebrand? Digital means a lot of things to a lot of people. We look at it in three buckets: product, service and innovation; marketing and customer experience; and supply chain. I'm concerned with the middle pillar. Digital is very horizontal, and my colleagues and I work right next to each other in utilising digital across the company. For 123 years, Philips has been known for making things. As the world increasingly connects and digitises, we're focusing more on local innovation. We bring a lot of digital innovation through marketing, combining brand stories and personal stories. The rebrand has been to assert that the brand is relevant locally. Digital is a huge role in helping the campaign come to life and reinforcing the brand and personal stories. For a global brand like Philips, how do you go about creating a \"catch-all\" marketing campaign? It's a global brand with a global tagline \"Innovation and you\", but the content that brings that campaign to life in any area is highly localised, depending on the products, services and solutions for that market. We have a global theme for delivering a product, but the way a campaign is brought to life will be different in India compared to Africa. Each brings the tagline to life for it's own market. How are new technologies changing the role of marketers, and how is Philips adapting to this? The big shift has been companies creating digital marketeers. The marketeer needs to be digital. It's part of the DNA. With male grooming products, for example, in a highly digital ecosystem like the UK the whole customer journey could be 80%-90% digital. Another purchase for a different product might be far less digital, so we're trying to embed these necessary digital skills into all our marketeers. How do you utilise statistics? Is an over-reliance on data and analytics damaging creativity in marketing? To be able to look at a bunch of numbers and tell a story from it is actually quite a science. I think it's a relatively new skill set. The creativity now comes through the representation of the data and analytics, through data visualisations especially. Visualisation can take analytics and data to the next level, and involves some very creative people. I think that the world is shifting towards \"trust capital\" in that people freely give up data in exchange for a benefit, for example a social platform. But the maturity and knowledge level of the consumer is increasing regarding the trade-off of what data they're exchanging. There is such a pursuit for analysis in order to understand consumers. Chasing data for the sake of data. You can get lost in it. How can brands navigate this value exchange? There's a ongoing area where we'll continue to see businesses having to differentiate. I think we'll get to the place where there is a higher exchange value between sharing personal data and what is received. The biggest piece there is \"Do I trust you with my data?\" We're very open on that value exchange. If you have the right value exchange, and you guard the data, you can continue to navigate the new space successfully. How big an opportunity is the internet of things for brands? What are the challenges? It's important for all businesses to focus on guarding the data. As the connected products and services become more complex more types of data could be exchanged, which will require more work. We're getting very much into the health sector, and lots of our connected devices will have applications for health. It's an interesting area for Philips, and we may have an announcement to make around the Changing Media Summit. What trends are going to dominate the media landscape over the next year? There will be a rise in new platforms and services that need to be adapted to. Part of this is keeping up with the modern, hyper-active customer. A lot of brands aren't using social platforms, they need to be more aware of where the consumers are. Bi-directional shift will become quite prominent \u2013 a completely online company creating an offline product, and offline companies moving online. It's all becoming omni-channel. Brands want to be everywhere, because the customer is everywhere. Blake Cahill will be speaking at the Changing Media Summit 2015. See the rest of the line-up here.
