  "content": "A Republican congressman has caused controversy after sharing details of a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan on social networking website Twitter. Pete Hoekstra, the top-ranking Republican on the House intelligence committee, sent a string of messages from his BlackBerry announcing that he was on the way to Andrews air force base in Maryland and giving brief updates of his visit to Baghdad. The move has angered Democrats who say that he endangered the safety of the six-member cross-party delegation, which was travelling to Iraq and Afghanistan to examine progress made by US troops, as well as their minders. It has also led to an announcement from the Pentagon saying that it would be reviewing communications made by members of Congress while in war zones. \"Generally speaking, we encourage the members to hold off any communication until they are wheels down at Andrews,\" Courtney Littig, spokeswoman for Democrats on the intelligence committee, told the New York Times. The text message updates revealed little detail of the trip beyond the barest bones, and impressions that Hoekstra formed on his trip \u2013 which he said was his 11th visit to Iraq. \"Just landed in Baghdad,\" he wrote last Thursday. \"I believe it may be first time I've had bb [BlackBerry] service in Iraq.\" \"Moved into green zone by helicopter Iraqi flag now over palace. Headed to new US embassy Appears calmer less chaotic than previous here,\" he added a couple of hours later. Hoekstra, a Dutch-American conservative who has represented Michigan's second Congressional district since 1993, responded to the criticism by pointing out a number of senior Democrats have given out substantial details of their own trips over recent years. \"There is no such formal rule or policy,\" he said in a statement. \"In fact, senior Democrats have followed a different policy. President Obama, Speaker Pelosi, Secretary Clinton and even Chairman Reyes are among the many Democrats who have announced their travel to Iraq or other sensitive destinations before arrival or while in country.\" Twitter, a social networking site with around 6m users, has grown massively after heavy media attention and take-up by high-profile users like Britney Spears and Lance Armstrong. In the UK it has been heavily promoted by British comedians including Stephen Fry, John Cleese and Jonathan Ross. Hoekstra said that using Twitter allows his constituents to get real-time updates on his activities, adding that he would never deliberately endanger anybody's security. However, despite his hectic schedule in the Middle East he did find time during his trip to respond to critics - by suggesting they should \"lighten up\". \"Love twitter critics,\" he wrote. \"Spelling mistakes. Sorry but riding in poor light, bouncing around, speed not accuracy. Lighten up. Its called twitter.\" \u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday February 12 2009. The subject of the article is Pete, not Mike Hoekstra as we had it. This has been corrected.",
