  "content": "When Diana comes to my hostel's door, she is wearing a name badge: \"Diana, Servas Suriname.\" I wouldn't have thought this was entirely necessary, given that there's only the two of us heading out for a drink, however it seems my travel-networking experiment has taken a more formal turn. I'm now in Paramaribo, the capital of Suriname, next to Guyana on the northern shores of South America, and stylishly dressed Diana is here in her official capacity: president of the local chapter of Servas, the world's oldest travel networking site. The internet may have driven the new wave of travel networking, but the original global hospitality project started back in 1949. With members in over 100 countries and a motto of promoting \"peace through understanding\", Servas (joomla.servas.org) was founded by an American pacifist, Bob Luitweiler, who died last month, aged 90. Most intriguingly, unlike the new websites, where anyone can sign up and log on, potential Servas members can only join after having a face-to-face interview. The Suriname chapter has been running since the 1990s and has 20 members - all female, ranging in age from 48 to 84. It's a far older demographic than any network I have encountered so far and Diana has promised to enlighten me on its quirks over an evening at Paramaribo's Torarica hotel, famed for its casino and glitzy decor. The rest of Paramaribo isn't quite so flash, but it certainly doesn't lack charm. There's a public park made from a forest of palm trees and a historic centre where Unesco-listed buildings with wooden verandas look like they came straight from the set of cowboy movie. As a former colony of the Netherlands, Dutch is the national language, but English is widely understood. At the hotel poolside, Diana orders some coconut water, served with a straw stuck into the open husk and, before long, we are joined by another local Servas member, Henna. I tell them I'm intrigued by the interview process: is this more for verifying security or attitudes? \"It's a bit of both,\" explains Diana, 48, \"but it certainly makes Servas much safer. Some branches ask for written references as well.\" \"Suriname's different though,\" adds Henna, 52. \"We don't usually need to interview here. Everyone already knows everyone else's background.\" Servas members pay an annual fee (typically $US25), and, instead of browsing online profiles, they find hosts by getting in touch with one of the national secretaries, who provides them with a list. Members are only asked to host others for two nights, and, after that, are entitled to ask for payment. Alternatively, they can just offer to be a day host and show someone around town. Henna was one of the Suriname branch's founders. She is also a member of hospitalityclub.org and owner of an eco-travel company (morindatours.net). Sometimes she lets Hospitality Club members join her tours for free. \"They are usually young people with little income, and so I help them,\" she shrugs. The next day, Henna offers to take me to the eco-resort she's building. Just over an hour from Paramaribo, and surprisingly close to the airport, we find her \"paradise\". We park the 4x4 and walk down a dirt path, canopied by palms, fringed by vibrant red heliconias and echoing to the sound of cicadas. Then comes a clearing, where a small cluster of thatched huts sit next to a perfectly still lake. She takes me on a boat trip along the river, its surface like dark-green glass, reflecting the reeds, mangroves and purple orchids. Our only disturbance is an occasional splash, which Henna tells me could be a black river dolphin, although I never actually see the proof. \"Do you like the trip?\" she asks. Chuckling with proud delight, she already knows my answer. I can't stay with Henna that night as she already has a house guest, but she goes out of her way to find an alternative. She suggests a property down the road that she manages for friends, and so, for one night only, I have my own bungalow in the Surinamese suburbs. I head downtown the following morning and Diana takes me to visit Servas Suriname's two oldest members. First, we head to the home of 84-year-old Polly, who started travelling when her children studied in Holland and hasn't stopped since, taking in Israel, Spain, Germany and much of the Caribbean. She joined Servas eight years ago, around the same time as the death of her husband. Was that the reason she signed up? \"Oh no, I've always been a member of lots of things. I'm still with the Girl Scouts. I just like to help people,\" she says passing me some orgeade, a cold drink made from crushed almonds. Next, we pay a visit to 81-year-old Rudia, also defying her age, with short cropped jet-black hair, held in place with a sparkly alice band. Her house, brimming with souvenirs of her travels, has played host to so many people - Servas members and otherwise - it now has its own guest book. Rudia also uses Servas when she travels abroad. \"It was great in San Francisco,\" she says. \"I used to live there and yet the Servas couple I met still managed to take me to places I'd never seen before.\" When it comes to reciprocating, Servas members certainly have a lot to show off in their homeland, the so-called \"beating heart of the Amazon\". But, as I prepare to head onwards to French Guiana, I wonder what future the organisation has. Will it focus on targeting the ever-growing market for over 50s travel? Or will it try and compete with the younger upstarts? It looks like Polly, my new Surinamese grandmother, has her heart set on the latter. \"We need more young people,\" she says, squeezing my arm. \"Don't forget to tell your friends about us.\" vicky.baker@theguardian.com Henna's tips \u00b7 Take a boat trip from Paramaribo waterfront to where the Suriname and the Commewijne rivers converge. You can spot dolphins on the way, and Fort Nieuw Amsterdam has incredible panoramic views. You can arrange a trip either through a tour operator or by dealing directly with the boat owner whowill take you for US$50 or less. \u00b7 The Wia Wia Nature Reserve is part of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (whsrn.org). Located in western Suriname, its mud flats and coastal plains are home to 122 species of birds, 72 year-round residents and 50 migrants from either North America or other parts of South America. Food for thought Every Sunday since the mid-70s, American-born Jim Haynes has opened his Paris apartment for any traveller that cares to join him for dinner. All they need do is go to his website, jim-haynes.com, click to find directions, and then call or email to confirm. Jim prepares all the food for the meal, with the occasional help of a guest chef, and supplies the drink. Guests then simply make a contribution in an envelope at the end of the evening. \"Some 120,000 people have dined with me and, out of this, have come numerous friendships, love affairs, marriages, babies, jobs, apartments,\" he says. \"I once introduced two sisters from Suriname to two doctors from Edinburgh and it resulted in two weddings.\" And Jim's not the only one offering travellers the in-home restaurant experience. Dan Perlman in Buenos Aires (casasaltshaker.com) and Lothar Hesse in Dusseldorf (f-cook.de) also run in-house restaurants (both charge a small fee) - and keep your ear to the ground for more.",
