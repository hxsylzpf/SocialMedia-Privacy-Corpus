  "content": "The small North Yorkshire town of Helmsley is not a typical home of rock. There are four coaching inns, a half-timbered rectory and a picturesque duck pond. The place usually plays host to leather-booted ramblers, not leather-jacketed rockers, and activities include floral competitions, feeding the ducks and exploring the castle, not taking drugs and listening to loud music. However, this week the town has become a rock capital. A film by local band One Night Only has become the talking point of MySpace, where it has been receiving 5m hits a day. The story began a few weeks ago when four lads still in their teens shot the video for their first single, You And Me, in the leafy climbs around the castle. They captured such hardly rocking delights as the Royal Oak pub, the \"best delicatessen in the west\" (the band were later politely informed that Helmsley is actually in the east) and two elderly pensioners who \"used to be in a rock 'n' roll band, you know\" - a joke. The band posted the video on their own MySpace site - www.myspace.com/onenightonlyonline - and thought nothing more of it. However, it was glimpsed by someone at MySpace central, who noticed that the procession of genteel tea rooms and rather odd characters - not least a scarecrow, whom the locals have christened Meg - made a refreshing change from music videos' usual parade of moody young men and scantily clad ladies. In fact, MySpace liked the video so much that it asked the band to make a short film - One Night Only Welcome You To Helmsley - which was first put on the main MySpace homepage and then led to the band becoming a MySpace featured artist. As a result, their chirpy song You And Me looks very likely to enter the Top 40 this Sunday, an amazing achievement for a band who, until this week, were hardly known far beyond their Royal Oak local. The 17-year-old vocalist, George Craig, suggests that the very un-rock 'n' roll nature of their origins - the town is usually more concerned with the In Bloom gardening competition than chart positions - makes them different. \"People are intrigued,\" he argues, \"because most bands come from a city. I think we're the first band ever to come from the middle of the countryside in North Yorkshire.\" Which may be so, although Helmsley actually has a tradition of youthful musical rebellion stretching back hundreds of years. In the 17th century, when the village was a weaving centre, guides suggested the loom operators were famous for their \"thirsts, their songs and their leather breeches\". Historic accounts of the local fair suggest an event which was fraught with fistfights and drunkenness - just like a rock gig, then. However, the town that a sign outside the castle calls \"the cradle of chivalry\" is clearly a lot more restrained these days. When One Night Only formed in 2003 - initially covering Beatles songs before Craig arrived armed with a Libertines album which he'd bought as a 12-year-old in York, the nearest city - the band were banned from rehearsing almost everywhere in the village because of the noise. The band - who include guitarist Mark Hayton, keyboardist Jack Sails, drummer Sam Ford and bass Dan Parkin - became accustomed to shouts of \"Get yer hair cut\" from villagers whose experience of rock was limited to the handful of skate punks who hung around the village hall. \"They're not really used to musicians,\" says Craig. \"There's not really a scene in Helmsley.\" However, hailing from Helmsley has not held One Night Only back at all. Last year, Radio One DJ Steve Lamacq began spinning the You And Me demo. Then, after a frantic campaign of phone calls landed them a few gigs in York, an A&amp;R stampede saw the band sign to Vertigo/Universal, home of the Killers and Kanye West, which Craig says recognises that \"it's not where you're from, it's the quality of your songs\". However, Helmsley has clearly influenced One Night Only's music: songs like You And Me and Just For Night - a love song in honour of a nearby power station - have an almost mythical English cheeriness about them that makes a pleasant change from songs about hooded tops and stabbings. \"Helmsley's that kind of environment,\" says Craig. \"Relaxed, beautiful, good people. A place that makes you happy.\" The band are touring with Leeds rabble-rousers the Pigeon Detectives, but with their first album due in January they hope that in their absence, One Night Only fans will accompany the tourists who film the ducks in making pilgrimages to Helmsley in the way Beatles fans flocked to see the Cavern. \"They'll be made very welcome in the tea shops,\" Craig says. \u00b7 This article was amended on Friday November 9 2007. Jack Sails and Dan Parkin play keyboard and bass in the band One Night Only. We wrongly named them as Mark Sails and Sam Parkin. This has been corrected.",
