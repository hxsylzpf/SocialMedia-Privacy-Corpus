  "content": "In this week's Liberty Clinic, Corinna Ferguson, barrister and legal officer at Liberty, addresses the issue of workplace surveillance, responding to questions from Worktimesurfer and smallgirl on CCTV and personal searches in the office. In last week's Liberty Clinic open thread, basics wanted to know about the definition of terrorism. S/he might be interested in liberty central's guide to the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, both of which make provisions for amending the definition of terrorism. It's a hotly contested topic, in both legal and academic circles: Conor Gearty sums up some of the debates in this 2006 Oxford Amnesty lecture (pdf). Do post your own questions for the Liberty lawyers in the thread below, making your suggestions as brief as possible. If you made a contribution in a previous week that hasn't been answered yet, do please post it again here. And don't forget to check next week's thread to see whether Liberty answered your question: you can bookmark the Liberty Clinic homepage here.",
