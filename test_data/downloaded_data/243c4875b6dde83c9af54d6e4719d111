  "content": "Lawyers acting for the Toploader guitarist Dan Hipgrave have warned the Daily Star after the newspaper on Wednesday published a picture of his eight-year-old daughter, flouting Press Complaints Commission guidance on the images. Hipgrave, 35, sent a legal notice to all national newspapers two weeks ago after his daughter, Honey, was pictured in tabloid stories relating to the mental health of her mother, the TV presenter Gail Porter. Porter, 40, and Hipgrave divorced in 2004. The musician slammed the Express Newspapers title's decision to withdraw from the PCC as a \"self-admission that they're not going to play fairly\". Hipgrave's original legal notice sent out on 20 May asked newspapers not to publish any pictures of Honey \"for the foreseeable future\" and warned publishers about intrusion of privacy, referring to the section of the PCC code of practice on photographing children. Hipgrave said he would not seek an apology from the Star because \"it would fall on deaf ears and most likely end up on page 80\". It is understood that a source said that Hipgrave's publicist spoke to the Star's lawyers on Wednesday afternoon and that matters have now been resolved. Richard Desmond's Express Newspapers withdrew from the PCC in January after it stopped paying the fund that supports the regulator. The PCC chairman, Baroness Buscombe, described the decision at the time as \"disappointing\". A spokesman for the PCC said: \"As soon as recent stories appeared about Ms Porter's health, we contacted her representatives to offer assistance in dealing with any concerns about the press. This could include helping frame complaints against the Star, despite the current financial dispute between Richard Desmond and the funding body for the PCC.\" Northern &amp; Shell had not provided a comment at time of publication. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
