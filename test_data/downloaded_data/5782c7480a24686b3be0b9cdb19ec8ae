  "content": "Hacking With an active criminal investigation under way, what the inquiry is able to say about phone hacking is greatly limited, the report says. But Leveson observed that \"the degree to which editors from different titles joked about hacking, however, taken with the rest of the evidence, drives me to conclude that this was far more than a covert, secret activity, known to nobody save one or two practitioners of the 'dark arts'. Yet it was illegal. \"In my view the evidence which the inquiry has received ... strongly suggests phone hacking was a practice which, \u2026 from the late 1990s to the arrest of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire in 2006, was occurring within the industry on a more than localised basis ... To speak only of rumours being rife underplays the extent of the understanding and knowledge.\" Illegal trading in information Operation Motorman in 2003 had revealed an extensive network of people illegally selling personal information to journalists at a number of papers. But the Office of the Information Commissioner had failed to respond to the \"evidence of serious and systemic illegality\". None of the journalists named in the notebooks of a later convicted private investigator was even interviewed. Leveson calls this a \"missed opportunity\". He recommends introducing prison sentences for the worst breaches. News of the World It is clear, the report says, there was a general failure of management at the paper. \"It was said that the NoW had 'lost its way' in relation to phone hacking; its casual attitude to privacy and the lip service it paid to consent demonstrated a far more general loss of direction.\" Hacking was \"not limited to a single journalist. It would not be unfair to describe the practice of voicemail interception within a part or parts of the NoW as cultural\". Journalists worked under great pressure to deliver stories, which may have led them to \"use whatever means were necessary\". Surveillance, harassment and deceit were among the other tactics used, and \"bullying was a problem\". Press culture in general \"One of the main complaints [of witnesses],\" says the report, \"was that a cultural strand exists within the press betraying an unethical cultural indifference to the consequences of exposing private lives, and a failure to treat individuals with appropriate dignity and respect.\" It was not merely the NoW, notes the report. \"Too many stories in too many newspapers were the subject of complaints from too many people, with too little in the way of titles taking responsibility.\" Papers had often showed \"a significant and reckless disregard for accuracy\", frequently relying on \"misrepresentation and embellishment\". Similarly, \"there is a cultural tendency within parts of the press vigorously to resist or dismiss complainants almost as a matter of course\". Leveson sets out three ways in which the press has misbehaved: failing to respect privacy and dignity; obtaining information unlawfully or unethically; and harassing or discriminating against people. Some have suffered from \"egregious examples\" of inaccurate reporting, but many have felt too intimidated to complain. As for more widespread criminality, it is clear from the current police inquiries into hacking, illegal payments and computer hacking that \"there is considerable potential for further arrests of journalists, and not merely those previously employed by the NoW.\" Politicians' relationship with the press For 35 years \"and probably much longer\" politicians have got too close to the press \"in a way which has not been in the public interest\". This has involved putting themselves in positions where they were vulnerable to \"unaccountable influences\", overlooking chances to address public concern about press conduct, and seeking to control \"if not manipulate\" information in return for favourable treatment. \"There is of course no evidence at all of explicit, covert deals between senior politicians and newspaper proprietors or editors ... these very powerful relationships are more subtle than that.\" But there can be no doubt, he says, that there have been \"exchanges of influence\" that raise \"legitimate questions\". On the subject of Rupert Murdoch's dealings with prime ministers, Leveson said he had found no evidence of \"express deals with politicians\" but added in a rather waspish paragraph: \"Sometimes the very greatest power is exercised without having to ask ... Just as Mr Murdoch's editors knew the basic ground rules, so did politicians. In their discussions with him, whether directly or by proxy, politicians knew the prize was personal and political support of his mass circulation newspapers.\" The report recommends greater transparency about dealings with the press. The police The Met's failure to alert hacking victims or follow up the 2009 Guardian revelation of widespread hacking and the close ties between some officers and senior News International figures led to a \"concern\", Leveson says. But he said he was \"satisfied that I have seen no basis for challenging at any stage the integrity of the police or that of the senior officers concerned\". But they were often guilty of \"poor decisions, poorly executed\". The failure of John Yates, formerly assistant commissioner, to recuse himself from investigating the NoW, where he had good friends, was a source of \"regret\", says Leveson. \"I have no doubt that he should not have accepted the task.\" Decisions made following the Mulcaire/Goodman prosecution in 2006 were \"insufficiently thought through, wrong and unduly defensive\". On police contacts with the press, the inquiry \"has not unearthed extensive evidence of police corruption\". When briefing the media, the report advises, police should be clear about the status of the briefing; officers should only speak on subjects they have responsibility to comment on. Some \"high-level national guidance\" on hospitality should be developed. With regard to claims of a \"revolving door\" between the NoW and the Met, the report recommends considering a 12-month \"cooling off\" period before officers could start work for newspapers. The BSkyB bid/Hunt Jeremy Hunt escapes with his nose almost entirely clean over his handling of News Corp's bid to take over the rest of BSkyB. Though he had had \"strong views as to the merits of the bid\", when it became his responsibility he had \"immediately put in place robust systems\" to ensure it would be handled with \"fairness, impartiality and transparency\". It was \"commendably handled\", but for the overly close relationship between his adviser Adam Smith and News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel. \"I doubt the wisdom of appointing Mr Smith to this role.\" But while he concludes there is \"no credible evidence of actual bias\" on Hunt's part, the \"voluminous\" exchanges between Michel and Smith \"give rise to a perception of bias. The fact that they were conducted informally, and off the departmental record, are an additional cause for concern\". Media ownership When it comes to ensuring a sufficient plurality of media ownership Leveson concludes the current process of adjudication is \"clearly not satisfactory\". But given the rapid change of the media landscape to now include online news, the report resists making specific recommendations, suggesting only that the government \"ensure there is a mechanism for protecting media plurality\". It should also ensure greater transparency in media merger processes. But \"the levels of influence that would give rise to concerns in relation to plurality must be lower, and probably much lower, than the levels of concentration that would give rise to competition concerns.\" News International The report refers to Rupert Murdoch's evidence that he was unaware NI had been accused of obstructing the inquiry into hacking in 2006, which it says raises two issues. \"First, if Rupert Murdoch's evidence is correct, it appears that there was a lack of full transparency between the local management at NI and senior management at News Corporation or, alternatively, a very different understanding of the meaning of the word co-operation. Second, the NI approach is far from what might be expected of a well-run corporation. \"An organisational culture that is founded on integrity and honesty would require not only full co-operation with law enforcement, but also a determination to expose behaviour that failed to comply with the law... What happened at the NoW ... is particularly informative about the culture that pertained both within the corporate and editorial operations. The internet The report devotes just four paragraphs to a section entitled \"The relevance of the internet\". While some have argued that online publication renders its publication irrelevant, \"this argument is flawed\", he says, because the web is an \"ethical vacuum\" whereas the press claims to operate by an ethical code. Secondly, \"there is a qualitative difference between photographs being available online and being displayed, or blazoned, on the front page of ... the Sun\". Individual politicians \u2009 1.\u2009Margaret Thatcher A particular feature of her time as PM was the \"strong personal relationship\" she had with a number of proprietors, Leveson says, though he finds her government's granting Murdoch permission to buy the Times without reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission \"does not appear to me to be directly attributable to personal influence\". 2. John Major consciously chose not to be close to the media, he told the inquiry, adding that during his time in office \"a culture of press hostility\" arose leading to \"unfair and inaccurate\" coverage. Leveson finds that the hostile treatment he received was a lesson to many subsequent politicians, who resolved to handle the press differently. 3. Tony Blair It is unclear whether Blair would have called the Italian PM Romano Prodi in 1998 to lobby on Murdoch's behalf if the media owner hadn't asked him, but comments that the fact he could ask the PM in the first place is notable. Similarly, while Blair couldn't recall what he and Murdoch discussed in phonecalls before the Iraq war, \"It is interesting that he made time to discuss these issues with a newspaper proprietor ... It is also interesting that Mr Murdoch's 173 newspapers worldwide all supported the war.\" 4. Gordon Brown In his evidence Rupert Murdoch claimed Gordon Brown had phoned him in September 2009 after the Sun withdrew support for Labour to \"declare war\" on his company; Brown vehemently denied the claim. \"It is neither critical nor, indeed, necessary to decide where the truth of this conversation lies,\" the report states. There is also, meanwhile, \"considerable dispute\" between Brown and Rebekah Brooks over the source of a story in the Sun about the then chancellor's son's illness. \"What is not in dispute is that there was no public interest in the story.\" In asserting that the Browns wanted the story made public, Brooks is \"guilty of a degree of blinkeredness if not self-persuasion\". 5. David Cameron When it came to hiring Andy Coulson, it is clear, says Leveson, that Tory investigations \"did not go beyond asking Mr Coulson about [hacking] and accepting his assurances\". The decision to vet him to a particular level was taken by the civil service, not Cameron. The report states pointedly that politicians are permitted to have friendships with newspaper figures - \"Nevertheless, Mr Cameron frankly and, in my view, properly accepts that politicians have got too close to the media.\" Past regulation and the PCC Perhaps predictably, Leveson is withering in his criticism of the PCC, saying he \"unhesitatingly agree[s]\" with Cameron's assessment of it as \"ineffective and lacking in rigour\", and Ed Miliband's characterisation as a \"toothless poodle\". Fundamentally, says the report, the PCC is \"not really a regulator at all\". Its inquiries into hacking \"lacked any credibility... no serious investigation was undertaken at all\". Overall, \"It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the self-regulatory system was run for the benefit of the press not of the public.\" Future regulation \"I am firmly of the view that the goal here is voluntary independent self-regulation,\" the report states; its recommendations, however, also include an element of statutory oversight, with other possible mechanisms if some newspapers chose to stay outside. \"I cannot, and will not, recommend another last chance saloon for the press.\" His model would see the setting up of an \"independent regulatory body\" which would hear complaints, crucially with the power to investigate and impose sanctions where appropriate, \"take an active role in promoting high standards\", and offer a quick and cheap arbitration service to deal with civil law complaints. Its fines could be as much as 1% of turnover, to a maximum of \u00a31m. Alongside it, Leveson calls for a new law placing \"an explicit duty on the government to uphold and protect the freedom of the press\". The panel would be appointed by \"fair and open process\". Serving editors could form part of a \"Code Committee\" which would advise the panel but not have final say over it. It acknowledges that \"convincing incentives\" are required to entice all industry figures to join the body \u2013 principal among these would be access to an inexpensive arbitration service for resolving libel complaints. Failure to go through this process could hit noncompliant publishers or complainants with exemplary damages or heavy costs. Crucially, Leveson also recommends a statutory element: the independent body would undergo a \"verification process\" by a state body \u2013 Leveson recommends Ofcom \u2013 to make sure it's doing its job properly. If the industry doesn't participate, finally, Leveson \"with some measure of regret\" notes that the government might need to consider \"a statutory backstop regulator\".",
