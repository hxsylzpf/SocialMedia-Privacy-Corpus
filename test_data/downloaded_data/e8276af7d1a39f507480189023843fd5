  "content": "The Pirate Bay co-founder Gottfrid Svartholm Warg has launched a formal appeal in the hacking case that could see him deported to from Sweden to Denmark, where he could face up to six years in prison. The appeal is likely to delay the extradition, which was due to go through next week. Warg is accused of involvement in one of Denmark's biggest hacking attacks \u2013 on databases holding driving licence records, official email messages and millions of social security numbers. The attacks on the databases, all run by a Danish subsidiary of the US technology company CSC, took place between April and August last year. Warg claimed that errors in the extradition order and the lack of closure of his original hacking case of which elements were dismissed at appeal, including accusations of hacking Swedish bank Nordea, which could have an impact on the validity of the Danish extradition order. \"Formal errors were made in terms of the warrant form, of the information I have received on its contents as well as in terms of my rights to have this presented in the Swedish language,\" said Warg. Warg explained it was found that his computer could have been controlled remotely, which resulted in him being cleared of suspicion by the Swedish court of appeals over his hacking of Nordea in Sweden. Because of the similarities between the Swedish and Danish cases, Warg believes his clearance of charges related to hacking Nordea in Sweden should also apply to the Danish charges. \"It must be investigated whether this act should be considered 'the same offence' or not [in Denmark],\" said Warg.",
