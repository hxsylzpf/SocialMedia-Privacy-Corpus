  "content": "Social networking is taking a bit of a beating at the moment (Facebook and Bebo risk 'infantilising' the human mind, or make you ill), so it's nice to see some actual research that points in a different direction. Social networking benefits validated, in The Washington Times, reports that: the Digital Youth Project and conducted primarily at the University of Southern California and the University of California at Berkeley, found that in our increasingly technological world, the constant communication that social networking provides is encouraging useful skills. The study looked at more than 5,000 hours of online observation and found that the digital world is creating new opportunities for young people to grapple with social norms, explore interests, develop technical skills and work on new forms of self-expression. Mizuko Ito, lead author of the study, says: \"we found that spending time online is essential for young people to pick up the social and technical skills they need to be competent citizens in the digital age.\" Yes, there are issues for children, but Monica Vila, founder of theonlinemom.com, is quoted as saying that parents need to set parameters just as they would at any other playground. In my view, parents have more chance of finding out what their kids are up to online than they have when they are out, hanging around with their friends. And I'm not really worried about social networks \"infantilising the human mind,\" as Lady Greenfield warns. Since you have to be able to read, write and, to some extent, think in order to use a social network, I suspect they're more likely to be helping undo the infantilism produced by the original \"boob tube\": television.",
