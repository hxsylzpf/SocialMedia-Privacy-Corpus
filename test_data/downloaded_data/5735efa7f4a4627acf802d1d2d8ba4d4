  "content": "\"Diana had three people in her marriage \u2013 I've got more than three million. And I'm tired of it,\" wails self-confessed \"Twitter widow\" Celia Walden about hubster Piers Morgan (followers: 3,196,324 and counting) in Tuesday's Daily Telegraph. Waldo, not a Twitter user herself, you see, blames the social network for PM missing key events including his daughter's first step \u2013 \"too busy taunting Alan Sugar about the size of his 'follower count'\". Is there ever a day the shy and retiring one isn't taunting sirallun? Naturally, Piers retweeted the article. Celia, you should be grateful \u2013 at least while he's tweeting you presumably don't have to listen to him talk.",
