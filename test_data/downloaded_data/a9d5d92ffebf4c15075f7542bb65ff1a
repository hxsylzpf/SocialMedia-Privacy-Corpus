  "content": "Finnish mobile comic firm Comeks has announced investment from venture capital firm Accel, the company behind Facebook, BitTorrent and RealNetworks. The two-year-old company offers a tool for mobile users to create and send their own cartoon strips using video, photos, text and speech bubble graphics. Comeks, which was founded by three Finnish technology graduates and targets web users aged between 10 and 18, announced the investment in a comic strip on its own site. The mobile comic firm is in negotiations with several film studios about creating branded services. Accel did not announce the amount of the investment but said the sum would be used to further develop the Comeks service for mobiles and online. Earlier this week the venture capital firm announced the appointment of Andrew Braccia, former vice-president of consumer web search for Yahoo!, as a new partner with responsibility for internet investments. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
