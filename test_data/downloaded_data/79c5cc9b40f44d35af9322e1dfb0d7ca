The Facebook list shows that users of the social network are as diverse as on Twitter \u2013 and that the weird and wonderful often outdoes news on natural disasters.

Winehouse's sudden death in July provided the fourth and eighth most-shared stories on Facebook, outdoing the death of Osama bin-Laden, which came in at 14th. The BBC was by far the most-shared UK news outlet this year, with 11 stories in the top 20.
