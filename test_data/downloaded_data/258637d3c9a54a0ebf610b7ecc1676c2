However, I doubt whether your analysis of more than 2.5m Tweets (Report, 25 August) will indeed \"settle the issue as to whether or not instant messaging was truly important in fomenting the recent troubles\". First, by focusing only on the open Twitter medium, rather than closed BlackBerry messaging network, it emphases the role of social network publishing over connecting. Second, in terms of analysing the fomenting of trouble, it privileges explicit and immediate references to collective mobilisation for looting and arson, over messages from a longer period of time, reflecting, say, individual boredom or indifference. Focusing on what is accessible and dramatic always risks overlooking the hidden and the superficially mundane. The first limitation is technical, the second conceptual. Both suggest we should be cautious in interpreting data. That caution, of course, will not always be accepted by those who will draw on these innovative analyses. Professor Patrick McGhee Vice-chancellor, University of East London \u2022 The recent riots have generated much debate about the power of social media. Yet there has been no comment on the impact of old media, in the guise of television. How much of the drive to loot shops in Clapham was fuelled by hours of television given to the Tottenham riot the night before? Research on the commercial use of digital technology is beginning to indicate that the power of digital messages is magnified if linked to offline media, such as television. In the case of the riots, Facebook and Twitter may have been the messengers, but the message was that carried by television the previous evening. It is also odd that while brands are held to elicit selfishness and greed through mass media advertising, the editorial content is not generally seen as having an impact on people's behaviour. But soaps achieve far wider coverage than the average TV ad campaign. The commercial use of television is regulated. But what guides those who want blockbuster ratings for their drama: a desire to change people's lives, or the lure of a Bafta? All too often soaps portray a world where it is impossible to escape from social groups, where violence and fear is the undertow that entraps or lures back, and where there is no way out of the \"Street\" or the \"Square\" way of life. Episodically dealing with individual social issues in one character's story line is a token, not an overall commitment to social mobility and justice. Vic Davies Bucks New University",
