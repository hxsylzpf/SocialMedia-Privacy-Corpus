  "content": "After a New York grand jury decision on Wednesday to not indict the police officer Daniel Pantelo in the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island in July, demonstrations in the streets led to 83 arrests. Many people, however, took to Twitter instead. Garner's final words \u2013 \"I can't breathe\" \u2013 became an immediate rallying cry for protesters across the country. But many also chose to express their concerns over police and policing in the US, and disparities in the treatment of suspects based on the color of their skin, by using a hashtag started by a comedy writer. Jason Ross, a writer for the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, started the #CrimingWhileWhite hashtag late on Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday, as national debate and discussion of the grand jury's decision continued, it was still going strong. The hashtag sought to draw attention to how police respond to crimes or alleged crimes committed \u2013 or allegedly committed \u2013 by white and black Americans. The consensus? Even after being caught carrying out criminal acts, most white people receive, at most, a stern warning. Even when individuals said their reactions to officers were rude or aggressive, the officers' reaction was reported to have been similar: calm, perhaps even helpful. While the #CrimingWhileWhite effort received praise, it was not without its detractors. Such tweeters had a point. While well-intentioned, #CrimingWhileWhite distracted attention from police violence against black citizens. It satirically highlighted the privilege of being a white person in America \u2013 but at the expense of listening to actual black voices. On Thursday morning, Ebony senior digital editor Jamilah Lemieux responded by starting another hashtag, #AliveWhileBlack. Responses to #AliveWhileBlack reinforced the idea that police attitudes are divided by race, and illustrated the existence of two Americas: one in which white Americans are respected by the police and another in which black Americans are questioned, harassed or, as in the cases of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, killed. #AliveWhileBlack further illustrated that even black children are not exempt from mistreatment or, as in the case of the 12-year-old Cleveland boy Tamir Rice, being killed by police.",
