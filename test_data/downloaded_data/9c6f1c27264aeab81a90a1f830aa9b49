  "content": "The Washington Redskins attempted to fight back in the ongoing battle over their name \u2013 which Native American groups consider offensive \u2013 only to see a social-media push around the #RedskinsPride hashtag badly backfire. Last week, Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic Majority Leader, sent the Redskins a letter, signed by 49 Democratic senators, protesting the name. On Thursday, the Redskins' official Twitter account asked followers to \"Tweet @SenatorReid to show your #RedskinsPride and tell him what the team means to you\". By the afternoon, the #RedskinsPride hashtag had duly achieved trending status. Some tweets were supportive. The majority, however, did not use the hashtag in the manner intended by the team. Reid's official Twitter account did not immediately make comment, but the Washington Post reported the senator's digital director, Faiz Shakir, as saying: \"From our perspective, what we saw was just overwhelming opposition. It's really made our day.\" Speaking to Deadspin.com, Shakir said: \"The Skins tried to engage folks, and it has failed miserably \u2026 we haven't found more than one or two that are actually supportive.\" The Redskins' owner, Dan Snyder, has repeatedly said he will not change the name. Recently, however, the NBA's decision to ban for life Don Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers who was recorded making racist remarks about black men, has turned the spotlight on to the NFL franchise. President Barack Obama has also commented on the name, saying in October: \"If I were the owner of the team and I knew that the name of my team, even if they've had a storied history, that was offending a sizeable group of people, I'd think about changing it.\"",
