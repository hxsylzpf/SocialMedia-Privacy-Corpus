Here in Turkey, in an atmosphere increasingly resembling that of Kafka's tales, we wake up every few months to find our social media tools taken away from us for an indefinite time, by unidentified agents. It gets more absurd every time it happens \u2013 and it happens very frequently indeed. On Monday morning the Big Three \u2013 Twitter, Facebook and YouTube \u2013 were taken away. All gone, just like that. The official reason behind the ban on access is a picture taken last Tuesday by militants of the outlawed Revolutionary People's Liberation Front (DHKP-C), a Marxist-Leninist party who took a prestigious state prosecutor, Mehmet Selim Kiraz, hostage at gunpoint last week. A few hours after the picture was released on social media, he died from bullet wounds after security forces stormed the Istanbul courthouse where he was being held. Last Wednesday a number of newspapers published that photo of the slain prosecutor: gagged, against a backdrop of flags of the organisation that took him hostage, and a look of terror in his eyes. Turkey's prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, denounced the newspapers that published the photo. Soon afterwards, a court ordered 166 websites featuring the image to be blocked. The failure of that measure seems to have triggered the social media ban. This is what we call, in Turkish, burning the quilt to get rid of the flea. It is an unfair, indefensible and unproductive method. When YouTube was banned in Turkey in 2007 \u2013 because of videos that insulted Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk \u2013 users quickly learned about ways to get around the ban (which incredibly wasn't lifted until three years later). By that stage everyone had forgotten about the cause of the ban and nobody seemed to take it seriously. The prime minister at the time, and now president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, famously said he himself was using YouTube, and urged others to \"go ahead and do the same\". In Turkey, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have in the last three years turned into political arenas where supporters of all political beliefs spend endless hours arguing, fighting and attacking one another. People group together and spam those who have different political views; social media reflects the vibrant nature of Turkish society. Closing such a platform is the worst thing a state can do to the citizens, whose freedom of expression it is required to ensure. That the ban was invoked after a matter concerning journalistic ethics makes it not more acceptable but less. It is little different from closing all newsagents because one newspaper has published images of severed heads of murdered journalists. The decision to publish such images may be questionable and wrong, but closing down newsagents is indefensible. Last Tuesday, when the state prosecutor was killed, there was a nationwide blackout in the country and Twitter became the preferred platform for people to talk about their experiences. With the social media blackout, many feel there is nowhere left to express their frustration. Turkey's ruling party \u2013 which has long defined itself as a party of pro-market, conservative democrats \u2013 often refers to the old bureaucratic system as the old Turkey. And if blanket bans on access to social media belong anywhere, it is surely in the Turkey of the past.",
