  "content": "From the bottom shelf at Asda to the top of the Viral Video chart, Old Spice is showering the social web with just-for-you messages. Following on from the success of February's more traditional television advertising campaigns, the face of Old Spice - actor Isaiah Mustafa - is back with a more personalised digital campaign. Simply send Mr. Old Spice a message - through Facebook, Twitter or YouTube - and wait for his visual retort. He's getting through the videos, considering the amount of messages received, but you might be one of the 116 lucky recipients like Gizmodo or Kevin Rose. The campaign goes hand-in-hand with the Old Spice worldwide promoted Twitter trending topic. Top marks to Old Spice for a refreshing (boom tish) take on video advertising, I look forward to hearing the company's take on its value. In the meantime, we've sent Mr. Spice a couple of pleading tweets in the hope of a video reply.",
