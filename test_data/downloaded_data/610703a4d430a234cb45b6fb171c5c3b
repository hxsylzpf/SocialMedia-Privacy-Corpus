In front of people? \"I was like 'great, you've been on Pinterest again.'\" Just the thought of it made him uncomfortable. \"I'm a very private person,\" says the 32-year-old youth pastor from British Columbia. \"If it's a big moment, I like to have it to ourselves.\" He preferred to find out when Chelsea gave birth \u2013 a bit like in the old days, when fathers celebrated with a cigar in the waiting room. Instead, four months later on a sunny May afternoon, Johnny and Chelsea stood outside their church behind a large cardboard box from Dollarama. Along with a group of 25 family and friends, they were about to learn if they would be raising a daughter or a son. The couple's two-year-old boy, Cohen, pulled the string to open the box. They gave it a shake. Five multi-colored balloons popped out. Confusion. \"Well, what color is it?\" said Chelsea in the tight tone of someone trying to keep it cool in front of a crowd. A second later, a bigger balloon wriggled up from the bottom of the box. Chelsea screamed and jumped up and down. Cue the crying. Cue the hugs. It turns out Chelsea had been on Pinterest, where she discovered that gender reveal parties are the trendiest way to find out whether you're having a Susie or a Sam. Though the savviest mommy bloggers have been in the know since the first gender reveal videos were uploaded to YouTube in 2008, in the past few years the number of parties has grown. Since January 2014, the number of \"gender reveal\" pins have increased by 224%, according to a spokeswoman at Pinterest. On the BabyCenter, a popular website for new parents, the number of posts about the gatherings has increased from 280 in 2011 to 14,000 in 2015. Now that actors, hipsters and even men like Johnny have embraced the fad, it could just become the next staple of Baby Celebration Inc. The parties all follow a similar formula: after a sonogram, the couple hands their sealed envelope to someone trusty and waits in agony until the dramatic reveal. One of the most popular (and cheapest) ways to discover the sex is via balloon-filled cardboard box. Others slice into a cake filled with either pink or blue icing. But the options are endless, and range from confetti in a pi\u00f1ata to pink- or blue-colored \"lava\" from a plastic bottle modeled into a volcano. Online, \"reveals\" are mostly still dominated by pregnant women who revel in tacky pink and blue-themed decorations. There are straws, napkins, banners and mini-water coolers filled with pink lemonade and blue punch. Hershey bar packages are colored in to highlight \"she\" or \"he\". Most parties also include interactive ways to guess the baby's sex: think pins for the cardboard \"staches\" or \"lashes\", painted clothespins or marking your vote on a chalkboard under a headline like \"Guns\" or \"Glitter\". Chelsea admits she spent about 25 hours preparing for the party, which a professional film-maker friend shot and edited into a slick-looking compilation of the day. One woman I spoke to described the gender reveal bash she attended as a \"mini-wedding\". Is most gender reveal swag tacky? Absolutely. But as these parties spread beyond crafty moms, others are throwing a more discreet kind of celebration. Kenneth Harris doesn't spend much time on Pinterest \u2013 he plays guitar for the band Panic! at the Disco. He and his wife Victoria threw a gender reveal party in early October as a last hurrah before their life would become more about diapers than daiquiris. \"It was just like a normal party you would have but with cake,\" says the 34-year-old who lives in Los Angeles. \"We didn't want it to feel like a shower.\" The couple did have the obligatory pink and blue straws and discovered they were having a boy via icing. But otherwise, the backyard party with 30 of their friends was standard hipster fare: cornhole, bocce ball and catered food from a trendy LA eatery. They spent about $600 and made sure there was lots of booze. Even still, some of Harris's single, male friends gave him a hard time: \"'Oh man, I'm going to have a cake for my next physical results,\" one said. They may have a point, but defenders of gender reveal parties say they trump baby showers any day (though many couples throw both). There is less pressure to bring a gift, and men aren't excluded. Guests describe the excitement as infectious. And while you might not think it's possible to feel that invested in another couple's baby, people find themselves in tears during the big \"reveal\". At the beginning of the party, Johnny felt a bit awkward. \"I was like 'do people actually do this, or do all our friends and family think that we're insane?'\" But as he watched his guy friends enthusiastically mark their guesses on a chalkboard and take photos with their staches or lashes, he embraced the idea. When he saw the excitement of his wife and guests just after they opened the box, he was sold. He was going to have a baby girl. His very next thought? \"This is going to be awesome but, also, I'm going to need to buy a rifle.\"",
