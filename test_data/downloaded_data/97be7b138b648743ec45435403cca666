He wants a new rule that would allow investigators to look at files without the permission of company directors. His plans ran into immediate opposition from business leaders who said his request for increased powers were a heavy-handed response to the problem. The information commissioner, Richard Thomas, said that a \"horrifying\" succession of data security breaches in recent years at high-profile companies - including mobile phone operator Orange, building society Nationwide and mail order retailer Littlewoods - had shown that many companies failed to understand the risks to their customers and to their own reputations of keeping vast databases without adequate security. Mr Thomas said giving him the power to conduct an inspection and audit to ensure compliance with data protection laws would allow him \"to force the pace\" and encourage more companies to change their behaviour. Now, he must gain the consent of an organisation before starting an investigation. He also questioned whether companies should be obliged to report data security breaches in the same way the banks are forced to report suspicious money laundering. \"Over the last year we have seen far too many careless and inexcusable breaches of people's personal information. The roll call of banks, retailers, government departments, public bodies and other organisations which have admitted serious security lapses is frankly horrifying. Wrong hands \"How can laptops holding details of customer accounts be used away from the office without strong encryption? How can millions of store cards fall into the wrong hands? How can online recruitment allow applicants to see each others' forms? How can any bank chief executive face customers and shareholders and admit that loan rejections, health insurance applications, credit cards and bank statements can be found, unsecured in non-confidential waste bags?\" Mr Thomas, who was speaking before the publication of the commission's annual report today, signed a deal with the banks last year that effectively gives him access to inspect and audit their systems without permission. He extracted the concession after a series of high-profile breaches at prominent high street banks and building societies. In one instance, Halifax allowed details of 13,000 mortgage customers to go astray after the briefcase holding the documents was stolen froma member of staff's car. The incident came after Nationwide's lax security procedures put thousands of customers at risk from fraud. A laptop was stolen from a long-standing Nationwide employee in a domestic burglary. The employee reported its loss and then went on holiday, but it took three weeks for the building society to realise that the laptop contained confidential customer information. Mr Thomas said a similar agreement allowing his inspectors access to companies in all sectors would prove to be more effective than spending the next few years painstakingly negotiating with each area of industry and commerce. He said he also needed a more effective sanction where there are \"flagrant, far-reaching breaches of the law\". Debt collectors linked to a financial services subsidiary of General Motors and private equity firm Cabot Square Capital were named in a court case this year over the illicit market in private information stolen from government databases. The commissioner brought a prosecution against a private investigator who was used by companies chasing vehicle hire purchase and bank debtors. The private investigator posed as another member of staff in telephone conversations in a practice known as \"blagging\" to gain access to personal information. The companies say they told the private investigator at the time not to break the law. Mr Thomas said he was concerned that a market in stolen data was growing despite recent adverse publicity. \"During a recent investigation we turned up at the offices of a private investigation agency and while we were there the fax machine leapt into life. It was a request from another firm asking them to find out if a woman had cancer. It also asked the agency to check a list of clinics to see if another woman had had an abortion. \"In this instance we are not talking about a small misdemeanour. This is the illegal soliciting of personal information and the kind of thing that we need to investigate thoroughly.\" But the CBI said enhanced powers to investigate alleged breaches of the data protection rules would have wider implications. \"The nature of business is changing dramatically, so the way companies handle customer data is increasingly important,\" said the employers' body spokesman Jeremy Beale. \"Some firms need to improve their data policies but there are no easy answers or silver bullets and the CBI wants a national debate to help identify where the responsibility for different aspects of data protection lies. By calling for the ability to inspect firms' files without consent, the information commissioner is in danger of leading businesses into the very surveillance society he is heeding against.\" Mr Thomas said this year he was concerned that the vast amount of data being collected on individuals meant we were sleep-walking into a surveillance society. He said he lacked greater powers only because when the government translated the EU data protection directive into law it left out crucial elements. \"The EU wants the government to give us the powers. Our experience tells us we need the powers,\" he said. The Ministry of Justice is responsible for overseeing the Information Commissioner's office. Yesterday it said: \"We believe that the Information Commissioner already has adequate powers.\" Don't bank on banks to keep your secrets For consumers who have been studiously shredding their old credit card statements and other sensitive data, the information commissioner's move cannot come soon enough. Despite repeatedly warning their customers to be careful about what they put in the recycling bin, several banks and other institutions have shown a disregard for their customer's important financial data. Two years ago the Guardian exposed how the Grand hotel in Brighton - bombed during the 1984 Conservative party conference - had thrown thousands of its customers' credit card details, home addresses, and phone numbers in a skip outside its back door. Passers-by were helping themselves. We were able to ring up some of the former guests and read out their credit card numbers - to their initial bemusement, and ultimate anger. In some cases we even had their passport numbers. And the Grand was by no means alone. Since then, banks have been caught leaving bin liners full of customers' details out in the street. Others have allowed staff to take unprotected laptops containing sensitive data home, which have subsequently been stolen. A further concern was the case last year of Abbey's call centre staff who were selling its customers' bank details in an underpass near Bradford. In fact, this happens far more often than is realised because the banks always hush up breaches of security. Sri Lankan staff in petrol stations recently perpetrated a \u00a330m chip and pin fraud after they recorded details and then cloned several customers' bank and credit cards. The government is another culprit. In one instance, temporary staff at the Child Support Agency were allowed access to one of the country's three main credit reference agencies. The staff could ask for credit checks on individuals and get other personal financial information. To make matters worse, they were able to continue accessing the Equifax database for several months after their contracts ended. Next week HM Revenue &amp; Customs is expected to announce that its tax credit system suffered fraud and error worth \u00a31bn in 2005/2006. In its first three years the level of fraud and error will reach almost \u00a33bn. So you are far more likely to be the victim of identity fraud because of something an institution holding your details has done - or not done - than you are from not shredding your documents at home.
