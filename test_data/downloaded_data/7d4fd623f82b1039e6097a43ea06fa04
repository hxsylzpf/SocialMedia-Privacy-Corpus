  "content": "Barack Obama is secretly a Muslim. Having children makes parents dumber. A fifth of Canadian parliamentarians are drunk drivers. What do these statements have in common? They're all lies. Yet being manifestly silly \u2013 the one about parental intelligence was originally invented by satirical magazine the Onion \u2013 never stopped them spreading merrily around the globe. Nothing travels like a juicy internet rumour, as footballer Steven Gerrard discovered when untrue allegations about an extracurricular sex life disrupting England's World Cup performance went viral last week. It took no less a cultural authority than the Sun to squash it, a stark reminder of how untruths can multiply online. The two basic rules of internet life \u2013 share nicely and move fast \u2013 virtually guarantee it. The web is woven from the millions of connections we make \u2013 forwarding emails, circulating strangers' jokes on Twitter, linking to blogs, all googling \"Gerrard\" simultaneously \u2013 and the more information you share, the stronger your online presence. Combine that sharing impulse with a tradition of openness (the hoax emails cleverly claimed Gerrard's lawyers had suppressed publication, making spreading it seem a blow for free speech) and the immediacy of electronic media and malice quickly goes global. The sheer speed of spread attracts those for whom hoaxing is a full-time hobby. Scandals have always travelled quicker than denial can get its boots on: Virgil's description of \"rumour, than whom no other evil thing is faster\" suggests pernicious inaccuracy certainly predates broadband. But fear of being caught muckraking within our relatively small social circles at least restrains our real-life gossip. Lost in much bigger crowds online, many of us are astonishingly casual about what we forward. People who deplore tabloid intrusiveness behave like the Sunday Sport on crack: who cares if it's true or not, private or not? Click! Forward! Why do it, when we know it may cause those involved pain? It's partly because social media are the nation's virtual fag break. Millions dip into Facebook or Twitter to break up a dull afternoon, procrastinate, or take a quick drag on the outside world. Like smokers' huddles everywhere, social media thrive on irresponsible gossip and bitching about authority: it's easy to forget this conversation is public. It's common practice on Twitter to retweet news snippets without checking if they're true. The faintly hippie, collective web spirit dulls our sense of individual responsibility for them. The darker side of such flippancy is cruelty. While some research suggests online socialising triggers the same pleasurable responses in the brain as talking to people, there are critical differences. It's being able to see faces and gauge body language that encourages empathy; virtual communication tends to anaesthetise the emotions. Who cares about Gerrard's wife? Forward! But electronic mud sticks. The Obama rumour was dismissed by mainstream media, but a pre-election poll found nearly one in 10 Americans still believed it. So perhaps Gerrard should count himself lucky. If anyone can be persuaded it was not England's feeble inability to score \u2013 but the opposite \u2013 that knocked us out of contention, at least Fabio Capello might be grateful.",
