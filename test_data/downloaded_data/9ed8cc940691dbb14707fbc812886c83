  "content": "Harold Evans is bang on target (Why the silence on ownership?, 30 November). In all the squealing about freedom of the press, hardly anyone is addressing this key issue. Freedom only has meaning if equal access and diversity is guaranteed. For Cameron et al to cry wolf about state interference and the danger of overthrowing a long and proud tradition of a free press displays a lack of knowledge of history. The press throughout its short history has been hounded by the ruling elite with fines, bans and stamp duties imposed to prevent the publication of popular, usually, working-class newspapers. Only since the concentration of ownership in the hands of the wealthy has the state ceased hounding the press. Leveson's modest suggestion is, in any case, not calling for state regulation, simply statutory backing; otherwise it would remain a toothless poodle like the PCC. Bruni de la Motte London",
