The prime minister's official spokesman said David Cameron \"very much shares the view that is being expressed there around the use of web-enabled, internet-access technologies by violent and extremist groups amongst others, and the need to do more\". Hannigan, in an article for the Financial Times, dispensed with the traditional GCHQ approach of hugging the shadows and instead said he wanted to have a mature debate about privacy in the digital age. No10 said Sir Nigel Sheinwald, the former ambassador to the US who is now a special envoy dealing with the intelligence agencies and the internet companies, had been given \"a specific responsibility to discuss data-sharing with the US authorities, with US [technology] companies\". Technology firms responded with irritation to Hannigan's suggestions that they were little more than \"command and control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals\". The Internet Services Providers' Association, the voice of the UK internet industry, described Hannigan's comments as ill-judged. Its secretary general, Nicholas Lansman, said: \"Ultimately, the public will be the arbiters of where the line should be drawn between privacy and security. For this to happen, an honest and frank debate is required based on the full facts. The comments from GCHQ fall short of this.\" One tech company insider suggested that attitudes such as Hannigan's were the reason Britain did not have a sizeable technology sector of its own. Others said most of the time it took for social networks to respond to takedown requests was a product of the byzantine legal system required for authorities in one country to order the removal of content in another. Ed Richards, the head of media regulator Ofcom, told MPs that social media firms such as Google and Facebook had a \"social responsibility\" and it was \"absolutely right\" to ask what society should expect from them. Richards told the Commons culture, media and sport select committee that it was important to explore \"what goes over these networks and to what extent are we as a society comfortable with the world that that is creating, particularly in relation to children\". Richards, who steps down as Ofcom's chief executive at the end of the year, said: \"I think it is fair to say that there are social responsibilities that come with a media that are as prevalent and as significant as those social media have become.\" GCHQ is normally the most secretive of the British intelligence agencies. A GCHQ spokeswoman, responding to questions about Hannigan's article, restricted herself to saying: \"Mr Hannigan's article speaks for itself.\" Hannigan is understood to be pleased with the wide publicity his article generated. Morale at GCHQ is reported to have been dented by the Snowden revelations, with some staff unhappy over what they see as their work being unfairly vilified. Civil rights groups and politicians welcomed Hannigan's promise of a debate, but expressed scepticism over whether his call was genuine or a diversionary tactic, because he focused on the use of social media by groups such as Islamic State while failing to address issues such as mass surveillance. The response from British parliamentarians to Hannigan's comments was muted but Claude Moraes, who heads the European parliament's home affairs committee, which is investigating the role of the internet companies in surveillance, took issue with him and called for balance and maturity in the debate. \"The European parliament has begun the second phase of its inquiry into mass surveillance and will target precisely the area the new GCHQ chief claims tech groups are using as a so-called command hub for terrorists,\" he said. \"I don't believe that major tech companies are in denial about the misuse of their services by potential terrorists.\" He predicted there would be a European digital bill of rights or a European habeas corpus to enshrine better security and encryption by spring next year. The British intelligence agencies have blamed the Snowden revelations for alerting terrorists to their techniques for intercepting communications and claim that adoption of encryption by the tech companies will make their work much harder. Civil liberty groups say GCHQ is seeking even more powers after the general election. Mike Harris, campaign director of Don't Spy On Us, an umbrella group of civil liberties groups set up after the Snowden revelations, said of Hannigan's article: \"This is the intelligence agencies getting on the front foot seeking new powers and wanting to put some of the programmes Snowden uncovered on a legal footing.\" Asked about Islamic State, Harris said: \"They are muddying waters.\" Jim Killock, director of the Open Rights Group, said: \"Robert Hannigan's comments are divisive and offensive. If tech companies are becoming more resistant to GCHQ's demands for data, it is because they realise that their customers' trust has been undermined by the Snowden revelations. It should be down to judges, not GCHQ nor tech companies, to decide when our personal data is handed over to the intelligence services. \"If Hannigan wants a 'mature debate' about privacy, he should start by addressing GCHQ's apparent habit of gathering the entire British population's data rather than targeting their activities towards criminals.\"It is Hannigan's claim that \"most ordinary users of the internet\" disagree with the tech firms' views on privacy that has sparked the most ire in Silicon Valley. Rafael Laguna, of the German communications firm Open-Xchange, said: \"Mr Hannigan is correct in one respect: internet users would be comfortable with a more sustainable relationship between intelligence agencies and technology companies. But his idea of a sustainable relationship is quite some distance from that of the big technology companies and their subscribers. \"Monitoring all electronic communication en masse breeds fear and suspicion, and it's natural that individuals will move towards more secure technology such as encryption to avert this.\"",
