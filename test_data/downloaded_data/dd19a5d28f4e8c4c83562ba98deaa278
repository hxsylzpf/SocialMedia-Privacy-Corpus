  "content": "As unwanted Facebook messages go, it would take some beating. A judge in Australia has ruled that house repossession notices can now be served on the social networking site. So much for simply keeping track of your mates. A couple in Canberra defaulted on a six-figure loan. A lawyer acting for the lender could not trace the couple at their home or via email. So he applied and was granted the right to serve legally binding documents on Facebook. The lawyer, Mark McCormack, said the couple's Facebook pages included their names, dates of birth and they had listed each other as friends. What next: divorce papers served on Facebook? There has, after all, already been a rather public Second Life divorce. Australia seems to be leading the way on the perils of Facebook: last month an employee in Sydney was discovered to be pulling a sickie by his boss through an unwise status update.",
