A blog post by chief executive Travis Kalanick outlined the growth that has brought the company to this point. \"It was just a year ago that Uber was operating in 60 cities and 21 countries \u2013 today we are in over 250 cities in 50 countries. We are 6 times bigger today than 12 months ago \u2013 and grew faster this year than last,\" he wrote. \"In 2015 alone, Uber will generate over 1mm jobs in cities around the world and with that millions of people may decide that they no longer need to own a car because using Uber will be cheaper than owning one.\" The company is growing fast, but is it maturing in terms of its corporate culture? The recent controversy sparked by an Uber executive's suggestion that it might spend money investigating the personal lives of journalists who've criticised the company suggested there was work to do. Kalanick agrees: \"The events of the recent weeks have shown us that we also need to invest in internal growth and change. Acknowledging mistakes and learning from them are the first steps. We are collaborating across the company and seeking counsel from those who have gone through similar challenges to allow us to refine and change where needed. Fortunately, taking swift action is where Uber shines, and we will be making changes in the months ahead. Done right, it will lead to a smarter and more humble company that sets new standards in data privacy, gives back more to the cities we serve and defines and refines our company culture effectively.\" Do you think the criticism of Uber over data privacy has hit home? Or is it still an example of what Observer writer John Naughton recently called \"digital capitalism\", suggesting that \"the billionaire geeks who currently run the giant internet companies may look and talk like a new species of entrepreneur but it would be more prudent to view them as John D Rockefellers in hoodies\"?
