  "content": "Currently doing the rounds on Twitter is the image below, taken from Facebook by artist James Harvey, whose tweet has been shared thousands of times. It depicts one of the fairly frequent brawls in Ukrainian parliament which, while undoubtedly ugly to fans of democracy and national stability, is beautiful on a purely aesthetic level. The Fibonacci spiral has been placed on top of it to show just why its elements cohere so satisfyingly. Starting with one added to one, if you add each number in a series to the one preceding it you create the Fibonacci sequence, whose beautifully exponential growth can be transposed on to everything from the arrangements of petals in flowers to cauliflowers. Here, the violence spirals exponentially outward from the focal point of the fight up to the reddened face of the man at the top of the image; in another brawl image, at the top of this article, the spiral similarly flows around the image to the shiny-suited politico grappling in the middle. Renaissance painters used this 'Golden Ratio' to arrange the elements in the most biologically pleasing \u2013 and therefore divinely anointed \u2013 order. Take Michelangelo's depiction of Adam on the roof of the Sistine Chapel, where the ratio helps place the crucial finger of God. A court photographer obviously didn't have the kind of time Michelangelo did to compose his image, but its serendipity makes it even more magical. The hands that swarm in at the edges of the photograph give it a weirdly Renaissance quality too: in those paintings, hands do so much of the emotional heavy lifting \u2013 they supplicate, pray, and constantly reach for the divine. Another example of 'Accidental Renaissance' is this Associated Press image of Frank Lampard suggested by Dan Sully. This time, the spiral begins at the heart of his grief and release, tracing his arm and down to Drogba's leg, to form a remarkable composition. Carvalho and Drogba hold him like he's being removed from a cross; his face is cast with a benevolent heavenly glow. How many of these strange neo-masterpieces are there out there? Feel free to share links to any you've found below.",
