With 300 million active monthly users uploading an average of 70m photos a day and generating 2.5bn \"likes\", the mobile photo and video sharing social network is one to watch. More than half of young adults aged 18-29 already use the service. Yet relatively few charities have embraced Instagram. Only 21% have a presence on the platform, according to research published last year. That's surprising, as it can be a great tool for storytelling, connecting supporters emotionally with nonprofits' work. Calgary Zoo in Canada even shared its 2012 annual review on Instagram. Part of the appeal is the simple and spontaneous nature of the platform. Joe Freeman, social media manager at hospice and neurological care charity Sue Ryder, says: \"The best charity accounts on Instagram, for me, are those that use the app in the way it was originally intended \u2013 taking photos directly from their phone. There's definitely a time and a place for you to share your 'professionally' taken photos, especially around supporting a very public campaign, but it's the quick, insightful photos that for me, always look better in the app and actually show better rates of engagement.\" How can you get the most from Instagram? 1. Bring people closer to the action Nick Owen, digital communications officer at M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, says: \"With our @doctorswithoutborders Instagram feed we try and bring our supporters as close to MSF's frontline work as possible. Whether it's trauma surgery in a conflict setting or mobile outreach care in Ebola hotspots, Instagram is a fantastic way to give an up-to-date insight into our lifesaving work in over 60 countries. It's opened us up to a wider, and younger, audience.\" 2. Build your brand Neil Wissink, photography manager at WaterAid, posts to the charity's Instagram feed at least once a day, covering both issues and success stories. \"We keep track of what's happening around the world, and ensure our posts resonate,\" he says. \"People from all over discover WaterAid because of Instagram. We've been contacted by everyone from keen seven-year-old fundraisers, to politicians in Sierra Leone. It's given us a completely different kind of visibility.\" Instagram spotted one of WaterAid's videos and featured the charity as a suggested user, which helped it gain more than 20,000 followers in a matter of weeks. 3. Involve your supporters The National Trust runs a photo challenge every weekend asking its Instagram community to share photos of their locations, using the hashtag #NTChallenge. This boosts engagement and enables the charity to share the stories behind its properties. 4. Reach young people Young Scot, the national youth information and citizenship charity for Scotland, sees Instagram as a key platform for its audience. Kirsten Urquhart, the charity's information services manager, uses Instagram to co-create campaigns with young people, including coping with exam stress, celebrating the benefits of sport and stories of eating disorders and recovery. Urquhart says: \"It's the visual content that connects so well with our audience, coupled with stories of direct experiences of young people \u2013 it's powerful, immediate and engaging. It is easily accessible and shareable for young people and because it is so quick, we can be really responsive to issues. We have seen a real growth in followers in the past six months, which is great, but the bit that gets us most excited is how Instagram helps us share the views of young people on a peer-to-peer basis.\" 5. Define your goals You don't need a huge digital team, just a clear idea of what you want to achieve. Nancy Scott, digital communications officer at Beating Bowel Cancer, developed the charity's Decembeard UK account for the campaign. Noticing that many people were posting about beards on Instagram, the charity connected with beard and grooming brands and engaged with bearded men who could spread the word. Scott says: \"We went from 56 to 3,800 followers in three months so we were very happy with that.\" Joe Freeman has a final tip, pointing out that it's easy to overuse hashtags on Instagram. He advises charities that, \"whilst they do increase the number of likes on a photo, the quality of those likes is arguably of less value because you're effectively gaming the system. Keep hashtags relevant and use them sparingly.\" For more news, opinions and ideas about the voluntary sector, join our community - it's free!",
