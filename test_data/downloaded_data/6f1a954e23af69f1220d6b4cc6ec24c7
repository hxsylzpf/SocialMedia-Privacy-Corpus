Members of groups will be able to swap updates rather than broadcasting them to all of their \"friends\" on the 500m-strong social network. Announcing Facebook Groups, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said that groups are \"a fundamental building block\" and solving how best to implement them is \"the biggest problem in social networking\". He said that after considering the best way to do it, Facebook had decided that the best implementation would be social \u2013 letting users create their own groups, which would be \"as simple as inviting your best friends over for dinner\". Of the feature, he said: \"We think this is going to be a pretty fundamental shift for how people use Facebook ... The amount of sharing will go up massively and will be completely additive.\" The feature will be familiar to anyone who has used Yahoo's \"Groups\" system, which lets people find interests and join up for web discussions. The new Facebook Groups feature lets users create groups which are managed by all their members, to hold group chats, edit a wiki, and send emails to the members of the group. By default, groups will be private \u2013 known only to those who are invited \u2013 but it will also be possible to create public and \"secret\" groups. Zuckerberg said that the purpose of groups was to make sure users would be informing people who are interested in a particular topic. In a blogpost on the introduction at Facebook, Zuckerberg said: \"We've long heard that people would find Facebook more useful if it were easier to connect with smaller groups of their friends instead of always sharing with everyone they know. For some it's their immediate family and for others it's their fantasy football league, but the common concern is always some variant of, 'I'd share this thing, but I don't want to bother 250 people. Or my grandmother. Or my boss.'\" Previously, he admits, \"Facebook has made it easy to share with all of your friends or with everyone, but there hasn't been a simple way to create and maintain a space for sharing with the small communities of people in your life, like your roommates, classmates, co-workers and family.\" \"We approached this problem as primarily a social one. Rather than asking all of you to classify how you know all of your friends, or programming machines to guess which sets of people are likely cohorts, we're offering something that's as simple as inviting your best friends over for dinner. And we think it will change the way you use Facebook and the web.\" The reaction from privacy advocates was mixed: some welcomed the fact that it would give users more control of their information, while others thought that it would yield more information to Facebook, which it could then sell to marketers. Facebook is insistent that it never reveals personal information about individuals to marketers, but only sells aggregated, anonymised information; marketers select the characteristics of people they want to reach with ads \u2013 such as 55-year-old beer drinkers living in a city \u2013 and Facebook then finds people who match that profile and serves the ads. Facebook is the world's largest social network, with more than 500m users around the world. Although it is a private company that has not released any financial details, it is believed to be profitable day to day, with revenues approaching $2bn annually. Facebook wants Groups to become useful so that everyone will take part in one. Zuckerberg compared the approach to photos, where a minority of Facebook users upload photos, but 95% of users have been tagged in at least one. With Groups, one person's interaction with the product affects everyone else's experience of it, and the design is personalised to become a space for that particular group of people, said the Facebook director of product, Chris Cox. Asked whether activity on Groups would take away from the interactions that happen today on users' profile pages, Zuckerberg contended that group participation would open up new communication and collaboration that didn't happen on Facebook before. An earlier tool called \"Friend lists\", launched in 2008, only ever reached 5% of users despite being promoted strongly within the site. Zuckerberg said that those have no \"virality or social dynamics\", but that Groups should. Zuckerberg said the company also experimented with algorithmic solutions to understand which friends and information users care about the most, but that those could go badly wrong if, for example, it decided that a tradesman who you had emailed daily over a work project must therefore be a close friend. The conclusion, he said, was that algorithms were OK for news feeds and lists of friends for chat, but not groups of friends. Facebook has posted a video of how Groups works.",
