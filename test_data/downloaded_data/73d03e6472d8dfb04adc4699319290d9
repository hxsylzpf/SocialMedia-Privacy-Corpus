  "content": "Almost a decade ago, in the wake of a journalistic scandal that shook the New York Times to its core, the newspaper appointed its first ombudsman, Daniel Okrent. His post was called the \"public editor\" and the role was defined by the newspaper in this way: \"The public editor works outside of the reporting and editing structure of the Times and receives and answers questions or comments from readers and the public, principally about articles published in the paper. Additionally, he publishes periodic commentaries in the paper about the Times's journalistic practices and current journalistic issues in general, to appear when he believes they are warranted.\" The job hasn't changed much since Okrent's debut in 2003. He and his three successors have hewed to the format laid out in the beginning. In the outside world, they've been admired and loathed, praised and ridiculed \u2013 as you'd expect, given the prominence of the Times and what I consider to be its indispensable role in our society. (Of the four, I've been a colleague of two; and the current public editor, Arthur S Brisbane, is a friend.) Ombudsmen have never been common in journalism, but for a time, in recent years, there was an upsurge in their number at prominent organizations. They include the Guardian's \"readers' editor\", and similar positions at the Washington Post and National Public Radio. There's even an organization of news-business ombudsfolk, though newspaper ombudsmen are, like their employers, an endangered species. In January of this year, Brisbane and his Washington Post counterpart, Patrick Pexton, published columns and blog posts that led to widespread public comment. One of the commentaries was mine. I suggested that the traditional role of the ombudsman made no sense in a digital age, and offered several suggestions. That piece may have been one reason why, after Brisbane announced he was leaving in September, the Times asked me to apply as his replacement. Someone else will be getting the post, as it turns out, but I am flattered to have been on a short list for this. During the process, I was asked to write a brief memo on how I'd approach the job. What follows is a slightly edited version of what I sent the newspaper. I hope, fervently, that the newspaper will adopt at least some of my recommendations \u2013 and if not the Times, that some news organizations may do so. I wrote: This is a huge opportunity for the Times to rethink and enhance the role. I have no argument with the overall mission. I would, however, make some major changes in methods. Above all, I'd like to be a host and moderator of a civil conversation. I'd do my best to lower the personal profile of the Public Editor and raise the profile of the public \u2013 the audience and those affected by the journalism \u2013 using three main techniques: aggregation, curation and discussion. I would, in particular: \u2022 Aggregate (quote and link to) every thoughtful critique of the organization's work that I could find, and invite readers to analyze and comment on those critiques. I would ask permission to crosspost some of these on the blog. When I thought a critic was wrong, I'd say so. I'd also note when they were, in my view, making fair points. I'd deal with disrespectful critiques on a case-by-case basis, recognizing that sometimes a nasty person can make a good point. \u2022 Create a robust, open forum about the newspaper's work. This would most likely take the form of a traditional bulletin board system where readers could create their own topics, using moderation software that would minimize staff costs while still filtering out the worst trolls. \u2022 Strongly encourage newsroom staff to participate in these conversations. The discussions would still work to some degree without the staff, but with them, the conversations would be vastly better. Of course, some newsroom folks \u2013 Nicholas Kristof is a prime example \u2013 are already engaging with readers in terrific ways; I'd point to those interactions. But my main goal here would be, whenever possible, to have the newsroom explain how it operates and why it does what it does. Serious journalism is hard work, and I don't think readers understand how hard. As I wrote in my most recent book, greater transparency in an honorable news organization will lead your audience to trust you more even if they may believe you less. \u2022 Use the Sunday column mostly as a guide to (with highlights from) the online conversations. \u2022 Work with social media to expand the conversations. This might mean creating new forums in those services, but my inclination would be to steer people to the Times' own forum and blog. \u2022 Make moderation a core feature of these conversations: moderate the discussions and insist on civility and mutual respect. \u2022 Ask the readers how to do all this better. Those are the most essential elements. But I'd also experiment with some ideas that could break new ground in other ways. For advice on how to make these work, I'd pick the brains of some of the folks I've worked with at the Harvard Berkman Center for internet and society and in the broader technology world, as well as people in journalism. Examples (third parties have already created or are creating some of these): \u2022 \"Anonymice Tracker\" \u2013 an open and publicly searchable database of every story quoting anonymous sources, annotated in various ways (for cross-tabular purposes) such as whether a story was based entirely on such sources, as well as quoting the reason(s) given for granting anonymity. \u2022 \"Feedback Zeitgeist\" \u2013 semantic analyses, including visualizations, of correspondents' email and forum/comment posts. I suspect this could be extraordinarily illuminating once we had some data baselines. \u2022 \"Error Notifier\" \u2013 a system whereby anyone who signs up receives an automatic email notification (assuming he or she was actually looked at the original posting or column) of any error in what I've written. \u2022 \"PubEd Submitterator\" \u2013 borrowing the second word from BoingBoing, my favorite blog, which relies on its readers for tips on what to show to the rest of us. The main purpose would be to get help finding the best critiques. \u2022 \"Goof Tracker\" \u2013 a reader-fed database of what they believe are errors of fact and whether they've been corrected. I understand that the newsroom has its own non-public database, and I believe there should be some public listing of this kind. I also recognize the difficulties of making this work, but it's worth a try. You'll have noticed that most of these ideas, as well as my must-do list above, share my conviction that the audience should be an integral part of this process. The readers and other constituencies should participate, not just read, by saying what they know and believe, and by adding data where we can create structured input systems. I want, as well, to stress the word \"experiment\" \u2013 because this would be very much an experiment. In fact, I see this job almost like a startup. Although I'm confident that it would work in a general sense, we'd all have to recognize that some of these ideas would flop. I strongly believe the audience members would be tolerant of failure provided that we: a) got them involved; b) adopted their good ideas; and c) operated as transparently as possible. I hope the Times would be equally forgiving and adaptable. Whomever you select for a new public editor, I'm hoping he or she will adopt many if not most of my suggestions. This is the right time, and the Times is the right organization, to set a new standard in this arena, as it's done in so many others. If these ideas work, you'll be copied; that would be good for journalists and their audiences. No newspaper gets criticized more than the Times, and for good reasons. Your indispensable journalism and authority make you a target for people and organizations that see you as an impediment to their agendas. But your fans are some of your most important critics, too; we cringe when we see the flaws, especially the ones that we believe are self-inflicted wounds. I'm under no illusion that changing the public editor's methods will create peace and harmony with your enemies. But I do believe that the public editor can help engender the kind of conversation that could be seen, and used, by all parties to mutual benefit. It's worth a try.",
