  "content": "A high court judge has refused to lift an order banning journalists naming a woman with whom former bank boss Sir Fred Goodwin had an \"extra-marital affair\". Mr Justice Tugendhat rejected an attempt by the Sun's publisher News Group Newspapers, a News International subsidiary, to have the woman named. She also worked at the Royal Bank of Scotland at the time when Goodwin was chief executive. However, the Sun won a partial victory when Tugendhat said the paper could refer to the job title of the woman who allegedly had an affair with Goodwin. Tugendhat said NGN could also refer to the length of Goodwin's alleged affair with the woman, who also worked at RBS in a senior position. Lawyers for the unnamed woman and NGN argued in court over how detailed the job description the paper will be allowed to publish should be. Tugendhat told them to agree a form of words between them by later on Thursday. The existing high court injunction, which prevents the woman from being named, will remain in force until then. The judge said he was concerned that describing the woman's former role at the bank could lead to other former RBS employees being wrongly named as the person who had an alleged relationship with Goodwin. A privacy injunction had previously prevented the naming of both Goodwin and the woman \u2013 who allegedly had a sexual relationship \u2013 but last month the order was varied to allow him to be named. That came after Lord Stoneham, a Liberal Democrat peer, used parliamentary privilege to refer to the existence of the injunction. He also argued that it was in the public interest for it to be dropped. Stoneham told peers: \"Every taxpayer has a direct public interest in the events leading up to the collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland, so how can it be right for a superinjunction to hide the alleged relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and a senior colleague. \"If true, it would be a serious breach of corporate governance and not even the Financial Services Authority would be allowed to know about it.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
