  "content": "A Nielsen Online report says two thirds of us now use what it calls \"Member Communities,\" which includes both social networks and blogs. MCs now make up \"the fourth most popular category online \u2013 ahead of personal email,\" says Nielsen Online. The others are search, portals, and PC software. Nielsen Online says: Facebook - the world's most popular social network - is visited monthly by three in every 10 people online across the nine markets in which Nielsen tracks social networking use. Facebook has its greatest reach in the UK market (47%). Orkut in Brazil has the largest domestic online reach (70%) of any social network in these markets. The use of MCs grew by more than 10% in the UK last year, but Brazil has the highest penetration (see chart). Nielsen Online says: Among the markets Nielsen measured, penetration of visits to social networks and blogs was highest in Brazil, where 80% of the online audience visits such sites. The share of overall Internet time for which social networks and blogs account is also highest in Brazil, where nearly one in four (23%) of minutes spent online is spent on these sites. Following Brazil was the UK, where over one in six minutes (17%) is spent on these sites. It's easy enough to understand the shift towards social networking from email. Email has a huge spam problem, and efforts to stop spam frequently block legitimate messages. It's quicker to use Twitter, Facebook or an instant messaging service and there's less chance your message will be lost or blocked. But how far Member Communities can go to replace portals and search engines is still to be determined. Facebook is certainly going to have a go, as is Microsoft with its Live Wave 3 profile pages. Also, my experience on Twitter is that I now find more interesting stuff from other users than from most news sources, though it's nowhere near replacing Google as my home page. However, as Nielsen Online points out, the move to using MCs goes along with an increase in mobile phone usage. It says: Mobile is playing an increasingly important role in social networking. Nielsen found UK mobile Web users have the greatest propensity to visit a social network through their handset, with 23% (2 million people) doing so, compared to 19% in the US (10.6 million people). These numbers are a big increase over last year \u2013 249% in the UK and 156% in the US. It isn't a surprise when the use of a different device leads to a preference for a different type of site or service.",
