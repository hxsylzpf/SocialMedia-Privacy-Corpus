  "content": "Former SBS sports reporter Scott McIntyre is taking legal action against the broadcaster after he was sacked for tweeting controversial views about Anzac Day. His lawyers, Maurice Blackburn, filed a discrimination claim on Monday with the Fair Work Commission. The experienced football journalist was fired 12 hours after posting a series of tweets on Anzac Day that the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, described as \"despicable\" on Twitter the same evening. McIntyre began his tweets on the centenary of the Gallipoli landings by criticising what he said was the \"cultification [sic] of an imperialist invasion\". \"Remembering the summary execution, widespread rape and theft committed by these brave Anzacs in Egypt, Palestine and Japan,\" he said. Turnbull has admitted communicating his dismay about McIntyre's posts to the managing director of SBS, Michael Ebeid, the night before the SBS staffer was sacked. Ebeid later said McIntyre's remarks were inappropriate and disrespectful, and that they breached the broadcaster's code of conduct and social media policy. McIntyre's lawyers are claiming SBS breached its policies, including its code of conduct, and did not follow due process when the broadcaster dismissed McIntyre less than 24 hours after he posted his views on Twitter. \"The case is not about whether Mr McIntyre's opinions are correct or not, Maurice Blackburn spokeswoman Amanda Tattam said in a statement. \"It will focus on whether the views expressed by Mr McIntyre constituted political opinion and whether SBS terminated his employment for expressing these views. Section 351 of the Fair Work Act protects employees from adverse action by their employer (including sacking) if they express political opinion. \"It is alleged SBS took action without a proper investigation and consideration of all relevant issues. It will be contended that Mr McIntyre had an unblemished work record and if a proper process had been followed, he would still be employed in his chosen career. Turnbull has denied he influenced SBS to sack McIntyre. \"Mr McIntyre, as a private citizen, is entitled to express his political views, but in his capacity as a reporter employed by SBS he has to comply with, and face the consequences of ignoring, the SBS social media protocol \u2026 a number of provisions of which were breached by him with his offensive tweets,\" Turnbull wrote on his blog. \"The management of SBS, however, not the government, is responsible for staffing decisions at SBS.\" Ken Shipp, director of sport at SBS, told staff McIntyre was sacked for disobeying an order to delete the posts. SBS said on Monday: \"As this is now a legal matter SBS is unable to comment at this time.\" McIntyre will be represented by Maurice Blackburn and barristers Michael Lee SC and Siobhan Keating. McIntyre was unavailable for comment.",
