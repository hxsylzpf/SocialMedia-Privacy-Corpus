The Local Government Association of Queensland last week launched the LG App store. It works by curating a catalogue of apps that can be useful to local authorities, apps that, for example, help them communicate better with the public. The new store is essentially a way to assist councils to sift more effectively through the millions of apps available. Two of the best The LG App store features apps designed to streamline processes in large and small authorities. \u2022 InspectionApps is a Queensland company that has developed an app to improve the productivity of local government for daily tasks. The app replaces a paper checklist and digital camera with software. It allows people to use their phones to record inspection data, whether online or off. \u2022 Go2Guides is a national app designed to inform residents and visitors about important events, attractions and announcements in a region.It's main aim is to raise awareness about local business and places of interest to promote the development of towns and regions. What apps are popular with Australian councils? The Local Government Association of South Australia has worked to develop a state-wide application that gives information to residents about local services. It was prompted by confusion among residents about when bins and recycling were collected. The My Local Services App offers interactive access to council services and information. It allows councils to direct message ratepayers and inform residents about local news, events and issues. The app recognises where the user is and provides people with access to council information, answering frequently asked questions relating to council services. Key information, including bin pickups, waste collections and recycling information, is readily available, as well as map locations of local libraries, parks and council events, road closures, rates information and payment details, dog registration and fire bans. To date, 22 South Australian councils haveused the app. Last year in Queensland the government introduced GraffitiSTOP, a mobile app that allows the public to report a vandalised property to thecorrect department. Citizens are able to report graffiti on the spot, pinpointing their exact location to assist councils in their removal. Elsewhere in Australia, Sydney will soon open its planning decisions to the masses, with consultation apps for citizens to send feedback to the council directly from the sites of proposed developments. The development of Sydney's new app will build on the existing dedicated feedback Sydney Your Say website, providing residents with a place to find out about projects, share ideas and engage with the views of others. Why don't councils just build their own apps? The risk of councils building their own app from scratch is that they may find themselves bogged down by unnecessary maintenance costs. Not to mention the cost of building it, which can be quite substantial. What's more, like everything else in the world of technology, there's always going to be someone out there doing something better, faster and more advanced than you are. The LGAQ encourage councils to use apps but advise buying them \"off the shelf\" or partnering with software developers as it can be more benefitial than going it alone. The future of apps in Australia While a council as big and as mobile friendly as Sydney can afford this citizen engagement driven approach, it remains to be seen if mobile apps will evolve to replace community forums and feedback forms in smaller regional and rural councils.  A recent report by the LGAQ found that while improving productivity, efficiency and performance were high priorities for 92% of councils, only 27% were strategic in measuring and setting targets against these goals. According to social media agency We Are Social, Australians are spending an average of nearly two hours on their smartphone every day. The key test for Australian councils is whether they can translate the interest and feedback generated by apps into something which aligns with their strategic goals? With latest statistics indicating that 90% of Australian smartphone users search for local information via their phone, it looks like we won't need to wait long to find out.
