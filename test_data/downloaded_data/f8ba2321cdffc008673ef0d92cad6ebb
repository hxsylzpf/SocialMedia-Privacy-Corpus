  "content": "\u2022 Remember Mark Papermaster, the IBM executive whose defection to Apple sparked litigation between the two companies? He finally started working for Cupertino last Friday, according to CNet. At the same time, Bob Drebin has also joined Apple, more than a year a year after leaving his job at AMD - and Amazon has bought Lexcycle, the company behind the iPhone ebook application Stanza. \u2022 Anyone worried about the disappearance of GeoCities may have a new hero in Jason Scott, who - along with the Archive Team - is trying to download as much of the information on the service before it's closed later this year. So far? 200,000 sites and counting. \u2022 And anyone with a little Twitter schadenfreude will appreciate Tweeting Too Hard - a repository for some of the most self-important messages out there. Lots of gems on display, but currently top is Leto75's way-too-much-information message from last month (I'll leave its contents a surprise). You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
