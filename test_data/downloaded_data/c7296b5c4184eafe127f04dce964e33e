  "content": "The UK's Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre today claimed its new Facebook application has prompted 211 new reports of suspicious online behaviour. Facebook, which has 26 million UK monthly unique users, proposed the app after it refused to introduce Ceop's reporting button to every profile on the site, and it has now been downloaded 55,000 times since it was launched on 12 July. But online safety campaigners are concerned that the spat between Ceop and Facebook, and the preoccupation with the so-called \"panic button\", is distracting the agency from more wide-ranging efforts to tackle online grooming and abuse. A spokeswoman for Ceop said the agency is keen to move the debate on and emphasise its work in other areas, including discussing a browser plug-in with Microsoft, Mozilla and Google. She added that the 211 reports through the Facebook app would all be classified as very serious offences, such as sexual grooming. Of Ceop's cases for the 12 months up to February this year, 38% or 2,391 reports came through the ClickCeop button. Alex Nagle, Ceop's head of harm reduction, said there is no single solution to online safety. \"The UK has adopted a holistic and multi-sector approach which combines education and awareness with a child-victim focus,\" he added. \"Many of these were because young people had the ability to easily report directly \u2013 from the online environment they inhabit \u2013 those who are behaving inappropriately towards them. We cannot prevent all instances of harm to our children in the real or the virtual world, but because of the efforts of many stakeholders the UK is an inherently safer place for them to be online.\" Facebook's European director of policy, Richard Allan, said the social networking website is looking at other ways to support online safety, including the \"site integrity\" project which aims to identify suspicious activity and fake profiles at its multilingual support centres. \"There is a lot more to explore in the use of social media platforms not only in the distribution of centralised safety messages,\" he said. \"We are keen to share expertise with Ceop, recognising their expertise with child safety issues, but also our huge expertise in managing websites and enabling users to seek help when they need it, and in developing a platform which people can use to share information and help each other.\" The home secretary, Theresa May, has proposed folding Ceop into a new National Crime Agency. Staff have since been concerned the move could mean job cuts and less power, while the government has been evaluating the performance of the agency. Mark Williams Thomas, an independent expert in child safety, praised Ceop for raising the profile of online safety but raised fresh concerns about the priorities of the agency. \"Ceop has done an incredibly good job in online policing by raising awareness of grooming and predatory paedophiles online,\" he said. \"But this recent spat with Facebook about the report button has lost the focus on what really makes the internet safer for children. One of our biggest concerns is that parents have been put off using Facebook, which is actually one of the safest sites on the internet, and driven onto more dangerous sites.\" Williams-Thomas criticised the Ceop reporting system which, rather than being a panic button with an immediate response, is an 11-stage process that requires children to submit their full name, address and contact information and agree to be contacted by a policeman at their home. \"The idea of a reporting button is vital but the current button is inefficient and puts children off,\" he said. Analysis by another independent safety expert, who did not wish to be named, reinforced those concerns, saying children had needed to ask teachers to help them report problems. \"This is not a problem where this type of relationship exists, but for an individual without the necessary support networks it could be a real issue,\" this source said.",
