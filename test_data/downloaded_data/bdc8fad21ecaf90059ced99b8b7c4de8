  "content": "The editor of the Daily Mail made a passionate case against the imposition of a privacy law, arguing it would be used by the rich and powerful to curb the influence of a free press. Declaring that he had to stand for election in front of his readers every day, Paul Dacre attacked MPs for getting rid of the parliamentary watchdog Elizabeth Filkin when she got too tough. He also attacked the BBC as \"a state monopoly\", which he would argue \"in my more cynical moments\" had been \"colonised by New Labour. Newspapers are entirely different. They have no monopoly whatsoever\". Mr Dacre, editor-in-chief at Associated Newspapers, told the select committee for culture media and sport that self regulation of the press was the best way of serving the interests of ordinary people. The publicist Max Clifford told the committee earlier that he believed Britain had the \"most savage press in the world\", but Mr Dacre said it had a positive influence on the democratic health of the country. \"We have a very good press in this country, one that I am very proud of. It is a press that has its faults, but I don't think it's savage,\" he added. \"It can occasionally be inaccurate, it can occasionally be insensitive, it can occasionally act in an overly competitive fashion, but it also has great strengths.\" In a session that ended at 7pm last night, he told the committee, which is investigating the merits of privacy legislation, that the press could justify giving the public what they wanted to read. \"I don't have a five-year term of office, I have to go out and persuade the public every day, often in the rain, to spend 40p. The Daily Mail does that by producing a brand of serious journalism mixed with celebrity gossip and human interest stories that allows us to have a huge circulation.\" An adjudication against a newspaper by the press complaints commission (PCC) was taken extremely seriously, he said. \"It's a very shameful moment - too often, our competitive newspapers make great hay with it.\" He said the commission, which resolves complaints in an average of 31 days, is a \"quick and easy\" method of redress, provided as a free service to everyone regardless of their background. He rejected a suggestion that it should be given the power to impose fines, or take evidence in person from complainants and journalists. \"Justice delayed is justice denied,\" he said. Mr Clifford had told the committee that the PCC did not provide an adequate means of redress for ordinary people who found themselves in the public eye. He claimed to have acted on behalf of a number of readers who came to him with problems, but said most readers did not have the ability to complain direct to editors in the way that he was able to do, on behalf of his well-known clients. He jokingly suggested a network of \"Max Clifford associates\" around the country to act on behalf of maligned readers. But Robin Esser, the managing editor at the Daily Mail, said the PCC had \"even better access to editors than the great Max Clifford\".",
