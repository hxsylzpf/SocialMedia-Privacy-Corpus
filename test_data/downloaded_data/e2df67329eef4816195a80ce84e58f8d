  "content": "Asperger's syndrome is characterised by a strong desire for order and justice, but unfortunately it also means that people born with it struggle with non-verbal communication and social interaction. Without support and understanding, it causes them to be picked out as \"different\"; rejected, bullied, written off and left behind. Which of course affects their self-esteem and life outcome. Imagine being dropped off in the middle of a foreign country, unable to understand or speak the language of the land? There are no classes to attend and no translators. After a few months or years, most people learn to communicate \u2013 almost on subconscious level \u2013 and do so quite well. But that's just language: words and grammar, a system with rules that eventually can be understood. With Asperger's syndrome, non-verbal communication will always be a hit-and-miss scenario and even those of us academically educated to the level of professors still have to make an effort to deconstruct non-verbal communication \u2013 such as body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, reading \"between the lines\" and decoding the intent of others, because it will never come naturally to us. With support and understanding, even with an accidental mentor or two along the way we can fast-track that learning and at least not be \"forever lost in the foreign land without a guide or a hope in hell\". We can start communicating better and feel as if we finally belong with other humans. Word recognition \u2013 which autistic people mostly rely on \u2013 comprises just 8% of all communication, meaning that the remaining 92% is out of our reach. That explains why Gary McKinnon \u2013 a man accused of hacking into Nasa and US military computers and currently fighting extradition to America \u2013 was so naive and trusting. He admitted blindly what he did and didn't do and did not have a lawyer present when he was first arrested. And he's now facing decades in a US jail if convicted. And even before there is a trial, he'll have to stay in prison for years, without bail. McKinnon may have made a mistake, but it would not have happened if he had had better support for his autism and obsessive behaviour. Even after his official diagnosis, he has yet to receive any professional support. The way the law stands today, it is not just McKinnon. The same could happen to any one of our autistic children \u2013 even to my son \u2013 should they get obsessed with \"the wrong thing\" because they were trying to cope as best they could \"in the foreign land of communication\", all by themselves. Yet people on the autistic spectrum can be very good at certain things like technology, art, music, computer programming, languages \u2013 anything system-based. With the right support we can and want to become productive members of society. Unfortunately, that support is currently lacking, often non-existent. Many autistics rely on peer support and accidental mentoring from good people who care. But what happens to us is still a lottery with pretty poor odds. Things could have been so much better. Discrimination on the basis of someone's height, age, race, sexual orientation, accent, social status and disability is against the law: we all innately know that it is morally wrong. If you took a white stick away from a blind person or a wheelchair from someone who could not walk, society would be outraged and rightly so. But autism is an invisible disability and people on the autistic spectrum are subjected to inhumane treatment and are bullied and rejected every day in Britain. It is unacceptable. McKinnon was born with Asperger's syndrome, the \"invisible\" disability. He was an intelligent child who always felt like an outsider and desperately wanted to belong but could not. He found learning easy but social interaction difficult and was often misunderstood, subsequently losing jobs. McKinnon badly wanted to belong but, apprehensive of human interaction that so often went wrong, he locked himself in his bedroom, away from the world and tried to earn his place in society by being \"useful\". McKinnon embarked on discovering information about free energy that he believed was being hidden from the people. Asperger's syndrome and years of no support absolutely affected McKinnon and caused him tremendous anxiety and stress, triggering coping strategies which resulted in extreme obsessions that were impossible to control without outside help. McKinnon started to live in a world of his own. His obsession happened to be the search for alien technology and evidence of UFO's, via his computer. Autism is the last frontier in the fight for equality of all human beings. In the current difficult economic climate, it makes logical sense to support people on the autistic spectrum to become independent, productive members of society. Instead of persecuting them for having a disability they were born with, helping and nurturing their natural talents, to encourage them to feel accepted. That would be for the benefit of all.",
