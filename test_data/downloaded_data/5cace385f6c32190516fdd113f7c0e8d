Conroy announced plans in December that would force Australian internet service providers to ban access to any websites listed as \"inappropriate.\" If implemented, the policy would make Australia one of the strictest internet regulators in the world. The move \u2013 which attracted widespread condemnation, not least from the majority of potentially affected ISPs, including Google and Yahoo \u2013 has now been put on hold for another year. \"Some sections of the community have expressed concern about whether the range of material included in the RC [restricted content] category... correctly reflects current community standards,\" Conroy said. \"As the government's mandatory ISP filtering policy is underpinned by the strength of our classification system, the legal obligation to commence mandatory ISP filtering will not be imposed until the review is completed. \"The public needs to have confidence that the URLs on the list, and the process by which they get there, is independent, rigorous, free from interference or influence and enables content and site owners access to appropriate review mechanisms.\" The proposed filter would ban access to a regularly updated list of sites that include child pornography, sexual violence, and detailed instructions on crime, drug use and terrorist acts. Three of the country's largest telecommunications companies today said they would voluntarily implement a child pornography filter, a move that would take several months to put in place. Karim Temsamani, managing director of Google Australia and New Zealand, welcomed the review, but said concern remains about the plans. \"Our primary concern had always been that the scope of the proposed filter is far too broad,\" Temsamani said in a statement. \"It goes way beyong child sexual abuse material and would block access to important online information for all Australians.\" Simon Sheikh, chief executive of online activist group GetUp!, told the Sydney Morning Herald: \"A delay is not enough \u2013 the government needs to announce that they will either scrap, or change the policy to an opt-in model, so that Australians themselves can judge how best to protect their children online. \"When it comes to protection of our children online we need investment in education, home-based filters and the federal police. These investments will better equip parents to protect their children at home, and better equip police to combat the issues at their source.\" More than 127,000 people have signed up to a protest launched by group.",
