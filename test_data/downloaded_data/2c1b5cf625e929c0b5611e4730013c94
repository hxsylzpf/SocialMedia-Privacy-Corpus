  "content": "The New Yorker does not have a reputation for X-rated material, it's fair to say. So the venerable magazine was understandably surprised when it was temporarily banned by Facebook for violating its community standards on nudity and sex on Monday. The reason? This innocuous-looking drawing of a naked couple sitting underneath a tree, with the caption \"Well, it was original\". The New Yorker says it was banned by Facebook because its cartoon included a drawing of female nipples \u2013 or, in the words of the social network, \"female nipple bulges\" \u2013 which are strictly banned on the site. Kids these days, eh? Bob Mankoff, the New Yorker's cartoon editor, has taken Facebook to task on his blog over so-called \"Nipplegate\". He writes: \"Rather than fight the battle of the bulge, let's point out, that while female nipple bulging, or FNB for short, is a potentially serious problem, with as yet no known cure, it also has no known victims. That is, unless you count freedom of expression, common sense, and humour.\" Would you Adam and Eve it?",
