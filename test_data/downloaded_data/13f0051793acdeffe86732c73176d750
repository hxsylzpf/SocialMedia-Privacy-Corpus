  "content": "A high court judge today refused to grant David and Victoria Beckham an order that would have prevented their former nanny from making any further comment about them to the media. Mr Justice Eady said the publication of information about the Beckhams \"on such a wide scale\" made it futile for the couple to try to gag Abbie Gibson. \"There is no black and white line as far as personal information is concerned and what is in the public domain and what is protected by law. \"It is not necessarily the case that because personal information is already in the public domain it is beyond the laws of privacy. \"But the publication of this material on such a wide scale makes it futile to prevent further publication.\" The decision means Ms Gibson is free to appear on television and repeat the claims she made about the Beckhams' marriage in the News of the World on Sunday. Ms Gibson had already agreed not to disclose any further \"confidential\" information about the couple's marriage pending trial or further court order. She had also agreed to freeze the \u00a3125,000 she received from the News of the World for her story. At a high court hearing this morning Hugh Tomlinson QC, for the Beckhams, said the couple were seeking to \"bring down the shutters\" on any statement of any kind by Ms Gibson that related to them. This would have covered taking or providing any photographs or film footage, providing any information, making any comment for the purposes of publication, giving any interview, writing any article or book, appearing in any TV programme or film concerning the couple or any person, firm or company associated with them. Making his submissions, Mr Tomlinson said: \"The whole purpose of this is to try and prevent the claimants' private life being aired in public in an unauthorised way by a treacherous employee.\" He said Ms Gibson had signed a confidentiality agreement four times. \"That is what this claimant signed and that is what she is bound to,\" he said. \"She is the person who signed the agreement and was their confidante and intimate for two years. It is uniquely hurtful and distressing to have the person who until the end of March this year was sitting around the breakfast table with them and their children discussing their daily lives repeat that information.\" But Mark Warby QC, making his submissions for Ms Gibson, asked the judge \"how many bites of the cherry\" a claimant was supposed to have. Last weekend's allegations about the couple's private life came after their lawyers failed to win a last-minute injunction on the basis that Ms Gibson was in breach of a confidentiality contract. They argued that her contract included an obligation not to speak about the Beckhams' private lives but Mr Justice Langley ruled that the newspaper could publish. Mr Warby argued today that the proper route for the Beckhams was to appeal against that ruling, saying the couple were trying to secure an order that went beyond what his side was prepared to offer \"out of the goodness of our hearts\". And he said granting such an order would prevent his client from responding to any allegations made about her by the Beckhams. \"The position now is that injunctions are being sought from you to shut the door after this particular series of horses has bolted after the weekend, to put the Beckhams in a position where they can have their say in the media while tying the hands of my client in such a way that she would be extremely hampered, if not completely prevented, from giving any form of response other than a blanket denial.\" Ms Gibson's lawyer, Niri Shanmuganathan of Taylor Wessing, said the nanny had won the most important point of the day. \"She's now able to talk about things in the public domain even if what she says involves a disclosure in breach of her confidentiality agreement,\" he said. \"We also succeeded in overturning clauses that would have prevented her from commenting on issues that weren't even confidential.\" The News of the World accused the Beckhams of using their legal and PR teams to \"hunt\" headlines. \"Abbie told her full story to us last week. Therefore she had no reason not to give the undertakings she gave today,\" the paper said. \"This issue could and should have been resolved outside the courts. Instead, yet again, the Beckhams' energetic PR and legal teams have hunted headlines on behalf of their clients.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
