  "content": "It's nice to know the phrase \"only in Washington\" applies to fiction as well as reality. In the hours leading up to the launch of the second season of the Netflix drama House of Cards, former DC mayor and current city council member Marion Barry Jr engaged in a marathon Twitter conversation with a parody account for Francis \"Frank\" Underwood. Underwood, the House majority whip in the show, is portrayed by the actor Kevin Spacey. Underwood is not an actual person \u2013 not that that has stopped ABC's political Sunday talk show, This Week with George Stephanopoulos, lining up Spacey for its main interview tomorrow \u2013 but since when does that matter? The two discussed love, ribs and vague sexual innuendos. Here's the exchange in its entirety. It's almost cute, until you consider the fact that every resident in Washington pays about $32.41 for their city council. Awkward. (This is probably what Underwood is referring to in the tweet above. Or this. Or this. Who can say, really?)",
