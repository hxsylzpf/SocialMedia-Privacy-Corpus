  "content": "Former presenter of Channel 4's 11 O'Clock Show Iain Lee has a new gig \u2013 he will begin presenting the breakfast show on BBC local radio station, Three Counties Radio, next month. Lee is no stranger to the people of Beds, Herts and Bucks, having guested on the station in July, and has previously presented shows on Absolute Radio \u2013 which he left last year \u2013 and London stations LBC and Xfm. Word has it his new local radio show isn't as whacky as some of his Absolute and LBC (and podcast) stuff, which will delight and appal his audience in probably roughly equal measure. Clearly a subscriber to the radio maxim that you should never use 100 words when one will do, Lee had an economical response to a chap on Twitter who suggested he was a real-life Alan Partridge: \"Bellend.\" RI:SE and shine, everybody!",
