Brian Whelan, the editor of Yahoo Ireland, and one of the first bloggers to accuse Hari of plagiarism, noted a near identical use of language in two interviews given by Gareth Thomas, the Welsh gay rugby player, first to Attitude magazine editor Matthew Todd and subsequently to Hari in the Independent in January 2010. Whelan cites this passage from Hari's Independent interview: \"For the first 35 years of his life, Thomas tried to bury his sexuality. He confides: 'I used to visualise it as a little ball. I know it's crazy, but I'd imagine this little ball in my stomach and I'd have an encounter with a man and the ball would just be there. Then from that day to the next encounter, be it one month, two months, three months, all I could see was this gold liquid dripping out of the ball. That was the real me seeping out ... I didn't want it to be there. I'd walk along cliffs and think it would be much easier if I just fell off.'\" Although the original article in Attitude was not immediately available online, sections were reprinted by the Wales Online site \u2013 including a passage of quotes attributed to Thomas, which after an initial sentence that is different, contains a block of almost identical quotes. The passage, as recorded by Wales Online follows: \"He said: 'I tried to bottle it up, but I could feel it, it was there in my stomach. I know this sounds crazy but this shows how much stress I was under, I used to visualise it as a little ball. I'd imagine this ball in my stomach and I'd have an encounter with a man and the ball would just be there. Then from that day until the next encounter, be it one month, two months, three months, all I could see was this gold liquid dripping out of the ball. That was the real me seeping out...'.\" At this point the quotes in the two articles diverge. Whelan \u2013 who was one of the first bloggers to accuse Hari of plagiarism, and has since found other examples \u2013 concludes Hari is \"taking other people's interviews and passing them off as his own\". Elsewhere, Guy Walters posting in the New Statesman, wrote about an interview Johann Hari conducted with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in May 2006, and noted similarities between quotes used in the interview such as: \"'I realized at that moment that I was saying goodbye to life,' he says, looking away. 'So it is possible that, after surviving, one has been a bit imbued with that sense ever since, no?'\" which were almost identical to quotes given to Jon Lee Anderson in the New Yorker in 2001. Anderson's piece of five years earlier contains the following passage and quotes attributed to Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 identical to the Hari interview of five years later bar the absence of a single sub-clause: \"'I realized at that moment that I was saying goodbye to life,' Ch\u00e1vez said. 'So it is possible that one has been a bit ... imbued with that . . . ever since, no?'\". After pointing out other examples regarding the Ch\u00e1vez interview, Walters concludes: \"It now appears that Mr Hari has made quite a habit of pinching quotes given to other interviewers, and claiming that they were given to him.\" However, in his column, published on Wednesday morning in the Independent, Hari said that it was wrong to accuse him of plagiarism. He described the allegation as \"totally false\" and said that he only tidied up quotes. \"If (for example) a person doesn't speak very good English, or is simply unclear, it may be better to quote their slightly broken or garbled English than to quote their more precise written work,\" he wrote, but conceded that this was \"an error of judgment\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
