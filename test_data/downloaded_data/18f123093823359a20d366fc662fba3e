  "content": "There are some things a male music producer shouldn't ever do. Don't have a meltdown halfway through a set at a huge music event with the eyes of the world on you (hello, David Guetta), don't single out a fan for abuse while hundreds of smartphones are able to record your diatribe (hi, Calvin Harris) and don't suggest female pop stars need bigger butts on micro-blogging sites. But this last faux pas is exactly what DJ and producer Diplo committed on Wednesday night on Twitter. In a glib tweet to his followers, the MIA and Madonna producer \u2013 who is known for the Twitter call out #expressyourself where fans take pictures of themselves twerking \u2013 said, \"Someone should make a kickstarter to get taylor swift a booty\". This being the internet, some of his fans took the suggestion seriously and created the Get Taylor Swift A Booty Kickstarter campaign. Fortunately,Taylor Swift's friend Lorde was on hand to provide an appropriately caustic response. No doubt the Get Diplo A Bigger Penis Kickstarter is in the works. Meanwhile, the latest song from the Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1 soundtrack, which Lorde curated, has leaked. Meltdown is a collaboration between Lorde, Haim, Pusha T, Q-Tip and Belgian dance-pop act Stromae.",
