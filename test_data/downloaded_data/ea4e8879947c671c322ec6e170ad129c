As his government took the highly unusual step of issuing a formal rebuttal of accusations made by the Mail on Sunday, a source close to the chancellor indicated that further steps were likely, despite the view of British legal experts that the German court's ruling was unenforceable in Britain. \"I would reckon that there will be another round,\" said the source. \"You have to accept that there is an urge to get to know politicians and that this can spill over from the public into the private sphere. But that is no reason whatsoever to publish lies, and if that is the case then one will take action.\" Asked if the chancellor was angry, the source said: \"Yes. He is.\" Mr Schr\u00f6der's lawyer announced last week that he had won a temporary injunction from a Hamburg court ordering the Mail on Sunday not to repeat any of six points referred to in a story earlier this month which linked the married chancellor to a well-known German television interviewer. The penalty for ignoring the ban was set at \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3164,000). The paper yesterday launched a two-page counterblast that included photographs of the interviewer on both pages. In an editorial headlined \"Sorry, Herr Schr\u00f6der but you don't rule Britain ... at least, not yet,\" the chancellor was described as a \"vain politician\" who \"cannot bear criticism\". Alongside was a \"message to our German readers\", written in German. It said: \"The Mail on Sunday will not be censored by federal chancellor Schr\u00f6der. Call the number below if you know any stories that Mr Schr\u00f6der would find embarrassing and that the German press ought to be publishing.\" In a statement, the German government's spokesman said: \"We reject the allegation of censorship. This was a sovereign and independent decision of the German courts. The allegations will rebound on those who have made them.\" The chancellor's Hamburg-based lawyer, Michael Nesselhauf, was said last night to be considering how best to react. \"I'm sure that he has the newspaper on his table and that he will do what is necessary to confront these unsubstantiated allegations and rumours\", said a senior adviser to Mr Schr\u00f6der. The tussle between one of Europe's political heavy-hitters and a British newspaper represents a clash of legal and journalistic cultures. Germany has some of the world's strictest privacy laws, courts that issue in junctions against newspapers first and listen to their arguments later, and a public which - as in most other continental European countries - is relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians. Polls show that only a minority of Germans see a link between politicians' private behaviour and their public actions. The kind of kiss-and-tell revelations that most recently troubled John Major have rarely surfaced fully in the German press. By contrast, the Mail on Sunday is bound by no privacy rules and is a robust member of Britain's mass circulation press that largely regards politicians' private lives as fair game. But after four marriages, the latest to a woman 19 years his junior, Mr Schr\u00f6der's love life is inevitably a subject of special curiosity, even within his own country. He is already widely dubbed the \"Audi chancellor\" - the trademark rings of the German car symbolising his four wedding rings. The claims that he has been cheating on his current wife come at a time when he is already under fire from the opposition, and large sections of the press and public. A parliamentary investigation has been launched into claims that he had deliberately misled the country about the true state of Germany's public finances before polling day. At the same time, Mr Schr\u00f6der's decision to try to gag a foreign newspaper raises serious questions about jurisdiction within the European Union which the Eurosceptic Mail on Sunday yesterday played for all they were worth. \"The European Union is entering a new stage of its life which its leaders hope to create a 'Common Legal Space'\", the paper's editorial said. \"As the EU expands into ever more shadowy and unstable parts of Europe, we will not see English liberties carried into Slovakia or Latvia, but Slovakian practices brought here and Latvian judges pronouncing on our rights.\" Tomorrow, the chancellor faces a challenge on another front when two German newspapers contest an earlier temporary injunction granted to Mr Schr\u00f6der ordering them not to repeat reports that his marriage was in difficulties. A lawyer for the papers was quoted last week as saying that he would ask the court to call as witnesses the chancellor's wife, Doris Schr\u00f6der-Kopf, and his bodyguards. Ms Schr\u00f6der-Kopf noted last week in an interview with Stern magazine that the chancellor is watched over day and night by his police escorts so any dalliance by him would soon be known to them. His wife no longer spends most of her time in the Berlin chancellery but instead lives in Mr Schr\u00f6der's home town of Hanover. In articles published at the end of last year, an east German daily, the M\u00e4rkische Oderzeitung, and another regional paper, S\u00fcdwestpresse, reported claims that when the chancellor returned to Hanover at the weekends, he did not stay at the marital home. Ms Schr\u00f6der-Kopf last week denounced the claims as \"sheer madness\". She said: \"He spends the night with me and we are very happy with things that way.\" But Johannes Weberling, the Berlin lawyer hired by the two newspapers to challenge the injunction, said: \"My clients feel they have reported in a serious fashion and they want to fight\".",
