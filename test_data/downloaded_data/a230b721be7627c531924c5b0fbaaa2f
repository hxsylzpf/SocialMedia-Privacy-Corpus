  "content": "We're delighted to announce that we have partnered with Pinterest on their launch of article pins. Pinterest is a tool for collecting and organising things online. People use Pinterest to create fashion wishlists, find travel and cultural inspiration, discover new recipes and collect and save articles to read. Pinterest's new article pins make saving and discovering articles on Pinterest much clearer and easier, and will encourage pinners to click through to read articles in full. From today, Guardian articles on Pinterest will be much easier to recognise, with much more information on the pin, including an image, the headline, author and story description, with a clear call-to-action to encourage users to read the content on the publisher's website. Regular Guardian users will have noticed that we have recently been trialling Pinterest share buttons on some of our articles and galleries to enable our users to start saving and sharing articles to their boards. This is already proving popular in areas such as Life and style. Here at the Guardian we are always keen to trial new things, especially if they allow new users to discover the Guardian's great journalism and online content. This is an interesting experiment to help us understand how Pinterest could enable us to deliver even more engagement with our content, so feel free to start pinning and sharing our articles on this great platform. As always, we welcome your feedback in the comments below.",
