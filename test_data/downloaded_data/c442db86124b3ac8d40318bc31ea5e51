The soft-drinks giant, which has come in for heavy criticism after running a racy Facebook campaign for the Dr Pepper brand, has told the agency that it must stop all advertising work on Coca-Cola brands until a decision is reached on whether to terminate the relationship. \"We have stopped all our ongoing work with [digital agency] Lean Mean Fighting Machine and are currently reviewing our relationship with the agency,\" said a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola GB. The company was forced to pull a Facebook campaign for its Dr Pepper brand, in which users allowed their Facebook status box to be taken over by the company. Users could choose from three levels of \"embarrassingness\", and the contract with Facebook stipulated that all content had to be moderated by Coke before going live. However, the promotion backfired when a Mumsnet user saw her 14-year-old daughter's Facebook page \u2013 or rather the Dr Pepper campaign she had joined \u2013 had been updated with a message that made direct reference to a hardcore pornographic film. Coca-Cola apologised and announced an investigation into its promotion procedures. It said the offending line had been approved by them, without them realising its true meaning. Other examples of embarrassing statuses used as part of the promotion included: \"Lost my special blankie. How will I go sleepies?\", \"What's wrong with peeing in the shower?\" and \"Never heard of it described as cute before.\" Coca-Cola is now reviewing its relationship with the agency behind the campaign, Lean Mean Fighting Machine. The move could result in the agency losing one of advertising's juiciest accounts \u2013 a bitter blow, especially as it had just won the digital ad account for Coca-Cola's Coke Zero brand. Dr Pepper is no stranger to flirting with social media controversy in its marketing activity, which uses the strapline \"What's the worst that can happen?\". For April Fool's Day the brand launched a push on Chatroulette featuring a cheerleader. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
