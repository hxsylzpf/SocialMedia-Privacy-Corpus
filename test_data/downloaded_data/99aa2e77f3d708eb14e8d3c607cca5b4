  "content": "I hardly ever get to say this, but when it comes to faceswapping, I was an early adopter. I have proof. In late 2011, I posted a Facebook album called SWAPPED FACES, which consisted of 36 pictures of friends and family with their mugs superimposed on each other. As meme pioneering went, it was pretty impeccable. Founded on the app iSwap Faces, it featured your classic male-female and child-adult switches, and took an early, improvised step towards the more surreal variations that have lately become commonplace with a particularly uncanny shot of my friend Ross holding a dog, or, at least, my friend dog holding a Ross. Commenters were quick to recognise the importance of my work. \"This is just one of the best things I have ever seen,\" one said. \"Again, thank you.\" \"Holy fuck,\" said someone else. \"I'm speechless. The taller one is particularly revolting.\" In the intervening years, maybe frustrated at a broader cultural failure to seize on this moment and run with it, or maybe conscious that it wasn't always cool to interrupt two people having a good time and make an image of them looking unsettlingly awful, I let faceswapping slide. I didn't want to just be known as the faceswap guy. I had other strings to my bow, apps that made people look older or hairier or otherwise a bit shonky, and the world seemed more able to appreciate those contributions. My own life was changing, too. I turned 30. I got a new job. For a while, I had a cat, which never seemed amenable to the practice. Faceswapping, I supposed, was behind me. Lately, though, as I've sought to establish my own personal brand on Instagram and discovered that the technology has caught up with my vision, I've felt the tug of facial reassignment once again. And this time around, it seems, you idiots have caught up. Faceswapping (we should, I think, write it as one word) is everywhere now. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has given it a whirl, and there are any number of marvellous shots of Kanye West morphed onto his daughter North, being coddled by his wife-mother Kim Kardashian. Faceswap Live, a definitive app that has revolutionised the field with its ability to record videos of people with each others' features, is the number-one paid app on the iPhone; MSQRD, a twist on the form that superimposes celebrities, animals and Iron Man helmets, is number three in the free category. People younger than me do it with a Snapchat filter. (iSwap Faces is barely a player any more, which I guess is how it goes.) Viral content websites have published ever more compilations of the best work out there, from men with babies for noses to people singing Drake's I'm the Plug with the face of a plug, work that makes me feel as if I finally have peers. Last week, a friend posted a link to one of these compilations on my Facebook wall. \"You made this happen,\" he wrote. I felt vindication, and remembered that fake Gandhi quote: \"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\" Compared with some seers of the age, even I was pretty late to the party. Knowyourmeme.com traces the practice back to the early 2000s, and points out that the website Something Awful published a set of pictures entitled Swap Grandparents and Babies Heads! in 2004. In those days, of course, you had to have Photoshop and a computer to make it work, which was a pretty high barrier to entry that has since been shattered. Knowyourmeme points to Google trends data that shows an explosion of interest in the last couple of months: now we can swap faces anywhere, instantly, and we understand that it can be funny to do so with a plug. Still, from the prehistory to contemporary practice, the dominant themes have remained the same: women sprouting chin beards that make them look like terrible backing dancers, men with haircuts that make them look like adult Warhammer fans (or, with surprising frequency and precision, the X Factor's Wagner), everyone discovering that the relatively orderly composition of their features relies heavily on the size and width of their own faces as opposed to their friends'. Deadening though it can be to ponder why something's funny, in this case it's reasonably simple: we all look absurd, and we are all very relieved to stand in front of the mirror later and reassure ourselves that it was only a bad dream. I suspect it also appeals to a certain self-hating narcissism: yes, I want my picture on the internet. No, I don't want to be the kind of person who pouts in selfies. Here is my niche! Presumably, memes being what they are, we will soon tire of faceswapping and discard it in favour of some novel, if less intrinsically hilarious, alternative. So be it. You move on if you want to. I'll still be here, like that Japanese soldier who didn't surrender until 1974, seeking out ever more exceptional disarrangements of faces, and hoping that eventually the glory days will come again.",
