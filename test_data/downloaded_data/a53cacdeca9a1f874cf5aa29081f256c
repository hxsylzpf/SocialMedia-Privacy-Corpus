  "content": "The Guardian's Africa network is taking over the Guardian's Instagram account this week. Our mission is two-fold: to showcase the best stories and images from the Guardian, and to find out more about what's happening in Africa through the eyes of the Instagram community. As well as on-the-ground reporting from our Africa correspondent David Smith, Monica Mark in West Africa and the Global Development team on the road in Ghana, we want to see your best pictures too. We're looking for day-to-day compositions of daily life, the best in fashion, culture, food, music and more, plus reflections on breaking news, politics and the issues covered by our colleagues on the Global Development desk. Upload your pictures \u2013 filter or no filter \u2013 using the hashtag #guardianafrica and we'll profile the best on the Guardian's account and on the Africa network. We also want to celebrate the best Instagram accounts on the continent, such as Everyday Africa, a group of photographers \"finding the extreme not nearly as prevalent as the familiar\", who unearth human stories in everything from the aftermath of conflict to behind the scenes at Kinshasa fashion week. Then there's photographer Andrew Esiebo making his mark on Nigeria's Instagram scene, and those from South Africa, which according to Instagram HQ has \"some of the most photogenic landscapes in the world.\" If you spot an account you think we should be following, please tell us in the comments below.",
