  "content": "Almost from the very moment of its first tentative tweet, legions of online Morrissey fans and others had converged on what was assumed to have been the new home of the bequiffed one on Twitter. \"Hello. Testing, 1, 2, 3. Planet Earth, are you there? One can only hope...\" came the tweet from the new account, @itsmorrissey, whose authenticity was bolstered by the fact that it had been endowed with a blue verified badge from Twitter itself. But then late on Friday came what may have been crushing disappointment for many who had been looking forward to regular installments \u2013 or at least up 140 characters worth at a time \u2013 of the former Smiths frontman's trademark waspish wit. \"I would like to stress that I do not have either a Twitter or a Facebook account,\" read a statement provided to a fan club site, True to You. \"I gather that a Twitter account has been opened in my name \u2013 as 'It's Morrissey' \u2013 but it is NOT Morrissey. I do not know who has opened this recent Twitter account, but please be aware that it is bogus. That's, of course, if you should remotely care.\" For good measure, the statement finished with: \"Untwitterably yours, MORRISSEY, Salt Lake City, 15 May 2014.\" Twitter did not respond when contacted on Friday. The account meanwhile had continued attract followers, clocking up more than 247,000 of them and tweeting about a tour. It was following just one other account, Harvest Records, to which the singer has recently signed. However, Morrissey fans can console themselves with the hope that their idol may yet soon be expressing himself via an older medium. It emerged on Thursday that he has been approached by the makers of The Archers to take a guest role in the long-running Radio 4 soap. The former Smiths singer is said to be \"fascinated\" by the offer to take part in the series originally billed as \"an everyday story of country folk\".",
