  "content": "Tributes to Michael Winner, the film director turned restaurant critic, have poured in as news broke of his death, aged 77, from liver failure. Speaking to the Guardian, the actor Joanna Lumley, who starred in Winner's final film, Parting Shots (1999), remembered his gift for inspiring those around him. \"He was a truly loyal man, generous and funny and I loved him dearly. People just liked him. When he wasn't being a monster he was adorable. He was a real monstre sacr\u00e9 \u2013 though really more of the sacr\u00e9 than the monster.\" Winner, who found early notoriety helming the Death Wish movie series, before moving into tamer film territory, and then taking a turn into restaurant reviewing, met Lumley while they were both shooting a television show with Robert Carrier in the mid-70s. \"I shook his hand and said: 'I understand you're a really horrible man.' He roared with laughter; he loved his bad-boy reputation, and we were friends ever since.\" Michael Caine, one of Winner's closest allies, told the Guardian: \"I am very sad to lose such a wonderful friend. I will miss him very much and will treasure our great and wonderful relationship.\" Other friends also paid tribute on Twitter. Broadcaster Danny Baker called him \"a chum, a funny man who twinkled \u2026 [and a] proper old rascal \u2026\" Winner's gleeful film-making style won him fans among today's generation of directors, too. Edgar Wright, who shot Shaun of the Dead, called him a \"crazy genius\", and recalled Winner's kindness in signing a movie poster for him as a surprise gift for his friend, Joe Cornish. Restaurateur Gordon Ramsay also took to Twitter to express his sadness, calling Winner \"the most charismatic food critic ever \u2026 loved him dearly,\" while Times food critic Giles Coren called him a \"great fellow\". Lumley was eager to emphasise the keen brain behind Winner's larky exterior. \"There was always the most tremendous crowd around him, often of extremely distinguished people. Sometimes he was treated as a joke; written him off as a fool, but there was much more to him than met the eye.\" Lumley said: \"We would send each other postcards; mine addressed to 'Winner Darlink' as though he was just learning the language. I knew from this year's Christmas card it would be last as it didn't have the usual insanely fulsome greeting. He was a real one-off character and I'm very, very sad he's gone.\"",
