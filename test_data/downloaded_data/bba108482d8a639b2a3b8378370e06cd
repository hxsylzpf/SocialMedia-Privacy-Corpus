  "content": "Not too many years ago, the big brains of the Internet were telling us that news was shrinking into the Daily Me - an infinitely customizable digital newspaper that would pre-select stories according to your interests and filter out anything that didn't match your criteria. Want the latest on post-grunge punk without being bothered over the war in Iraq? Not a problem. I'm exaggerating, of course, and personalized news has its uses. But for those of us who care about the news, the Daily Me was a nauseating prospect. Fortunately, the real power of the Internet turned out not to be the individual but the community. And the fastest-growing sites have been social networks like MySpace and Facebook, and sites such as Flickr, which allow you to share content. So can social networking be applied to the news? The answer - or, to be more accurate, a few glimmers of hope - comes in the form of several newish websites whose users submit content in order to be evaluated by the rest of the community. Last week the Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ), based in Washington DC, took a look at three of those sites and compared them to a fourth, Yahoo! News. The study examined Digg, Reddit, and Del.icio.us, each of which operates somewhat differently. Digg and Reddit let users vote up or down on stories submitted by users. Del.icio.us is a social-bookmarking site: the more people who bookmark a particular site, the higher it rises in the rankings. \"If someday we have a world without journalists, or at least without editors, what would the news agenda look like? How would citizens make up a front page differently than professional news people?\" asked the PEJ. The answer, not surprisingly, was that users of those services, as well as those who shared stories on Yahoo! News, were more taken with technology and lifestyle features than they were with hard news. During a week in June when war and immigration were among the leading stories in the mainstream media, the PEJ found that the biggest story on the social networks was the introduction of the Apple iPhone. (Reddit users were somewhat more interested in politics than the Digg and Del.icio.us communities.) But let's not get too depressed. After all, the three services the PEJ chose to focus on are not news sites per se. And to its credit, the PEJ is definitely not an organization of fuddy-duddies still lamenting the decline of cigar-chomping copy editors and fedora-wearing photogs. \"I think that to some extent websites like Digg and Reddit represent something really meaningful,\" PEJ director Tom Rosenstiel told me recently. So if Digg and its ilk aren't quite the answer, what is? No one knows, of course. Almost certainly, though, news would have to be the whole point, not just an afterthought. Moreover, there would have to be some way of evaluating not just how much buzz a story has, but also the reliability of the news source and the users who recommended it. \"Mix in reputation - an enormously complex problem - and you have something worthwhile,\" wrote citizen-journalism advocate Dan Gillmor on his blog in reaction to the PEJ study. Gradually, some mainstream news outlets are embracing social networks. Most sites, of course, run lists of the most-popular and most-emailed stories, and many allow comments and easy posting to Reddit, Facebook, et al - rough forms of news-based community-building. The ubiquitous USA Today has gone one better than that, building Digg-like features into its website. Perhaps the most ambitious model is a small, experimental site called NewsTrust. Not only can users submit stories and rate them on a variety of criteria, such as importance, sourcing, and fairness, but there are also methods of rating the reliability of news organizations, and even of fellow users. If the \"wisdom of the crowds\", to invoke an overworked phrase, is to be brought to bear on the news, NewsTrust may point the way.",
