  "content": "Say \"massively multiplayer online gaming\" and most people will think of goblin-bashing games set in fantasy worlds such as World of Warcraft. However, the traditional MMO has just one way of making money: monthly subscriptions and/or the sale of the client software. But a new MMO format may have found a way to create multiple revenue streams. Empire of Sports, which is about to go into closed beta with a planned launch at the end of this year, is set to capitalise on a number of developments on the internet, including the growth of in-game advertising and social networking. In the game, you start as a rookie and develop your skill at various sports in a virtual world. Activities include football, skiing and bobsledding, with many more planned, according to the Swiss-based developers. This creates multiple opportunities for companies to place their brands in the game - for a fee, of course. \"Product placement is more attractive to advertisers and to gamers,\" says Christian M\u00fcller, manging director of Empire of Sports. Such product placement, he suggests, could include, say, a branded car to transport your avatar between the cities that will make up the gameworld. \"Time is precious,\" says M\u00fcller, \"so you could buy a car to travel in.\" There is also plenty of opportunity for real-life organisations to have an in-game presence. In-game membership of real-world clubs could, M\u00fcller suggests, lead to real-world interactions such as meeting stars and going to events. And the development of avatars from rookies to experts in their field requires the player to manage their (virtual) exercise and nutrition. \"You could have, for example, a beverage company selling sports drinks that have an effect on your avatar,\" M\u00fcller says. Social networking will also be part of the world: players will be able to form teams and join clubs. They will also, Muller says, be able to congregate to watch real-world sporting events: \"It's a 3D world where people get together,\" he says. While that seems like Second Life, user-generated content, however, will be more strictly controlled. \"We don't want some of the kind of content that has been seen in Second Life,\" M\u00fcller says. What about the traditional way of making money? \"It will be a downloadable client,\" M\u00fcller says. He is considering a staggered subscription model, with some content free and further content and character development available for a small fee. \"We hope that in the end advertising and sponsorship will take away the need for a subscription fee,\" says M\u00fcller, who adds that it will be \"significantly lower\" than World of Warcraft's prices. Mixing social networking, competition and creating your own space in a persistent world is, M\u00fcller says, \"not so much web 2.0 as web 3D\".",
