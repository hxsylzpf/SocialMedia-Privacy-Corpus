  "content": "Last autumn, wildlife lovers around the the world had an opportunity to follow the migration of wildebeest across east Africa, through a series of live web broadcasts using Twitter's Periscope app. This month the concept is to be repeated, with two new broadcasts from Kenya: one showing lion interaction at night via a starlight camera, the other capturing the moment rehabilitated turtles are released back into the ocean. The first broadcast, will start today (7 January at 6.30pm GMT) and run every evening until 13 January, offering a view of the lions in the Olare Motorogi and Naboisho conservancies of the Maasai Mara. The second broadcast will take place from 16-18 January (at 7am GMT) from the coastal town of Watamu, following the Watamu Turtle Watch project as it releases sea turtles back into the Indian Ocean. Some live footage will be captured via a small GoPro camera on a turtle's back. To follow the live broadcasts it is necessary to download the Periscope app and follow Herdtracker's channel from 7-18 January. Updates will be posted using the hashtag #KenyaLive. The project has been curated by Make It Kenya, the country's newly-launched business and tourism board, in collaboration with Herdtracker. Herdtracker, which produced the original wildebeest broadcast, allows people to track migrations in real time on Google Maps. The tool can be used by those planning safari trips to book lodges in relation to the location of herds.",
