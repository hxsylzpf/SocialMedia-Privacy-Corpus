  "content": "Two of the women who took part in a series of sex parties with formula one boss Max Mosley have told the high court today that the events had no \"brutality\" or Nazi themes. Mosley is suing the News of the World for breach of privacy over articles, photographs and videos showing him participating in sadomasochistic role play at two parties in a Chelsea flat on March 8 and March 28 this year. The News of the World alleged that the role play had a Nazi theme and the violence was brutal to the point of criminality. One woman, identified as Woman A, who organised parties on Mosley's behalf and holds the lease to the Chelsea flat where they were held, told Mr Justice Eady in the high court that she had known Mosley for some time. \"Myself and Mike [Mosley's pseudonym in the S&amp;M scene] have obviously known each other for a while and had obviously played CP [corporal punishment] or caning [before],\" she said. \"I played with him so much I know how far I can push him,\" Woman A told the court. She added that she had been very good friends with the other four women at the parties, including Woman E, who was the News of the World's informant. \"We were constantly laughing and we enjoy what we do \u2013 it's like children playing cowboys and Indians. It's adults playing, having fun,\" Woman A said. \"Afterwards, it's the best feeling in the world. It's a natural high and the endorphins kick in whether you are giving it or receiving it. It's as if you've just run a marathon.\" Woman A, who is to face cross-examination this afternoon, said there was never any suggestion of a Nazi theme. One of the other four women, identified as Woman D, said she did not attend the March 8 party but there was no Nazi theme at the March 28 event. She told the court that Woman A had given broad instructions about the theme, but that they were not prescriptive. Woman B added that the German-speaking at the parties was a result of her own revelation that she had a longstanding fantasy to be interrogated in another language. She said she was shocked that the article appeared in the News of the World and that Woman E had been the informant. Woman B's voice cracked and she started crying as she said: \"I was horrified, I didn't believe anyone in the scene would do something like that. One thing we always try is to make sure everything remains private.\" She added that the role play had a prison setting rather than a military one and the laughter on the video showed no one was taking it too seriously. \"Grotesque? I don't think so,\" Woman B told the court. \"It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it's something I enjoy in the privacy of my own space. \"Brutal? Certainly not. We never get any permanent markings or anything like that.\" Woman D said she was not always paid for attending Mosley's parties, adding that she was not \"financially dependent\" on Mosley or men like him, since she was completing a PhD and received a tax-free stipend of \u00a314,000. However, she acknowledged under cross-examination that she had been treated to two trips to Monaco at Mosley's expense and he generally gave her money for her participation in the S&amp;M parties. The case continues. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
