By giving a platform to \"counterspeech to the speech that is perpetuating hate,\" she argued, Facebook could be an instrument for peace. The panel session was reported, across much of the internet, as \"It's snowy and cold in Switzerland, but Sheryl Sandberg wore a lightweight burgundy dress and matching high heels, with no tights.\" The inference in some accounts seemed to be that Sandberg must be a bit dizzy, and didn't realise that a conference held at 1,560m above sea level in the Swiss Alps in January might be chilly. I can't help thinking this an unlikely analysis of how a 46-year-old billionaire and global power player operates. In fact, Sandberg dressed with pure pragmatism. Davos is the world's power-dressing catwalk. It is to CEOs what the Paris haute couture shows are to Hollywood actresses. It is a conference from which images are beamed across the world, which is a clear business case for bringing your A-game to what you wear. Also, it's not often you get dressed for work knowing that a selfie with Leonardo DiCaprio or Emma Watson is on the cards, and no one wants to mess that one up. There is a maddening can't-win-either-way unfairness in criticising Sandberg for not wearing warmer clothes \u2013 I am pretty sure that if she'd worn salopettes and moon boots, that would have grabbed the headlines even more firmly. (There is also frustrating ignorance about how women run their daily lives. The concept of having both heels for the office and a practical pair of shoes for travelling is par for the course in many offices but \u2013 because men don't do the overflow bag thing \u2013 still not factored in to how we read a woman's outfit.) Sandberg, like all the men around her, power-dressed. She chose clothes to project competence, seniority, excellence. For a man, that means a suit and sturdy shoes; for a woman, it means a dress and heels. What Davos flags in stark relief is how unequal this power-dressing playing field is, and how that issue reflects more important ones. Just as the proportion of women in attendance flags up the too-slow progress of women's representation at the top levels of industry \u2013 18% of those at Davos this year were women, compared with 17% last year and 16% the year before that, a glacial rate of change which does not suggest these self-proclaimed dynamos are throwing their full weight behind a movement towards equality \u2013 so the physical setting of Davos, its harsh climate and treacherously iced streets and general air of rugged, Revenant-esque manliness emphasises both how practical men's trouser suits are in challenging conditions, and how impractical the women's equivalent look is. Sheryl Sandberg has a clear formula for what she wears: fitted dresses, medium-height heels, block colours in the blue-red-purple arc. Not yellow, not pink, no print. No jewellery apart from earrings. It is remarkably consistent. Interestingly, there is not a single sentence in her book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, about what to wear. Her strategy is to neutralise this conversation with a consistent look which is easily recognisable as the uniform of the 21st century female in the public eye. It is a kind of bland, business-lounge glamour: the fitted dress, the court shoes, the colour palette, the clean lines and sleek polish are recognisable in women from the Duchess of Cambridge to Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Selina Meyer in Veep. Women have good reason to stick to this formula. Sticking your head above the tailored-dress parapet is a risky business. Note how, as her campaign has gathered intensity, Hillary Clinton has changed her sartorial tactics. A wardrobe once noted for its theatrically bright colours \u2013 trouser suits in mustard yellow, or kingfisher blue \u2013 has lost its flourish. Her suits now are usually navy, grey or black. The earrings and bold necklaces are absent. Fashion is a powerful communication tool but it is also a nuanced and interpretative one, and it seems Senator Clinton has ruled that the risks of being misinterpreted make fashion a game not worth playing. Sandberg looks to me like a woman who can handle herself. (Anyway, she \u2013 along with all her male colleagues \u2013 is no doubt limo-ed from door to door.) If she can keep her footing so surely on the uneven playing field of business power dressing, the icy streets of Davos will have been a doddle.",
