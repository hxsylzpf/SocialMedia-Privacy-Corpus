  "content": "Recently I went to my local magazine store only to find the music section, which is dense with titles but rather cramped, completely occupied by emo fans. The teenage threesome were flicking through mags, mocking particular bands (like Paramore) and pointing out others they thought were cool, while playing tunes to each other off portable players (sharing earbuds, a sweet if insanitary habit). Waiting for them to finish, I overheard their conversation, including some playful joshing about who had heard a hot new band's big song first. The banter went something like: \"I heard it on MySpace\", \"Nah, you heard it on a commercial\", \"Nah, you heard it on Disney.\" What struck me about this exchange was the sense of a hierarchy in terms of the medium via which you discovered music. MySpace was cooler than a TV ad, but a commercial seemed to be superior to RadioDisney (presumably because it equates with Miley Cyrus-style teen pop). What I took away from this accidental field research is the impression that for many young people the idea of \"alternative\" \u2013 music that bypasses the commercial and corporate, that fans engage with in an active way that transcends consumerism \u2013 still has a strong romantic appeal. Yet MySpace's parent company, Fox Interactive Media, is owned by News Corporation, the world's second biggest media conglomerate (behind only Disney, actually) and third largest entertainment conglomerate. Strictly speaking, finding out about a group through MySpace ought to be no more \"underground\" than hearing a song on Clear Channel or buying a CD made by a Big Four music corporation like Universal. In the noughties, the idea of \"the underground\" in music seemed simultaneously to wither and to flourish. This paradox \u2013 the underground as an eroded/outmoded concept yet a strangely persistent and relevant practice \u2013 has something to do with the peculiar properties of the medium through which music culture increasingly organised itself as the decade progressed: the web. As a fan, you drift across the internet in a seemingly autonomous manner, following tangents and encountering things serendipitously. All kinds of amateur, for-love-not-money creativity nestles in the nooks and crannies of the ever-expanding webworld. Yet somehow this accessibility has undermined the notion of subcultures, of marginal zones of dissident music-making. The internet creates the illusion that everything is equal, because it's literally all on the same level: the flat plane of webspace. With just one click you can go from the New York Times (or indeed the Guardian) to an obscure noise label's website. In an odd twist, the fact that the power of the mainstream media has been challenged by all this non-professional culture and opinion also means that everything that was once marginal now seems more central. It's all media, now. This doesn't mean that a blog has the same power as a newspaper, that a tiny label is just as much a force as Warner Music Group. Massive disparities in terms of attention and influence persist: there are blogs that are hardly read, netradio stations hardly anybody tunes into. But the overexposing light of the web means that that anything that has online presence simply doesn't feel underground in the way its precursors did in the age of the underground press and fanzines, tape trading networks and DIY labels. Even the coolest online music retailer selling the most esoteric, out-there music doesn't have the same vibe as an independent record store that is physically located, that you have to seek out and journey to. Yet the fact is that the decade has witnessed a boom for small labels and \"zines\" (ie. blogs) specialising in noise, drone, free folk, improv, and dozens more marginal genres across the spectrum from black metal to grime. Clearly loads of people still believe in the ideals of \"underground\" music as anti-corporate and unpop. All these micro-genres are based around an ethos of participation. That's why scenes like noise or dubstep have such a high ratio of performers to punters, with the remainder of the audience often involved running labels, promoting gigs, or just writing about the music. As well as the attraction of commitment and effort, another reason to be involved in these scenes is a yearning for cultural intimacy: the desire to enter a space that is special, set apart. You could call this need to be in the know \"tribal\" or \"elitist\", depending on your own sympathies. But either way, this kind of secret knowledge is precarious, hard to maintain, precisely because of the web. It's easier than ever for people to find out about other people's business. \"Underground\" really ought to mean more than just \"being into something not many people know about\". One reason for the rise of the word \"hipster\" as an insult relates to this sense that what was once genuinely alternative has become a quasi-bohemia: all it's about now is being an early adopter, knowing about stuff before everybody else. If \"underground\" still carries a faint renegade and utopian charge, it's because the concept comes from the late 1960s and originally referred not just to long hair and trippy bands but also to the counterculture, the free press, and at the extreme end of the spectrum, guerrilla outfits like the Weather Underground and Angry Brigade who actually blew stuff up. \"Underground\" meant lifestyle nonconformity and opposition to the establishment. Punk/post-punk renewed that meaning just when it was flagging and gave it more of a solid infrastructure: independent labels and independent distribution networks. This was still entrepreneurial activity, the making and selling of stuff to a niche market. But these micro-capitalists believed they were operating in a radically different way from the top-down, bottom-line-oriented major labels. Some post-punk indies espoused collectivist ideals and aimed for non-exploitative, partnership-style relationships with bands (Rough Trade and Factory's famous 50/50 split of profits, for instance). In the 1990s, rave brought a fresh wave of underground consciousness into music, with a new boom of independent labels and computer-enabled DIY music. But \"underground\" in these scenes lacked the vaguely socialistic slant of post-punk and early indie. If these new dance underground scenes had a politics, it was \"minoritarian\", based around race and class: they fostered the music that major labels didn't support or understand, that was too innovative or \"street\" for either commercial radio or public broadcasting. That's why underground dance music in the UK has always been so closely entwined with pirate radio. With no hang-ups about making money (indeed cash was a vital issue, a matter of survival) the post-rave undergrounds didn't oppose corporate pop for anti-capitalist reasons but because the majors were too slow-moving and, even trying their best, they would inevitably dilute or gentrify the sounds of the street for mainstream palatability. This was an aesthetic underground, in other words, not a political one. This steady depoliticisation of the concept of \"underground\" is one reason why it's become more nebulous and tenous over the last decade. It made cloudy the question of what was at stake in the underground versus crossover dilemma. What were you actually bringing into pop from \"outside\"? A more abrasive/experimental sound? A reminder of the existence of a certain urban population? Grime wanted \"in\" badly, boasted that nothing could stop it breaking through and \"blowing up\". But entry into pop would almost certainly come at a price, and if the music was really what mattered, why risk it? On his 2005 debut album Home Sweet Home, grime MC Kano candidly addressed his own confusion with Sometimes, an uncharacteristically subdued track whose chorus murmurs: \"Sometimes you'll see me in a daydream/thinking 'can the underground go mainstream?'\" Kano's crossover bid didn't work out, stranding him in the same limbo as Lady Sovereign: a scenario he actually contemplates in Sometimes with the pensive line \"Is it too far to go back?\" But as I suggested earlier, this very topography of popular music in terms of underground versus overground, margins versus centre, has been steadily dissolved this decade, partly because of the web and partly because of the economic upheavals that have beset the music industry. The mainstream itself seems to have shrunk, both in sales and in its domination of our attention. It's no longer the oppressive behemoth it once was, but for that same reason doesn't beckon nearly so strongly as the higher ground to be conquered, the inner zone to be invaded by the barbarians. Just look at how few records you have to sell to get to No 1. This shrivelled mainstream is now surrounded by channels of musical activity that are not so much underground (in any oppositional sense) as simply \u2026 not selling many records. That's what US street rap is becoming: a sub-mainstream. The grass roots activity and DIY mixtapes recall 1980s indie, complete with rap bloggers as zine writers stamping their feet about the national music press neglecting provincial city-based scenes. Another way of thinking about this could be High Street versus boutique. That fits this decade's post-rave electronic dance genres, especially since they've mostly exchanged hardness, extremism or blatant drugginess for pleasantness, exquisite sound-design and tastefulness. A label like Kompakt caters to a discerning niche market that runs in parallel with the mainstream but at a slight elevation. Which is fine, but a long way from the idea of rave as a movement. Despite all these shifts, a lot of people still seem attached to the idea of \"going underground\", being into music that's off the radar. But how do you recreate that in an age of webbed connectivity and media supersaturation? There seem to be currents of irritated awareness that the internet, for all the boons it's brought, is inimical in a number of ways to the things we most value about music. That's a whole other topic, and a vast one, but the erosion of the idea of an \"outside\", of secret knowledge and exclusive but shared spaces is one of them. One response has been the renewed importance of live music, and especially festivals. That's how an audience gets a sense of itself as (potentially, at least) a community. Performances are also events: you have to be there in person, to experience the performer's presence, the collective vibe. Performances have duration (you can't press \"pause\") and they can't be repeated or exchanged. Another response is the cult of tangible musical artefacts that are analogue not digital: vinyl records and, bizarrely, cassettes. It seems revealing that it's the most narrowcast genres, like noise/drone and free folk, that have fastened on tape as their recording medium of preference. Micro-labels release cassettes in limited editions anywhere from 300 to 30, often with lovingly handcrafted packaging for added fetish appeal. The smaller the band, the more frequently it seems to release material, anything from a dozen to 20 tapes a year. Instead of taking time to create an album as a definitive work, these artists emit a continuous drip-drip-drip stream of music to a super-select fanbase who want to own the music in physical form (followed by a wider audience who tune in via the inevitable blog uploads). Momus's maxim that in the future everybody will be famous for 15 people gets ever more applicable. And then there is the possibility that a true musical underground, in the archaic sense, could only really exist if it was offline. But that seems utterly beyond imagining, doesn't it?",
