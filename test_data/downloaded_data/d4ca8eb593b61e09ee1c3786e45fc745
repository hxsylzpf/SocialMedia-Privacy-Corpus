  "content": "It is the longest bow to say that, as in the UK, Australia's media regulators have been found wanting (Australia's fourth estate comes under siege, Media, 11 June). On what basis does the reporter make these claims? The Australian Communications and Media Authority's investigation into the David Campbell matter, where Channel Seven broadcast footage of a former NSW minister leaving a gay club in May 2012, concluded that there had been a gross breach of the minister's privacy. The principal question we then had to decide was whether it was in the public interest for it to be nonetheless broadcast. We decided there was a matter of public interest and that conclusion was explicitly set out in the investigation report's reasoning. The principles arising from the ACMA decision also include: public figures and private citizens alike are entitled to the privacy protections under the Australian Commercial Television Code; broadcasters have to articulate why a story is in the public interest and not simply make bland assertions to that effect; not all matters that interest the public are in the public interest; information about a person's sexual life is ordinarily personal and private unless a public interest consideration defeats that default presumption; conduct in a public place can still have expectations of privacy visited upon it. This report was framed in a very particular set of circumstances and Australian broadcasters would be very unwise to see the decision applying to any other situation than this: namely, the sudden and unexplained resignation of a very senior elected official against the backdrop of a series of political controversies attaching to the minister. The decision on this occasion was an extremely difficult trade-off between what is in the public interest and a person's right to privacy. I am happy to acknowledge that the decision was certainly one over which reasonable minds, properly informed, might differ. Chris Chapman Chairman, Australian Communications and Media Authority",
