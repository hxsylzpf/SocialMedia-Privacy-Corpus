  "content": "Yahoo has become the latest technology company to promise to alert its users if it thinks their accounts have been attacked by \"state-sponsored actors\" \u2013 hackers working on behalf of governments. \"Yahoo will now notify you if we strongly suspect that your account may have been targeted by a state-sponsored actor,\" said Bob Lord, Yahoo's chief information security officer, in a blog post announcing the change. \"We'll provide these specific notifications so that our users can take appropriate measures to protect their accounts and devices in light of these sophisticated attacks. Our notifications provide targeted users with specific actions they can take to help ensure that their Yahoo accounts are safe and secure.\" Those actions include turning on two-step verification; changing their password to a stronger one that has never been used before; updating their account recovery information; and checking recent activity on their account. Yahoo's move comes two months after Facebook made a similar announcement in October, telling its users that it would notify them \"if we believe your account has been targeted or compromised by an attacker suspected of working on behalf of a nation-state\". In December, Twitter warned a number of its users that they may have been the targets of a state-sponsored attack, including several experts in information security and privacy. Google, meanwhile, made this move in June 2012 for a subset of its users who it believed might be targets for phishing, malware or other attacks from state-sponsored \"bad actors\". By necessity, all of these companies decline to provide detailed information on the potential attackers they have identified. \"In order to prevent the actors from learning our detection methods, we do not share any details publicly about these attacks,\" wrote Lord. \"To protect the integrity of our methods and processes, we often won't be able to explain how we attribute certain attacks to suspected attackers,\" explained Facebook. The likelihood of online attacks coming from state-sponsored actors has been increasingly talked about in 2015. Richard Ledgett, deputy director of the US National Security Agency, claimed in October that \"if you are connected to the Internet, you are vulnerable to determined nation-state attackers\".",
