Anyone who's been in the trade long enough is almost certain to win something, no matter how minor or laughable. But there are several honors that do mean something, and one of them is the Pulitzer Prize. Although the annual awards are rife with politics, and the outcome sometimes plain bizarre, a journalist who wins one can count on his or her obituary starting, \"So and so, who won a Pulitzer Prize \u2026\", or words to that effect. This year's awards were notable for two reasons. One was the honor to two online-only organizations, Politico (for editorial cartoons) and the Huffington Post (for national reporting). Both were clearly deserved, and were a demonstration of the online journalism world's further ascendance into the realm of mainstream media. Slowly but surely, the Pulitzer jury and board are bringing their venerable institution into the current century, and that's a gratifying development. The other notable item among the journalism Pulitzers was the prize that nobody won. The jury named some finalists for editorial writing (editorials are called \"leaders\" in many other parts of the world) \u2013 but declined to name a winner. Prize for the best commentary on this goes to Gawker, for a post entitled \"Pulitzer Committee Confirms: Editoral Writing is Useless\" \u2013 a slightly-too-mean assessment of the state of the art. During my journalistic career, I have written editorials at two papers. One was a tiny (and defunct) weekly, where I did a little of everything, and the other was at a then-large metropolitan daily where I filled in for a writer who was on leave. What I learned was this: the reason editorial writing is mostly worthless is that most newspapers have no idea why the genre exists in the first place. If you can find one, look at the editorials in the typical metro paper. What you'll read, most of the time, is material that would have to improve to be pablum. Editorial writers have trained themselves and each other to write in a style that is more effective at relieving a reader's insomnia than any drug, and which offers no straightforward opinion \u2013 and that used to be the whole point of editorials before newspapers became part of corporate empires. It's especially snicker-worthy when an editorial pronounces that the president, or Congress, or state legislature, \"must\" do this or that \u2013 as if an increasingly feeble institution could order up such things. Great editorial pages had clout in the old days for two reasons. The first was that newspapers themselves had clout, which has dissipated in recent years. The second was that editorial pages genuinely stood for something. They were used by newspaper publishers to help set and move the public agenda. When they said something had to happen in the state legislature or city council, it often did happen. One of the few American editorial pages that still plays at least a portion of that traditional role \u2013 albeit in an unfortunate way \u2013 is the Wall Street Journal, which has enormous clout due to its unique position in US financial and political journalism. You know what the Journal's bosses want you to believe: a rightwing agenda that has little patience for sentimental ideas like fairness. There's nothing mushy in the Journal's editorials, however wrong they may be. Editorial pages in other parts of the world \u2013 published by organizations that don't hide their worldviews \u2013 often have the same style, if not political bent. Metro and local dailies in America do occasionally stray from their standard \"on the one hand, on the other hand\" nonsense into the real job of the page \u2013 namely, generating a community conversation about important issues. And those are the ones that tend to win prizes, which make the usual junky editorials look even more absurd. Years ago, I published a blogpost about how to reform editorial pages; it added up to a fairly simple concept: get the community involved in a broader conversation about its condition and its future. How? Go online in a serious way, and turn the printed pages into a guide to, and best-of showcase for, the conversation the community was having with itself. That ageing post has no mention of social networks, which were just getting started around then, but the principles would apply there, too. No publisher has taken my suggestion. So I'm either ahead of my time or wrong. But I'd bet that these moves, even amid the accelerating dissolution of American newspapers, would have benefits both to the community and a news organization's bottom line.",
