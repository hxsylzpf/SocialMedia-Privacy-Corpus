  "content": "Since the middle of the twentieth century, economic prosperity has been equated with a consumerist society with ownership at its core. But in today's hyper-connected world, this view of the world is beginning to change. The abundance of assets along with the relative affordability of almost anything, high-tech consumer platforms, the digitisation of products, close-knit social media communities and the economic downturn of 2008 have all meant that collaborative consumption is flourishing. As children, many of us were used to bartering, swapping or trading. But these networks are now wired up globally, so this kind of networking and exchanging is second nature, even between strangers and across myriad commodities. eBay could be said to be the poster child of this movement, but many sectors have been disrupted. A raft of well established businesses seem here to stay, from travel (AirBnB) to transportation (Zipcar, Lyft) and fashion (GirlMeetsDress), crowdfunding (RocketHub, Kickstarter) and peer lending (Prosper) to collaborative inventing (Quirky) and skills (TaskRabbit, Zaarly), and from smart mobs to knowledge (Quora). What Quora shows is that even the expense of becoming an expert \u2013 through on-the-job experience, training programs, and education \u2013 is being shared between strangers. A hyper-consumption economy, to paraphrase Milton Friedman, is a \"ponzi scheme\" which clearly fell apart again in the last recession. It is true that most of the older generations who have lived their lives prioritizing private ownership are less ready to fully benefit from this trend. It is the young who are leading the way, understanding that it is not the DVD they want but the movie it carries, not the drill they need but the hole it creates, and the needs or experiences these assets fulfil rather than the assets themselves. Today time, experience and access trumps possession. In October 2012, GirlMeetsDress and ParkatMyHouse were featured in a report produced by Zipcar called 'Pay-As-You-Live - the Business of Sharing in the UK. It revealed that this new pay-as-you-live lifestyle is changing the retail paradigm, with a market in the UK estimated at \u00a322.4bn. The main reasons given for hiring, rather than buying were: \u2022 Cost per use \u2013 60% \u2022 Not being able to afford to buy it \u2013 53% \u2022 Depreciation in value \u2013 38% \u2022 Ongoing maintenance costs \u2013 45% \u2022 Flexibility to upgrade or change styles \u2013 29% On a basic level GirlMeetsDress.com provides millions of women the ability to rent designer dresses and accessories for a fraction of the retail price, allowing them to look and feel beautiful for all of their social events. In reality we help create those \"Cinderella moments\" for hundreds of women every week, be it an 18-year-old wearing her dream Alexander McQueen dress to a prom, or a savvy hard-working executive that simply wants to wear an asymmetric ruffled yellow dress from the latest Lanvin collection. When we launched back in 2009, the recession mindset dominated. It meant that \"cost per use\" was a huge driver, as being smart with money and where to spend it was highly regarded. But it was also clear that people have since realised that experience and time are the most precious commodities we have, and that consequently ownership is becoming more irrelevant than ever before. \u2022 Xavier de Lecaros Aquise founded his first startup after university before working in banking and tech investment, and then co-founding GirlMeetsDress in 2009  \u2022 This article was amended on 6 January 2014 to correct details of the Pay-As-You-Live report.",
