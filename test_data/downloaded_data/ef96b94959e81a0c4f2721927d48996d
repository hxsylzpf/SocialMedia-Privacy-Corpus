  "content": "Facebook has disabled the API that shares users' mobile phone and address details with developers in response to a wave of what it is calling 'feedback', and what I'd call justified concern. A carefully worded statement on the Facebook Developer Blog listed the possible advantages of using this data in apps - speeding up the checkout process on a shopping website, for example, or allowing Groupon-type deals to be sent straight to your phone. And, the post says, users need to give permission to every app that might use that data, it won't share friends' details and there's an application dashboard where every user can control how their information is used.

Facebook now admits \"that we could make people more clearly aware of when they are granting access to this data\". \"We are making changes to help ensure you only share this information when you intend to do so,\" said Douglas Purdy in the official post. \"We'll be working to launch these updates as soon as possible, and will be temporarily disabling this feature until those changes are ready. We look forward to re-enabling this improved feature in the next few weeks.\" Facebook's 'seek forgiveness not permission' strategy is a risky but ultimately successful one. On one hand, it means a steady stream of what could be perceived as 'controversies' as some of the more privacy-related features are rolled out, reacted to, retracted and rolled out again in some modified form. But that's the nature of iterating in an innovative business. That strategy also means that in relation to the total number of features being rolled out, the number of problematic launches is very small. Facebook's incredibly rapid development and growth has much to do with this process, and these kind of 'adjustments' are a sign of a company continually pushing its own business forward. The tension arises where that business overlaps with our sense of what is public and what is private - an area where Facebook is on the front line, redefining what privacy means to us.",
