  "content": "Memo: To all staff at Channel 8 From: Rupert Sawyer, chief executive Subject: Let's face(book) facts, the future online is in video. Channel 8 has always been an early adopter of new technology and a trailblazer for the best innovations across television, publishing and in our online businesses. I am proud that we are still the only television channel in the world to issue all our programming on both Laserdisc and 8-track formats. I'm tickled pink that Tosspot TV is the only special interest programmer to offer fully biodegradable disposable groin attachments to subscribers, and I cannot tell you how delighted we all should be with the stereoscopic 3D pages of All-Right magazine. But, in order to move with the times in the 21st century, I understand that a company must be fully hooked up with the social networks. Already a regular Twitter user, with many tens of loyal followers, it was with intrigue, excitement and some trepidation that I built my first Facebook page after learning of the company's $100bn valuation \u2013 surely 845 million users can't be wrong? \"If you build it, he will come,\" whispered the wind in Kevin Costner's informative 1989 documentary Field of Dreams \u2013 well, maybe that's true in Idaho cornfields (and on Tosspot TV), but not on Facebook. Despite my obvious CEO celebrity status, my extremely well-furnished Facebook page has barely been touched by fact fiddlers. Why is that, Rupert? No, it's not because people are snubbing my witty retorts and insightful media commentary \u2013 it is simply because Facebook is rubbish. I ask you, what self-respecting business would float on the stock market with a letter from its boss who personally owns more than a quarter of the firm \u2013 and is happy with $500,000-a-year in pay, saying \"we don't build services to make money \u2026\" and believe \"people want to use services from companies that believe in something beyond simply maximising profits\"? Good luck with selling those shares. Compare this sentiment to the Channel 8 prospectus \u2013 and my own cool \u00a31.25m per annum package \u2013 that simply promises: \"We'll double your money in a year or we'll give you a blender\" and I think it's now fairly clear why only half the people signed up are actually using Facebook daily. However, I do have something to thank Mr Zuckerberg and company for \u2013 if it wasn't for discovering how little time I have for their social network, I would never have discovered another fine online property, YouTube, and then had a brainwave \u2026 What are we? We're the peoples' channel, Rupert, I hear you cry. But how can you call yourself the peoples' network when you don't let Joe Public make programmes? I couldn't agree more. And so, with this in mind, I am excited to announce a brand new Channel 8 project \u2013 Trailer Idol. No longer will the shows that our viewers see be dictated by the few, they will be created by the many. Unlike the BBC, who tax honest hard-working folk only to force worthy dramas and low-budget game shows down their throats like foie gras-ready geese, Trailer Idol will be a true meritocracy, I'm inviting anyone with a good idea# (and access to a computer) to send in trailers*, up to a minute long for show ideas \u2013 and if we like them, we'll make them into full programmes and screen them across our network. Take a look at a few of the ideas we've already received, I'm sure you'll be suitably impressed and inspired. Catch this explosive C8 trailer, or this on our news coverage, a flavour of our new ground-breaking observational documentary, and The Max Factor, a take on the reality show revolution. So, it's over to you \u2013 my staff, my viewers, and a few left-leaning pseudo-intellectuals (once the Guardian hacks my email again and publishes this message). All you need to do is upload your videos to YouTube and then pop them on my brand new Facebook page (I've left the wall open for you) \u2026 remember to keep checking back throughout the week to see just how much talent Britain/Vietnam has \u2026 I think you'll be surprised. The very best of luck! Happy uploading, Rupert * by submitting a video you give up all rights to the show, its concept and content to the Channel 8 Television Corporation. You may also be asked for a non-refundable contribution towards production costs. # please do not upload content ideas intended for Tosspot TV online. These films should be sent direct to Rupert Sawyer, Floor 52, Channel 8 Plaza, Ha Noi, Vietnam.",
