  "content": "Q Last Friday evening I was phoned by someone who claimed to be from NatWest bank. He was trying to sell me a product called PrivacyGuard, which apparently relates to identity theft. I was suspicious about this call and challenged the caller, who managed to provide some of my personal details. But I objected to being rung up in this way and ended the call. I used 1471 and found that the call came from a company called Teleperformance. I then contacted NatWest customer relations dept, which confirmed that it contracts Teleperformance to sell NatWest products. As far as I can see, there is a triple breach of consumer law here: NatWest passing my personal details to another company, in breach of the Data Protection Act; Teleperformance claiming to be NatWest; and Teleperformance using my telephone number for sales and marketing calls when I have registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS). NatWest refuses to accept any of this PON Registering with the TPS should prevent any company contacting you with unwanted marketing calls, including those with which you have had dealings in the past. That includes Teleperformance, which in this instance is acting as an agent of NatWest. NatWest hasn't necessarily broken any data protection laws by passing your details to one of its agents but, unless you gave the bank your express permission to continue contacting you with details of products and services, it is in breach of the TPS rules. If you write to NatWest requesting that it stop contacting you with marketing calls (or letters), either directly or through a third-party, it has to comply - otherwise it will have broken data protection laws. If it continues to contact you against your wishes, you can complain to the Information Commissioner's Office. Registration with TPS takes 28 days to become effective. If this time has elapsed, you can also complain to the ICO about Teleperformance.",
