  "content": "Prince Edward's TV company, Ardent Productions, will no longer make programmes about royalty. Ardent's chairman, Malcolm Cockren, told the ITV reporter, Jonathan Maitland, the company had taken the decision to stop making documentaries about the royal family, hitherto the lifeblood of the prince's company. In this evening's Tonight with Trevor McDonald: the Trouble with Edward, Maitland claims Mr Cockren told him Ardent would not make any more programmes about royalty. The Ardent producer, Paul Watson, was set to appear on the programme at the request of Prince Edward but he pulled out at the last minute after the palace intervened. It is believed Mr Watson was going to claim Ardent did not film Prince William at university in St Andrews - the incident that sparked the company's most recent PR disaster. On the programme, the former Ardent producer, Christine Carter, talks about the letter she made public in which Edward allegedly admitted cashing in on his royal connections to get TV commissions. In a further blow, The A-Z of Royalty, the series Ardent was making for American television when it was caught filming in St Andrews, has been shelved. The decision to stop making films about royalty will have a severe effect on Ardent. The company has lost \u00a31.7m since it was founded seven years ago and half its output has been based on royalty.",
