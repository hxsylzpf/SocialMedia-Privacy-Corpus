  "content": "I'm sorry, but I had to blog about this. Namco Bandai has released a new international version of its Pac-Man Twitter client, originally launched in Japan earlier this year. Featuring all the standard Twitter functions, it comes with skins resembling the classic 1981 maze game as well as legendary shooter, Galaga, celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. \"When you update your timeline, characters on the screen move around to classic PAC-MAN and Galaga melodies,\" explains the press release. Furthermore, each time you reach a certain number of outgoing tweets, an onscreen roulette wheel spins, giving you the chance to win a puzzle piece; collect all the pieces and you're awarded with a Pac-Man or Galaga wallpaper. Of course, they could have gone further, playing the classic Pac-Man waka-waka noise every time you tap in a letter, finally delivering the death sound when you reach 140 characters \u2013 perhaps they're saving that for the next update. So which classic game would you like to see reborn as a social media novelty? A Metal Gear Solid codec would be nice, or a LucasArts adventure client that forces you to construct all your tweets using a SCUMM interface... Failing that, Horace Goes Tweeting? Once again, I'm sorry.",
