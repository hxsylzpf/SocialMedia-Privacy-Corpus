  "content": "Today's extract from What do we mean by local?* is by Les Reid, political correspondent of the Coventry Telegraph and also a contributor to national titles. He speaks up for regional journalism by pointing out what reporters can achieve on behalf of their communities... Many journalists in the local media remain serious about their scrutinising role. They know they are there to challenge what they are told. They know deadlines or staff shortages often require them to simply and quickly attribute views from all sides, however distorting that might be. Yet there remains much scope for local newspaper journalists to challenge, to comment, to criticise. The good news is that the internet offers far more space for than was ever possible in print. Journalists can use live blogs to put politicians on the spot in the run up to elections, or provide live coverage from public debates hosted by newspapers. The opportunity remains in local newspaper organisations to critically interview national politicians, particularly when they visit localities. There is potential scope, even in a 10-minute interview for writing and website broadcast, to challenge way beyond the prevailing national media discourse of rolling 24-hour news. The centralisation of \"openness\" and information processing at public bodies through communications departments has made things worse for journalists since the 1990s. Back then, expert council officers were readily available for specialist newspaper journalists to interview and grill. Now, all too often responses to questions come back in email format, with little scope within deadline for supplementary questions. Yet local journalism continues to put pressure on the flow of information, and can use its power to expose when local authorities fail to meet their constitutional commitment to \"openness\" and \"transparency\". The skill of a political journalist remains partly to get to know political insiders, particularly the wags who calculate they have a political motive for delivering off-record briefings about manoeuvrings in the so-called corridors of power. Twitter is a fast-moving source of opinion and information which can be useful to journalists. It has also provided another new theatre for the playing out of age-old jostling between journalists and politicians. Politicians use it to heavily spin and indulge in one-upmanship with each other, using the distorting narratives of party politics. Yet local politicians regularly explicitly and implicitly make clear to me they remain very concerned about coverage in local newspapers and websites. Despite circulation decline, they worry. They get jittery. It is why many continue to brief me on a regular basis, and why they continue to employ PR professionals to help guide them. On more serious matters, there is much scope to hold to account local MPs \u2013 just as with Westminster frontbenchers. My role in the MPs' expenses scandal My work during the MPs' expenses scandal in 2009 involved me using the still powerful lever of a regional newspaper to request of nine MPs in Coventry and Warwickshire that they hand over to me their unedited expenses files. It was in the weeks when the Daily Telegraph was publishing its investigation, after gaining sole access to the leaked unedited expenses files of every MP. That leak, and the admirable efforts of freedom of information campaigner Heather Brooke to force parliament to release MPs' expenses, gave me further leverage in making my request to all local MPs. What came back was material that would have otherwise been redacted with the censorial big black marker pen following parliament's interpretation of the high court and information tribunal rulings of what should be released. My simple request to the nine MPs amounted to an unspoken yet obvious straight choice \u2013 hand over your full expenses files, or face accusations in the local press of covering up. Eight of nine MPs agreed to my request and I set about a forensic auditing process of every line of thousands of expenses claims, files and supporting documents. Only the then defence secretary Bob Ainsworth (Labour, Coventry North East) refused. He had earlier voted in the Commons to completely block the release of MPs' expenses. What became immediately apparent to me in scrutinising the files was the severity of the Commons authorities' censorship proposals - which MPs had at that stage been asked to check and approve. Red crosses and highlighted markings indicated what deletions they were suggesting would comply, perversely, with the freedom of information rulings. One of the barristers acting for Ms Brooke and other campaigners \u2013 Hugh Tomlinson QC \u2013 who had challenged Commons speaker Michael Martin's attempts to block MPs' expenses being released, told me that, in his view, the suggested redactions I revealed to him went well beyond what the high court ruling allowed. Proposed redactions included not just sensitive personal data such as MPs' addresses and bank account details, but emails and other correspondence between MPs and Commons' fees office officials which revealed controversial claims and over-claims, some of which had been declined. It became one focus of my MPs' expenses investigation and campaign in the Coventry Telegraph. We put pressure on the Commons' authorities, with support from some local MPs, in calling for them to be less censorial in the public interest. Our campaign provoked personal responses from then Prime Minister Gordon Brown and then opposition Conservative leader David Cameron. Much of my work was also published in The Guardian. My work also uncovered overclaims made by several MPs which they told me they had been previously unaware of. They agreed to pay the money back immediately. The Commons auditor Sir Thomas Legg later agreed with those findings. I performed this entirely independent work before the Daily Telegraph published its own reports on some of those individual MPs' expenses claims. Whereas Meriden Conservative MP Caroline Spelman \u2013 now a cabinet minister \u2013 appeared in the Daily Telegraph's \"saints list\" because of her relative low \"second homes\" expenses claims, I was able to exclusively report to her constituents that she was claiming around \u00a310,000 a year just for council tax, utility bills and cleaning for her country mansion. It was one of three expensive properties owned by her and management consultant husband Mark Spelman, whom I revealed had used the same address as his main residence when standing to become a Conservative MEP. Again, this work, first published in the local press, was picked up by several national newspapers. Much original and scrutinising work by local press journalists remains a source of much national media coverage. While no clear wrongdoing within the flawed and previously clandestine MPs' expenses system was alleged in Mrs Spelman's case\u2026 my work raised questions about whether MPs were really making claims, or choosing lifestyles, in line with the Green Book rules. These stipulated expenses should only be incurred \"wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the course of their parliamentary duties\". The answer for many lay somewhere in the murky grey area of moral interpretation about this particular expenditure of taxpayers' money. A letter from one of her constituents published days later in the Coventry Telegraph attacking our \"scurrilous\" journalism probably indicated we had done something right. Will local journalism be valued? To summarise, local journalism is far from perfect. Yes, technological and economic changes have put close to unsustainable pressure on staffing levels, and threaten further instability and uncertainty. However, examples from my own experience illustrate the flaws in any polarised assumption that local journalism already no longer has the power, skill or will to hold political and other power to account, on behalf of people. Whether this type of journalism has commercial viability in future, alongside other forms of community-based news, will partly depend on the extent to which it is valued in communities. In the digital age, it will not only be professional journalists working for traditional media organisations who are doing this important work. At the local level, there will continue to be far fewer professional journalists than in the 1990s, more reliance on reader contributions, and those of the amateur \"citizen journalist\". Yet it is an important role that will continue as long as there are those working and investing in local journalism who want it to.
