A Senate hearing on Friday into Australia's telecommunications interception laws was told by Vodafone that retaining the type of data the federal government was pushing for would come at a substantial cost. Under current telecommunications laws, almost any local, state and federal government agency can gain warrantless access to Australia's web and phone data if it is not considered content. This means they can request phone and web logs, location history and IP addresses. The federal government has indicated as part of its third tranche of national security legislation that it will seek to enforce a scheme that would force telecommunications companies to keep their data for up to two years. But Vodafone's general manager of industry strategy and public policy, Matthew Lobb, told the committee there were a number of issues that needed to be resolved; telecommunications companies ability to retain IP metadata, the number of agencies that could make requests for their data, and the length of time for any storage of data. \"There are three main policy considerations that we think do need public consultation. The first is the capability of moving to a regime of data storage of IP metadata,\" he said. \"At this stage the IP identifier system within telcos is in its infancy. It has not been a traditional capability that has been part of the way we store data, but it is evolving.\" When questioned about the costs of establishing the infrastructure necessary to build a retention scheme of this sort, Lobb said: \"Our estimates were in the tens of millions of dollars\". Vodafone's views on costs echoed similar remarks from iiNet in a previous hearing, where the company also suggested that much of the cost would be transferred to consumers. Chris Berg, from the Institute of Public Affairs, also told the inquiry that retaining more data also increased the risks involved in data security. \"When you store data you create a risk or access, whether that's lawful or unlawful access. One of the issues society is grappling with now is that data is hard to secure.\" Victoria's public interest monitor also called for greater oversight of the warrantless personal data request scheme. The deputy public interest monitor, Joanne Smith, said the creation of their office in Victoria had seen a reduction in the number of authorisations for data sought by government agencies. \"There is a benefit in having a public interest monitor who does have an oversight role,\" she said. \"The number of applications initially seemed to have reduced once we commenced operation. There was a larger number of operations prior to the public interest monitor coming into being.\" In an unusual move Telstra was also compelled to appear before the inquiry to give evidence. It conceded during the appearance that it was able to track the web browsing data in one instance \u2013 described as a \"unique\" situation \u2013 that was then passed on to a government agency. James Shaw, director of government relations at Telstra, said: \"That report related to one occasion in which we had passed that information across that was an almost unique instance \u2026 it took a lot of time and manual intervention.\" He added that while Telstra did not hold data that would allow records to be compared to determine web browsing, their network \"does generate data related to internet usage\". The Centre for Internet Safety's Alastair MacGibbon, who is a former federal police officer, told the inquiry that while metadata was important for criminal investigations, there needed to be greater safeguards in its access. \"We do need to limit the number of agencies that access metadata,\" he said. \"In my view, while I'm sure there are cases that would justify local councils accessing this, I'm not sure local rangers should. \"We should make sure that it is an appropriate offence for the information sought. \"Pretty much any offence is now a serious type of offence and I think we need to very narrowly define the types of offences for which this information is sought.\"",
