If you've ever cut out something from a magazine, collected stickers in the playground, or made a photowall of your favourite postcards, chances are you'll understand the attraction of Pinterest.. Dubbed the \"Tumblr for mums\", Pinterest allows people to create online displays of their likes and interests \u2013 from home decor to nail art \u2013 by \"pinning\" images and videos on to virtual boards. It has grown rapidly in the last six months, driven largely by tech blogs and word of mouth. Reliable figures on the site's 12m monthly unique users are hard to come by, as the 10-strong team in Palo Alto, California, went quiet after Pinterest's popularity surged, but its reported \"pinners\" in the US are somewhere between 57% and 97% female. Early figures suggest the gender balance of the UK's 200,000 users is more even. The year-old site started as an idea for a online catalogue where friends could share tastes. Early adopters include crafters, foodies and creatives who jumped on the easy way to store sources of inspiration and share ideas in an online moodboard. Those who are self-confessed \"pinddicts\" talk of a need to organise and compartmentalise in a digitally scatty world. The most popular boards are on weddings, planning and food, making the grid-like homepage look like Good Housekeeping from the 1980s. Pin etiquette advises users to \"avoid self-promotion\" and to \"be nice\", which makes the site feel like a safe haven away from trolls and online haters \u2013 one of the possible reasons it has been a hit among new mums. Guardian weekend columnist Sali Hughes uses Pinterest to nurture a fashion obsession \u2013 and says it satiates curtain-twitching nosiness and the curious feeling of walking through someone else's home. \"I'm quite obsessive about products \u2013 clothes, home details, flowers and all those things. Pinterest is the only social network which caters for that. And it's also bloody useful \u2013 sometimes you bookmark something and you can't remember why, but Pinterest is a visual reminder. \"I think the reason women joined is it's compulsive sharing. It's creative and pretty and it's also completist \u2013 it's a great feeling when you finish a lovely board. It also makes you crystallise what it is you love.\" Companies are quickly cottoning on to Pinterest potential \u2013 creating boards that reflect brand lifestyles, like Wholefood's strength board, or behind-the-scenes boards like the US Today's anchor antics (and the Guardian is on Pinterest too). One of people's favourite boards is called Things I think women like, as a man (a satire), while one of cofounder Ben Silberman's favourites is on household weapons, and there are boards on everything from Pantone colour palettes to Harold Pinter tributes. Anecdotally, male users say they \"don't get\" Pinterest, aren't interested in creating visual aides for real-life decision making, or don't see the need to have an image-based bookmarking site. The site also doesn't lend itself to boards around technology, although high-profile pinner and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg co-created a pinboard of iPhone home screens. One of Technology blog Mashable's top boards is on infographics, and Mashable's community manager, Meghan Peters, thinks Pinterest is here to stay: \"The site has quickly struck a chord with a mainstream audience \u2013 a difficult feat for a new social network. Its novel design allows users to experience the web in a way that makes them feel productive and inspired. In addition, there's plenty of monetisation opportunities with brands (retailers in particular) jumping on the bandwagon.\" Pinterest is pegged on to the idea of sharing \u2013 which this week raised questions of copyright about pinning original content from photographers and publishers \u2013 but it's something avid pinners fiercely defend. Cardiff photographer Pippa Bennet says it suits her work perfectly: \"It gets my photography recognised and seen without me having to shove it down anyone's throat. I can also interact with potential clients in a totally novel way. If they like what they see of my photos or they see other things I've pinned, they can go look at my other boards and see what, beyond my own photographs, I enjoy.\"",
