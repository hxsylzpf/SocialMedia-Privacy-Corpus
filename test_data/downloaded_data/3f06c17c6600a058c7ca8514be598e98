  "content": "The paparazzi pursuit of Kate Middleton is again so severe that Prince William's former girlfriend has made two complaints to police since the weekend. Ms Middleton complained after incidents yesterday and on Saturday night when photographers pursued her across London while she was driving her car in dangerous conditions. According to a source with knowledge of the incidents, Ms Middleton confronted one photographer yesterday who said: \"We are sorry Kate we are having to do this, the newspapers are all pressing us for photographs.\" Yesterday up to 10 cars containing photographers are understood to have pursued Ms Middleton while she was driving in London. She stopped her car to complain and told the paparazzi that they were harassing her. According to the source, Ms Middleton asked one photographer to stop, who replied: \"We are not doing so because we know you aren't going to do anything.\" On Saturday, in weather conditions described as appalling, four cars containing photographers are said to have tailgated Ms Middleton's car as she drove in London. Some of the cars came alongside her to attempt to take photographs of her, forcing Ms Middleton to stop her car, the source said. She told photographers they were scaring and harassing her, but according to the source the photographers did not stop their pursuit. The incidents are understood to have prompted Ms Middleton's lawyer, Gerard Tyrell of Harbottle &amp; Lewis, to warn that he will take action against the paparazzi. Ms Middleton is also said to have made two complaints this week to the police about the paparazzi's behaviour. In addition, the Press Complaints Commission has privately let national newspaper editors know of Ms Middleton's concerns. Ms Middleton was photographed on Sunday attending the Concert for Diana at Wembley stadium, where she was seated near her former boyfriend, Prince William. Media interest in Ms Middleton has resumed following a report in the Mail on Sunday that she had secretly resumed her relationship with Prince William. This has not been confirmed. Separately, the Sun has warned other newspapers not to republish a photograph of Kate Middleton and Prince William enjoying a candlelit drink after the Wembley concert, which it ran as a picture exclusive on Tuesday July 3 on page one and five of the paper. Paparazzi agency Big Pictures forwarded the image to rival picture desks in error, but the Sun has warned that it has exclusive publication rights to the images. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
