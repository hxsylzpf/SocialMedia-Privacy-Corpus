  "content": "Media lawyers today said the \"insignificant\" amount of damages awarded to Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas showed English courts do not consider \"personal distress\" or breaches of privacy deserving of large pay outs. They said the award of \u00a314,600 to the Hollywood couple, who sought \u00a3600,000 in damages after Hello! magazine published sneaked paparazzi shots of their wedding, was in keeping with tradition. \"Distress without financial loss has never rated highly in English courts,\" Alex Carter-Silk, the head of media technology and intellectual property at Manches. \"There's a fairly strong tradition in the courts that if you can show the commercial loss you get paid - but if you can't, you don't,\" he added. Lawyers representing the Douglases and OK! insisted the total damages of \u00a31,047,756 received in the case was a joint award, and discounted press reports that the Hollywood couple had sought a total of \u00a3600,000 in damages, comprising \u00a3500,000 for breach of confidence and \u00a350,000 each for personal distress. However, in his ruling today, Mr Justice Lindsay clearly stated the Douglases would receive \u00a314,600 but in a indication that OK! had suffered significant damage, it ordered Hello! to pay \u00a31,033,756 in damages to its arch-rival. The award to the Douglases breaks down into \u00a33,750 each for distress plus expenses and a nominal sum under the Data Protection Act. Mr Carter-Silk added that if OK! had backed out of the deal and the Douglases had been able to prove Hello!'s actions had led to financial loss, then the damages might have been higher. \"What he [the judge] is saying is that the breach didn't cause the loss, which seems to me eminently sensible,\" Mr Carter-Silk said. OK!, on the other hand, was able to provide evidence of the commercial loss it suffered as a result of the spoiler operation. \"If you're involved in an accident for pain and suffering you get very little, if you're off work you get a lot. That principle extends through English law,\" Mr Carter-Silk said. Jennifer McDermott, an expert in media litigation at Lovells, said the low sum showed courts are not yet recompensing celebrities in cases involving invasion of their privacy. \"It's great news for OK! and other newspapers that enter into exclusive deals. I think this must be one of the largest ever awards of damages for a spoiler,\" Ms McDermott said. \"On the other hand, we don't yet have a proper law of privacy in this country. It's still developing and the judge looked at the cases where people have got awards for breach of confidence/privacy and they are in a very low scale and he therefore pitched Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones \u00a33,750 each for distress. That seems to me a very small amount. \"We're a long way yet from getting the sort of damages that people should get if their privacy has been invaded. \"If you compare it with a libel claim it would be the most anodyne of libels that would attract an award of this amount.\" When Naomi Campbell sued the Daily Mirror for revealing she had attended a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, the high court awarded her \u00a33,500 for breach of confidence and data protection. The court of appeal later overturned the awards and Campbell is currently taking her case to the House of Lords. Another lawyer, Anthony Burton, described the total sum which Hello! must pay in damages as a \"massive award\". \"The damages awarded to the Douglases are small compared with what they requested. At the same time they have always said they weren't seeking any monetary reward or gain over this,\" he told Sky News. \"The judge accepted that there had been distress and that distress included wondering which friend of theirs might have betrayed them. \"It isn't a significant sum of money. What is significant is it's a step forward for those who have valuable image rights to protect. But for those who do not have valuable image rights to protect it doesn't seem to advance the law for them.\" The costs in the case have yet to be decided, however they are believed to be huge, possibly as much as \u00a34m. Mr Burton agreed this was an \"enormous sum of money\", but said: \"It's probably commensurate with the usual costs when you're employing that level of expertise.\" Following a six-week legal battle at the high court earlier this year, Mr Justice Lindsay ruled Hello! had breached commercial confidence when it published unauthorised photographs taken at wedding of Zeta Jones and Douglas at the New York Plaza hotel in November 2000. However, he made it clear he was not ruling on the grounds of breach of privacy. Hello! magazine today said it was \"very pleased\" at the sum awarded to the Douglases, but \"disappointed\" at being forced to pay over \u00a31m to its competitor. Sally Cartwright, Hello!'s publisher, cast doubt on whether OK! could really have lost the 1.4m sales it claimed, and said the magazine would almost certainly appeal against the part of the judgement which related to the re-use of the unauthorised photos in the Sun and the Daily Mail. She added the ruling would have \"alarming consequences\" for the common practice in the print media of running a spoiler operation, and would potentially restrain freedom of expression. In a statement, the representatives of the Douglases and OK! described the damages award as \"historic\", and said Hello!'s publication of the sneaked pictures as \"very seriously damaged\" sales of OK!. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857",
