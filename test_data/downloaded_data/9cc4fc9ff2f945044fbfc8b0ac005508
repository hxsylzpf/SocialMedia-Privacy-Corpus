And one of the most elegant we've seen is this lovely piece of work from UrbanTick. This is how they did it: The data is derived from tweets sent via a mobile device that includes the location at the time of sending the message. The contours correspond to the density of tweets, the mountains rise over active locations and cliffs drop down in to calm valleys, flowing out to tweet deserts. Throughout the emerging landscape features have been renamed to reflect these conditions. So London now looks like this, with the highest peak Soho Mountain, extending Eastward towards Liverpool Street: And Paris like this: And here's New York: They got the data from their rather lovely Tweet-o-Meter, which measures Tweets in the most active Twitter locations around the world and is a joint project by CASA, University College London Any other Twitter geo visualisations we should be looking at?
