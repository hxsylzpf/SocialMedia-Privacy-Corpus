  "content": "\"It's like the government devolving power to librarians to decide what books people can read (based on requests from the public) and then locking those books away.\" That's Index on Censorship describing the European court of justice's \"right to be forgotten\" ruling. Index has previously warned (here and here and here) that the failure to include clear checks and balances, or any form of proper oversight, would be problematic. In its latest statement, Index argues: \"Private companies like Google \u2013 no matter how broad and noble their advisory board might be on this issue \u2013 should not be the final arbiters of what should and should not be available for people to find on the internet... There's no appeal mechanism, no transparency about how Google and others arrive at decisions about what to remove or not, and very little clarity on what classifies as 'relevant'\". Index wants to see this \"flabby ruling... challenged on many fronts\".",
