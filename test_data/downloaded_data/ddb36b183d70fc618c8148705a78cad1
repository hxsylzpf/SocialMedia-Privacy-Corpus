  "content": "It's becoming clearer that we're moving towards some new form of independent press regulation that is neither statutory nor mandatory in nature. Much of the discussion inside and outside the Leveson inquiry focuses on how newspapers can be persuaded or \"incentivised\" to sign up for what will still be in essence a voluntary regulatory framework. In my new report for the Carnegie UK Trust, Better Journalism in the Digital Age, I suggest that a key incentive for participation could be based on the existing conventions around press accreditation and recognition \u2013 an idea supported by Paul Dacre at the Leveson inquiry on Monday. There are many benefits from being designated as a serious news organisation and it is reasonable for wider society to say that you should get those advantages only if you are willing to adhere to editorial standards and ethical obligations. In his blog, Roy Greenslade says this won't work because there aren't really any benefits and anyway this would be a form of licensing of newspapers. In fact, recognised news media get access to events that are closed to the public, they get advance copies of significant reports, they get often-subsidised facilities at parliamentary and other public venues, they get thousands of press officers all over the country paid to answer their questions promptly and accurately. The public investment in all of this is huge, because it is rightly felt that journalism is important to a well-informed and healthy democracy. This privileged club already exists with what is effectively informal licensing through the issuing of press passes and the accreditation requirements of various public and private bodies. But unlike most clubs, there are very few duties or obligations in return for the benefits and a new balance has to be struck. Once established, a new independent regulator can ask for registration by all those news suppliers who wish to be acknowledged as serious and principled organisations. Participating media can display a recognised standards mark on their various outlets. What do we gain from this idea? It provides a clear link between benefits and obligations for serious news organisations. It provides a commercial imperative \u2013 a market incentive, if you like \u2013 for participation. It means that press regulation remains voluntary rather than statutory. It does nothing that interferes with editorial freedom. Very importantly, it lets the public know the nature and status of what they are looking at \u2013 no standards label, then no guarantee of standards. It includes those websites and digital services that provide news content and can also include future forms of media as they evolve. It is your purpose that determines membership, not your platform. And it is society that sets the standards for news media, not governments or politicians. Roy asks why sporting bodies should pay any attention. Turn the question around. Why would Manchester United open up their news conferences and make their players available to supposed news suppliers who won't accept a code of ethical and editorial standards? Why would anyone? The Carnegie UK Trust report makes it clear that stronger or smarter regulation is not enough on its own to strengthen the supply of good journalism in the UK. We have other suggestions on actions that need to be taken. So, please read the report and join the debate.
