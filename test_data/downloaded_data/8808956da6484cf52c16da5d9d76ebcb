  "content": "Charles Arthur: how does Creative Commons makes its money? Where is the money coming from? Joi Ito: I beg. (laughs) CA: Is that sort of the classic problem with the sharealike style corporation? JI: Or non-profit. We could come up with a business model - we're thinking about it - I was on board of icann, but they make a bazillion dollars, they make $50m or so CA: from registration? JI: From registration, and I'm on board of Mozilla, which gets about $70m from Google.. so business models are possible. Non-profits are difficult, but there are certain things that you have to do as a non-profits, the World Wide Web Consortum wouldn't be what it is if it wasn't nonprofit, and as a nonprofit it also has financial problems. Having said that, Icann has a business model that is a cause of a lot of their problems. Governance is a lot easier when you're a non-profit. CA: What are you in London to talk to people about? JI: I'm mostly here talking to people about Creative Commons, more listening than talking, trying to understand what the issues are here, what people are thinking, and trying to understand what we need to do, what we can do to help CA: What's the reaction \u2013 because the UK tends to be avery copyright-heavy kind of country compared to the US, where government data is made available for free because it's paid for by the people? In the UK the attitude is rather different, which is a very longstanding thing about copyright and data. JI: Creative Commons is a tool that is built on top of copyright, so in order for Creative Commons to exist, copyright has to exist, and in fact in countries where they have little or no copyright enforcement we're actually not that interesting, and Creative Commons is the most interesting in regimes where copyright is very complicated, yet people, some people, want to share, and then Creative Commons becomes a very important tool. So in fact in places where it's difficult - we're really a solution for failed sharing, where it's difficult for professors to share courseware, for students to do work together, for musicians to collaborate, and we provide a tool to help you do that. CA: You were an early investor in Flickr, which is one of the biggest examples of the use of Creative Commons. JI: Yes, they have over 100 million Creative Commons images. CA: Has that success at Flickr been translated into an understanding of what Creative Commons is about? JI: I think it's been hugely important, it has created a dialog, created a great deal of understanding; of the 250m or so licences, of them 100m are for Flickr, but not included in that quarter billion is Wikipedia which just several months ago [in June] has converted to Creative Commons licence, and I think everyone understand Wikipedia. So Flickr was the first and most important user of Creative Commons, but now we've got the White House, Ridley Scott, Al-Jazeera, Gwen Stefani, and Trent Reznor using Creative Commons so I think it's starting to ripple out, but Flickr was the most important initial user. CA: What's different about the way that musicians are using Creative Commons - you mentioned a number there - compared to the way that photographers or other people would use it? JI: We have a whole range of licences. We have six basic licences ranging from \"just give me attribution, you can do what you want\" to \"you can't create derivative works or use commercially\", or \"you can create derivates but must share back\". It depends who you are. We don't tell people what they should want to express; what we want to do is if you're a pro musician, we want you to express the copyright licence you want technically and legally very easily and clearly. Typically a professional musician will choose a licence that prohibits commercial reuse, to protect their income which usually comes in from copyright - not always the case - but for instance a photographer, especially an amateur photographer may say \"what I want is to be well known\", so they focus on attribution. Documentary producers often use a \"no derivatives\" licence because don't want the story to change, but their point is to tell the story so they will allow commercial use, so for instance that a movie theatre could show it. It really depends on the use. Educators for instance are by and large encouraged to use just attribution, because it's very important to allow textbook manufacturers to reprint educational material to allow it to finish its path. The different categories of people use different categories for different reasons. CA: One question that's come up is whether licences have been tested in court and shown to have a legal standing. What's the status there? JI: First of all there's these sorts of licences in general, these free licences or things like artistic licences. That was actually tested in court - not Creative Commons but very similar - in the US federal appeals court last year. It gets somewhat technical, but the original discussion was it's a contract, if you haven't signed it are you liable if someone breaches it, but the US Federal court decided that a breach of licence is actually a breach of copyright so you become a copyright infringer if you don't follow the stipulations in the licence, so we don't have to have this conversation about if it's a contract or not. And then specifically one of the most well known cases is Adam Curry, the former MTV DJ, who sued a publication in the Netherlands for not providing attribution and he won using a Creative Commons licence. And there are others. But they're slow, even old licences like the GPL there have been only a few cases. But we hope you don't have to go to court, and we depend a lot on the community and the normative part to be the thing that helps people conform to licences. CA: While you've been in London you've spoken to a number of companies including EMI and music companies. What sort of interest are they taking in Creative Commons? JI: Broadly speaking most of the progressive record labels are relatively interested in talking to us now. It's still mostly artists - but there are very few record companies who we aren't in discussion with. Usually we're talking to them on ideas on using Creative Commons for marketing, helping them understand the way that our technology works. One important thing is that we have worked with the World Wide Web Consortium to create a recommendation called the RDFa - resource definition framework in attributes - basically it's a way to put copyright information into HTML. This isn't just Creative Commons licences; this will help anybody who wants to express who is the owner of this object, bla bla bla, so that when you copy and paste an object from the web the copyright information comes along with it. In that context anyone interested in copyright should be interested in what we're doing with the W3C, and as you can imagine internet standards bodies are relatively difficult to work with, especially if you're not from the community, and so we're trying very hard also to educate a variety of industry associations and others on the idea of RDFa and the Creative Commons rights expression language. CA: What would be a key thing for the advancement of the Creative Commons? What would be the next step it would need to take to really break through into the consciousness of the people who need to be conscious of it? JI: It's a good question. If you look at our adoption curve, it's growing geometrically. The number of countries adopting it continues to increase, and the categories of people using it - so now scientists and educators and things like that - so I feel just looking at it statistically, we're growing very quickly, and we've gone from several years ago having to really evangelise it to now spending nearly all of our time just working with the people who want to use the licence, and helping them make sure they use it correctly. For me most people still don't know what Creative Commons is, but those people who are concerned about sharing and have run into the problem that Creative Commons solves - which is to lower the friction of sharing whether you're a producer or a government, the White House uses a Creative Commons licence - they all come to use for help. In that sense I think it's just a matter of time, and I think we've gotten to the point where, whether it's WIPO or RIAA or record labels, most of them not all of them, but most of them understand now that we are not anti-copyright and we are not out to get them or to fight them, and we're really a technical standard and an interoperability standard, and we're really trying to help people to express their choices, not trying to convince people to make certain choices. CA: So it's not like an open source vs Microsoft conflict at all? JI: Um..(pause) no, I don't think so. There are some people whose business models become difficult when Creative Commons becomes popular, just because it shifts the attention. It's like Wikipedia probably is not that exciting for Britannica; when you create huge bodies of shared content there are certain people who become unhappy. So there are definitely people who don't like it. But it has - we have much fewer enemies than - a lot of the enemies we used to have misunderstood our mission, and so they have changed. But there are people who just don't want change, and for those people I think it's difficult, because what we're enabling is legal change - meaning changing in a legal way. We're kind of stuck actually between two extremes, where there are certain people who are what I would call abolitionist and certain people who are pro-piracy, basically want to abolish copyright; and there are people who want to not allow any sharing because it destroys their business model and want everything to be controlled. But most of the people are sort of in between, and we enable everybody in between. Although I will say that we are creating tools that allow people to waive all of their rights, and we feel that in cases like government-created data and genome data and scientific data, that it should be contributed to the public domain, and so we're creating tools like that. But it's usually communities of people who believe that. CA: Is it right that you had to create a new flavour of the Creative Commons licence for the White House? JI: The White House - it's slight complicated - the White House itself has, the content that the US government creates, they are under a US government licence which is public domain in the US, and they use Creative Commons for third-party content that's uploaded to the WH page. There are some government agencies which are using our tool which is called Creative Commons zero which allows the government to dedicate content and data to the public and is usable worldwide. In fact some US government content is considered restricted outside the US, so there's some complexity here that we're trying to help resolve. CA: On another tack, you're a venture capitalist, you were an early investor in Last fm, you're an early investor in Twitter. A lot of people are interested by It's rumoured it's going to get some extra investment. Is that true? JI: Yes, there is that rumour (laughs). CA: Is it true? JI: I can't really say. I can't speak on behalf of Twitter. It's possible. (laughs). CA: The other question that keeps hanging over Twitter is how is it going to monetise itself? How is it going to start making money back? What is your understanding of the plans there? JI: Well, again, I'm not authorised to speak on behalf of he company but can speak generally about internet companies, which is that almost all the companies that I've invested in that have failed, or that I see fail, have business models, great products, have pretty good teams but they have no users. Getting users, getting distribution, getting attention, becoming viral - that's the single most difficult thing on the internet to do. And just about every product fails because they don't have any users. Entrepreneurs tend not to focus on that. There are very few companies that have been able to get to tens of mills of users that have failed, other than for being sued or some other reason like that. The other thing is that the people who would pay you for things, like carriers or big companies, typically don't want to talk to you until you have tens of millions of users. If you have a thousand users and you go to British Telecom and say \"I want to come up with a business model with you guys\", they're not going to sit at the table with you. So the focus on user growth initially may sound like an internet bubble-era way of thinking about things; but if you think about statistically what's suCreative Commonsessful and what's not, that is usually the suCreative Commonsessful thing, to focus on the virality and the user growth; and once you have that, what you look at is \"who are we benefiting?\" When Twitter grows, SMS [text message] usage goes up. Sites are now able to promote across friends' networks; traffic to certain kinds of sites increases; and you can search, and use Twitter traffic for doing search. People can sell, they can tell stories, there's a lot of things Twitter enables. And as a normal internet company would do, we'd look at \"Who's benefiting the most in this value chain? Where is there the least friction to get paid?\", and then \"How do we come up with a business model?\" Twitter has a bunch of very smart biz dev [business development] people right now thinking about all the various things. In Japan we're actually doing a lot of experimentations, we're running advertising on Twitter, we've got a Twitter portal, and we're talking to a variety of different partners, so there's little bits of monetisation experimentation going on right now, but I can't say for sure what's going to be the big thing. CA: In your view if you look at that value chain, which part of the value chain with Twitter has the money that can be most easily moved into Twitter's coffers? JI: It's pretty hard to say, but I will say that mobile is globally one of the areas that has significant growth in revenue for a lot of players. If you look at Japan, the companies that are growing are the mobile companies, selling hundreds of millions of dollars each on avatars for mobile phones and ringtones and games. I think mobile will be an important part of the strategy. CA: Is that the mobile user or the mobile network paying Twitter? JI: That I can't say for sure, because we're benefiting both of them. I used to run Infoseek, I was chairman of Infoseek Japan, and when I first used infoseek it was trying to charge the user for search. (Pause.) Didn't work, right, but there was still clearly value. And then eventually we figured out - I think Infoseek was one of the first to sell banners by CPM [cost per thousand impressions], and we figured that business model out. But if you have a clear value, you may experiment and find out that one way of collecting money is going to work better than another. But if you have the users and the traffic, you can experiment and iterate and usually figure out a way to make some money. Not always, but usually. I dodged your question. I'm not sure. CA: But you're not worried about Twitter burning out before it finds a way to go cash-positive? JI: I'm always worried, and there's always a possibility that you don't find the model. But if you just look historically, there are very few companies that have gotten to the scale that Twitter has, with the cash that they'll have, that have become zero - except for maybe some of the music piracy-related things, or other things that have run into liability issues and things like that. There are certain areas, like some of the Chinese companies, where you don't have the fundamental monetisation. One thing that is important is - people make fun of internet advertising as a business model, but if you think about it in the US, and now to a certain extent Japan, and more in Europe, you have a huge value chain that starts with e-commerce. E-commerce depends on payment systems and logistics, and that creates businesses like eBay and Dell and Amazon. So if you look at the big spenders on online advertising, it's the people who monetise traffic most directly, and that's the bulk of the money that goes in. But they can convert traffic directly into money. And there's the people who are a little bit more indirect, but there's a tremendous amount of e-commerce that drives the cash that goes into the websites, and that's why for instance in the US the value of ads is so high, it's because the infrastructure is there. I think that when you look globally the infrastructure for e-commerce isn't available in a lot of of countries, so while you may have a lot of traffic, you don't necessarily have al lot of money. Having said that, mobile - people pay directly through mobile, and mobile carriers do the proxy, so it's kind of interesting to look at the internet ecologies where you have e-commerce and web, versus the ecologies where you don't have e-commerce but you have mobile. I think that the strategies for those markets will be slightly different. This isn't speaking just about Twitter - but just generally. CA: Thank you very much.",
