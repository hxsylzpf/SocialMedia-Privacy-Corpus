  "content": "Balenciaga, one of fashion's hottest labels, took inspiration from Bernie Sanders for its most recent collection at Paris fashion week. But what would Bernie himself look like in the oversized, feel the Bern-branded scarfs and quirkily proportioned bomber jackets? Well, pretty good, if a little bit sheepish, if the zeitgeist-y Instagram art account @Siduations is anything to go by. The account has been tickling the fashion industry, picking up steam during the autumn/winter shows. Its most successful posts place some of the more unusual items of high-fashion in everyday situations. There is a model in a Chanel metallic wrap stuck next to marathon runners shrouded in foil, and an impossibly fluffy Commes des Gar\u00e7ons felt dress looking like tumble-dryer fluff. The idea, says Sidney Prawatyotin, the man behind the memes, is not to make fun of the unwearability of some fashion items. \"I love fashion. I hope none of the designers think I'm making fun of them,\" he says. Having worked in fashion PR for the past 15 years, Prawatyotin has an obvious respect for what designers do. And, he says, while you might think that some of these garments aren't made to be worn, just look at street-style stars pulling them off. \"I often think, who's going to buy this? But I look at the [street style] pictures and it's like, people will buy this.\" The idea for the account started when he saw a picture his friend, the actor Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, had posted of herself on Instagram. In it she is wearing a floor-length Prada dress and is on a basketball court \u2013 not a natural combination, you might think. And neither did Prawatyotin \u2013 he put a basketball emoji on it and sent it back to her as a playful lol. Sevigny posted it to her account. Having recently moved to Los Angeles from his native New York, he was spending more time on social media as a way to see what friends were up to. Prawatyotin started making these little pictoral gifts for friends, repurposing pictures they had posted on Instagram. You only need to look at Zoolander's cult status in the industry to know that fashion \u2013 despite the poker face \u2013 likes to laugh at itself. After all, the first rule of fashion is: definitely talk about fashion, even if that is to rib the absurdities.",
