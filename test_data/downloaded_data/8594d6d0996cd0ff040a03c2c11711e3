  "content": "Wherever you go in the world, people are too busy checking their phones to really appreciate their surroundings. It's so disappointing. Focusing on their breathtakingly impressive technological devices that allow access to endless information and constant communication with hundreds of friends, rather than looking up and acknowledging the unparalleled beauty of a decaying bus stop? Or a nondescript caf\u00e9 wall? Or a public toilet? People are so shallow! We are in the midst of a selfie epidemic. The World Health Organisation is stockpiling selfie vaccines as we speak, which are weakened pictures of yourself injected into the bloodstream to allow your immune systems to fight them off. Probably. I don't know. People document every moment of their lives, and now this culture has infiltrated academia. Who'd have thought that academia would behave similarly to the human society of which it is a part? It boggles the mind. Before I go further, let me explain; I am not a cranky old professor, or a student, criticising the use of online communication by scientists, in an online article, with no apparent sense of irony. I'm a jobbing lecturer/tutor whose attempts to produce publishable research were thwarted by circumstance and bad luck, so I had scarce hope of a decent job in the current \"publish or perish\" climate that pervades academia far more insidiously and damagingly than an enthusiasm for Instagram. Embracing Twitter and the online world essentially saved my bacon and allowed me to provide for my family. But that's just me. I'm probably the only person to miss out on a lucrative science career due to bad luck, it's not like the field is oversubscribed and competition fierce or anything. Everyone knows becoming a successful scientist is just a matter of working round the clock all day every day, communicating with as few people as possible and having no life outside the lab, so what's the point of social media? Using social media to impress people with your research and other projects has now become a professional concern for many academics. Previously, they'd have to impress people by standing next to complicated posters in conferences and hoping an interested person wandered into their eye-line. Social media has clearly made this meticulously efficient method less productive, for reasons that definitely exist. When did it become acceptable to use your phone throughout a lecture or presentation? Sure, you may be spreading the presenter's work far and wide, increasing their potential audience by orders of magnitude, but that just means normal people might see it. Who wants that? Plus, you can't possibly be smart enough to both follow the presentation and tweet at the same time. If you were, you'd be an academic or something. Sadly, it appears (to me) that most of the people who share their work online do so purely as proof of their dedication to the profession, to mark them out as more enthusiastic than their peers. This is very sad. Before social networks, academia was essentially a communist utopia, where nobody ever self-aggrandised or showed any hint of ego. This is genuinely true, ask anyone who agrees with me. I suspect that this trend stems from careers advice gurus. \"Tweet every 19 seconds or future employers will think you're busy embezzling funds or injecting heroin in the stationary cupboard\" they say. Probably. I wouldn't know, I never had a careers advisor. My school didn't have the funding. We just had a CD-ROM which asked you questions about what you were interested in and then gave you a suggested job to go for based on these. I'm fairly sure it was random. It once even suggested I try being a \"careers advisor\", which seemed like some cruel joke in context. Perhaps I'm na\u00efve, but I need to believe that employability is not directly correlated to how many likes you get on social media. But no, I've lost count of the number of times I've been beaten to a job by someone who had more Twitter followers than me, or a better mastery of Instagram filters. Admittedly, I sometimes struggle to count to one, but the point still stands. I've even encountered some scientific staff who encourage social media use. I know many who don't talk too well to people in person but are happy to communicate online. It's as if science attracts socially awkward types who aren't outwardly confident in person but can use the safer and more ordered environments of social media and technology to communicate more freely and enthusiastically, and thus get greater enjoyment out of life? What a totally ridiculous notion! Some scientists even go further and express opinions about important issues like the EU referendum. They talk about things that are nothing to do with their work! Engaging with the public, who might not agree with them. This risks alienating the taxpayers who fund our work. Much better to maintain an illusion that we're all totally passive drones with no views of our own. I realise I am using the fact that our work is funded by taxes to argue that we should show utter deference to those outside our field, despite earlier condemning anyone who tries to share our work with the very people who pay for it. No, YOU'RE inconsistent! This social media craze in science has gone too far. Surely the dedication I show in the lab should be enough to get me promotions and respect? It's not like I'm a woman or anything. Why can't I just do my job and rely on everyone else recognising my brilliance and rewarding me in a manner that I feel I deserve? What's the point of academia if it doesn't conform to my own specific preferences?
