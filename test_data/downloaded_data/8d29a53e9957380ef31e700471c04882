  "content": "UK internet users have become significantly more cautious about how much personal information they reveal on social networking websites such as Facebook, according to a report by media regulator Ofcom. The twice-yearly report, a survey of the internet habits of 1,824 people aged 16 and over, found that since 2007 users have become more savvy about online security and are now more reluctant to provide personal information online. Ofcom's report found that 80% of those surveyed who have a social networking website are likely to only allow friends or family to see it. This is a significant seachange in attitude compared to 2007 when just 48% of those surveyed took such steps. The report has been published in a climate where the practices of social networking sites \u2013 Facebook in particular \u2013 have come under scrutiny for privacy and security practices. Earlier this month, EU data protection officials called Facebook's latest privacy changes \"unaceptable\" and the world's biggest social networking site has been embroiled in a controversy over \"panic buttons\" for child users. Almost half of adult internet users in Scotland say they have set up a social networking profile compared with 46% in Wales, 44% in England and 31% in Northern Ireland. However, about a quarter of internet users say they \"lack confidence\" in installing filtering software or security features. The report found that the Scottish were the least likely to worry about entering personal details online with 50% \"happy\" to enter their home address details on the internet, compared with 23% in Wales and Northern Ireland. More than 40% of Scottish adult internet users are also happy to enter credit card details. When it comes to trust in media, just 31% of internet users believe web content to be \"reliable and accurate\". This compares to about 50% of adults that trust television and radio content. However, news sites are trusted by 58% of web users. Adults in Scotland say they use the internet at home the most at 10.6 hours per week, with adults in England at 8.3 hours per week and those in Wales at 6.8 hours per week. Adults in Northern Ireland say they use the internet at home the least at 6.5 hours per week.",
