  "content": "The judge who startled the legal world by attempting to ban over his mobile phone publication of the name of Michael Fawcett, Prince Charles's aide, last night disclosed that he had done so in an effort to stop the name of the Prince of Wales coming out as well, in connection with the sexual allegation concerned. Mr Fawcett's QC, Desmond Browne, claimed to the judge sitting in his car in a traffic jam at 6.50pm, two hours before the Guardian's publishing deadline, that: \"The matter was one of extreme urgency as the Guardian was about to go to print.\" The judge said the essence of Mr Browne's case was that \"disclosure of Mr Fawcett's name would necessarily lead to the identifying of both Mr Fawcett and the senior member of the royal family\". He had therefore given him a new injunction, on top of one previously granted against the Mail on Sunday, in order to \"hold the ring\". Lawyers said last night that this may have reflected a misunderstanding of the law by a non-specialist judge who failed to hear the newspaper's side of the story. He had in fact changed the status quo, by disrupting a second newspaper proposing to run a different and true story, which was not banned by the terms of the original libel injunction. This was done in a way the libel courts normally frown upon. Mr Justice Henriques' detailed defence of his position marks a new level of frankness by the judiciary. But it also revealed the confusions that arise when judges rush to hand out media injunctions. Mr Justice Henriques maintained to Channel 4 News that he had ordered Desmond Browne, Mr Fawcett's lawyer, \"that he must give my phone number to his opponent so that he could make representations to me forthwith as to whether the injunction should remain in force\". But Mr Fawcett's solicitor told the Guardian a significantly different story. He faxed the newspaper saying: \"The judge said that if you wish to check the terms of the injunction with him, you could do so on his mobile number.\" Mr Justice Henriques last night, however, defended the present system of granting gagging injunctions over the phone. He said: \"An emergency applications judge is on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Applications are made by newspapers, the homeless, for asylum support, for bail.\" Judges dealt with them from their homes at night. \"They must also travel home and yet remain continuously available. There was nothing at all unusual in the granting of an interim injunction over the telephone.\" Widespread publicity followed the bungled injunction attempt on the Guardian, which was lifted at a full hearing by a specialist media judge, Mr Justice Tugendhat. This led Sir Michael Peat, Prince Charles' private secretary, to go public. An astonished world then find out last week that, although there was no evidence it was true, the tabloids wanted to print an allegation that Prince Charles and Mr Fawcett had been involved in a sexual incident. The attempt to use the machinery of the courts to silence newspapers had, in the event, precisely the opposite effect to that intended.",
