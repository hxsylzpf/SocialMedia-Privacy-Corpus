Over the past 10 years, matching Rowena Leder's example timescale (Letters, 9 August), I've acquired memories I wouldn't give up for the world. All of humanity is to be found online, the good and the bad. This August bank holiday I and many online friends will unite in grief to mark a year since the day a friend was torn from us by a drunk driver in Los Angeles, an exceptional young woman I feel privileged to have known, even for a brief time. Our loss is none the less for having lived an ocean away. I would ask Rowena Leder to lift her eyes to more and distant horizons.There are wonders there, even if there are also those we know and loathe as \"trolls\". Greg Brown Bromborough, Wirral \u2022 There is one sure way to end social media abuse (Report, 7 August). All social media should demand that users write only in their full and legal name (verified by the network) with attributable contacts. If you have things to say, have the guts to say who you are \u2013 and this must be enforced by law. Until very recently anonymous communications (\"poison pen letters\") were seen as contemptible. I am baffled as to why it is now acceptable to write anonymous messages across the broadest ever field of communication, and why the media seem so lenient to this magnet for spineless and warped inadequates.
