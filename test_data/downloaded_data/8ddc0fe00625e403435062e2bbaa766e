  "content": "\u2022 News that a legally blind hacker from Massachusetts has been sentenced to 11 years in prison for computer intrusion comes from Wired. Something relevant, perhaps, to the case of Gary McKinnon, who has been lobbying against his extradition to the US on the basis of being diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome? \u2022 Also in the courts, the case against Darryn Walker, the blogger charged under Britain's obscenity laws after writing a disturbing slashfic story about pop group Girls Aloud, has collapsed, says the Independent. \u2022 Our friends at Schulze and Webb have developed a nifty little app for iPlayer fanatics called Shownar: see what shows other people are talking about and then go and watch them.
