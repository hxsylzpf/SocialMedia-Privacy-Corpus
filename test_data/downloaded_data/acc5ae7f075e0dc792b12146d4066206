  "content": "Catherine Zeta Jones swept into a courtroom in London today to tell a judge how she was \"devastated, shocked and appalled\" when she realised her big day had been invaded by paparazzi. She said it had been just the wedding she wanted - homely even though it was on the grand scale - at the Plaza Hotel, New York in November 2000. In papers before high court judge Mr Justice Lindsay, she said: \"We spent the first day of our 'honeymoon' reminiscing about what a wonderful time we and our guests had had.\" But when she and her new husband, film star Michael Douglas, found out that pirated pictures of the \u00a31.2 million event were due to be published in Hello! magazine, \"our peace and happiness evaporated\". \"I felt violated and that something precious had been stolen from me,\" Ms Zeta Jones said. The couple are suing Hello! for \u00a3500,000 damages for invasion of their privacy. The stars are giving evidence today to try to convince Mr Justice Lindsay that their privacy and confidence were breached at the wedding, for which they had sold exclusive coverage rights to a rival celebrity magazine, OK!. They had signed a \u00a31m deal with OK! after turning down a \u00a31m-plus offer from Hello!. Ms Zeta Jones and Mr Douglas walked into court without ceremony and sat on the wooden bench at the front of the court surrounded by their lawyers. The couple were both dressed in black - Ms Zeta Jones wore trousers, a jacket and a clinging top that emphasised the outline of her eight-month pregnancy. Her dark hair was worn down but held loosely at the back in a clasp and her jewellery was limited to diamond earrings and a large pendant at her throat. A lightly tanned Mr Douglas was dressed in a single-breasted suit with a cream shirt and purple tie. His wife with her hands together while her husband briefly squeezed her knee as they waited for the hearing to start. Mr Douglas, chewing vigorously on a throat lozenge, scanned the ranks of around 50 reporters as they gazed back at him. Called to the witness box by her counsel, Michael Tugendhat QC, Ms Zeta Jones took the oath in a low husky voice with its hint of a Welsh accent. The judge said she must tell him if she experienced any discomfort in the witness box and invited her to sit.",
