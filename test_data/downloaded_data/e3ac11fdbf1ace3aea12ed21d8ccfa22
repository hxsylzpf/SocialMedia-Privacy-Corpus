  "content": "The Sun has thrown its weight behind Prince Charles, calling on critics to \"leave him alone\" and claiming he has been \"subjected to a witch hunt\". The paper today denounced the former palace servant who made lurid allegations which, it said, were the \"ravings\" of a man \"you'd think twice about believing if he told you the time of day\". Under a headline: \"Leave him alone\", the Sun Says leader column in today's paper said former royal servant George Smith, the source of the \"ridiculous rumour about [Prince Charles'] sexuality\", was a \"scarcely credible witness in anyone's eyes\". However, on the facing page the Sun ran a news story claiming Prince Charles had ruled out suing Mr Smith because of fears about his mental stability. The Sun claimed there were concerns Mr Smith might \"do a Dr Kelly\", a reference to David Kelly, the former weapons inspector who committed suicide after being caught up the Iraq dossier row between the government and the BBC. \"A ridiculous rumour about [the prince's] sexuality has been fanned by the oxygen of publicity until it is an inferno that threatens the whole future of the heir to the throne. Indeed, the survival of the monarchy could be at stake,\" the Sun said in its leader. \"He is being subjected to a witch hunt, a vendetta built on the ravings of former servant George Smith - a scarcely credible witness in anyone's eyes. The Sun does not believe a word of Smith's allegations. Nor can we find anyone else who does,\" the paper added. \"Smith, a former alcoholic, has suffered from mental illness and appears to have a gigantic chip on his shoulder about the royals who once employed him. You'd have to think twice about believing him if he told you the time of day. \"Charles may be blue blooded but he is also a red blooded male. Just ask Camilla,\" it says. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857",
