  "content": "Rupert Murdoch is unhappy about the \"fuss and publicity\" over the fate of the Sun's Page 3, as this tweet shows. I like that line about \"horrible elites\". I imagine that's a reference to the Guardian (I don't think I constitute an elite myself) and the BBC. But what of Sky News? Is that an elite? Surely he cannot mean the No More Page 3 campaigners either. They are the very opposite of an elite. Anyway, it's a relief to know that the Sun \"will always have great looking women - and men\", but what about those asterisks? In case you missed it, Marina Hyde's riff on the Sun's use of t*ts was a real g*m.",
