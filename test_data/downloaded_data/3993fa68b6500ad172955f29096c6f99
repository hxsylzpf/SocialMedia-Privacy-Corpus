  "content": "The Conservatives today called for an urgent review of security across Whitehall after it was revealed that government departments have lost an average of one official computer a week over the past year. The losses included 53 laptops or PCs, with the highest numbers disappearing from the Department of Health (14) and Department for Children, Schools and Families (13). Also lost were 36 BlackBerrys, 30 mobile phones, four disc drives and four memory sticks, according to official data gathered by the shadow housing minister, Grant Shapps. And despite the high security surrounding Parliament, 10 chairs went missing from the House of Commons' Portcullis House annexe, Mr Shapps revealed. He released the details on the anniversary of Gordon Brown's apology for the loss computer discs containing the personal details of 25 million families. Mr Shapps said the new losses raised concerns about potential breaches of the confidentiality of personal health or education records. And he voiced concern that neither the Home Office nor the Ministry of Defence had responded to his requests for information. Mr Shapps said: \"Despite losing half the nation's personal information and being forced to apologise for it exactly a year ago today, it seems that Gordon Brown's government remains incapable of keeping our data secure. \"Until ministers can demonstrate that their departments can be trusted with confidential information, the government should place its controversial ID card scheme on hold.\" He added: \"With more than one official computer going missing each week - not to mention numerous hard drives and memory sticks - today we're calling on the government to urgently review data security right across Whitehall.\"",
