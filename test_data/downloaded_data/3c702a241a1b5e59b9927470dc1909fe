  "content": "It is possibly the biggest start-up lawsuit since the Winklevoss twins sued Mark Zuckerberg over their part in the success of Facebook, but a new legal fight is brewing in Silicon Valley over the ownership of Snapchat, an app for sending self-destructing photo messages. The ongoing court case in LA County court has that Frank 'Reggie' Brown IV and Evan Spiegel met programmer Bobby Murphy in the spring of 2011 but by August, the friendship had broken down. Spiegel and Brown continued to build Snapchat without Brown, registering themselves as directors of the company based on a previous project they had developed. Brown now claims that he assumed their new company Toyopa Group had been registered in all three names, whereas Spiegel and Murphy had actually changed the name of their existing company, FutureFreshmen, to Toyopa Group and so retained their respective 60/40 split ownership. Brown is now suing for a 20% share in the company. Brown alleges that the initial idea for the app is his, as well as the design of the logo (\"Brown created this logo by directing Spiegel on what to draw, while the latter implemented Brown's direction on Adobe InDesign\", in the words of his suit) and much of non-programming work. Spiegel and Murphy argue that ideas are worthless without execution, and that \"directing\" someone on what to draw is not the same as designing a logo. Spiegel and Murphy currently share 60/40 ownership of Snapchat respectively, and Brown is suing for 20% of the company. Snapchat gained notoreity as an app for sexting [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexting] but has grown into a widely-used social network, installed on 19% of all iPhones and sending over 50 million messages a day. That's the basis for the company's $800m valuation, and also for the fights over ownership unfolding in the Los Angeles County Court. A flurry of new evidence presented to court includes text messages and emails between the trio - all members of Stanford University's Kappa Sigma fraternity - starting with lighthearted texts in friendly 'brogrammer' banter - and ending with lengthy emails that landed up in court. Both show how the superficial chumminess soon gave way to claims of ownership in Snapchat's hastily won fortune. One message forwarding the initial press release, sent to blogger Nicole James of That White Bitch, is headlined: \"Yo, gurl, here's an iPhone app I think you'd love...\" \"I just built an app with two friends of mine (certified bros - our frat just got kicked off campus)\", Spiegel writes in the email, which Brown has seized on as evidence that he was involved in the creation of Snapchat. He also filed an earlier draft of the same release, which he claims to have written, and which reads \"Uhhhh, let's be honest. What betch ever wants anyone to get hold of her pictures? I mean with incriminating photos of lacrosse team captains, rounds of drinks at, and sexy, fun photos of new outfits, a betch would be at the mercy of her captor if anyone ever got a hold of her phone\". Even after Brown had first allegedly overheard Spiegel and Murphy discussing their 60/40 split of the company, the \"bros\" still flew. \"Dawg that contest poster looks so fucking good haha #patentpendingbrodjsjsjshhajsndkdjs fuck yes fuck yes you and Bobby need to celebrate this shiz tonight\", Brown texted Spiegel on 11 August, the day he filed a patent application listing all three of them as co-creators. \"No chance were celebrating wo you bro\", Spiegel replied. But by the end of the week, the problems were out in the open, and the language had tightened up. \"I want to make sure you feel like you are given credit for the idea of disappearing messages\", wrote Spiegel. The next day, Brown left the house, and walked out of Snapchat for good. A year later, he started legal proceedings. Snapchat may have sounded a great example of brogrammers and fratrepreneurs building a multimillion-dollar apps in their summer holidays, but if your business co-founder finds that he or she has been cut out of the company it takes a lot more than partying hard to fix that slight.",
