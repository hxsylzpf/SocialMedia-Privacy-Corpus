Those 41 seconds swiftly exposed apparently incomplete police explanations of how and why Ian Tomlinson died. They alone forced a level of instant accountability from the police about their orders, behaviour and operation. Like the London police, most major institutions of power, and those working for them, still don't appreciate the full scale and implications of the dramatic new real-time media trend and its profound new impact on their credibility in a moment of crisis. The ongoing investigation into heavy civilian casualties last week when US-led Nato war planes bombed villages in Afghanistan's Farah province recalls how initial official claims were challenged after a similar strike on a school in Azizabad last August. US forces initially claimed only seven people died. NGOs said the bombing killed up to 90. Only after mobile phone video emerged two weeks later did US commanders accept they had to re-examine evidence. In a re-investigation condemned by Human Rights Watch as \"deeply flawed\" the US had to revise the death toll up to 55, although 22 victims were classified as \"anti-coalition militants\". Such examples confirm how new information technologies and dynamics are together driving a wave of democratisation and accountability. It shifts and redefines the nature of power in such moments. It also creates a new policy vulnerability and brittleness for institutions, who then struggle even harder to maintain public confidence. Increasingly routinely, a cheap, \"go-anywhere\" camera or mobile phone challenges the credibility of the massive human and financial resources of a government or corporation in an acute crisis. The long-held conventional wisdom of a gulf in time and quality between the news that signals an event and the whole truth eventually emerging is fast being eliminated. The new lightweight technologies available to almost anyone mean a new capacity for instant scrutiny and accountability that is way beyond the narrower, assumed power and influence of the traditional media. That banker in the City of London on 1 April was neither a citizen journalist nor a citizen reporter. He happened to bear witness electronically and thereby \"did information\", which he then decided to share with the Guardian. This makes him the latest example of a non-professional \"information doer\": one of the hundreds of millions with an electronic eye now found anywhere from the shaky heart of the global financial system in London's Royal Exchange Passage to crisis locations in Iraq, China's Tibet plateau, Burma, the flooded heart of New Orleans or the Afghan mountains. The core implications are twofold. First, this new technical reality has dramatically foreshortened the news and information cycle from a few hours to often no more than a few minutes. Second, those cellphones and digital cameras of the proliferation of new \"information doers\" have swiftly modified and broadened the assumed definitions of the media landscape in a crisis. The new ubiquitous transparency they create sheds light where it is often assumed officially there will be darkness. Frequently just one \"information doer\" such as the G20 investment banker will swiftly expose the often stark reality of unexpected \"Black Swan\" crisis events. These are the moments of acute tension which are so improbable that few in positions of responsibility will have even considered them a possibility to prepare for. But when these \"Black Swan\" moments take place it must now be assumed that what the \"information doer\" records and uploads will more than likely instantly challenge official versions and threaten to discredit them. Worse, the structures of power usually fail to respond with effective impact and in a timely way. Too often, the knee-jerk institutional response continues to be one of denial as if this new broader, fragmented, redefined media landscape does not exist. Yet within minutes the new, almost infinite media dynamic of images, video, texts and social media mean the public rapidly has vivid, accurate impressions of what is unravelling. Overall, the time lines of their institutional power and the new media realities are increasingly out of sync. This creates what a few enlightened officials or executives concede is the new fragility of their power in a crisis. Institutional assumptions of commanding the information high ground in a crisis are from a different era. The instant scrutiny created by the new digital media landscape subverts their effectiveness and leaves reputations more vulnerable than ever in a crisis. It usually does so with breathtaking speed.
