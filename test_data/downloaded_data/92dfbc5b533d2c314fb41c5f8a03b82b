Mr Schilling, a leading media lawyer, said the principle of a legal right to privacy had now been established and Ms Campbell was \"delighted\". \"I have just spoken to Miss Campbell in Los Angeles. She is naturally delighted with the decision. The judge has found in her favour on a number of points,\" he said. \"This is a landmark judgment that establishes that anyone in the public eye whether through choice or accident is entitled to protection of their private life. The courts will now protect privacy through a combination of existing confidentiality law and European convention on human rights. \"Miss Campbell brought this case on a matter of principle as Mr Justice Morland found in his judgment.\" The courts awarded damages of \u00a33,500 against the Mirror. The newspaper will also have to fork out Ms Campbell's costs, estimated at \u00a3200,000. Piers Morgan, the editor of the Mirror, showed his contempt for the judge's decision outside the high court. He said Ms Campbell should expect \"a knock on the door from the police\" in relation to her drug use and in relation to the judge's observation that she had lied under oath - an offence that carries a seven year sentence. Asked whether he would be appealing against the ruling, Morgan said: \"To be honest I'm just bored with the whole damn thing.\" Desmond Browne QC, for the newspaper, told the judge: \"This case is about whether the equitable right of confidentiality permits celebrities to manipulate their public image to their own advantage. \"The issue is whether celebrities like Miss Campbell are entitled to select what information - or more significantly in this case, misinformation - they release to the public, and then go to court seeking damages when the truth is told.\" He said Ms Campbell was \"guilty of serious criminal behaviour in illegally abusing drugs over a number of years\". She had also deceived the public by making public statements boasting to the media that she had avoided illegal drugs when others in the modelling world had succumbed. \"That deceit is an additional ground for depriving her of any right to be heard to complain about disclosure of her drug addiction.\" He said Ms Campbell had first lied in a number of interviews in June 1997 at the time of her emergency admission to hospital in the Canaries. She had told the Daily Telegraph: \"Maybe I am just a target again because of all the other stories about models taking drugs, but I am not like that.\" In Paris Match she said she never took stimulants or tranquillisers, and she told US television: \"I have never had a drug problem\". She had also \"compromised the privacy of her personal life\" by trading interviews in which she provided glimpses of her private life - normally about her current boyfriend - in exchange for the opportunity to promote her latest commercial venture. The opportunity to do this \"depends entirely on the oxygen of the press publicity on which she thrives\". The picture of her leaving NA was taken in a public place and what was published amounted to additional details that were so harmless and trivial that no damage could have been caused, he said.",
