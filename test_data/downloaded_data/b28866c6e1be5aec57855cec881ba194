  "content": "There was a time when sending a misbehaving youngster off to their bedroom was viewed as a punishment. It was supposed to make them feel isolated and excluded; an admonishment to sit alone and reflect on their wrongdoing. For today's average adolescent staying by themselves in their room is never a matter of being isolated and hardly feels like a punishment. Physical surroundings are meaningless because every teenager is now always in constant touch with their peers, and the world beyond, through ubiquitous devices. In fact, judging by my own household, for many teenagers their default position is to stay alone in their room staring at screens; playing games, messaging late into the night, sharing YouTube clips and multiple other diversions. They might emerge for meals and necessary sustenance, but they would generally prefer to  be locked away using technology to interact with others near and far. But how fast all this has changed. My three children are spread over eight years. The older daughter is in her late 20s and her teenage years now feel like a simpler time. Navigating these issues with her brother, who is 19, was much more complicated. Between them they have spanned the advent of social media and online communication. The eldest was only given her own phone at 14, which in 2002 was pretty average. And the phone itself was a basic Nokia pay-as\u2013you-go. Facebook was still only a twinkle in Mark Zuckerberg's eye and when it was invented in 2004 it was limited to Harvard University students. Like other parents, we gave her the phone rationalising that she was going by herself to school and elsewhere so it would be useful if she needed to be in touch. She used to eke out her \u00a310 per month top-up allowance texting away to friends. She soon realised that communication was a two-way thing. We could now also contact her, asking where she was and reminding her to return on time \u2013 so all too often when she was out late and we tried reaching her the phone trailed on to voicemail. \"Sorry had no signal or the battery ran out\" were the frequent explanations, when she had clearly chosen that it was inconvenient to her plans to be in touch. By the time my youngest, Ben, left primary school having a phone at age 11 for the start of solo school journeys was standard. Most children without a mobile by this stage would be insisting to their parents that they were missing out. Meanwhile, the gadgets themselves, never mind all the multiple online possibilities, have been transformed. I struggled with him to get my head round the ever-changing social media sites \u2013 the pervasive pornography, the advent of Snapchat, Instagram, WhatsApp and the prospect of continual online interaction \u2013 sometimes even, weirdly, as a substitute for real life. I remember when I first saw him on Facebook exchanging messages with his friend who lived just down our road \u2013 \"Why don't you talk to each other rather than communicating through the computer?\" \u2013 he shrugged and rolled his eyes. By then it was too late to question what he was even doing on Facebook, which was supposedly restricted to older teens? Like his friends, he had \"adjusted\" his birth year when he joined, to circumvent the age limit for opening a Facebook account \u2013 which was never challenged. Even so, he still did not have his own laptop in the early teenage years \u2013 and often left windows open on the family desktop. If I was using it later I might have sight of what he had been looking at and his conversations. Sometimes I was unhappy about sites he had visited and my husband and I would challenge him. But, of course, once he had a laptop in his room that no longer happened because how would we ever know? Yet it's not just the teenage bedroom that has morphed, the whole concept of the home is different in this era of online and social media. Remember the time when you arrived back from school? The only prospect of connection to your peers, unless you had arranged to meet up with someone, was speaking to them on the single family phone handset. In many homes, and certainly in my case, it sat in a draughty hallway, where everyone could overhear the conversation. Worse still, parents would interrupt to complain about the mounting bill or to insist that they needed access to the phone for their own call. And once the lingering chat with a friend or two was over, there was no further external contact until the next morning's journey to school. The family home was almost a retreat. It might have been boring for a teenager, fed up with her family and desperate to be in touch with her friends, but it was also a kind of sanctuary. The intensity of continually interacting \u2013 the adolescent obsession of measuring who is up and who is down \u2013 had to take an overnight break. Now the multiple conversations never stop. Late into the night teens are posting pictures, making comments, sharing links; the pressures of being cool and part of the action are a 24/7 activity. Fear of missing out (Fomo) has always been a teenage obsession. Most have little sense of proportion, so the thought of not attending a party or a gathering with everyone else can make them frantic. But now Fomo never stops. There is not only the party but all the social media noise that follows \u2013 posting photos, sizing up what did or did not happen. Children are reluctant to admit it, but after a bad day at school it might be a relief to have a place where the online world cannot reach you. The problem is whether the home can any longer offer that peace and quiet. It is as if the walls are no longer solid but permeable. Somehow the outside world now penetrates inside the average family home because of this continual contact with peers and others. The days of a single family landline had another advantage. Parents still had some notion of who their children were interacting with. They might answer the call or even take a message. Today, unless there is no signal, few teens would resort to speaking on a fixed landline \u2013 there is no need. But my two older daughters are just about from the end of that quaint era. I recall when my second daughter was 11 or 12, the same boy, Leo, would call every day at 5.20pm and the conversation always lasted for ages. I still tried to enforce a rule about no phone chatting until homework and music practice were all done (except of course when they insisted that they must consult a friend about the homework). Sometimes when Leo rang I would say she was busy and ask if she could return the call or if he could ring back later \u2013 often wondering, \"Don't you have any homework yourself to finish?\" Nowadays that would be a joke \u2013 no child would dream of calling up on a landline, to be intercepted by irritating parents \u2013 all communication is direct. Leo is now a successful whiz-kid in Silicon Valley, even profiled last month in the Guardian, so maybe disrupted homework never did him any harm. But what about switching off? Once I became aware of the continuing late-night activity I insisted that my son leave his mobile outside the bedroom at night. I had tried asking him to switch it off after hours \u2013 but the temptation was too great. Sometimes I would find he had even crept out to retrieve the phone from the landing in the wee hours. Once there was wifi throughout the house, we resorted to unplugging the router late at night. Of course, the downside was that no one else could go online. Anyway that strategy was ruined when 3G and 4G arrived. Now those tussles have faded and I hope that my children have developed sufficient self-control to know when to switch off and tune out of the online frenzy. Alas, how many adults cannot disconnect, pore over their devices at every moment and, most annoyingly, leave them out on the table during mealtimes, like a nearby lifeline? As with other matters, if they want their children to behave sensibly online, parents had better set the right example.
