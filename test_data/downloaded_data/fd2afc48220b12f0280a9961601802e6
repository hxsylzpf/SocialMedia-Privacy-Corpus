In the article, which the magazine initially held back from its own website, McChrystal and his army aides are reported making disparaging remarks about President Obama, his vice president Joe Biden and several other White House appointees. Now McCrystal is on his way to Washington to face the music by meeting Obama who, as you can see from the above video clip, is none too happy with the general he has previously had reason to slap down. But the media story behind the story is also fascinating. First off, there was a fuss about whether or not McChrystal was speaking to Rolling Stone's writer, Michael Hastings, on or off the record. The magazine's editor, Eric Bates, was quick to defend his man. In an interview on MSNBC, the hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough repeatedly expressed their astonishment at the sheer number of damning quotes in the piece, which have stunned political observers. Brzezinski asked Bates if McChrystal had been unaware that he was on the record. Bates said that Hastings had been very clear with the general: They knew when we were on the record. They said a lot of stuff to us off the record that's not in the story. We respected those boundaries. This was all when they knew they were on. \"Wow,\" Brzezinski responded. The McChrystal story has led the New York Times (latest: McChrystal's Fate in Limbo as He Prepares to Meet Obama and Washington Post websites (latest: McChrystal's remarks compound Afghan peril) ever since it first broke. And that's the other interesting media story because it broke when the blogosphere and Twittersphere began mentioning the Rolling Stone article, which was then carried only in its print issue. A leading US politics website, Politico, even published the entire article online. So, for many hours, the one place you couldn't read about the Rolling Stone piece was on Rolling Stone's own website. Magazine spokesman Mark Neschis explained that Rolling Stone generally doesn't put entire national affairs stories online, preferring to run them only in the print version of the magazine. But the fact the net was buzzing with bits and pieces, along with Politico's initiative, forced the magazine's hand. As the Yahoo! writer Michael Calderone noted: While a magazine understandably wants to reap the financial benefits of having a major, deeply reported story only available on the newsstand, the idea of holding breaking news for print doesn't easily mesh with the demands of the 24/7 online news cycle. Rolling Stone did know it had a scoop, of course, and it did set out \"to generate buzz\", so it gave an advance to the US news agency Associated Press. an advancer to the AP.\" Then AP screwed up. It carried only a short piece about McChrystal's frustration with US ambassador Karl Eikenberry, but didn't deal with the dismissive attacks on the president. But Politico and Time magazine's political writer Mark Halperin realised the significance and carried all the gory details. The genie, as Calderone noted, was out of the bottle. So how did Hastings get his story? Bates explained that the writer was given \"really unprecedented access\" to McChrystal and his staff over several months. We were with him on a trip in Europe that wound up getting extended because of the volcano in Iceland. So our reporter was kind of trapped with him for about two weeks in Paris and traveling from Paris to Berlin. They couldn't fly, so they had to take a bus. So we really spent a lot of time with him and really got to look behind the curtain, and hear how he and his men, top men, talk among themselves on their own. It is one of the best pieces of reportage I've ever read. In these digital days, how could Rolling Stone ever imagine it could keep such an agenda-setting story to print alone?
