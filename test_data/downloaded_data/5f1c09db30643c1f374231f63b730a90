But if it were, I would be saying to Cameron to find out very quickly whether Coulson did act in any way improperly, and to act accordingly if he thinks he did. And if I were Coulson, I would be totally honest with Cameron to help him make that decision. When the Damian McBride emails first surfaced, it was obvious where it was going to end. If Cameron thinks that this situation might also end in him having to lose his right-hand man, better to do it quickly. Tim Montgomerie at ConservativeHome says Campbell's advice is sound. [Coulson] stands at the heart of David Cameron's \"West Wing\". Losing him because of this would be a grave setback and I hope it will be unnecessary. I hope he will be able to tell David Cameron that he was not in any way involved in the illegal phone-tapping of John Prescott and others. John Prescott, on his blog, says that, although Cameron claims to be \"relaxed\" about the affair, that might change. The systematic illegal hacking of up to 3,000 people is in a different league all together [from the McBride affair]. Allowing the man who allowed that to happen into No 10 would be deplorable. So the question Cameron must answer is: \"Do you back him or sack him?\" By the fact his people are tonight briefing that he's \"very relaxed\" about the episode, we sadly have our answer. I've got a feeling that \"very relaxed\" attitude is going to change. Nick Robinson, on his blog, says that Cameron will be \"anything but relaxed\" about the story this morning. It is now clear that phone-hacking at the News of the World was much more widespread than previously thought, that it targeted senior ministers not just celebrities and that, if the Guardian is correct, at least one of the paper's executives knew about it. This is leading to calls \u2013 not just from Labour politicians \u2013 for Andy Coulson to answer questions about what he knew and to questions about whether he should be at David Cameron's side. Sunny Hundal at Liberal Conspiracy says that this is Cameron's \"McBride moment\". The Conservatives milked the Damian McBride affair for all its worth \u2013 turning up on television almost everyday in faux-outrage at how someone could be so nasty in politics. Every day a succession of outraged rightwing bloggers and backbench politicians said they expected better standards from parliament. If that is the case, what will they now say about the allegations levelled at Andy Coulson, David Cameron's director of communications? But Paul Staines, aka Guido Fawkes, says that it's wrong to compare Andy Coulson with Damian McBride. When the News of the World's royal reporter was caught at it, Coulson resigned, saying he took \"ultimate responsibility\" for the hacking affair. He also avoided having to explain himself to the PCC in so doing. This was before he went to Millbank \u2013 that is the key difference between this situation and the situation with McBride \u2013 it happened years ago in a former job, not yesterday. Sunder Katwala at Next Left says that Cameron appears to be motived by convenience, not principle. Keeping Coulson may prove too difficult. But the attempt to do so suggests that the only ethic that matters is one of convenience \u2013 and that different rules apply to the inner circle. Iain Dale, on his blog, says Coulson has been a good adviser, and that Cameron may be \"relaxed\" because he did \"due diligence\" on Coulson before hiring him. He's not a showy adviser. For someone who came into the job with a high media profile, he has done well to stay out of the limelight. He will be cringing at \"becoming the story\" because he knows that there are sometimes dangerous consequences when that happens. Ask Alastair Campbell. Mike Smithson at PoliticalBetting says the affair is very dangerous for Cameron. There's little doubt that this could be highly dangerous for the Tory leader \u2013 just at a time when he was seeking to make \"character\" and \"honesty\" into campaign issues. Conor Ryan on his blog says Cameron should sack Coulson. David Cameron was at his sanctimonious best a few weeks ago when he saw an opportunity to get rid of troublesome backwoodsmen over their duck islands and moats ... Coulson must go. Otherwise, we must conclude that there was nothing more to Dave's recent righteous indignation than sham PR bluster. Mark Thompson, on his Mark Reckons blog, says Coulson will go soon. If Mr Cameron is smart (and we all know he is) he will be lining up a potential replacement as I write. He may claim to be \"relaxed\" about the situation but not so relaxed as to not have a Plan B, I am sure.",
