  "content": "This extract from The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial* is taken from a chapter written by Chris Atkins, director of a film that showed how tabloid journalists could be fooled into accepting false stories. His Starsuckers documentary, first screened in 2009, exposed the deceit involved in celebrity reporting. Some 30 minutes of the film was shown to the Leveson inquiry. Atkins begins his piece by explaining that there \"was abundant prima facie evidence of wrongdoing\" by tabloid journalists but the only way to prove it was by the use of subterfuge. His words follow... We set out to feed untrue stories to tabloid newspapers to see if they would be printed without checks, and observe how the stories were relayed to the public. We created fictional celebrity stories that had no factual basis whatsoever, apart from the physical location of a celebrity at a certain time. We avoided fabricating anything malicious or defamatory to the celebrity themselves, and did not take any of the money that was offered in return for the stories... Researching our first story, we learned that the Canadian singer, Avril Lavigne, had been to the nightclub Bungalow 8. The next morning, on 18 March 2009, our researcher Jen Richardson called the Daily Mirror news desk pretending to be French party girl 'Gigi', with the story that Lavigne had fallen asleep in Bungalow 8, and started snoring. Jen had spent a large amount of time (and expense) visiting celebrity nightclubs, and working on Gigi's character, in order to make her stories convincing. From this first call it was clear that this research was redundant \u2013 the journalist at the Daily Mirror simply wrote down what Jen said, and didn't probe further. Our fabricated story appeared in the newspaper the following day without checks. Jen was told to send in her bank details to receive the \u00a350 payment for the story, which we did not do. As the investigation continued we created more and more outlandish stories to see at what point suspicions would be raised. We went on to feed fabricated stories successfully to the Daily Star, the Daily Mirror again, The Sun and the Daily Express. As the tales became more absurd, the effect was not that they received more scrutiny, but that the payments offered increased along with the coverage... In all, six fake celebrity stories were created and fed to the tabloid press in a two-week period in March 2009.. Our biggest story was in The Sun, revealing that Sarah Harding from Girls Aloud was secretly a fan of Quantum Physics. It ran as a lead story in Gordon Smart's Bizarre column. Smart's article also included a fabricated quote: 'There is a lot more going on under that blonde barnet than Sarah is given credit for. She's a smart cookie and does read an awful lot.' This quote didn't come from Jen, showing that the Sun will add fictitious quotes into their articles, as well as not running basic checks. At the time, Girls Aloud appeared regularly in The Sun, so it would have taken minutes to check with the agent or PR if there was any truth to our story. The Harding physics story was then was picked up by dozens of news sites around the world. Had we claimed it, the story fee would have earned us \u00a3600 from News International... Later... we look at the culture of criminality in tabloid newspapers. We talked to several journalists and ex-journalists off the record who told us that the [Clive] Goodman and [Glenn] Mulcaire convictions were just the tip of the iceberg. These sources explained that tabloid journalists, from the Sunday papers in particular, were still routinely breaking the law to get stories without any public interest. Our research also indicated that this behaviour was institutionally ingrained in tabloid culture... We wanted to test the Sunday tabloids to see if their journalists were willing to break the law, and the PCC code, to obtain private information about celebrities that was not in the public interest. The scenario was constructed to present the newspapers with a story that would involve them breaking the rules, and see which newspapers would engage with us. I would pose as an intermediary who was selling the details of celebrities plastic surgery operations, but was ignorant of the rules of modern tabloid reporting. I would claim that I was the ex-boyfriend of a nurse who worked in a plastic surgery clinic and who had evidence of high profile celebrities having operations. Given the intrusive nature of such stories, the newspapers would be likely to need to obtain proof that these stories were true in order to print them. Any such proof would inherently involve a breach of the Data Protection Act, which prohibits the sale of medical records. Even harvesting information to research the stories would involve a breach of the DPA, as this would constitute a fishing expedition. The DPA does have a general opt-out for journalists where the information is in the public interest... So we deliberately created stories that, while of interest to a tabloid readership, could never be classed as being in the public interest... Atkins then details his conversations with four people from four news desks - the Sunday Express (which rejected the idea), News of the World, Sunday Mirror and the People. They showed varying degrees of interest. He concludes: To our knowledge, the PCC did not, in any way, investigate any of the allegations made by Starsuckers, even though three of the four newspapers we tested seemed willing to breach the PCC code and the DPA... I believe that Starsuckers shows that there are serious problems at the heart of the British media, in particular the tabloid press. These are problems that the media itself is incapable of investigating or solving, which is why I support stronger regulation of the press that is completely independent of both the press and government.
