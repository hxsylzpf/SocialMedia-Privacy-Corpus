  "content": "\"Someone's got a bit too much time on their hands!!\" As a pithy, dismissive response to online endeavour, it has to be up there with the classic \"Yawn ...\" and \u2013 my personal favourite \u2013 \"SLOW NEWS DAY?!?!?\" But sometimes, when perusing the fake accounts of Twitter as they are retweeted by the gullible and the idealistic, one does have to wonder whether certain keyboard botherers might not be better off finding a more constructive use for their time. How about writing a nice poem, or attempting some baking? The accounts I find perplexing are not those that exist to parody or satirise celebrities and those in power, or which operate as supposedly amusing comic creations. Certainly if a grown man wishes to spend his time on Twitter pretending to be, say, a robot, that is fine by me. And you might accept that the Cheryl Kerl Twitter account, which is somehow still trundling on in all its glorious unfunniness, does have at least some purpose, even if that purpose seems mainly to involve scoring a deal to publish a lightly misogynistic, rather snobby little toilet book. But the point is to amuse, or at least to try. The ones I find confusing are those such as another Cheryl Cole account, dating from before Cole eventually signed up, which listed the mundane events of Cheryl's imagined life, and was only rumbled when \"Cheryl\" invited more than 30,000 followers to visit a swingers' website. Then there was the fake Katie Price account, which took a dig at the real Stacey Solomon by posting a photo of a baby smoking, and was so convincing that it generated a story that the Mail swiftly deleted when they realised that they, along with the account's thousands of followers, were following not Katie Price, but Katie Priice. The Dalai Lama's real Twitter debut was pre-empted by a faker in 2009, and there's one fake Lily Allen account \u2013 now sadly dormant \u2013 that once sent a pissy tweet about another fake Lily Allen account, noting: \"This is fake and has nothing to do with me\". It comes to mind this week with the news that 2011 X Factor runner-up Amelia Lily had her own deranged Twannabe. (Twimposter? Doppeltwanger? Please yourselves.) The real, virtuous Amelia Lily can be found at @AmeliaLilyOffic, while the fake, evil Amelia Lily was, until the Twitter gods intervened, at @RealAmeliaLily. Now I don't wish to alarm anyone but if this unknown Twitter bandit could play fast and loose with the sanctity of the word \"real\", what else could this monster unleash on the world of microblogging? Perhaps very little, because the mundanity of the \"fake\" Amelia Lily was like some sort of inverse take on Being John Malkovich. \"Had an early start today to do an interview and then went straight to studio, been there all day!\" raged one tweet. \"How is everyone on this sunny day?!\" roared another. It echoed the banality of the fake Frank Ocean Twitter account, still being retweeted by all and sundry until it was suspended this week. There is an almost superhuman level of pointlessness in assuming the identity of a celebrity \u2013 even if it's just Amelia Lily \u2013 then dribbling out such prosaic missives. It's like winning the lottery and spending the lot on paperclips. In any case, the game could be up. On Wednesday it emerged that Twitter, having been issued with a subpoena through a California court, is prepared to give up the details of whoever is behind the fake account that plays on the identity of newspaper executive Steve Auckland. Naturally this sort of disclosure order runs against freedom of expression and the core principles of a democratised internet. On the other hand, as someone who once suffered the fear, pain and social exclusion that followed accidentally retweeting a fake Gina G, Lost in Showbiz does wonder if it might be best for humanity if the man (and it probably is a man) behind the fake Amelia Lily were asked to step forward. And if you're wondering what I was doing retweeting Gina G in the first place \u2013 well, it was a slow news day.",
