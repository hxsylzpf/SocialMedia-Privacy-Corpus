  "content": "The Football Association has reprimanded Wayne Rooney after the Manchester United striker threatened a follower on Twitter. The governing body has written to Rooney to remind him of his responsibilities and warn him over his future conduct. He had a heated exchanged on Twitter during which he wrote to a follower: 'I'll put u asleep within 10 seconds' after being provoked. Rooney claimed later it was nothing more than 'banter'. The written reprimand is the latest in a long line of disciplinary issues for Manchester United at the hands of the FA. The manager Sir Alex Ferguson yesterday hinted that his players may be banned from using Twitter, saying: 'I don't understand it, to be honest with you. I don't know why anybody can be bothered with that kind of stuff. We as a club are looking at it because there can be issues attached to it. And we don't want that.'",
