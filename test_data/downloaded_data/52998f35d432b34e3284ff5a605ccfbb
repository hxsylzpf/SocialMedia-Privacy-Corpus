We need to address this gap between online and real identity\u2026 and make cyber bullying a criminal offence.\" Goodman said the current legal situation was confused and that a offence of cyberbullying should mirror \"charges of harassment that can be brought in the real world\". A solution needs to involve education as well as law, she cautioned. \"If you are in a playground and six people go [after] someone in the corner, you see them respond. The problem with social media is there is no feedback. Bullying is changed by the technology.\" Goodman also argued for more robust content controls to protect the under 18s. \"We should be quite confident that we apply those norms built up over 50 years - what we see in the cinema, on television - to the net. Should we be putting 13 year olds into an adult space? They should not be treated as if they are 18.\" Delegates expressed concern that any heavy-handed move would criminalise rather than teach children to change their behaviour. Simon Blake, chief executive of counselling service Brook, said there needed to be more positive material available through search providers \"for young people who navigate (the internet) well\". Claire Perry -David Cameron's adviser and a government whip - said there needed to be a non-partisan approach and that Britain \"had grasped the nettle\" and was \"the most family-friendly place to go online\", with the introduction of one-click filters by internet service providers, warning pages on adult content, and steps to block pornography from public Wi-Fi services. She said the real problem lay with user-generated sites which included \"the good, the bad and the ugly\", and that some unmediated services would require legislation. Fifteen-year-old Tallulah Wilson died in 2012 when she was hit by a train. An inquest into her death found that she had developed an alternative fantasy life online. In 2013, 14-year-old Hannah Smith was found hanged after being being bullied on the open-discussion site Ask.fm.",
