  "content": "What a cunning wheeze: knock up a new logo that looks like a cheap imitation of one of your rivals', await the uproar from the Twitterati and then perform a U-turn. It's a terrific way to create the impression that the original logo is a much-loved classic design that customers should be proud to wear on their T-shirts. And the cost is minimal since you haven't bothered to slap the new logo on any new clothes. Brilliant. That's the conspiracy theory of what happened at Gap. The new logo, abandoned today after a week, certainly seemed to borrow its style from Bench. Gap was also quick to claim it was engaging in a \"crowdsourcing project\" and would be interested in seeing alternative designs. The cock-up theory says Gap's identity crisis \u2013 is it a basics brand or a fashion brand? \u2013 is more severe than previously thought. The conspiracy theory gets this column's vote: surely even Gap executives don't believe they need a \"sexy cool\" logo.",
