  "content": "Billed as an exclusive, the story told how Prince Harry had received a joke phone message from Prince William pretending to be the younger man's then girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, and berating him over his antics in a lap dancing club. The page seven lead in the News of the World, published in April 2006, became a talking point at today's select committee hearings for two reasons. Firstly, the story was bylined Clive Goodman \u2013 the royal editor later jailed for hacking into royal aides' phones \u2013 and Neville Thurlbeck \u2013 the paper's chief reporter. Secondly, the story also relied on quotes it said were from a message left on Harry's phone. This raised a number of questions from MP Adam Price, who pointed out that it appeared to be a case of phone hacking. He asked Andy Coulson, the editor at the time, if he remembered the story. Coulson did not, adding that he did not micro-manage every story. It was possible to work alongside someone and not know what they were up to. \"The headline reads, Chelsy Tears a Strip off Harry,\" said Price. \"It is based around a phone message left by Prince William imitating Chelsy on Prince Harry's phone. \"Either the story is untrue, or it is based on phone hacking of the prince's phone. Are you saying as editor, a page seven story about princes and about a message left on their phones, and you don't remember?\" Coulson said: \"I don't remember it.\" Price responded: \"Isn't that astonishing? Here is a story based on a verbatim account of a message from one prince to another. And you are telling me you don't remember it.\" Coulson replied: \"I can only tell you what I remember. And I am afraid I simply don't remember the story, so I can only conclude I played no part in it.\" Leafing through the paper, he said there had been a lot on that week. Earlier, News International's lawyer Tom Crone said he also had no knowledge of the story: \"I do not remember page seven stories, ever.\" He added that Goodman and the private detective Glenn Mulcaire had been charged with hacking into royal aides' voicemails, not the princes'.",
