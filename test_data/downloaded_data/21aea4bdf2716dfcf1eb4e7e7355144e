The albums are full of blurry and unmanaged moments \u2013 a stranger grinning in the corner, a flash gone awry. They show shiny faces, terrible poses and awkward facial expressions. The albums tail off around the time I got a phone with a camera. We were seduced by the novel concept of taking a photo, deeming it unflattering and instantly trying again. We got tools to add effects, or crop out that stranger in the corner. We presented a better version of ourselves, and our albums stopped taking up space in our homes. They went online \u2013 we Facebooked our memories so that all our friends could appreciate them too. This trend has only accelerated, of course. Except now the preferred showcase for our images is the photo-sharing site Instagram. A well-lit photo of your cosy dinner party shows how glamorous you and your friends are; a snap of a beautiful vase of flowers tells your followers how much your partner loves you. These visions of a perfect life can be intimidating, acting as glimpse into a world to which you are denied access. For a few, they might inspire \u2013 help crystallise an idea of the life they want to live. But would an amateur photo account actually make you want to spend money? Celebrities have always been paid to promote products through social media. But increasingly, Instagram users without real-world fame are cashing in too. While you've been putting up photos of your dog, others have been busy building up their own brand identity. Companies have sprung up that encourage followers to buy the clothes on your back, the pillows on your bed, the bowl your cat eats from. Instead of building up a blog, and working for hours on a carefully crafted post that might bring in some advertising, you can now assemble your identity through photos that flaunt your style and your home. One of the first Instagram stars was a woman called Jen Selter, who got noticed after posting multiple shots of the results of her fitness regime. Her behind, in particular, got so many fans that she (or it) acquired an agent, and shortly afterwards a sportswear endorsement. Looking through her photos you can see why people feel compelled to follow her: an ordinary girl who encourages you to work out for similar results, even though you know that a million squats won't give you a bottom that defies gravity. The trouble is, these new online vendors don't show anything more than an \"at home\" feature in House &amp; Garden. The appeal of a person you admire sharing their world with you is potent, but it's all scripted reality. You might turn your nose up at watching that genre of TV, arguing that it's fake and wooden, but this latest wave of amateur marketers is no different. They're polished, they present something aspirational, but it's not really their life. And it won't be yours, either. Much has been written about the pitfalls of celebrity culture \u2013 the dangers of attempting to emulate our favourite Hollywood heroes. Why are these new insta-celebs any different? They're not sharing spontaneous moments or candid pictures that give you a realistic look at their life, they're presenting a stage set. The idea behind it is to make you believe that if you spend enough, work out enough, primp enough, that you can be like them. And it works, because they're not megastars. They're just enough like you for it to look achievable. When your own life becomes your job, though, you're bound to present it dishonestly. While there's no doubt this tribe of web gurus is here to stay, I hope people are able to pull back the curtain, Wizard of Oz-style, on these happiness pedlars. Let's demand a bit more reality, and present a more honest version of own lives in response. By engaging with our real friends and being less polished with our own photos, we might find that there is no need to emulate a life that reaches us only through a heavily filtered lens.",
