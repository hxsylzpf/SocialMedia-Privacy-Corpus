Captain Mona Shindy, the chief of navy's strategy adviser on Islamic affairs, had been active on the @navyislamic account until it was deleted around 22 December. Shindy, who also heads the Guided Missile Frigate System program office, had angered rightwing activists with her tweets, including one on 22 October describing the newly launched Australian Liberty Alliance (ALA) as an \"extreme, ill-informed fringe group\". Days after Tony Abbott was deposed by Malcolm Turnbull she tweeted: \"Looking forward to a #PM that unites #auspol &amp; #OZ\". The 26-year veteran also expressed support for Australia's grand mufti, Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, who was attacked by government ministers for referring to \"causative factors\" behind terrorism in a press release expressing condolences for November's Paris terrorist attacks. Shindy wrote from @navyislamic, the \"Official Royal Australian Navy Islamic Advisor Twitter account\", that Abu Mohamed was a \"righteous and courageous man\" who had denounced Islamic State, adding the hashtag #IStandWithThe Mufti. The head of the ALA, Debbie Robinson, who has previously described Islam as \"a dangerous ideology\" incompatible with western society, wrote to the chief of the Australian defence force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, on 10 December asking the navy to distance itself from the account or delete it. \"It is completely unacceptable for an official defence Twitter account to criticise any registered political party in Australia,\" Robinson said in a press release. The account was deleted within 12 days. Asked why, defence media told Guardian Australia: \"Navy has consolidated its social media platforms to achieve a 'single source' so as to strengthen its messaging in sync with its support to traditional media.\" At least two other navy-linked Twitter accounts, @NavyASRL and @RanRURugby, remain online. In a statement on Tuesday evening, a defence spokesman said some navy-linked accounts would remain online \"due to the site not being solely managed by navy, or branding arrangements such as with some sporting bodies such as the Australian Surf Rowers League, Team Navy as well as Navy Rugby Union\". \"Other sites and accounts will be reviewed once personnel have returned from the Reduced Activity Period in mid January,\" he said. A review of all navy branded social media is under way and will be completed by early 2016. According to defence regulations, personnel may express their views on political parties, candidates or issues, \"but not as defence personnel\". An ALA Senate candidate, Bernard Gaynor, is in a legal dispute with the defence force after he was sacked for criticising defence diversity policies on his private social media accounts. Gaynor won an appeal against his sacking in December but defence has appealed against that ruling. According to her official profile, Shindy's role as chief adviser of Islamic affairs is intended to give the branch \"a better understanding and appreciation of serving Muslims, their needs and how they view the world\". \"Another key function of the role is to increase the appeal of the navy as an employer of choice among the Australian Muslim community,\" the profile says. Shindy was awarded the Conspicuous Service Cross in the 2015 Australia Day honours. She was named NSW businesswoman of the year in November.",
