  "content": "It's a tale that's been told a thousand times throughout the entertainment industry. A talented newcomer builds a passionate community before catching the eye of a big corporation; a buy-out ensues and the original fanbase is alienated. Sometimes it's a rock band, sometimes a movie director, and sometimes it's a virtual reality technology firm with an affordable head-mounted display unit and a charming 21-year-old at its head. Yes, reactions to Facebook's $2bn purchase of Oculus VR, creator of the Oculus Rift headset, have been... varied. On Tuesday night, while business analysts were carefully sifting through Mark Zuckerberg's announcement, attempting to understand his intentions, hundreds of game developers were registering their concerns on Twitter. This is bad, was a familiar refrain, bad for Oculus, bad for games and bad for virtual reality. Leading the charge was Markus Persson, the creator of the hugely successful block-building game, Minecraft. \"We were in talks about maybe bringing a version to Oculus,\" he wrote . \"I just cancelled that deal. Facebook creeps me out.\" Go on to the Reddit post where Oculus founder Palmer Luckey gave his side of the story, or visit the announcement on the Oculus VR home page, and the reactions are very similar. \"I have unsubscribed,\" wrote one developer. \"I will be cancelling my preorder, I will not make games with the Rift, and I am not associating myself with a Facebook affiliated company.\" And from another, \"I am really upset by this. I had nothing but grief as a developer of Facebook titles, and the direction and actions of the Facebook company are not ones I can support.\" Illusion and disillusion The Guardian sought responses from the development community, and caught some of the same disillusionment. \"I never would have backed them if I thought this was even a remote possibility,\" said programmer Chip Collier. \"I'm literally sad because I feel like a promising future was really just a hopeless dream. VR has just been set back another 20 - 30 years.\" The fear, of course, is this: while Oculus VR seemed genuinely interested in developing a VR platform that would be wonderful and open for developers and innovative for end-users, Facebook may well just be looking for a new way to lock communities into its proprietary social network environment, while feeding adverts directly into their brains. Corporate terror And even if this Orwellian nightmare isn't realised, there's an aching fear that Facebook involvement won't speed things up, as Luckey has asserted, but slow everything right down \u2013 or make it much more dry and restricted. \"I'm irritated,\" says George Buckingham, a developer with offbeat studio Die Gute Fabrik. \"The FB acquisition of Oculus seems 80% likely to kill their momentum [...] It's probably going to get locked down in annoying ways and stop being a cool weird tech you can freely hack on. I hope someone else comes and makes basically the same thing. Though I guess that's Sony, now.\" For others, it's not so much about the minutae of the buy-out, the micro-clauses Facebook may or may not have inserted into the deal, it's about the fear of big corporations crushing the indie instinct. \"I think it makes a lot of sense for Zuck to go after this,\" says programmer Mykola Bilokonsky. \"But I am as queasy as anyone else at the prospect. I don't want to live in a future where a handful of giant companies are dividing up every piece of creative enterprise that stands a chance of reaching mass market.\" Indie game maker Chris Hecker summed up this meta-narrative on Twitter, thus: \"I can't wait until Google and Facebook go to war, with the autonomous robots on one side and the VR mind-controlled zombies on the other.\" The other side But the reactions haven't all been negative. Amid the anti-corporate clamour, there have been optimistic voices. \"This is a smart move for Oculus,\" says Rami Ismail, co-founder of cult Dutch studio, Vlambeer. \"We may all know of them in the tech scene, but outside of our bubble nobody has ever heard of them. If VR is to be established as a market, we need the average consumer to know of it, so having Facebook and Sony in the fray is good news. \"Oculus needed a backer that has huge mindshare, a lot of money, a lot of technological credibility and access to great software and hardware facilities. To be honest, I'm not even surprised Oculus was sold, I'm more surprised that Facebook ended up being the highest bidder.\" Jeff Murray of PsychicParrot Games, which has worked on several VR projects, is similarly pragmatic. \"The way I see it is that Oculus needs a market and if Facebook thinks it can provide that, fair enough,\" he says. \"Oculus aren't even beginning to help or create ways for devs to monetise their creations and they seem to be only interested in the tech. The only people making money from Oculus demos are people building installations or training sims and as far as I can tell those are pretty rare too. \"For the moment, [Oculus Rift is] a nice toy but without any real market, no-one can really push it forward software-wise. Perhaps Facebook will provide that?\" The bigger picture Perhaps the narrative we're being sold about the purchase is true. Luckey says that Oculus is free to pursue its interests in the virtual reality gaming sector, while Zuckerberg has suggested that he is interested in the further applications of VR technology: \"After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences.\" Some developers wonder if Facebook will quietly watch and learn as Oculus builds its tech, before taking the Rift concept in wildly new directions. According to game designer and social games expert, Will Luton, it's not about owning the current, it's about preparing for the future: \"Facebook is in the innovator's dilemma pretty hard and is obviously feeling the pressure on its stocks, so needs fresh growth \u2013 it's at saturation point in terms of users, I should think. \"My inkling would be that Oculus is a missing part of some other tech that Facebook has in the works. That could mean an OASIS-like virtual world \u2013 what Zuckerberg refers to as, 'getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow'.\" Robin Arnott, the experimental developer of VR titles Deep Sea and SoundSelf is optimistic about wider applications too. \"The fear comes from looking at VR with video-game shaped goggles,\" he says. \"But if you change your goggles, it's kind of exciting. Facebook, after all, is not a gaming company, but a communications company. And Oculus is not a gaming company, but a virtual reality company. I think Facebook's probably looking at the big-picture potential of VR outside of games - as a means of communication and sharing experiences. I can't imagine what they'll come up with together, but I have a feeling that it'll more closely resemble the holodeck than Farmville.\" James Crowson has developed The Wall, a VR experience based around Game of Thrones \u2013 but he's also beginning a Master's thesis at New York University, looking at using virtual reality for mental health treatment. He reckons, the backing of Facebook could lead to more support for similar therapeutic applications. \"[Oculus Rift] has been marketed as a tool for gaming, but there's clearly far more important uses for it, treatment being one of them,\" says Crowson. \"I'm sure that it's going to play an important part in the bridge between technology and health, for example, using exposure therapy to treat people with phobias such as acrophobia. Mark Zuckerburg has already identified uses for the Oculus other than gaming, for education purposes as well as health, so it's clearly on the radar for them.\" The Facebook effect Most developers concede that Facebook has had a large and incredibly pervasive effect on game design and mechanics. Titles like Farmville popularised the use of microtransactions and tight, endless compulsion loops \u2013 the controversial tools of the free-to-play era. Facebook set up the environment in which these titles could proliferate and then it changed the rules, tinkering with its privacy settings and unbalancing the eco-system for developers. Might the same happen to virtual reality? Or will Facebook concede control of the gaming infrastructure to Oculus, its eyes on the bigger prize of VR as a communication and education tool? In the VR gaming sector, it is not dealing with companies like Zynga, set up to exploit new networks for vast monetary gain; right now it is dealing with hobbyists and indies, small teams interested in the tech and the artistic possibilities. These are the people voicing their concerns on Twitter \u2013 these are the teams that feel betrayed. Facebook needs to tread this PR tightrope carefully. It needs to understand the sector it has just entered. \"Reaction from the gaming industry will fall into two major camps,\" concludes Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games at IHS Technology. \"There will be independent developers that will feel alienated by this move and may shift their priorities to other platforms. Others will see the advantages of having a much bigger entity behind the platform with deeper pockets alongside a massive audience of potential consumers across Facebook. \"Judging by Zuckerberg's comments, Facebook is keen to accelerate the development of Oculus' gaming capability, but I sense this is more about proving the concept and driving early adoption for a much broader set of applications many years down the road. \"It's a high risk and very long term bet, but if VR does amount to something more fundamental than its history suggests, why not be prepared?\" \u2022 Oculus: Facebook buys virtual reality gaming firm for $2bn \u2022 Minecraft for Oculus Rift cancelled in wake of Facebook deal",
