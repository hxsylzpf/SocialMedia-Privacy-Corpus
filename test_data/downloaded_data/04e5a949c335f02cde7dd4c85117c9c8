  "content": "A student in Ireland is trying to prevent six newspapers from identifying him for obtaining injunctions about an allegedly defamatory internet video clip. It is being claimed that he is seeking the kind of superinjunction that caused controversy in England last year. The student last week obtained temporary injunctions against a number of internet companies, including Facebook and Google, to prevent the rebroadcasting or republishing of material that, he claims, defames him by accusing him of taxi fare evasion. He is now seeking legal gags against the Irish Independent, Dublin Evening Herald, the Irish Times, the Examiner, the Star and the Sunday Times. He wishes to prohibit them from revealing his identity. His counsel, Pauline Walley, disagreed that she was seeking a super-injunction. She was not trying to prevent publication about the court proceedings but was objecting to the identification of her client. An Irish high court judge, Mr Justice Michael Peart, will hear the application tomorrow, which is contested by all six papers. Source: Irish Times",
