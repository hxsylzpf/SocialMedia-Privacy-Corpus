It is not being melodramatic to say that each one of us stands on the threshold between a world in which individual liberty and privacy are taken for granted - and appear to the majority to be unthreatened - and a dystopia of total and unwavering scrutiny by big corporations and the state. Yesterday the Guardian published an excellent report by David Leigh and Rob Evans which claimed that 40 million patients' private health records are to be uploaded to a central national database, regardless of their wishes or general concerns about security and privacy. At the same moment the Chairman of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics condemned the Police National DNA database for creating a nation of suspects and retaining DNA from people who had not been found guilty of a crime. These were followed today by the long awaited report of the surveillance society is published by the Britain's Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas. You could not have a clearer picture of the rapid expansion of surveillance and the terrifying implication it has for the relationship between the individual and the state. For the last few months I have been making a film about databases and the surveillance society with the director Neil Ferguson for More4 (to be broadcast on November 20). What surprised both of us was the extent to which the networks of surveillance and the reach of databases had grown with such little public awareness. Databases have an organic tendency to creep towards each other, creating new pathways of exchange that were never intended in the first place but which delight those that wish to control and know everything about us. These reports all underline mine and Neil's fears. There is now absolutely no excuse for ignorance. The information is there for all of us to see. But what can we do about it? The first thing to know is that we cannot rely on Parliament. None of these reports was produced or even enabled by MPs, who largely remain unaware of the great threat to society and their own institution. Laws have been passed in the vague belief that they fight against crime and terrorism. Only on the Liberal Democrat benches has there been any consistent concern raised about security of databases, privacy and the type of controlled society that Tony Blair is creating. Among the main parties there is very little evidence of democratic instincts .The Conservatives are compromised by a need to seem as tough on crime and terror as the government, while on the Labour backbenches you see a group of individuals who claim an entitlement to power which is utterly unmerited by their performance as democrats. We need to make those MPs understand that they have a duty to freedom and privacy, and the only way to do that is in Tony Blair's words \"to harry, hassle and hound them\" until they do.",
