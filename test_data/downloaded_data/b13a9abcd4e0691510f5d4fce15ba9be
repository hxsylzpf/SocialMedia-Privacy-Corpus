Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is to take the helm at the social network as interim chief executive, after Costolo's shock departure, but users backed Snoop's tongue-in-cheek ambition. Tweets in support quoted Snoop lyrics and puns and referred to the star's well-known love of marijuana. Many were retweeted by the star. Snoop is well known for his wide range of interests. He is a big fan of football (aka soccer) but perhaps most brilliantly, he is a follower of British soap Coronation Street, even pursuing a cameo role and professing his attraction to the character Deirdre Barlow, played by the late Anne Kirkbride. Speaking about the programme, he said: \"I love the whole dynamic, the way it is put together, it is my world, it is something I could fall into.\" Costolo leaves Twitter with the network reporting 302 million MAUs (monthly active users), but his tenure has been marked with issues surrounding abuse and bullying on the platform.
