  "content": "\"Phone-hacking represented a low point in journalism, a matter of great shame for the industry. It was extremely poor ethical and legal behaviour, and it must not be allowed to happen again.\" That's Stephen Abell, director of the Press Complaints Commission, talking last week about the News of the World's interception of voicemail messages. Most of our interview, published in today's Media Guardian print edition, dealt with privacy. But there was a key section on hacking. Abell, obviously aware of the criticisms of the PCC's handling of the hacking scandal, argues that \"lots of things have happened\" since the commission published its November 2009 report in which it found no evidence of having been \"materially misled\" by the paper. Since then, The Guardian's original allegations - of hacking having been widely used within the NoW - have been admitted by its publisher, News International. It has registered its \"sincere regret.\" Abell says: \"It is a serious issue, which is the reason we have set up a review committee to look into the whole affair, at what the paper did and what we did. It's very important that we learn lessons from it. We will look at what the News of the World did and said and hold them to account for it. We need to find ways of insuring that this doesn't happen again and stamp out such practices. At the same time, how could we have acted differently and better? How we can up our game?\" He points out that the PCC's chair, Baroness (Peta) Buscombe, has already issued a statement condemning phone-hacking (see here), though she did not condemn the paper by name. That, evidently, is to avoid pre-empting the review committee's final report. But I remind Abell that in its 2009 report, the PCC took a swipe at The Guardian - along with its editor, Alan Rusbridger, and reporter Nick Davies - for the ground-breaking investigation into the NoW's misbehaviour. To recap, the commission - while agreeing that The Guardian had performed \"a perfectly legitimate function\" in scrutinising the NoW's activities - argued that the The Guardian \"had obligations under the code requiring it to take care not to publish distorted or misleading information.\" There were other sceptical references to The Guardian's \"anonymous sources\" before the PCC argued that there \"did not seem to be anything concrete to support the implication that there had been a hitherto concealed criminal conspiracy at the News of the World to intrude into people's privacy.\" Rusbridger responded at the time that the report was \"worse than pointless\" and later resigned from the editors' code committee. With the paper now having been vindicated, I asked Abell: \"Why have you not apologised in public to the paper, and to Alan and Nick?\" He replied: \"The purpose of the review committee is to look at what we've done, and everything is up for grabs. It is a genuine, independent look again at how we acted, why we said the things we said, and what our function should be. \"None of this is easy. There's lots of material still to emerge. So care is required. These are difficult waters to navigate. \"But the PCC has been consistent - an absolute condemnation of those who have done it, recognition that it's a serious issue, agreement to look at ourselves, and a total commitment to playing our part in raising standards.\" But, I repeated, it was The Guardian that was responsible for bringing all this to light. Why haven't you said sorry? Abell said: \"There's no point in setting up a review committee and then pre-empting it. We have said The Guardian performed a very legitimate public service in examining this issue. \"And the PCC's stance cannot be other than one of condemnation. There are other strands too. We see this as a moment to galvanise industry to support the work of PCC in order to make it more effective.\" In other words, he refused to offer any apology. We moved on to discuss another aspect of the PCC's work that attracts criticism - the prominence, or lack of prominence, of the adjudications, apologies and corrections the commission requires newspaper to publish. \"It's the thing that concerns people a lot,\" Abell concedes. \"People are entitled to demand prominence. But there cannot be a mathematical equation between the original story and the apology. \"But there have been distinct improvements. Editors hate apologising and they do that more than ever before. \"About 80% of apologies and so on appear same page, or further forward or in corrections columns. It's baseless to say they're published at the back of book.\" The commission is also considering calls for adjudications and corrections to carry \"PCC branding\", in the form of the commission's logo. \"Having good branding on adjudications is important,\" said Abell. There is more on the subject in the PCC's 2010 annual report, which is due to be published tomorrow. It will be accompanied by a printed book called \"Perspectives\", containing short articles and comments from a range of people, including those who have used the commission's services. It also contains a history of the PCC by Professor Bob Pinker, one of the original PCC commissioners. I'll cover some of that material in a separate posting.",
