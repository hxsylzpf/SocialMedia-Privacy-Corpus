  "content": "The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act is due to become law in October. A consultation period to fix regulations which outline the circumstances under which businesses can lawfully intercept employees' communications was to expire at the end of August, but has now been extended to September 15 at the insistence of industry, which wants more powers. What is being proposed? A 1997 European Directive requires states to protect the confidentiality of communications - that is, phone calls, faxes and emails - although there is scope for interception, to provide \"evidence of a commercial transaction\", for example. The RIP Act, which already permits the government and other authorities (police, security services) to monitor email, allows the interception of emails by employers in situations where they believe that both sender and recipient have given their consent. But the draft regulations would go a step further, to authorise monitoring or recording of emails and phone calls without consent for specific reasons, such as a suspicion of \"unauthorised use\". Industry pressure groups argue that they should be able to monitor employees' emails without consent. Civil liberty groups and unions disagree, and say that staff should have the right to privacy at work. To have your say, email the home office consultation group on tdpd.tdpd@dti.gov.uk.",
