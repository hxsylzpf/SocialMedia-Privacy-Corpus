  "content": "Jonny Wilkinson, the publicity-shy hero of England's rugby World Cup squad, has warned newspaper editors he believes pictures of him and his girlfriend on holiday were a breach of his privacy. His lawyers have written to all national newspaper editors after the Sun, Daily Mirror and Daily Mail printed the pictures on Tuesday. They showed Wilkinson and his partner, Diana Stewart, relaxing on a beach in the Seychelles. The issue of photographs on beaches is a thorny one: the Press Complaints Commission's code of conduct prevents publication of pictures taken when subjects can claim a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\". The PCC has previously upheld complaints when celebrities have been pictured without their consent on a private beach, as was the case with the author JK Rowling in 2001. But individuals are deemed not to enjoy a right to privacy under the code when they are topping up their tans on public beaches, hence the rejection of a complaint by the newscaster Anna Ford in 2000. That decision led her to brand the PCC a \"pussycat regulator\". Wilkinson has guarded his privacy tightly since he was thrust to fame after the World Cup final against Australia last year. He has cold shouldered numerous requests for interviews and photo shoots in glossy magazines, but media interest has continued unabated. Hello! magazine has used his image twice on its front cover; this month's GQ claims to be an \"exclusive special edition\" featuring its own photographs of the sporting star, although the pictures were later revealed to have dated from last March. The only magazine to have secured a new set of poses is Men's Health. This week's notice to editors is the first time Wilkinson has resorted to lawyers in his attempts to hold a cordon around his private life. Last June the Radio 1 DJ Sara Cox won a legal action against the Sunday People, which published naked pictures of her and her husband on their honeymoon. They sued even though they had won an apology from the PCC.",
