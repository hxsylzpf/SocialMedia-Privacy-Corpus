  "content": "George Clooney has hired the screenwriter of Oscar-tipped Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything, Anthony McCarten, to write his upcoming film about the News of the World hacking scandal, reports Deadline. McCarten will adapt the bestselling book Hack Attack by Guardian journalist Nick Davies for the film, which Clooney revealed plans to direct last month. The expose is billed as an account of the phone-hacking scandal that rocked the British establishment and resulted in the closure of the 168-year-old tabloid. McCarten is a New Zealand-born screenwriter, producer and novelist who splits his time between London and Los Angeles. The Theory of Everything, starring Eddie Redmayne as Hawking, is seen as one of next year's potential awards season frontrunners and could see its writer challenge in the best adapted screenplay category at the Oscars. Clooney, whose father was a newsman and whose film Good Night, and Good Luck examined the celebrated work of television journalist Edward R Murrow, reportedly plans an All the Presidents Men-style procedural examining Davies' investigation into Rupert Murdoch's media empire and its questionable practices for confirming celebrity scoops. The actor and director said last month: \"This has all the elements \u2013 lying, corruption, blackmail \u2013 at the highest levels of government by the biggest newspaper in London. And the fact that it's true is the best part. Nick is a brave and stubborn reporter and we consider it an honour to put his book to film.\" Shooting on the film, also expected to be titled Hack Attack, will begin next year.",
