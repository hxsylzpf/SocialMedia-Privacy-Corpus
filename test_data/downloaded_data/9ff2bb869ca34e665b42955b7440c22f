  "content": "I'm finding Twitter very, very interesting - it's one of those tools which, once you tune in to it, seems to be the closest we humans can get to really rapid idea-sharing (and disagreeing, and so on). (I'm here. Icon courtesy Simpsonize me. Realistic, eh?) So, what do you think are the best ways to follow what's happening on it? What tools do you use to make sense of what's going on? I'm using Twitterrific (a Mac application). How about on Windows - what are the best tools there? Are there other Twitter Mac clients? For finding new people to follow, there's whoshouldIfollow. For following threaded conversations, there's quotably. (An example.) What else, though? Let's hear what the best Twitter tools are. There's a list at mashable, but which are the *best*, and why? (Note: duck above is not official Twitter icon. But looks fun.)",
