  "content": "The general secretary of the National Union of Journalists has hit out at the Mirror for not giving more support to the freelance journalist who has been ordered to identify the person who passed him medical notes on Moors murderer Ian Brady. Jeremy Dear said the NUJ would continue to back Robin Ackroyd, who was told by the high court today that he must reveal the source of leaked documents that resulted in a story about Brady appearing in the Daily Mirror. \"We're disappointed they haven't supported Robin further. The Mirror took the case so far. We would have liked them to take it further and continue an appeal up to the Europeam courts,\" said Dear. He added: \"All journalists will support this case. It is fundamental to a free press that the highest professional standards are upheld and this includes the journalist's duty to protect confidential sources. \"It is not so much the journalists we are trying to protect but their sources. \"It would be immoral for journalists to betray people to whom they have promised confidentiality. \"No one will give journalists vital information on cases like Ian Brady's if they think they will be grassed up and the public will have lost their right to be informed.\" In June, the House of Lords ordered the Mirror to identify the source of the story, which did not appear under Ackroyd's byline. Ackroyd agreed to identify himself in an subsequent article in the paper. However, he found himself in court again after the high security hospital where Brady is being detained launched a new legal claim to establish the original source of the leak. A spokesman for Mirror Group Newspapers confirmed it had no further involvement with the case, saying: \"We have no further comment to make.\"",
