The new controls \u2013 whereby a variety of different levels can be applied with a simple click of a button \u2013 will be rolled out across the 450m users of the worldwide network over the next few weeks, said Zuckerberg at a press conference at the company's headquarters. The controls will offer four basic settings: share data with everyone, with \"friends of friends\", \"friends only\" or \"recommended\" \u2013 which shares certain information, such as family information, with everyone but photos and videos only with friends of friends. However, Zuckerberg insisted privacy was still important and dismissed suggestions that Facebook relies on selling personal data to advertisers to grow. \"People think that we don't care about privacy, but that's not true,\" Zuckerberg said. \"There's a balance. More and more people want to share information, and as long as they have good controls over that, I think that's where the world is going.\" He insisted that Facebook does not use data gleaned from users' pages to sell to advertisers \u2013 and that that means it does not matter what privacy settings are applied for Facebook to be able to sell adverts. \"The principle is that we don't give any information to advertisers. We target the ads to people ourselves. Advertisers come to us with adverts that they want shown to particular [demographic groups of] people, and we take the ad and show it to the person that we think will be interested in that information. So it doesn't matter who you're showing your data to. It doesn't matter whether you share it at all.\" Zuckerberg acknowledged the intense criticism of the site's privacy settings had meant it was \"an intense few weeks\". He also admitted that online criticism of the complexity of altering Facebook's privacy settings had hit home and that it had been changed as a result. He acknowledged the discomfort that has been expressed but said it has not had any noticeable effect on user numbers. \"We track what's called the promoters \u2013 the people who would recommend others join Facebook. They're a good indicator of whether we're going to grow. We find that whenever we change something \u2013 anything \u2013 for the whole network, the level of promoters goes down. But then over time it slowly comes back up until it goes above the level it was before,\" he said.",
