  "content": "Marmite: you wait ages for a new story about it and then two come along at once. First, there was the news that makers of the divisive brown spread are to strike in protest at changes to their pension scheme; then on Monday night a tanker crash on the M1 spilt 20 tonnes of yeast extract over the motorway, prompting a road closure, a hasty clean-up operation and, most importantly, a steady stream of Marmite puns on Twitter. Here are a few of the best: \"Marmite lorry has crashed on the M1. The driver is being yeast extracted from the wreckage.\" @markfrary \"Did it affect the yeastbound carriageway?\" @suthers \"It marmite have made a mess but at yeast nobody was hurt, 2 page spread inside...\" @Ladadie \"My mum's driving down the M1 to see me. I'm worried marmite be late.\" @malcolmcoles \"Getting a bit bored of all the #Marmite jokes now across the media. At yeast the M1 is open again...\" @garethherincx \"We want to toast all those wanting to help mop up the spread of Marmite on the M1. Thankfully the driver has no serious injuries...\" @thisismarmite",
