  "content": "The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is facing renewed criticism for sending two 'non-technical' members of staff to investigate Google's illegal collection of data from Wi-Fi connections in July. Two senior members of ICO staff with \"considerable experience\" of data protection law cleared Google of any wrongdoing earlier this year after examining a sample of so-called \"payload\" data at Google's London headquarters. Conservative MP Rob Halfon said it was \"astonishing\" that the ICO \"did not send technical people\" to investigate the breach, which the ICO later ruled was a \"significant breach\" of the Data Protection Act. Last week the ICO ruled that, in light of subsequent investigations by international privacy commissioners, Google had broken data protection laws, contrary to its initial impression in July. Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, told the Guardian: \"I find it astonishing that the Information Commissioner seemingly did not send technical people to investigate the Google breach of our private data. \"The IOC seems more Keystone Cops than protector of our civil liberties. It is extraordinary that the IOC can spend \u00a313m on PR over 10 years but can't find the right resources to investigate breaches of our data protection.\" New information about the ICO's examination shows that the information commissioner, Christopher Graham since June 2009 and previously Richard Thomas, has not met a Google representative for two years. Staff from the ICO have met Google on two occasions in this time, written answers by the Ministry of Justice reveal. The ICO sent an assistant commissioner and a \"strategic liason group manager\" to examine the data at Google's headquarters in July, deciding after a two-and-a-half hour meeting that the company was unlikely to have collected \"significant amounts of personal data\" or data containing any \"meaningful personal details\". Details about the nature of the ICO's investigation into Google's unlawful data collection, which it admitted to in May, have until now been thin on the ground. The Ministry of Justice, the government department which the ICO is directly accountable to, released the details in response to written questions tabled by Halfon. The collection of so-called \"payload\" data, including full emails and passwords, from unsecured Wi-Fi connections by Google Street View cars is under renewed scrutiny in the UK following last month's parliamentary debate on privacy and the internet. The Metropolitan police has dropped its investigation into the breach. The information commissioner last week announced that Google will now be subject to an official audit of all of its data protection practices in the UK. \"It is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the Data Protection Act,\" he said. \"The most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from Google that this will not happen again \u2013 and to follow this up with an ICO audit.\" Following last week's ICO ruling, Google's global privacy counsel Peter Fleischer said the company was \"profoundly sorry\" for the collection.",
