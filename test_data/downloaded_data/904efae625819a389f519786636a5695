  "content": "Valentine's Day pop quiz! How many romantic status updates, poetic tweets and mean-spirited candy hearts have you seen today? There is only one satisfactory answer \u2013 \"too many to count\". Valentine's Day is one of those holidays that drives otherwise sensible people to an overshare frenzy. If you're not posting photos of yourself with a loved one to Instagram, or letting everyone in your social network know how much you loathe this holiday with some hate-tweeting, you are likely living in a monastery and therefore not the target readership for this blogpost. But for those of you who've already shared your Valentine's Day on social media: have you ever considered sharing how you really feel, anonymously? Secret-sharing app Whisper is massively popular \u2013 it claims upwards of 3 billion pageviews per month from people who just want to read each other's anonymous messages \u2013 and it's providing a completely alternate hotbed of social media activity this Valentine's Day. With that in mind, we tweeted a Google form to Guardian readers asking them to share the one thing they can't say \"out loud\" on Valentine's Day. Then we posted all of their responses to Whisper. The app interface is simple: we plugged reader secrets into Whisper, and then it generated photos to go with the text. Here's our chosen selection of 10 reader Whispers, but you can view all 50 responses \u2013 or add to them by using the hashtag #bittersweet-vday:",
