  "content": "The phenomenal growth in social networking over the past few years has given social workers a multitude of opportunities for promoting the profession and collaborating with service users. However, with the potential benefits come some significant challenges, including notorious cases of social workers being sanctioned for inappropriate online behaviour. These widely reported examples are a cautionary note to social workers who participate in social media activity. But, as a former social worker myself, I am concerned that they also create a climate of fear around social media at a time when we need to be doing everything we can to promote the profession. The British Association of Social Workers (BASW), in its social media policy, acknowledges that online technology brings opportunities for networking, communication and inclusive practice, while also warning of the challenges. Advice to social workers within the BASW policy is to \"maintain appropriate professional boundaries\" but the continuous expansion of social media renders what constitutes such \"appropriate\" behaviour difficult to judge, particularly within complex social work practice. For the past few months I have been leading #ASYEngage, a small University of Sussex-funded research project which follows several newly qualified social workers in their assessed and supported year in employment. I developed this project to uncover the varying practice opportunities and challenges that could be encountered by social workers in their first year after qualification. Some of the social workers who agreed to participate were uncomfortable with social media and chose not to involve themselves. However, at the beginning of the project, they realised that some knowledge of social networking and other digital practices might be needed in order to understand and connect with service users. As one research participant said: \"It is highly likely I will encounter issues with this in practice. I recently worked with a young mum whose life and subsequent wellbeing seemed to revolve around messages posted on Facebook, and I did struggle to get my head around her experience.\" As findings begin to emerge from the project, it is clear that education has a significant part to play in preparing future social workers for practice in an online environment. As one participant said: \"There needs to be much more conversation between practice and education\". Another particularly striking finding is the creativity shown by participating social workers. This, I believe, could contribute to what constitutes appropriate behaviour online and to social work practice more generally. One participant in the project even identified the need for simpler and more visual ways of communicating with certain service user groups and is hoping to develop an app to meet this need. Another reached the uncomfortable conclusion that whilst she may not always like or agree with service user postings on social media, these could fulfil an important role in balancing power relations. She said: \"Something for me to consider is whether the families I have seen using forums have experienced poor practice and whether this is an appropriate channel for keeping social work to account.\" With the closure of the College of Social Work last year, I believe the findings from this small research project could point a way forward to promote the profession and its core values though creative engagement with social media.
