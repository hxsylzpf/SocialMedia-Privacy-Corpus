  "content": "Is this the worst of times for the stars? Paul McCartney certainly thinks so. Fame is finally getting too much for him and it's all technology's fault. \"It's never been as hard as it is nowadays to be famous,\" he told Swiss newspaper Blick, because \"today everybody's got a telephone with a built-in camera\". Now poor Sir Paul says he can't enjoy a meal at a restaurant without having to pose for a photo \"every few seconds\". Technology has its upsides for the savvy celebrity, though. Yes, cameraphones have turned the public into plain-clothes paparazzi, but a tweeting superstar can now talk directly to their fanbase, instantly correcting misinformation and generally basking in the adoration. Plus they're free to google \"I love Paul McCartney\" when they're feeling down. It's not as if celebs were left in peace before digital technology either. As my grandparents' bulging autograph albums attest, you can comfortably bother a superstar with little more than a paper tissue and an eye-liner. In fact, I'm pretty sure Sir Paul's signature is in there somewhere. Somehow I doubt that posing for snaps is any more of a faff than signing my nan's dirty napkins.",
