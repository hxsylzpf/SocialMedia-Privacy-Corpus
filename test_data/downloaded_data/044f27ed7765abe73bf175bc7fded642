Bruce Daisley will become vice president of direct sales for Europe and remains managing director for the UK for the time being. Stephen McIntyre is currently VP of sales for Europe, Middle East and Africa as well as managing director for Twitter's operation in Ireland. He remains MD for Ireland but becomes VP of online and reseller sales for Europe. Twitter's advertising business has diversified as the company has grown in Europe, McIntyre said, denying that new entrants to the space presented a challenge for Twitter. \"We're in a competitive industry but focus on our own game and have a very clear business model,\" he told the Guardian. \"We're trying to make the core product easier to sign up for so new users can experiment with instant timelines, and we're also trying to make product more enjoyable for existing users by introducing video or new experiences like the cricket world cup.\" Twitter now operates in 34 countries in Europe, but does not break out its European advertising revenue figure. The UK, however, is Twitter's largest advertising market outside the US, accounting for 10.2% of worldwide revenues in 2013 and 10.5% in 2014, according to emarketer. Twitter's UK ad revenues were around a tenth of Facebook's in 2013 at \u00a338.8m, and dwarfed by Google's \u00a32.5bn. Around 79% of Twitter's users are outside the US, eMarketer estimates, though only 34.4% of revenues are generated outside the US. Twitter's latest product Periscope, launched in March 2015, marks another step into the video market as twitter attempts to claim a greater share of the video ad market worth $5.96bn in 2014 in the US alone. McIntyre said that from the outset, Twitter had been used for experimentation by businesses. \"It's very early days for Periscope but businesses as well as individuals are starting to use it in creative ways,\" he said. \"The [social networking] category is very large \u2013 big enough for several competitors to exist, so it is more about how we execute than about the competition.\" McIntyre dismissed the expectation that Twitter might have a broader executive management in Europe to handle issues beyond advertising sales, saying many US companies use \"a matrix model\" based on functional rather than geographic management. Daisley joined Twitter from YouTube and has been UK MD since September 2013, while McIntyre joined Twitter in 2012 from Google.",
