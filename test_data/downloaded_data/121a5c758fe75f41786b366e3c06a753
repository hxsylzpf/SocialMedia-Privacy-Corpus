  "content": "A new British dotcom start-up will today take on the might of Silicon Valley in the booming market of social networks aimed at people in business with the launch of Talkbiznow.com. Following the success of sites such as Facebook, MySpace and Bebo, social networking has moved into the business world. In June, California-based LinkedIn, which has more than 25 million users, joined the internet jet set when it secured a billion-dollar valuation in a funding round that included Sequoia Capital, the Silicon Valley investor that backed YouTube. The previous month saw Plaxo acquired by US cable company Comcast. But Talkbiznow, which is aiming for 3 million users within six months, goes a step further by offering people the ability to set up online conferences; chat instantly with contacts while sharing a range of business documents; and search for more than just people's names in the hunt for new connections. \"We are about much more than just keeping in touch, we are about making people more productive in their business network,\" said chief executive and co-founder Martin Warner, a former investment banker with JP Morgan. The concern for Talkbiznow - which employs only 11 staff in London, Nottingham and San Francisco - is whether it has come to the game too late. Warner, however, said the company had been able to learn from mistakes made by rival sites. Talkbiznow, which has been in development for six months, has already raised two rounds of funding from European investors and is putting the finishing touches to a $25m (\u00a313.4m) third round that is likely to see the company take on at least one major US venture capital firm.",
