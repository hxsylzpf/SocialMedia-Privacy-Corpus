  "content": "When Geoff Peck hit his lowest point, he found that the intense pain of his blackest moment was turned into entertainment, with the help of CCTV cameras. Peck, 40, cut his wrists in the centre of Brentwood in Essex in August 1995. Staff monitoring CCTV cameras covering the area called police who calmed him down and rushed him to hospital. He recovered and began rebuilding his life after the trauma of his suicide bid. But eight months later, his partner was stopped in the street by neighbours. They told her they had seen Peck on the local television station, Anglia. It was the film of his suicide attempt. Unbeknown to him, the footage had been sold to television companies and broadcast. As the law stood then, he found that there was nothing he could do about it and no one had needed to seek his permission. It became a stark example of how the technology of CCTV cameras, even when they had been used for the best of purposes, could be misused in a way that trampled over a citizen's need for privacy at his most vulnerable time. Brentwood council sold the footage hoping to boost support for the use of CCTV cameras by demonstrating so vividly that their use could save lives. Peck found it was ruining his - and humiliating him. The footage also found its way onto the BBC's Crime Beat programme. Peck was shown with his face obscured, but he was clearly visible in trailers and in the end credits. The corporation later apologised. Local newspapers printed stills. Peck told reporters in the aftermath of the incident: \"I wouldn't have minded if it were for a police training film, I've nothing against the Old Bill, they saved my life. But this was salacious and cheap television which lumped me together with criminals. Didn't anyone wonder what effect this could have on someone who had already tried to commit suicide?\" His attempt to end his own life came after his second marriage hit trouble. Then his partner was diagnosed as having Hepatitis C. In 1995, such use of CCTV footage was ungoverned. The law lagged behind the technology and the uses it could be put to. The 1998 Data Protection Act introduced stricter controls on the use of CCTV footage. David Evans, compliance manager at the office of the Information Commissioner, said what happened to Peck would not have been illegal: \"There wasn't any regime covering the sale of material back then. That was a void.\" There were a flurry of programmes based on CCTV footage showing far more innocuous incidents than the one involving Peck. The 1998 act put a stop to that. Now, before the material can be sold or used by the media, the permission of those pictured is required. \"The footage should not be sold in the first place, and then not broadcast. If that happened, the council and the broadcaster would be breaking the data protection act,\" said Evans. The tougher controls were needed, he added, to assuage fears about CCTV: \"When the footage was sold onwards in the Peck case, it undermined the credibility of the system. Councils, the police and the operators of private systems want to maintain the systems' credibility.\" There have been no prosecutions for misuse of CCTV footage. Evans says this is because CCTV owners are aware of the legal requirements they operate under. \"Not to say it couldn't happen again, if someone was wilful enough, but it shouldn't.\" Peck's case is now being pursued by Liberty. The European Court of Human Rights ruled last year that he had an arguable case. The court will be asked to rule whether his right to respect for his private life was infringed as enshrined under the European convention on human rights. James Welch, legal director, at Liberty, said: \"Mr Peck's rights under article 8 were breached, not because he was filmed, but having been filmed the footage was passed on to the media and broadcast.\" \u00b7 Vikram Dodd is a Guardian reporter. The following apology was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Friday October 4, 2002 In this article we repeated a series of errors relating to an incident involving a person who, we wrongly said, was shown on CCTV attempting suicide in the centre of Brentwood in Essex. We published a correction and apology relating to the earlier article on August 4 last year. In part, this is what it said: \"In fact the CCTV recording showed no evidence of a suicide attempt, but it did show a man carrying a large knife ... and it showed the man being disarmed by the police. We accept that and we also accept that the CCTV recording was not sold but released - on the understanding that the individual's identity would be protected - to demonstrate how a potentially dangerous situation could be avoided.\" We repeat that there was no film of a suicide attempt, Brentwood council did not sell the CCTV footage of the incident, and in addition the police did not calm the person down and rush him to hospital. We repeat our apologies to Brentwood council.",
