  "content": "Is Ed Balls the first cabinet minister to become addicted to Twitter? Last week the Guardian was one of several media organisations fooled by someone pretending to be David Miliband tweeting a tribute to Michael Jackson. So, when I read this morning that someone called edballsmp is using Twitter to post his stir fry tips, I thought I had better check it out. I have \u2013 and it really is the children's secretary. Balls isn't the first cabinet minister to use Twitter, but he seems to be the first one to really get the bug. The Tweetminster website has links to all the MPs who are on Twitter. Some cabinet ministers, such as Harriet Harman and John Denham, just seem to use it to post news releases. And others, Jack Straw and Andy Burnham, for example, use it to link to their Commons speeches, via TheyWorkForYou. As for real tweeters? Liam Byrne, the chief secretary to the Treasury, uses Twitter reasonably often, but mostly to post political bulletins, like this one, from two weeks ago: [George] Osborne says he wants fiscal honesty! OK, here's three tests: will you confirm you will spend less than Labour whatever the situation? Ben Bradshaw, the culture secretary, is another occasional tweeter. His most recent tweet came on Monday, when he was in Norwich North exhorting his \"followers\" to support the Labour byelection campaign. But Balls has really got the habit. He only started tweeting last month and, as he says himself, it took him a while to get the hang of it. Now there's no stopping him. On Monday he posted four tweets. On Tuesday there were six. And yesterday there were 10. More importantly, he has also realised that you haven't really embraced Twitter unless you're prepared to broadcast to the world your trivia. Yesterday's highlights included: It is cool in the dark House of Commons committee rooms buried under the chamber itself ... Just come out blinking into the sunlight ... And: Just cooked stir-fry ... No fish sauce but soy, oyster and v good chilli ... Spoonful of sugar offsets heat v well And: Having cooked dinner, I now sitting here with box of papers to do ... Another hour to go ... good to be distracted Still, I'm following him now and I live in hope. Tom Harris tweeted from inside a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party recently, which I think was unprecedented. Will someone ever tweet from inside a cabinet meeting? I suppose anything's possible these days.",
