  "content": "IDC isn't generally one of the more excitable research firms in the technology world, so when it predicts a \"massive deceleration\" in tablet shipments this year, it's not seeking headlines for the sake of it. The company has forecast that overall tablet shipments \u2013 familiar caveat: not sales \u2013 will grow by 7.2% globally in 2014, down from 52.5% in 2013. What's more, it's predicting that shipments of Apple's iPad will decline year-on-year for the first time: a 12.7% drop to 64.9m units in 2014, compared to growth of 16% for Android tablets (to 159.5m units) and 67.3% for Windows tablets (to 10.9m units). So what's going on here? IDC is pointing to longer device life-cycles than originally expected: 3-4 years or even more before many people feel the need to upgrade, rather than the 2-3 years familiar from smartphones. What's your view? Are people simply hanging on to their tablets for longer, or is there something else afoot in the tablet category? And while Apple is likely to cite the shipments v sales issue when questioned on this, do you think there's more to the predicted year-on-year decline for iPad? The comments section is open for your thoughts. What else is happening in tech today? Some more links to think about: EC 'digital tsar' warning over net neutrality Long a hot-button issue in the US, the net neutrality debate is warming up in Europe. After recent warnings that governments may be tempted to water down proposals for net neutrality, incoming VP for the digital single market in the European Commission, Andrus Ansip, has spoken out. \"All the traffic has to be treated equally. The Internet has to stay open for everybody.\" The positive side of Spotify Indie musician Ron Pope has penned an opinion column for Billboard on why he thinks Taylor Swift is \"misinformed\" about Spotify and streaming music. He says he's made more than $250k from 44.6m Spotify streams in the last year. \"I've built a worldwide network of ravenous, devoted fans through these more grassroots channels...\" Google has removed nearly 3m Pirate Bay URLs TorrentFreak has been digging into Google's transparency data for copyright takedowns on its search engine, finding that it has been asked to remove more than 3m URLs on The Pirate Bay. But that still makes it only the 23rd biggest site in terms of removal requests: filesharing site Rapidgator has nearly 13m. Toy channels: still huge on YouTube Parents with children of a certain age will know all about DisneyCollector: the hypnotic toy-unboxing channel is the second biggest on YouTube with 311.8m views in September alone. But it's not the only channel in that area: Tubefilter has a report on multi-channel network Maker Studios signing up five other toy channels that between them do more than 300m monthly views. Could Twitter buy Bieber-staked app Shots? Selfie-sharing app Shots of Me launched a year ago, with Justin Bieber's investment in its parent company the subject of plenty of attention. A year later, it sits in 125th place in the free social apps category on Apple's US App Store. A flop? Not if rumours this week that Twitter is in talks to buy it turn out to be true. Because sharing selfies on Twitter isn't easy enough already, presumably. Oh, wait... What else? The comments section is open for your links, as well as your thoughts on the stories above.",
