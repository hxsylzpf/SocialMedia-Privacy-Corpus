  "content": "The Sun's royal photographer, Arthur Edwards, said today that Prince William had told him he intends to marry Kate Middleton. Edwards added that he had talked to the Prince about his love for Ms Middleton, giving evidence to the Commons culture, media and sport select committee for its investigation of media invasion of privacy. \"She is a private citizen and she is in love with Prince William and I am sure that one day they will get married, I have talked to him about this,\" he said. This revelation came in the middle of Edwards' giving evidence about the distress he claimed Ms Middleton had suffered at the hands of photographers and provoked astonishment among the MPs, witnesses and journalists present. \"He has made it clear that he wants to get married and I believe what he says, and they should be left alone,\" he said. Edwards added that he had heard from friends of Ms Middleton about her distress at media intrusion into her life and said photographers had followed her shopping and even climbed onto buses to photograph her. But he said that press intrusion had melted away after the adverse reaction to paparazzi activity during her recent birthday. He praised his boss, Mr Hinton, for banning the company's newspapers from using paparazzi photographs of Ms Middleton. \"When Les made that rule on our papers banning paparazzi pictures of Ms Middleton, I thought everybody came to their senses,\" Edwards said. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
