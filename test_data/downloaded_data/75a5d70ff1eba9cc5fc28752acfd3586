But experts are warning consumers not to be \"lulled into a false sense of security\". The POLi and eWise systems, launched this month, offer the option to pay directly from a bank account at supporting online retailers' checkout pages. Shoppers selecting the option are automatically taken to their bank's log-in page where, after they have manually logged in, a page appears on which the necessary payment fields are \"pre-populated\" with the correct amount and the retailer's bank account details. Once the consumer has accepted the purchase, the funds are transferred and the retailer is given a confirmation code so they can ship the goods. Not cleared for payment The companies behind each system claim this process of being automatically directed to a bank account gets around the problem of people either not having cards or not wanting to type in their card numbers on a merchant's site. They claim their systems provide greater protection for retailers by ensuring payment is cleared from the customer's available funds for a lower fee than a credit or debit card provider. It also saves a retailer from being responsible for storing card details securely. No retailer wants to follow in the footsteps of TJX, which lost more than 45m customer records between 2005 and 2007 (tinyurl.com/3y3vls). While web security experts agree that the gains for retailers are undeniable, they are questioning what the consumer gets from the two new systems. No UK bank has yet agreed to work with either payment system. None of them would provide a spokesperson to explain why not, but one can assume they do not want to allow a third party in to their back office systems. It would also be fair to say that eWise is not a popular operator among banks because it is behind the account aggregation services at Egg and First Direct which allow customers to log in to several accounts, with different banks, from one page. Banks are opposed to this as it means customers give a third-party site their passwords and risk compromising several accounts if the password falls into the wrong hands. Without access to the banks, the crux of the potential security risk each system poses is that users need to download software to allow POLi and eWise to fill out payment forms on their behalf. While POLi requires users to download a Microsoft .Net application for the payment, eWise requires users to download an ActiveX program (which will only run in Internet Explorer, on Windows). These are not routes which Greg Day, a security analyst at McAfee, believes will engender confidence: \"Using ActiveX for online payments is the kind of thing that would make me run a mile. [It] is probably the most used route for hackers to get in ... and steal personal information.\" Security analysts believe that if the payment systems become popular, they will be a powerful magnet for criminal gangs. Yuval Ben Itzahk, chief technology officer of security provider Finjan, says it is not the legitimate version of the software that could cause problems, but the potential fakes. \"As soon as you download any type of software to do with payments you open it up to phishers and social engineers,\" he says. \"If it becomes popular I can bet you 100% that phishers will launch sites claiming to offer it as a download and they will email people telling them they need to upgrade their current version and, if the person falls for it, they will end up with some malware code, probably a keylogger, which will record their bank account password and pass it on to the criminals.\" Web security experts are also claiming that the downloads do not follow a simple premise: if you are asking consumers to change the way they pay for goods, there should be a very clear security benefit, rather than an added potential risk. \"I can't see that either of these new systems brings in a new layer of security, but they do add a new layer of vulnerability,\" says Rik Ferguson of web security company Trend Micro. \"I can't see why someone would chose to open themselves up to the risk of paying direct through their bank when it's not clear who will pick up the tab if things go wrong.\" Pay up Certainly neither system operator is promising they will bear responsibility for any losses suffered through their technology becoming compromised, pointing out that, unlike PayPal, they do not store a user's bank account. Hence, the issue of responsibility is key, believes Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos. \"It may take some wrangling but if things go wrong with your bank, they'll pick up the tab and it's the same with a retailer or a card issuer. It's also the same with PayPal - although they're a big target for phishers, they have a clear policy for putting things right so that's what I would question these new systems are missing.\" Mark Matthews, managing director of eWise, points out that all communication through the eWise system is encrypted and that the system is \"scaleable and robust\" and has been used in Australia without incident. David Gagie, managing director of Netbanx, which is behind the POLi system, says it accounts for nearly one in four online transactions in Australia and has proven far less prone to fraud than credit and debit cards. \"People trust it because they realise if you don't give a retailer your card details in the first place they can't be lost or misused,\" he says. Gagie adds that Netbanx is working on adding a VeriSign certificate, similar to those used by all major high street banks online, for extra security. Users click on a padlock symbol to ensure it is issued by VeriSign. But this is unlikely to be in place when the system finishes its trial with undisclosed retailers next month. As for working with the banks, eWise's Matthews is still hopeful. But he says: \"We've talked to all the major banks but there always seems to be a bigger project that they're working on. We'd still welcome the chance to work with them.\"",
