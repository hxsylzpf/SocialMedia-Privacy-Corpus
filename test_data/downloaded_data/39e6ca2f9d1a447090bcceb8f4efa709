  "content": "As part of our Edinburgh festival coverage this year, guardian.co.uk has teamed up with Ed Twinge, a \"realtime fringe review service\", which rates festival acts according to the reviews you give them on Twitter. You can see the Ed Twinge Top 10 right here on the Guardian website - it appears on the righthand side of all our articles about the festival, as well as on our main Edinburgh festival page. Perfomances are ranked according to how many people have tweeted about the act, and how positive the tweets have been - using a \"karma rating\". Over to Ed Twinge to explain: \"Our karma rating is based on statistical confidence scoring. The karma rating for an act will go up the more positive things that people say about it and down the more negative things that people say about it. We take into account that lots of people saying the same thing is much more meaningful than just one or two.\" It also involves some complicated-sounding mathematical stuff, which you can find out more about here, if you like that kind of thing. You can sort the performances by genre using the dropdown menu at the top of the Guardian/Ed Twinge box. To join in and start reviewing shows yourself, simply visit the Ed Twinge website and log in using your Twitter account details. Type the name of the performer you'd like to review, and enter your verdict on the act in 130 characters or fewer (the remaining 10 characters are reserved for the 'edtwinge' hashtag), then keep an eye on the Guardian's festival coverage to see if your chosen show gathers enough karma to make it into the top 10.",
