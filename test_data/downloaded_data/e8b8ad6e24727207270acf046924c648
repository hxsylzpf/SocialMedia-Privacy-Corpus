  "content": "A whole new artform, or wilful desecration? Bringing the past to life, or changing history? The jury's still out on colorization (sic): taking old black-and-white photographs of famous people or historical events and using Photoshop or something similar to transform them into colour pictures that, bar the trappings of the time \u2013 the haircuts, the frock-coats, the beards, Model T Fords and tin helmets \u2013 look like they could have been taken yesterday. The effect is, at any rate, startling, and has spawned a popular Reddit group, ColorizedHistory, featuring the work of a dozen or so semi-professional colorizers, as well as a Facebook page, History in Color, with more than 30,000 likes. It is also going mainstream: last year Time magazine commissioned one colorizer, 23-year-old Swede Sanna Dullaway, to produce a gallery of colorized photographs of Abraham Lincoln. Dullaway told the magazine she started colorizing a couple of years ago while listening to Rage Against the Machine's debut album, whose cover shows a celebrated Associated Press black-and-white picture of a self-immolating Vietnamese Buddhist monk. She wanted a way \"to make the flames come alive\" so colorized first them, then the whole picture. When she posted it on Reddit, it went viral. Since then, Dullaway and fellow colorizers such as Jordan Lloyd and Dana Keller have colorized portraits of the likes of Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin, Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor, as well as historical scenes of the Hindenburg disaster, British troops heading to France in 1939, and tests of the hydrogen bomb. The best, taking anything from one hour for a studio portrait to five for an outdoor scene, are both subtle and sophisticated, displaying a nuanced, layered and undeniably artistic use of colour that, as Time puts it, \"maintains the photographic integrity of the originals\" while showing what they might have looked like \"had colour photography existed at the time\". Not everyone is convinced: some people argue forcefully that colorizing trashes both the original photo and the history it recorded. In an interview with Mashable, Keller, who has a background in graphic design and photography, said he \"can see where they're coming from\". But at its best, he said, colorizing can reconnect us with historic black-and-white pictures from which our modern eyes leave us feeling detached. Colour \"establishes a renewed familiarity with the past\", he said. \"It can force us to instantly see an old photograph with a new perspective, and truly make it seem as if the past it portrays wasn't that long ago after all.\"",
