  "content": "Rio Ferdinand has quickly moved to downplay reports that he is working on the formation of a new footballers' union \u2013 specifically, but not uniquely for black players. \"Don't believe all u read\", he advised his almost three-and-a-half million Twitter followers, before reverting to matters more commonly discussed in his feed \u2013 on this occasion, shaving methods and products. According to the Daily Mail, the Federation of Black Players would be funded by all professionals choosing to join and is indicative of growing disillusionment with the approach of the Football Association, Professional Footballers' Association and Kick It Out campaign in dealing with issues of racism. Matters reached a head after John Terry was found guilty by the FA of racial abuse, as although his language was felt to be more offensive than that used by Luis Su\u00e1rez to Patrice Evra last season, the suspension given to Terry was half that received by Su\u00e1rez, whose repeated infringment was deemed an aggravating factor. But this reasoning was not accepted by many in the football community, prominent black players among them. Consequently, Rio Ferdinand and his brother Anton, England internationals Shaun Wright-Phillips, Micah Richards and Joleon Lescott, and Djibril Ciss\u00e9, Kenwyne Jones and Jason Roberts, opted against wearing Kick It Out T-shirts prior to last weekend's games. This stance has been criticised by the PFA chairman Gordon Taylor. \"The longer it goes on, the more divisive it is becoming,\" he argued. \"We have black player against black player, different views of Glen Johnson, Ashley Cole, Rio Ferdinand. I just feel it is time for cool reflection on their behalf.\" Taylor is also opposed to the formation of a second union. \"If they want their own particular select group who they feel they can influence everybody more than the whole PFA as a union together, I would say they are seriously mistaken. If we are not careful this will set us back years. It would not only set back the game, it would set back the anti-racist initiative. It would encourage the extremists.\" Shaka Hislop, honorary president and founder member of Show Racism the Red Card (SRtRC), agrees - but only to a point. Though he believes \"the only way forward\" to be \"frank and meaningful discussion between minority players, their representatives, the Premier League, the FA and groups such as Kick It Out and SRtRC,\" he insists that the authorities must do more. \"In my opinion, a fine for a player that has, and continues to earn as much out of the game as John Terry, is meaningless. A four-game suspension is a slap in the face of what has been a unified call for stronger action. A call which the FA themselves echo when the accused are fans of other nations\u2026 By being as soft as they were on John Terry they have contradicted themselves and ostracised the very people and ideals they intended to support and champion.\" Similarly, Taylor received qualified support only from the Wales and Aberdeen keeper Jason Brown \u2013 but only in principle. \"We don't want to be rebels and break away,\" he told Sky Sports News, \"but if they're not doing enough, they're driving us to go down that road. I know four to five players who have met with Kick It Out and the PFA and gave them suggestions, but it seems they must have got lost because they have done nothing.\" Keith Vaz, MP for Leicester East, agrees that official bodies are not doing enough. After his early day motion last week calling for Uefa to impose stringent sanctions on the Serbian Football Association as punishment for the racist abuse endured by members of England's Under-21 squad, he tabled a second on Tuesday \u2013 this time asking the FA to take a stronger stance against racism in football. \"Racism has no place in multicultural 21st Century Britain, especially not in sport,\" he said in a press release. \"Although the Kick It Out campaign has done much to eliminate racism in our football stadiums, it is clear that more needs to be done. The chairman of the campaign, Lord Ouseley, has said that the charity's powers are limited and that overall responsibility for racism in football remains with the FA. The FA need to send out the right message following the John Terry incident. Rio's stance should be praised, not punished.\"",
