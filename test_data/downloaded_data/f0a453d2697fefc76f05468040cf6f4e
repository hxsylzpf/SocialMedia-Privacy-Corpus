  "content": "Lawyers acting for Liz Hurley's former lover, Steve Bing, are considering further legal action against the Mirror, which published a satirical apology to the millionaire yesterday. Mr Bing's lawyer, Martin Singer, confirmed his firm would be looking at whether the extraordinarily lengthy apology, which was published in a 'wanted' style poster in the paper yesterday, met the spirit of the deal struck with the Mirror. Although the Mirror printed every word Mr Bing's lawyers had requested, the satirical undercurrent of the apology was obvious because of the over the top presention. A full page was cleared for a poster-style announcement and if any readers were still in doubt, an article juxtaposed on the opposite page explained why Americans \"can't understand irony or sarcasm\". Mr Singer's comments come after the Mirror's editor, Piers Morgan, yesterday told BBC Radio 4's World At One that the apology was the \"most extraordinary we have ever published... in every sense, not least if you have a developed sense of humour\". \"We are going to evaluate whether or not this constitutes potentially a breach of the settlement agreed with the Mirror,\" Mr Singer told today's World At One news bulletin on BBC Radio 4. \"If in any manner whatsoever Mr Morgan is trying to state that he didn't want to go forward with this deal and, in fact, this was not intended as a full apology, then it's a breach of our agreement,\" he added. \"In terms of the [Kevin O'Sullivan] article, which I saw as well, if that was a way to try and diminish the apology we'll evaluate whether or not the Mirror will be facing additional liability for what it did.\" The agreement between the Mirror and Mr Bing's Los Angeles-based lawyers, Lavely &amp; Singer, settled a $40m lawsuit launched in the US last year. The paper has paid no costs or damages. Mr Bing launched the lawsuit after the Mirror printed his LA office number and urged readers to call him during its coverage of his break-up with Hurley.",
