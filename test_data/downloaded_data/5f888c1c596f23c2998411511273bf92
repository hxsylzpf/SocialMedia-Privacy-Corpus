  "content": "Reporter and newspaper Twitter feeds are expected to brought under the regulation of the Press Complaints Commission later this year, the first time the body has sought to consolidate social media messages under its remit. The PCC believes that some postings on Twitter are, in effect part of a \"newspaper's editorial product\", writings that its code of practice would otherwise cover if the same text appeared in print or on a newspaper website. A change in the code would circumvent a loophole that \u2013 in theory \u2013 means that there is no form of redress via the PCC if somebody wanted to complain about an alleged inaccuracy in a statement that was tweeted. Last year the PCC found it was unable to rule in a complaint made against tweets published by the Brighton Argus. Its plan, though, is to distinguish between journalists' public and private tweets. Any Twitter feed that has the name of the newspaper and is clearly an official feed \u2013 such as @telegraphnews or @thesun_bizarre \u2013 will almost certainly be regulated. However, that principle could be further extended to cover a reporter's \"official\" work account, whilst leaving personal accounts that discuss conversations over breakfast and weekend exploits as outside its ambit. Some journalists \u2013 such as the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones \u2013 already maintain multiple accounts in an effort to preserve professional and personal distinctions. The PCC wants each newspaper to develop a \"Twitter policy\", to tell its reporters which accounts are considered part of its editorial product and which are not. But with many newspapers, including the Guardian, republishing tweets on their site, many journalist musings are likely to be drawn in. An online working group of the PCC has already recommended that the body undertake a \"remit extension\", the formal mechanism by which the self-regulatory body takes on a new area of responsibility, after consulting with the newspaper industry as to how Twitter regulation can be implemented. That consultation is due to finish in the summer and the new rules are likely to be in place by the end of the year. Publication on Twitter is already subject to libel laws and court orders \u2013 the internet, of course, does not exist in a legal vacuum. Last week, for example, journalists at the Guardian were reminded that tweets that hinted at the identity of individuals covered by injunctions would be a breach of the injunction itself. In February the PCC ruled that information posted on Twitter should be considered public and publishable by newspapers after it cleared the Daily Mail and Independent on Sunday of breaching privacy guidelines. Both newspapers had reported on tweets posted by Sarah Baskerville, a Department for Transport employee, in November last year. Baskerville, who had around 700 Twitter followers at the time, described a course leader as \"mental\" and posted links to tweets attacking government \"spin\" and Whitehall waste. Baskerville complained to the press regulator, arguing that she could have a \"reasonable expectation\" of privacy and that the reporting was misleading. The Daily Mail and Independent on Sunday argued that the messages were public and could be read by anyone. The PCC decided in favour of the newspapers, in what is the regulator's first ruling on the republication of information posted on Twitter. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
