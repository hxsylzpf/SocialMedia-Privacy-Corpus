  "content": "What's more important at the fringe: being funny or creating a buzz about your show? It's hard to say. Making yourself out to be obscenely successful is essential these days. You either hype it up or go home. Basically, it's like smearing your show with baby oil and making it wear a pair of Spanx. Twitter is a great way to do it. Take Scottish comic Iain Stirling's masterly tweet: \"Do you like comedians who massively over-estimate their own appeal? Then I'm doing an EXTRA SHOW this Saturday at 11pm.\" Russell Kane, winner of the 2010 comedy award, is more subtle. \"Fannytastic first night in Edinburgh,\" he posted. \"You sozzled maniacs. Must at least half-behave for first few nights.\" Irishman Michael Legge, on the other hand, uses Twitter to chronicle his daily frustrations: \"I just kicked an entire musical impro group to death and then pissed on them. I am a tiny owl.\" Retweeting praise can seem a bit egomaniacal \u2013 but since when's that been a problem for standups? Putting on extra shows is another trick: it's a great way of making sure people know \u2013 or think \u2013 that there's too much demand for your amazing product. Some comics put extra shows on sale before the festival even starts; others before the brochure's even published. Maybe I should start doing that. In fact, I'm putting tickets on sale now for my extra shows at next year's fringe \u2013 and hurry folks because they're already booking up fast. The act's called: \"Susan Calman's Extra Show \u2013 Please RT.\" Few things beat getting a celebrity to tweet about your show, though. But it's better if it's a good one: someone like Kirsty Wark, say. If I saw her, I would stand nearby and start talking loudly about \"Susan Calman's show\" \u2013 using words like powerful, moving, riotous, life-changing and sexually charged. If that fails, tie yourself to a lamppost on the Royal Mile, pretending you're being held there by God because your show is so incredible she feels threatened. Nothing over the top, though. You don't want to look desperate.",
