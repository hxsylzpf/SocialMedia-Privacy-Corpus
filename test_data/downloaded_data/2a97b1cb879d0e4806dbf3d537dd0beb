Twenty-three staff signed a complaint posted on the newsroom internal memo board about the over-use, and mis-use, of Twitter. They cite a couple of examples: Last month, a very serious story about a 15-year-old girl and her mother... both killed by the teen's older boyfriend... included a quote by someone named \u00eelagordita. The quote... \"There was absolutely nothing good that could have possibly come from this relationship\"... did not add any particular insight to the story. It was added, at the suggestion of an editor... in an effort to show the story was generating interest online. But including the quote in the final story meant leaving out quotes from people who were close to the tragedy. On Sunday, we devoted the week's most desirable newspaper real estate to a series of tweets from our readers about 9/11. We know almost nothing about these people. The names could be real, but maybe not. It doesn't really matter in Twitter world. So, in a story that begins on the top of our front page, we have geomens and Karl B Gordon Geck and Neko-do and Miami Herald user and Afro-Cheez offering such trenchant and profound observations as: 'I was sleeping,' and 'In my car... coming home from the gym,' and 'Standing at my kitchen sink.' Is there any reason why our dwindling pool of readers would care about any of this? The complainants say the Herald is becoming a \"flea market\", adding: \"We're hoping to start a discussion about the quality of our front page, and the newspaper in general... Readers who still buy our product aren't buying it because they care what Gordon Geck has to say. \"They buy it because they can read about what their city and county governments are doing in thoughtful prose.\" Media Bistro writer Ryan Derousseau thinks this kind of debate will be held in many newsrooms \"as newspapers react to the social media world.\" He adds: \"The debate seems a little less one-sided if you actually choose Twitter quotes that provide a sharp opinion and witty analysis.\" Sources: New Times/Media Bistro",
