Thus the noughties could be seen as the period of Google's inexorable rise, of Apple's metamorphosis into a music and mobile phone colossus, of Amazon's increasing dominance, of mushrooming user-generated content (Flickr, Blogger) and social networking (MySpace, Facebook, Twitter), of the emergence of Wikipedia as the world's leading reference work, of YouTube and the BBC's iPlayer \u2013 and of corporate stumbles (Microsoft, Yahoo, eBay, innumerable record labels and newspaper groups). Or you could see the decade in terms of broad trends. It was the decade in which what Ofcom calls \"online catch-up TV\" went from an exotic preoccupation of geeks with fast internet connections to a domestic proposition. The key driver was the spread of broadband connections. By the end of 2008, 95% of UK households with an internet connection had broadband with a speed of 2Mb or more. This made it possible to have an enjoyable experience with YouTube (launched in 2005) and the BBC iPlayer (launched at the end of 2007) and in the process changed the media landscape in unimaginable ways. We moved from an era when \"the computer was the PC\" to the world of \"cloud computing\" \u2013 where John Gage's famous declaration that \"the network is the computer\" finally became true. We started the decade using expensive software packages for word-processing, emailing and doing spreadsheet calculations, and finished it using free services provided on the internet. This shift was also visible in the corporate world as companies began to shift their IT operations into the \"cloud\" by renting virtual servers from Amazon and others. In doing so, we crossed a threshold into uncharted territory. For one thing, nobody really knows how secure cloud computing really is. And although it may be free (ie ad-supported), the vast server farms needed to make it possible have significant environmental downsides. Optimists will see the noughties as a period of liberation and creativity \u2013 when the stranglehold of editors and media proprietors was finally broken. Blogging services made it possible for anyone to be published. Anyone with the inclination to do so could edit an entry in Wikipedia. Flickr enabled any photographer to create a gallery of online images. YouTube gave aspiring cinematographers a way of screening their work. MP3 audio compression enabled garage bands to get their music to potential fans. Twitter and Wikileaks made it much more difficult for governments and corporations to keep their secrets from the great unwashed, as Trafigura discovered. On the other hand, pessimists will view the decade as the period when the utopianism of techno-libertarians was exposed for what it was: naivety on stilts. In 2000, the UK Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) set the tone by illustrating the power of the established order to curb online freedoms. While it remained true that you could protect your documents with unbreakable encryption, Ripa enabled the home secretary to threaten you with two years in gaol if you declined to provide his officials with the key: suddenly the liberation provided by technology began to look less convincing. And while John Gilmore's dictum that \"the internet sees censorship as damage and routes around it\" remained broadly true, China demonstrated that if you throw enough people, resources \u2013 and western technology \u2013 at the problem, you can effectively erect a great firewall around 1.3 billion people. Even the technophobic Iranian regime found it relatively easy to throttle a flood of inconvenient truths after its grisly presidential \"election\". What all this suggests is that the noughties were the years when the internet went from being exotic to mainstream \u2013 indeed, to being a utility. No child under the age of 11 knows there was once a world without Google. Most teenagers cannot imagine a world without Facebook or YouTube. And even the proportion of adults who can remember travel agents is declining fast. Almost without noticing, we have become dependent on the network. Our task in the next decade will be to make sure it remains free and open, rather than the captive of the corporations and governments who would love to control it. Happy New Year!",
