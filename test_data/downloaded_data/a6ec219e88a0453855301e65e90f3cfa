  "content": "The fact Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas permitted the publication of one set of wedding photographs did not mean they consented to any photos of the event being published, it was argued at the high court today. Michael Tugendhat QC, representing the Hollywood couple, told Mr Justice Lindsay the stars gave their \"qualified consent\" to pictures of the ceremony appearing in OK!. The pair are suing rival celebrity magazine Hello! over the publication of unauthorised pictures of their November 2000 wedding at the New York Plaza hotel. \"Photographs can be very humiliating things indeed,\" said Mr Tugendhat. \"We all have the right to decide to whom we are going to expose ourselves and how much information we're prepared to give. \"Privacy is not an absolute right - but it can't be all or nothing.\" Mr Tugendhat told the court the unauthorised photographs shot by young British paparazzo Rupert Thorpe were \"taken from the hip\". One of the official photographers at the wedding caught Mr Thorpe - the son of former Liberal MP Jeremy Thorpe - taking a picture of Zeta Jones from waist level. \"If a bride was asked if she would agree to a series of pictures taken from the hip you can imagine what answer she would give,\" Mr Tugendhat said. OK! took a \"huge commercial risk\" because the magazine did not know what pictures of the wedding it would receive, Mr Tugendhat added. In a \u00a31m deal Douglas and Zeta Jones hired their own official photographers at the wedding then selected the pictures to appear in OK!. Part of the agreement between the couple and OK! was that some of the wedding pictures would be retouched, said Mr Tugendhat. The case continues.",
