  "content": "Amid the Twitter torrent on Wednesday morning following Jeremy Clarkson's suspension, Monkey couldn't help noticing an unusual tweet from BBC presenter Libby Purves. Which particular bovine creature could Purves be referring to, Monkey wondered? Her tweet was in no way related to her absence from Midweek that morning, though. The Beeb says that although Purves was billed, Mariella Frostrup was always due to front the show and it was trailed last week. So that's all good.",
