Apple has been named number one in the annual Brandz global brand power list, with a 67% increase in estimated value to $247bn (\u00a3161bn), while Facebook proved to be the biggest mover among the top 100 doubling its brand value to more than $70bn. Apple's brand value growth surge saw it topple Google which fell to second place in the list, with a modest 9% boost to $173.6bn. Amanda Phillips, UK head of marketing at Millward Brown which publishes the report, said that it was Apple's latest upgrade to its globally popular iPhone that boosted the brand in the 2015 report. \"Though the Apple Watch has proved extremely popular it is the success of the iPhone 6 that has been the main driver of Apple's brand value growth,\" she said. \"The key to success for winning brands is to define themselves through innovation, differentiation and purpose, as in the case of Apple.\" The biggest mover in terms of growth was Facebook which saw a 99% increase in brand value from $35.7bn to $71bn. Facebook's jump from 21st to 12th place on the list was fuelled by its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp and the huge success it has seen in attracting advertising spend globally.
