The row over the posting of Viacom programmes on Google's YouTube video service without permission sparked a wide debate over the limits of federal laws aimed at copyright theft versus the rights of people to find and share entertainment online. \"This settlement reflects the growing collaborative dialogue between our two companies on important opportunities, and we look forward to working more closely together,\" the companies said in a joint statement. Neither side disclosed terms but no money changed hands, according to one executive close to the matter. Viacom, home to MTV, South Park and Stephen Colbert, first filed a $1bn lawsuit against YouTube and others in 2007 claiming the Google unit had allowed the illegal broadcast of 79,000 copyrighted videos on its website. The hard fought case attracted the support of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the National Football League, the Screen Actors Guild, Garth Brook and Sting for Viacom; Google was backed by eBay, Facebook, Human Rights Watch and others. Both sides saw victories overturned on appeals during the case. In 2010 judge Louis Stanton ruled that YouTube did not have a case to answer because it was protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and had removed videos when notified. In 2012 the appeals court ruled that YouTube executives should answer charges that they knew users were posting Viacom's copyrighted material. Last year Stanton handed Google a victory rejecting Viacom's damages claims over YouTube's alleged posting of clips from SpongeBob SquarePants, MTV's 16 and Pregnant and other Viacom's programmes. Viacom had been appealing that decision. The deal comes as Google has been striking content deals with major media companies as it grows Google Play, its rival to Apple's iTunes. The settlement comes after much of the company's issues with YouTube have been resolved and should make it far easier for the two companies to do deals in the future \u2013 a development that is especially advantageous given the similarity between Viacom and YouTube's audiences. But media companies still had major issues with Google and other tech firms. \"The industry is still not doing enough about search,\" said one media executive who has been following the case. \"Search for Indiana Jones download and the first results should be Amazon or iTunes but often as not they are for illegal sites, they could do a better job of that,\" he said. The settlement comes a week after Congress started looking at the DMCA once more. First implemented in 1998, the act is now seen as being hopelessly out of date by many, especially in the technology community. But attempts to reform it have been stifled in Congress by the MPAA and others. Media companies including Warner have been sued for allegedly abusing DMCA takedown notices to harm businesses they believe are sharing copyrighted material. Last week's hearing on the DMCA was the House judiciary committee's eighth as it considers a possible revision that's been dubbed \"The Next Great Copyright Act.\"",
