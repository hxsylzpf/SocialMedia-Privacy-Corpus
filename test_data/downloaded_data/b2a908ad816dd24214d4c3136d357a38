The Nine Inch Nails frontman beat Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman (127 Hours) and Hans Zimmer (Inception) to take home the prize alongside fellow musician and producer Atticus Ross. Forty-five-year-old Reznor is a prolific user of Twitter and champion of the internet, giving away much of his recent music for free online. The Social Network was also awarded best motion picture, best screenplay and best director for David Fincher. In an interview with Mashable.com last year, Reznor explained his initial reaction to the idea of a movie about Facebook was one of reticence. \"I got a call from David Fincher, who's one of my favourite directors, saying 'Would you like to score this film?' (I said) 'Yes! What is it?' 'It's about social networks. It's about the founding of Facebook.' (I said) 'Hmm\u2026 really? How can that be interesting?'\" \"When I actually read the script I knew this wasn't going to be what I feared it could be in lesser hands,\" Reznor said. \"It's not about Facebook, so much. It's about people and greed and creation and entitlement.\" It was recently announced that Reznor will score the Hollywood adaptation of Swedish thriller The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Last night, Reznor tweeted two words to respond to his win: \"Holy shit.\"",
