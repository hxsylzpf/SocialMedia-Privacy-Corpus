  "content": "Nick Clegg today makes a pitch to younger voters by making an announcement on a new youth training policy via Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The Liberal Democrat leader's aides say he has the maximum number of friends possible on Facebook \u2011 5,000 \u2011 and is followed on Twitter by 6,800. He said: \"Many young people feel cheated by this recession and let down by politicians. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter play just as important a role as TV or newspapers in their lives. Politicians can't ignore new and social media if they want to connect with the next generation of voters.\" Eschewing the typical podium and press conference setup favoured by politicians, Clegg will instead send out his policy via the three social networks, hoping to snare the votes of the growing numbers of attract people who have struggled to find work in the economic downturn. Some figures put this as high as 900,000. He will launch a 90-day promise that would see young people claiming jobseeker's allowance for more than three months helped into training, a job or an internship. If they did not have any luck with these three, they would be fast-tracked on to a welfare-to-work programme, the flexible new deal. The Lib Dems contrast this with the government's current commitment to refer a young person to training after 12 months. Clegg's announcement today is his first overture to young voters after he included a scaling back of his party's pledge to scrap tuition fees among \u00a318bn worth of spending commitments that he jettisoned last week.",
