The author and Oxford Internet Institute professor told an audience of Wikipedia experts and volunteers that \"less than 1% of the world's data is still analogue,\" but that there is still \"a trade-off between the quality and quantity of data points\". He asked is we should aim to collect more data, or try to prioritise gathering higher quality data. Charting the evolution of small data, which shaped how we made sense of the world around us, he believes that collecting data could be cheap, as well as the cost of analysing it. \"Small data \u2013 like Newton's law of gravity \u2013 gave us shortcuts. Einstein took it one step further and captured relativity.\" Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger said we need to \"embrace the messiness\" of data. \"One example of this is Google Translate, which came to being from previous failed experiments with machine translation from the 50s onwards. \"Nothing happened until the end of the 1980s, when IBM's brilliant engineers had the idea of improving algorithms of languages. It was only Google, 10 years later, who saw that what was missing was data. They fed the entire world wide web into the project, and it didn't matter if the correlations were messy.\" 'The value of data lies in reusing it' The same goes for everyday, more human examples. Doctors in Toronto used a big data approach to save the lives of premature babies; establishing their vital signs helped them to predict if they were vulnerable to infections. \"The data was messy, the findings were correlations. But it helped the doctors to find the first steps, which meant ensuring medications were delivered, and thus lives being saved. In this way, big data gives us a new perspective on reality.\" Ultimately, Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger argues, the value of data lies in reusing it. In Britain, he pointed to the example of the NHS, which uses data to analyse different prescription cultures across the country, and can extrapolate new ways to save money. For Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, society does not lack expertise and tools, because more people are choosing a career with data at the forefront. But data is missing, and access to data needs improving. Why we must remember to delete \u2013 and forget \u2013 in the digital age",
