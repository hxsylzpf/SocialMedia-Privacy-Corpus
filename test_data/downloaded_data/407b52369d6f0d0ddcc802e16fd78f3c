But Google's executive chairman, speaking at an exclusive event at the Guardian, also deepened the mystery over how and what data Google will use and swap with Nest, which it is buying for $3.2bn. Nest currently makes a thermostat and a smoke/carbon monoxide alarm, both of which collect user behaviour data to produce a more tailored response. That data isn't shared outside Nest. Asked on Tuesday by The Guardian why Google had moved into hardware with the purchase of Nest, Schmidt replied: \"We actually are already in the hardware business, in the sense that we have a [phone handset] business called Motorola - that's doing well with a lot of interesting phones - and we have a whole Nexus product line [of smartphones and tablets]. \"The Nest is a natural evolution of those kinds of devices, and I think you should imagine that the Google technology applied to the things that Nest do will be infinitely more intelligent, and infinitely more useable. We're making an important bet and I'm very excited about it.\" Google completed its $12.4bn acquisition of Motorola in July 2012; since then the business has made cumulative losses of $1.6bn. The takeover of Nest has sparked questions about data use and privacy, and the extent to which a Google-owned Nest would pass user data to Google, and how that might be used. That follows Google's implementation of changes to its privacy policy in spring 2012 and in January to its Google+ social system which forced users to opt out, or abandon the system altogether. Some owners have expressed concerns about privacy and how data would be used, given Google's current business model which focusses on targeted advertising. At the takeover, Nest said in a statement that \"Our privacy policy clearly limits the use of customer information to providing and improving Nest's products and services. We've always taken privacy seriously and this will not change.\" Tony Fadell, the former Apple staffer who founded Nest, said at the DLD conference in Munich earlier this week that \"If there were ever any changes whatsoever [to the privacy policy], we would be sure to be transparent about it, number one, and number two for you to opt-in to it.\"",
