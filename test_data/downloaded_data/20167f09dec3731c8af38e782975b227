  "content": "Even if there wasn't a recession this year, 2009 was always going to be a crunch year for B2B and consumer magazine publishers, given the pull of online media and social networking on their readers. So how have they fared? Awkwardly, publishers' balance sheets show us\u2026 NatMags: The Hearst-owned Esquire publisher made a pre-tax loss of \u00a342.8m in 2008 \u2013 compared with a \u00a310.8m profit in 2007, according to newly filed documents at Companies House (via FT.com). The loss is incurred due to a \u00a355.7m impairment charge, \u00a351.7m of which was written off as goodwill. Revenue down 3.5% at \u00a3344m. NatMags' total circulation grew 26.6% due to its acquisition of the remaining half of Australian publisher ACP. Haymarket: The privately held Media Week and Management Today owner saw its pre-tax profits fall from \u00a38m in 2007 to \u00a34.5m in 2008, despite a revenue rise of 8.9% to \u00a3269m. The company spent \u00a37.2m on restructuring costs and paid a hefty \u00a31.4m to close down Eve magazine. Haymarket laid off 50 jobs last November. Most consumer and business publishers have unsurprisingly lost profits and revenue in past two years, against a backdrop of falling readership: the ABC figures for the first half of 2009 show that readership declined 21.5% \u2013 a loss of 17.4m copies \u2013 compared with the equivalent period a year earlier. But what's the solution? Cond\u00e9 Nast International chairman Jonathan Newhouse told publishers at the Fipp magazine congress this year that, \"if you love your readers, they will love you\" \u2013 or, if you make your print brands better, the revenue will come. But that's not strictly true: both readers and advertisers are becoming too promiscuous to have their attention held by monthly or weekly titles \u2013 and business subscribers are struggling to justify discretionary spend on media. Still scared of cannibalising expensive print operations by publishing content online, magazine companies either need to publish online and find a way to charge for it, or become genuine multimedia online producers. If not, they may find someone else has beaten them to it. And here's how other magazine publishers are surviving the recession so far: Reed Business Information: Profits fell 47% in H109 to \u00a339m. UBM: In the first half of 2009, UBM's profits fell by more than a quarter year on year to \u00a348m. Centaur: First-half profits fell by 88% year on year to \u00a31.7m. Euromoney: The DMGT-owned publisher has said it will meet its 2008/09 profit target of \u00a357m for the year to 30 September. Future: For its H109, announced in May, Future saw its profits fall 70% to \u00a31.2m. Economist Group: For the year to March 31, operating profits were 26% higher year on year at \u00a356m.",
