  "content": "MySpace's redesign has been a very long time in the making. The company's response to the Facebook explosion - and subsequent nosedive in its own traffic - appeared to be to go into lockdown, some kind of paralysing crisis. Several high-profile executives left, including chief executive Owen Van Natta and co-creator Chris DeWolfe, while it chose to take a very old world approach to updating its embarrassingly dated design by saving up all its ideas for one massive revamp. The more agile approach would have been to keep attacking smaller problems and improving the site incrementally - but then again, there was so much to rethink that maybe a blank slate was less intimidating. Either way, MySpace gave itself a massive challenge by taking so long to overhaul a site with such a serious competition. comScore puts international users at 90 million in September 2010 - down 18% from 110m a year before. In the UK, the drop in user numbers has been even more dramatic, falling 35% year on year to 2.738 million users from 4.242m. Users have also been spending less time on the site; average minutes per user fell from 23 to 12.7 in the UK, down 44.7%. And comScore's data on the exposure of advertising on social networking sites also looks pretty bad for MySpace; it has 5.6% reach compared to Facebook's 71.6%. So that's the state of the MySpace union. Now - what have they come up with to turn all this around? Unsurprisingly, they've dumped a lot of old features, including the logo and 'a place for friends' strapline. The main focus of the new site is music, as you might expect, and it's all about personalisation. It's everything you would expect in a music focused site, down to the rounded corners of the graphics (which, in their blockiness, are reminiscent of the Metro look). \u2022 Design: Generally cleaned up, tabs moved to the page top and news feeds of activity. \u2022 Sharing: Recommendation and sharing features for music, TV and games content with your friends. \u2022 Customisation: Musicians have new tools to design their pages, accounts can synchronise with Facebook and Twitter and there are loyalty badges for users. \"It's music first,\" Rebekah Horne, MySpace managing director for international, told us - explaining that the redesign took place over 12 months. Rather than trying to compete with Facebook, this new look is about shifting away. \"This heralds a new direction. Particularly for the music scene in the UK, this connects the socialisation of content, through the tools of the site, with people using the site across music, TV, gaming, celebrity gossip - it adds that social layer.\" I asked if that means describing music, TV and games content as the foundation of the site, and putting a social layer over that; Facebook, arguably, is the reverse. Horne didn't seem to want to commit to that. \"We provide a platform for both,\" she said. \"Content creators can build an audience, and there's a better tool set for interacting with and connecting to other fans.\" Isn't it unusual to 'hard launch' a site these days? \"It's not a hard launch. It's a suite of new products supporting our new strategic focus, but new products will be rolled out incrementally. MySpace has changed from a pure social net, a user-to-user community, to be more around the content... people can connect based on their shared interests.\" Horne admitted the cleaner site was informed by user research that the site \"had too many ads, was too cluttered\", and that simplifying the process for adding a friend, for example, had reduced the number of ads. The MySpace generation? Anyone with a lingering nostalgia for the days of pasting in ropey MySpace skins will be delighted to hear you can still do all that with the new design, Horne assured me. What the site has done is add more intuitive customisation tools for less HTML-happy users. (Hey - they were ugly, but had a certain popular charm about them.) Developers are already being given an API for the games section of the site; current apps include Pledge, which lets indie bands raise money from fans, Romeo, a mood-based music player, and Hunted Real Time Radio, which plays the most popular MySpace artists of the last 60 seconds. The UK will get the new MySpace look in mid-November, with updated Android and iPhone apps also due soon. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube integration is already built in, but there's more of that coming. MySpace wants to \"enable openess\", it says, so expect syncing, apping and integration. For News Corporation, this revamp could be about pushing MySpace one last time, putting some serious money into the new look and an updated, more focused strategy that will help it compete. Or - and this is more likely - this new look is about dressing MySpace up for a sale. Isn't it a shame MTV didn't buy MySpace back in the day? \"Possibly,\" says Horne. \"But we have a stronger proposition in music now than MTV, and a good stake to the claim that MySpace can really start to define a generation in the same way MTV once did.\"",
