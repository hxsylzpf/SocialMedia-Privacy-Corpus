  "content": "The last chance saloon in which the press has been drinking for the last two decades appears to have closed for renovation, and will open sooner or later as a gastropub with scrubbed pine tables, guest ales, and dishes such as tandoori pollock in a raspberry and passion fruit coulis with pecan crisps. But the opening has been delayed again, as the culture secretary, Maria Miller, told the House on Tuesday. The privy council will take another look at things in a few weeks. \"I hope,\" she said, \"that the ceiling is in place then.\" I hadn't realised that even the pub's wretched ceiling is not up yet! (Hang on; a colleague tells me that she meant the \"sealing\", which apparently is what you do to a royal charter. Sorry.) But Ms Miller does like a nice postponement. She ought to have a job at an airport, where her voice, like a very cautious head girl, would be well deployed. \"Ryanair is delighted to announce a further delay in the departure of its flight to Alicante, due to a wobbly tray table in row 23, but better safe than sorry, as Mr O'Leary says. In the meantime, you have the perfect chance to make sure all your travel documents are in order, insurance up to date \u2026\" No wonder some MPs were close to tearing their hair out. \"It may all take some time,\" she told the Commons, only a year after the Leveson report was published. Some blamed the press, including Sir Gerald Kaufman, who said he preferred an \"irresponsible, indeed a pernicious press, to a state-regulated press.\" But even he thought that the papers' procrastination had gone on too long. Chris Bryant almost screamed at the minister. \"It's like Groundhog Day!\" he yelled. \"I don't know if you've run out of sealing wax \u2026 If you default on the timetable, the House should take things into their own hands!\" What did that mean? Occupying the front bench? Setting up a commitee of public safety to arrest the cabinet? He did not explain, but he was jolly cross. But many Tories were on the side of the papers. Conor Burns was furious that the draft royal charter had been drawn up in Ed Miliband's office, in the middle of the night, with the pressure group Hacked Off present but not the press \u2013 and the participants fed on pizza! That seemed to trouble him most, as if the charter's parchment might get besmirched with pepperoni and a smudge of tomato mistaken for the royal seal. Labour MPs piled in. Dennis Skinner was looking forward to the Daily Mail's Paul Dacre following the News of the World and Andy Coulson into oblivion. Paul Farrelly contrasted the government's \"kowtowing\" to the media barons with Ed Miliband's assault on the \"malign\" Mail. Paul Flynn declared that \"self-regulation almost certainly means NO regulation!\" Jacob Rees-Mogg, who as a baby wore Barbour rompers, spoke up for the industry.But it was Labour's Sheila Gilmore who implied that Ms Miller had let down all of womankind. \"We are supposed to be good at multi-tasking, but she needs even more time!\" As she always does.",
