  "content": "The Sun has launched its much-anticipated social networking venture, My Sun, which allows readers to post content on its Sun Online website. \"We want to make the Sun readers the next editors of Sun Online,\" the Sun Online editor, Pete Picton, said. Readers will be able to post pictures and profiles, review films and football matches, comment on breaking news, and interact with other readers using community webchats and blogs. \"We have not been able to offer them a community on the site before,\" said Mr Picton. The Sun has had a limited webchat facility on its Sun Bingo site that allows players to chat while they play. My Sun has some similarities to News Corporation's social networking site, MySpace, which was bought for $580m in July 2005. However, the Sun's website is not linked up with MySpace. Readers who register on the site can create their own blogs and profiles, and get Sun content that interests them emailed to their profile page. \"The Sun has always been about its readers, and now we want YOU to write for the Sun online,\" the website says. \"Our new My Sun service allows you to publish your rants, reviews and pictures on the site - for our world of readers to see! \"You are the new editors of the Sun.\" Sun Online relaunched in September with more video content, including a video version of agony aunt Deidre Saunders' photo casebook. Earlier this year, Sun Online hired Danny Dagan from Wanadoo, now known as Orange Broadband, to be its communities editor and to supervise My Sun. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
