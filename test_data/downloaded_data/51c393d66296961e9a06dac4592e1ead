  "content": "The Mail on Sunday has won an important stage in its battle to name the health authority at the centre of a case involving an HIV-positive health worker. A judge at the high court in London accepted the newspaper's arguments that it was in the public interest for the authority to be named. He rejected the health worker's claim his rights under the Human Rights Act would be infringed. The judge also rejected the health authority's argument that it would be besieged with calls from concerned patients if it were identified. But the paper cannot yet name the health authority, or the profession of the health worker involved, until an appeal has been heard. That could take several months. Lawyers at Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, the London law firm that is acting for the paper, are preparing an application to speed up the process. Peter Wright, the editor of the Mail on Sunday, argues the health worker's patients have a right to know whether they have been exposed to HIV, even though the chance of infection is remote. \"If you are a healthcare worker, and you contract a disease that can be transmitted through your work, then surely it's in the interests of your patients to disclose that?\" Wright told Media Guardian last month. \"Surely the patients' health is more important than the individual's desire - however understandable - for privacy? Any reasonable person would think that.\"",
