James Jeffery, 27, stole around 10,000 database records containing the personal details of women who had registered with the British Pregnancy Advisory Service's site, before boasting of his crime on Twitter. Westminster magistrates court in London heard that the \"able\" hacker had also identified \"vulnerabilities\" on a series of websites for major international organisations, including the FBI, CIA and the houses of parliament. Jeffery, of Wednesbury in the West Midlands, showed no emotion as he admitted two offences under the Computer Misuse Act. The court heard he intended to \"release all the details\" of those registered on the BPAS site. He used Twitter under the name Pablo Escobar, after the notorious Colombian drug lord, to prove he had accessed hundreds of user names and email addresses by printing the name and log-on details of a BPAS administrator. He also managed to deface the website with the Anonymous logo and a statement. Jeffery was arrested by officers from the Metropolitan police's central e-crime unit during the early hours of Friday, after the company contacted police to say it had been targeted. The BPAS believes its computer servers and website were targeted on 26,000 separate occasions over a six-hour period. It took out a court injunction over fears that details of people who requested information had been compromised. The court heard how Jeffery eventually decided against publishing the details in his possession because he thought doing so would be \"wrong\". Deputy senior district judge Daphne Wickham adjourned the case because she did not have \"sufficient\" powers to pass sentence. Describing the defendant as a \"zealot with an anti-abortion campaign,\" she refused an application for bail, adding: \"Many, many other organisations and people's private details would be at risk. You clearly are an able hacker.\" Jeffery will be sentenced at Southwark crown court at a later date. In a statement on Friday, the BPAS said that while the identity of women receiving treatment was \"never in danger\", it took the incident \"very seriously indeed\". The service, which provides terminations privately and on the NHS, is the UK's largest abortion provider. It counsels on unplanned pregnancy and abortion treatment and gives advice about contraception, sexual infection and sterilisation.",
