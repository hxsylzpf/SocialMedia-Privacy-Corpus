The Hollywood stars are pursuing a multimillion pound damages action against celebrity magazine Hello!, which published unauthorised pictures of their \u00a31.2m wedding at New York's Plaza Hotel in November 2000. OK! had signed a \u00a31m deal with the stars for an exclusive picture deal, but were beaten to the newsstands by its rival Hello!, which used pictures taken by a paparazzo gatecrasher at the wedding. On the second day of the trial, in which the stars and OK! are fighting for damages of \u00a32.25m, Michael Tugendhat QC, representing the Douglases, outlined the defence case to the judge, Mr Justice Lindsay. The stars are seeking \u00a3500,000 from Hello! for loss of income and damage to their professional careers because of the poor quality of the photos. OK! is also seeking damages of around \u00a31.75m. Mr Tugendhat, quoting from earlier defences submitted by Hello! to the court, said the defendants claimed the couple had chosen to exploit their wedding for commercial gain and for publicity to further their careers. The barrister said Hello! lawyers had also claimed that a wedding attended by 350 guests could never be described as private. \"The notion that you can't have a private event because 350 people are present is so bizarre that I have difficulty in addressing it,\" he said. The couple claim that cameras were banned from their wedding and guests were asked to surrender them on entering the hotel. Anyone found photographing the event was asked to give up their camera, said Mr Tugendhat. Hello! claims the couple did no more than express a preference that cameras should not be brought to the ceremony. The magazine claims that any security at the hotel was not to protect the Douglases' privacy but their exclusive deal with OK!. Any attempt to bind guests or those providing services at the wedding to a confidentiality undertaking was meaningless, says Hello!. The case continues.",
