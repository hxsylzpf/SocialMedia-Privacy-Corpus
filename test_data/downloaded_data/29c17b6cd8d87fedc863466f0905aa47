Twitter made a pre-tax profit of \u00a33.2m last year, almost double the \u00a31.7m reported in 2013, according to the latest financial records at Companies House. The company, which paid no corporation tax thanks to past tax credits, also more than doubled revenues from \u00a324m to \u00a358m year-on-year. Twitter's UK staff benefited from a \u00a314m shares windfall \u2013 up from \u00a37.1m in 2013 \u2013 as employee numbers ballooned to 126. The company employed 73 staff in 2013. Staff costs jumped from \u00a37.4m to \u00a312.5m. Twitter launched a UK office in 2011 but the share awards date back to 2007 because of commitments relating to when Tweetdeck \u2013 the UK company it acquired four years ago \u2013 was founded. The UK company's parent is based in Ireland where it is thought a significant amount of revenue generated is legally diverted and not declared at Companies House. The OECD has outlined plans to force companies to report all their financial activities on a country-by-country basis to avoid offshore tax avoidance. Twitter UK declined to comment. On Monday, Twitter confirmed co-founder Jack Dorsey as permanent chief executive replacing Dick Costolo.",
