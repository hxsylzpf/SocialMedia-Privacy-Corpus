In a Westminster Hall debate on Wednesday, shadow culture minister Helen Goodman said social media firms were placing an extra burden on the UK public purse through the workload of teachers, police and social workers dealing with threats and harassment on social networks. \"These firms are putting a new and costly burden on the public purse but they are not acting as responsible corporate citizens,\" Goodman said. \"The government can't stand back and ignore this. Ministers need to ensure that [tax authorities] use all the weapons at their disposal and if necessary legislate further to crack down on these avoidance devices.\" Goodman reiterated concerns over what she called artificial devices designed to depress profits, referring to the royalty that Google UK paid to its parent company for use of its search and advertising technology. She cited Facebook's UK advertising sales of \u00a3175m in 2011 and accounts showing it paid only \u00a3238,000 tax, while Twitter filed no UK accounts. Google paid \u00a36.09m UK tax on 2011 revenue of \u00a3395m. \"[Google's] strategy is to minimise our tax and make up for it with a bit of corporate social responsibility \u2013 but in the grand scheme of things it's titchy. Are we going to accept that?\" Goodman asked. \"We can carry on as we are, the industry can decide it is in its own interests to change its behaviour, or the government can set a coherent strategy that runs across departments.\" Google, Amazon and Starbucks have been called to a Commons public accounts committee hearing on Monday along with tax inspectors, where MPs will grill both sides on corporate business contributions, but Google said its UK managing director Matt Brittin could not attend on that date. A government spokesman said the hearing could be delayed. . Google said: \"We make a substantial contribution to the UK economy through local, payroll and corporate taxes. We also employ over 2,000 people, help hundreds of thousands of businesses to grow online and invest millions supporting new tech businesses in east London. We comply with all the tax rules in the UK,\" Google said.Facebook and Twitter declined to comment. Both companies are headquartered, for accounts purposes, in the Republic of Ireland, which is known for its generous corporation tax.",
