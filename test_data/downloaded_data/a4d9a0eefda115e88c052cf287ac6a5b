  "content": "The Tories' new policy position on surveillance is a development that, at least in principle, should be applauded but the party is naive if it believes that in government it could achieve such reforms without making some very difficult choices. The policy paper concentrates on the database issue. True, the rise of the database state has become a significant and celebrated danger, but the desire for databases has more to do with the dynamics of power than the creation of computer systems. In the absence of detail we can have no assurance that many of the commitments are legally possible, let alone politically sustainable. The Conservatives say: \"Wherever possible, personal data will be controlled by individual citizens, who have the power to decide which agencies can access or modify this information.\" Brilliant. Full marks, but how on earth will the party achieve this goal? The Data Protection Act and the European convention on human rights already establish limitations on how much information can be collected and processed. The essential problem is that the government continually guts these general protections by passing laws that conveniently carve out exemptions in the name of \"public interest\". In government the Tories would face the same temptation to yield to political expedience and pass \"one-off\" powers that would mandate the collection of information and require the compliance of individuals. Public interest is a justification that knows no boundaries, the same applies to the term \"national security\" under which innumerable and usually unnecessary powers have been created. It is a little-known fact that national security provisions were used to remove nearly all data protection rights for London congestion zone charging information. If the Tories genuinely want to rein in the surveillance state they will have to come to terms with such issues. We can look even deeper into the heart of the problem by observing the way parliament scrutinises legislation. Select committees, particularly those on human rights, home affairs and constitutional issues, are largely ignored. An amorphous commitment to a British bill of rights might constitute a gesture in the right direction, but if the current government cannot fulfil its basic obligations under the Human Rights Act, how can we trust that the next government will heed the provisions of a bill of rights? Today on this site the shadow justice secretary Dominic Grieve rightly lambasts the government's child protection vetting proposals and remarks that \"this latest encroachment of the surveillance state is symptomatic of a far deeper problem\". Indeed. But the deeper problem is far more systemic than the Tories would have us believe. With or without \"giant\" computer systems we are still at risk from politicians who support kneejerk laws that have no regard to fairness, legality or commonsense. Will the Tories support the creation of proper oversight of the security services? Will they guarantee that parliament's watchdogs, its committees, will be respected? On these matters the new policy paper is mute. None of this should detract from the more specific and credible commitments in the paper. Increased powers for the information commissioner, limitations on the growth of the national DNA database, a requirement for conducting privacy impact assessments on new IT projects and the appointment of senior-level security positions within departments are tangible proposals that will make a real difference. As for the rest, the jury is still out on whether any political party can resist the creation of a surveillance state that is fuelled not by technology, but by idiocy, paranoia and a lust for greater legislative powers.",
