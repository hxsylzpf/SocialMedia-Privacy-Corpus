  "content": "Stronger privacy rights for celebrities to stop the media publishing snatched photos of them in public places were laid down yesterday in a landmark judgment of the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. The ruling was won by Princess Caroline of Monaco over publication in German magazines, but it will also apply in Britain. The European convention on human rights has been incorporated into UK law, and judges are obliged to take account of the judgments of the Strasbourg court. The decision follows Princess Caroline's 10-year battle to stop German magazines publishing pictures of her going about her daily life. Under privacy laws in France, where she lives, the photos could not be used without her permission, but German laws are much less strict, although not as lax as Britain's. Germany's constitutional court ruled in December 1999 that the princess was a contemporary public figure who had to tolerate photos of herself in public places, rejecting her bid for an injunction stopping the publication of further photographs. But the Strasbourg court said this constituted a violation of article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to respect for private life. Damages, payable by the German government, will be decided later. The judges said: \"The court considers that the public does not have a legitimate interest in knowing where the applicant is and how she behaves generally in her private life even if she appears in places that cannot always be described as secluded and despite the fact that she is well known to the public.\" The 47-year-old daughter of Prince Rainier of Monaco became Caroline von Hannover after her marriage to Prince Ernst-August von Hannover. Media interest has also focused on her husband, who has been convicted of attacking a photographer. The ruling will force Britain's press complaints commission to reconsider the provision in its code which prevents the publication of pictures taken when subjects can claim \"a reasonable expectation of privacy\". When the newsreader Anna Ford complained to the PCC about long-lens photos of her and her then partner, former astronaut David Scott, sunbathing on a Majorcan beach in 2000, the complaint was rejected because the beach was public. The high court refused her application for a judicial review in 2001. Her solicitor, Stephen Grosz, said: \"What this case comes down to is that even public figures like Anna Ford have an expectation that they won't be harassed when they're going about their daily lives.\" The Strasbourg judges said: \"Photos appearing in the tabloid press are often taken in a climate of continual harassment which induces in the person concerned a very strong sense of intrusion into their private life or even of persecution.\" The court said in its judgment that German privacy law is more strict than in the UK, which has no right to sue for invasion of privacy. Since the European convention became part of UK law in 2000, courts have expanded the law on breach of confidence to give more protection to privacy, but the law is still developing. The German courts had ruled that photos taken with Princess Caroline's children should not be published, and nor should those with the actor Victor Lindon in a secluded part of a restaurant, because she had clearly intended to stay out of public view.",
