  "content": "In this age of social media, everyone has to be mindful of language \u2013 even those for whom it might not seem relevant. I live in New York and, as reported last week, every police precinct in the city now has its own Twitter account, with slow-typing cops groaning anonymously to the tabloids about the addition of yet another stupid task to their list. It is pretty stupid. The New York Post, which got hold of the NYPD guidelines for cops' Twitter usage, shared the alarming fact that police have been told their tweets shouldn't be boring and informational, but instead should use \"tasteful humor\" to swell their number of followers. The template for all this is the forward-looking police force of San Francisco, which has been tweeting hilariously for years and which the NYPD cites in the handbook as its social-media role model. Sample tweet from the SFPD: \"Officers just arrested a naked man in the bison paddock in GG [Golden Gate] Park. The bison seemed unimpressed.\" Thank you, I'll be here all week, have you tried the veal? It is, obviously, a disastrous idea, which makes one feel sorry for the cops and will almost certainly end in tears and a lawsuit, perhaps from the person in the Elmo suit arrested in Times Square this week for bothering tourists. The arresting officer snapped a photo of her, minus the head of her costume and with hands cuffed behind her back, and jovially posted it on the feed of the NYPD Midtown South. (You couldn't see her face, but still; how many Elmos with long brown hair wrapped in a bun can there realistically be?) Which is more frightening, I wonder; being arrested by an angry cop, or by a cop who is trying to be funny? Lost in translation In New York the language barrier between Brits and Americans is a constant source of low-grade amusement. Mostly it revolves around swearing. Things that sound rude to Americans sound less rude to Brits and vice versa, so I will, occasionally, see a headline in a US media outlet that triggers the word \"wanker\". (For Americans, the equivalent is something like \"douche bag\", which is ruder than Brits understand it to be. And of course in America, the C-word is never, ever cheeky; only dreadful. As an American friend said soberly to me the other day: \"Vagina words are difficult for us.\") Less well documented than the swearing are the differences in words used for regular things. Brits think of Americans as being the more literal-minded, but that isn't borne out in the language. After being tipped off by an American colleague, I discovered recently that if you want to make an American laugh, all you need to do is say the words \"washing-up liquid\" \u2013 in the US they call it \"dish soap\". I tried it out on an American friend, who squawked like a parrot and said, \"It's so typical of your country, the way none of you can get to the point. It's such a passive-aggressive way to say soap.\" Meanwhile, my American colleague asked, \"What do you call actual soap? A 'make your face clean bar'?\" And he collapsed into laughter. Pride before prejudice If cops in New York get mixed reviews, it's a different matter altogether for the US military. I was in downtown Manhattan last week when two young sailors in uniform emerged from the subway. A man walking by instantly called out \"Thank you for your service!\", to which the female sailor replied, equally automatically, \"Thank you for your support!\" Enthusiasm for the military in the US is fervent and unquestioning, and always surprising if you come from elsewhere. Like sincere use of the word \"God\", it is vaguely embarrassing to Europeans, whose pride in their armed forces is more muted. It's no bad thing to cheer the men and women who do jobs no one else in their right minds would do, but the gap between voicing gratitude and showing it by paying veterans decent benefits is an enduring outrage. I have no words that can be published, in either language, for that.",
