Two members of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) five-member board have come out for a delay ahead of a scheduled release of new rules on 15 May. Their move comes amid lobbying from some of the US's largest internet companies against the rules and a widespread and growing online protest. On the FCC's website, Democrat commissioner Mignon Clyburn wrote that \"during the past few weeks, tens of thousands of consumers, companies, entrepreneurs, investors, schools, educators, healthcare providers and others have reached out to ask me to keep the internet free and open\". Clyburn said she would prefer to prohibit pay-for-priority arrangements altogether and would like to see cable companies reclassified so the FCC would have greater regulatory powers over them. In a speech on Wednesday, fellow Democrat commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel also called for a delay following the \"torrent of public response\" to leaked proposals from the FCC that suggest it is considering enshrining cable firms' ability to create fast lanes for high-paying customers. The third Democrat on the five-person commission, chairman Tom Wheeler, has said the new rules will protect the \"open internet\". \"We need to respect that input and we need time for that input,\" said Rosenworcel. \"So while I recognise the urgency to move ahead and develop rules with dispatch, I think the greater urgency comes in giving the American public opportunity to speak right now, before we head down this road.\" Wheeler, a former top cable and wireless industry lobbyist, has called suggestions that the new rules will create a inaccessible fast lane \"flat-out wrong\". He has also said any deals would have to be \"commercially reasonable\". The FCC was forced to draw up new rules after Verizon successfully challenged its power to bar broadband providers from slowing or blocking selected web traffic. Since that January ruling, Comcast has struck a deal with Netflix that will give it access to a faster connection for its service. That deal came after Netflix had accused Comcast of \"throttling\" its service in order to promote its own video-on-demand offering. The agreement, the terms of which were not disclosed, has sparked fears among consumer groups and Democrats that cable firms will create fast lanes for high-paying, established players that will effectively stifle competition and create a tiered internet. Such a system would effectively end \"net neutrality\" \u2013 the concept that all traffic should be treated equally online. Craig Aaron, president of the lobby group Free Press, said pressure was mounting on the FCC as more people began to see what was at stake in the net neutrality debate. He said it was highly unusual for FCC commissioners to dissent so publicly. \"The cracks are showing,\" he said. \"It's very clear that the commissioners are feeling a lot of public pressure. The fact that both Wheeler's colleagues from his own party are raising serious doubts about his proposal definitely puts things in flux. \"That said, the chairman did put out a statement Wednesday night saying they were moving forward.\" Wheeler's statement came as some 150 of the world's top tech companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, weighed in, calling for the FCC to protect net neutrality. The tech firms' move comes as politicians including three Democratic senators \u2013 Ron Wyden, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker \u2013 have also called for the FCC to protect net neutrality. In a Facebook post, Wyden called net neutrality \"an essential principle to the protection of consumers online\". \"When Americans purchase access to the internet,\" he wrote, \"we purchase access to the entire internet, not just our providers' network. By dividing up the internet into fast and slow lanes \u2013 with the fast only accessible by sites who pay the premium, Verizon and Comcast are playing bait and switch with every American consumer.\" Internet and civil-rights groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, Free Press and Reddit have collected a million signatures calling on Wheeler to tighten rules protecting the open internet. On Wednesday, protesters from groups including Fight for the Future, Popular Resistance and others announced they would camp outside the FCC's offices in protest, ahead of planned 15 May meeting.",
