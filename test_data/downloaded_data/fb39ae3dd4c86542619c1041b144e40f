  "content": "Following Jurassic World's monster of an opening weekend, zookeepers have started a meme by recreating a scene starring Chris Pratt and his raptor squad. Tumblr noticed it first: And soon, other zookeepers were following up: Fittingly, the animals have taken their roles extra seriously - especially this veloci-otter on the right: Stand-ins for the velociraptors have included penguins, giraffes, selfie-happy quokkas \u2013 and even chickens. In one zoo, the tables were turned: And one keeper was brave enough to recreate the scene with three tigers: It wasn't long before Pratt himself picked up on the meme after it was covered by Nerdist - fingers crossed he pops to his local zoo for his own re-enactment. Check out the hashtags #JurassicZoo or #JurassicZooKeeper for more.",
