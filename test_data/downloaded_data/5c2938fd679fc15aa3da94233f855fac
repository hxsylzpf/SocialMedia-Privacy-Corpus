  "content": "It's on Twitter so it must be true. With the scorn that journalists often heap on the internet, you'd think that their normal professinal scepticism would kick. But sadly it didn't. The wire service AFP, the Daily Mirror, the Times, Sky, the Evening Standard, the Telegraph (even though it has taken the story down) and even we at the Guardian were duped into publishing a tribute to Michael Jackson on a Twitter account purportedly from MP and foreign secretary David Miliband. The touching message from the fake David read: Never has one soared so high and yet dived so low. RIP Michael It kind of brings a tear to your eye and humanises those heartless, money-sponging MPs. The only problem is that the account doesn't belong to David Miliband. Now, in the future, a tip to my fellow journalists, read some other updates. Does this update seem in character for Miliband? Thanks goodness the crop jellyfish was a hoax. An intern just informed me aliens are definitely in the FCO remit! It's nice to see the Foreign Office is ready to pick up the X-Files beat if duty calls. Speaking of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, it does have a Twitter account, and just in case there was any doubt whether Miliband was behind the Twitter tribute, it was quick to say no both on Twitter and its own blog: A while ago, one or two also picked up Tweets from \"David_Miliband\" commenting on Bob Dylan's gig at the O2 \u2013 which he didn't attend.  This is an apposite moment for us to point out (as some commentators suspect) that the foreign secretary does not have a Twitter account.  The FCO does, however, and you can find it here www.twitter.com/foreignoffice. Way to go Foreign Office, using this tragic loss to promote your own Twitter account! Fake celebrity and politician Twitter accounts are a bit of a sport. One of my personal favourite fakes is the account of chancellor Alistair Darling. Fake Alistair promises \"up to the minute updates on the green shoots of recovery\". His latest update reads: On average everything earned by every pleb from 1st Jan to 14th May was soaked up to pay for 'public services'. So enjoy! Of course, if you really want entertainment, head over to the \"Real\" Nick Griffin's account. Most journalists probably won't mistake this account for the genuine article from the head of the rightwing British National Party, especially because the bio for the account reads: \"Your democratically elected, indigenous, bonk-eyed representitive. I'm a danger to others and a national fucking disgrace.\" The latest policy statement from the \"Real\" Nick on Twitter reads: instead of banning burqas, why not ban the people *inside* the burqas? then the offending item of clothing would just crumple to the floor.",
