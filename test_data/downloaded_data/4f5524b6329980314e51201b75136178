  "content": "Jonathan Ross @wossy Much of what the chatshow host shares with his 434,000 followers is predictably about films and his TV guests, but his always upbeat thread also gives a sweet-natured insight into his home life: dodging his kids' difficult homework questions, waking up to find the dogs asleep on his head or wondering how to dress for their walkies (\"Ralph Lauren or Lady Gaga?\"). Armando Iannucci @alannucci The comedy genius behind The Thick of It has been busy posting trailers and teasers for the latest series of the political satire, as well as sharing his views with nearly 25,000 followers: he's \"incalculably depressed\" at the thought of a Cameron government, and thinks the \"gob-hammeringly insensitive\" Ben Bradshaw proves we are entering \"the Dawn of the UberTwat\". TTOI fans will be glad to know that the cast and writers of the show are big Twitterers. Junior adviser Ollie Reeder, aka @mrchrisaddison, is consistently funny (\"Ikea. Sunday. I am full of meatballs and loathing\"), as is \"swearing consultant\" @ianmartin. You can also follow @rebeccafront, who plays new minister Nicola Murray, and writers @jessearmstrong1 and @simonblackwell. Grace Dent @gracedent Fast, distinctive and merciless, the Guardian's World of Lather soap columnist is a prolific and hilarious tweeter. Her lucky 11,000 followers are treated to regular updates on everything from her latest TV passions (Sky1's Modern Family) to Danny Dyer, Spandau Ballet and chocolate biscuits, although it's her companionable commentary on weekend TV that is most indispensable (Strictly: \"feel like I've been sitting in my gran's bay window waiting for the mobile shop for the last hour\"; X Factor: \"'couldn't have tried any harder' - that's what you say to the vet before you agree to having your dog put down.\") Particularly funny when bickering with @caitlinmoran and @alexispetridis. Other X Factor greats: the brilliant @popjustice and, for specialist gambling tips, @victoriacoren. Graham Linehan @glinner The creator of Father Ted and The IT Crowd tweets frequently and entertainingly about anything that takes his interest, but he's one of the more thoughtful users of the site - he's as likely to share his views on Nick Griffin, Jan Moir and car-pooling with his 32,000 followers as he is to spread good-humoured gags. The results - such as when he set up the hashtag #welovethenhs to defend the British health service from Republican criticism - can be powerful and persuasive. Mathew Horne @mfhorne The comic-sketcher seems to have a busy moonlighting life as a DJ. Who knew? Cheerily and enthusiastically bonds with his 50,000+ followers by greeting them as \"Team\" or, er, \"jizz biscuits\".  Derren Brown @derrenbrown The tricksy mentalist mainly uses his feed to direct his 165,000 followers to quirky postings on his blog, but frequently pops up to talk about food, gadgets and apps, or to pose mind-bending questions. A thoughtful and playful presence. Sharon Horgan @realsharhorgan A newcomer to Twitter, the Pulling/Free Agents star has around 1,200 followers listening in to her bizarre dietary habits (\"For supper tonight i am having a glass of speciality vodka and a bag of Percy Pigs. Then i might go for run\") and pithy X Factor verdicts (\"That was shit\"). Sam Bain @sambaintv \"Had a dream last night that Mark from Peep Show was gay and married Super Hans. Series 7?\" The writer of the Bafta-winning comedy (nearly 2,500 followers) pops up occasionally with intriguing thoughts such as this. Also on the site are the two stars, @realdmitchell (111,500 followers) and @realrobertwebb (42,700 followers). Sue Perkins @sueperkins The Supersizer (over 8,000 followers) is a diffident poster but her infrequent comments are amusing and self-deprecating: \"A builder has just shouted 'Oi, Mel Sykes!' at me, proving that regular eye tests are no longer mandatory in the construction industry.\" All her food-related posts are as hapless as her experiments on the TV series: \"Attempting to make a courgette trumpet (with red pepper mute). So far I've managed to slice off my thumb. That, at least, created a sound.\" By contrast, her fellow presenter, the restaurant critic and \"sweary food-throwing man\" Giles Coren (@gilescoren, 7,000 followers), cleverly gives the impression of often pressing send before checking over his very funny posts: \"Hix rocked by the way. Loads of art people, sexy people, cocktails, grown up food, bar-billiards. Book now before people like me ruin it all.\" Simon Pegg @simonpegg The actor and comedian (over 76,000 followers) tweets about fatherhood, balding, his dog and his local fox population. Not much about TV but he helpfully brings up those questions that have been niggling in the back of all our minds: \"Did JT bring sexy back? He said he was going to. I mean, if anyone can he can. I just wondered if I should, in case he forgot. He's busy.\" Ben Miller @bennylicious The sketch-show star doesn't post that frequently (he recently mentioned shooting the Catherine Tate Christmas special, involving a skit on Christmas past with Nan as Scrooge), but like his comedy partner Alexander Armstrong (@xanneroo, 13,600 followers) he engages enthusiastically with his 15,000 followers and seems to genuinely like their feedback. Katy Brand @katyfbrand The TV impressionist told her 2,200 followers that she now approaches celebrity haunts where her targets might hang out \"with gleeful caution\". Her comments on what she's seen on the box remain interesting and direct. On those cash-for-jewellery ads: \"'I sent in my unwanted gold ring from my first marriage and got more money that I could ever have imagined'. This recession has no class.\" On Top Gear: \"Is it just me, or is Richard Hammond looking increasingly like Liza Minnelli?\"",
