  "content": "What's the trick to watching the Oscars without a) falling asleep, b) napping or c) resting your eyes for a bit? It's following the action, or often lack of, via Twitter. Sunday night's rather overlong telecast was made more tolerable by the many tweets that went alongside, from the good to the bad to the John Travolta. Here's our pick of the night: The cruelty of the red carpet, as seen through the sad tale of Naomi Watts's publicist. Reese Witherspoon was arguably the most popular pre-show interviewee thanks to her support of the #AskHerMore campaign, which was launched to give actresses something more to talk about on the red carpet than just what they are wearing. But then she followed it up with a tweet listing what she did wear... The arrivals also allowed for some wonderfully odd celebrity pairings \u2013 Aniston/Stone, Gaga/Knightley, and the first strange John Travolta moment of the night. The most popular celebrity tweet of the night came from Anna Kendrick who shared a picture backstage with Jack Black after they performed with host Neil Patrick Harris. Reaction to Neil Patrick Harris was mixed throughout the night but one thing a lot of Twitter agreed on? Less American Sniper jokes. Meryl Streep's reaction to Patricia Arquette's speech gave her one of the night's biggest gif highlights and also a new best friend in the shape of Jennifer Lopez... ...who will no doubt be using her for some acting lessons. Other movie star selfies of the night, included this one from the totally not attractive at all pairing of Idris Elba and Jessica Chastain: And another from Jennifer Lopez who was photobombed by Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux. Oyelowo's \"so-so\" reaction will live in gif infamy, here rather cruelly juxtaposed with a comment about Neil Patrick Harris's hosting skills. John Travolta creeping up on Benedict Cumberbatch was loved and feared by many. As was this terrifying moment when he returned to give \"Adele Dazeem\" a face stroke. After last year's incredibly awkward clap from Steve McQueen, Wes Anderson gave him a run for his money with his strangely unenthused applause, despite his own film winning an award directly before... Joan Rivers became the Bob Hoskins of this year's Oscars, in that she was royally snubbed from the \"in memoriam\" montage, much to the fury of Twitter. While there were many bigger names singing, it was the performance of Selma's stirring original song Glory by John Legend and Common that had the biggest impact, with Chris Pine and David Oyelowo in floods of tears. It rightfully won the Oscar directly after. Lady Gaga's Sound of Music tribute confused some of her fans because they had absolutely no idea what the hell \"Sound of Music\" even is. The speech that evoked the most emotions of the night came from Graham Moore, screenwriter of The Imitation Game, who talked about a suicide attempt at the age of 16. Sean Penn's intro to best director winner Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (\"Who gave this sonofabitch his green card?\") didn't go over too well with fans who found it just a little bit racist. The main takeout from Julianne Moore's best actress win? That damn Rosamund Pike clip which spoiled the big reveal in Gone Girl of course. And finally an ode to the parody accounts, based on JK Simmons's hat, Michael Keaton's gum and John Travolta's toupee, that will be lasting for approximately the length of Boyhood. The film that is, not the shoot.",
