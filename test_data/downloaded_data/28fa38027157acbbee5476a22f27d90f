Advertising to the predominantly young people who use Facebook has been hugely profitable for Diageo, which makes the drink of choice for most teenagers who can obtain it \u2013 Smirnoff vodka. Announcing the deal, Diageo said Smirnoff had become \"the number one beverage alcohol brand on Facebook worldwide\". Its brands in the US had enjoyed a 20% increase in sales \"as a result of Facebook activity\". The deal will, said Diageo, \"drive unprecedented levels of integration and joint business planning, and experimentation between the two companies\". Diageo said that more than 950 of its marketers had been trained in \"Facebook boot camps\" to build their social media capabilities and the company was recording \"significant returns on investment\" across a number of its brands. But health experts and alcohol campaigners say the impact will be felt in teenage drinking. Dr Nick Sheron, a liver specialist at Southampton hospital, is one of those who believes the attraction of Facebook is the youth of its users, with half under the age of 24 and many under the legal drinking age of 18. Facebook argues that pages set up by alcohol advertisers are \"age-gated\", and therefore only accessible to those who are over 18. But Sheron argues that many younger people do not disclose their true age on Facebook. \"The age verification process for social networking sites is clearly completely ineffective \u2013 even though users are supposed to be 13 or above, it has been suggested that one-quarter of UK children aged 8-12 have a Facebook or similar account,\" he said. \"Secondly, the majority of these accounts are hidden from parents, so Diageo effectively has a private narrowcast channel of communication with young people, which it will use to promote alcohol use as a positive lifestyle.\" There are also concerns about viral marketing through social media, as short film advertisements with an entertaining storyline designed to appeal to a young audience are circulated between friends through sites such as Facebook, bypassing any age controls on commercial pages. Fan clubs for drink brands are set up apparently by consumers, and teenagers post pictures of themselves and their friends getting drunk. Linda Bauld, professor of social management at Stirling University, said: \"I think the primary problem is that there are no legislative restrictions on alcohol marketing at the moment, but we know that the industry has carefully and consistently marketed the product to young people. Many children use Facebook sites. By doing a deal between a multinational corporation that produces alcohol and a networking site, you are essentially marketing alcohol to children. We know from our research that it is one of the most effective ways to get to children.\" Gerard Hastings, director of the Institute for Social Marketing and the Centre for Tobacco Control Research at Stirling University, who gave evidence to the health select committee on alcohol marketing to children, said: \"I think what unnerves me most is the insidious nature of social networking being used for marketing purposes. Facebook is supposed to be about genuine friendship and real relationships, not commerce. \"In a sense there is nothing new here \u2013 brands were established in the first place to give the inhuman corporation a faux-human face; relationship marketing, the key business development of recent decades, is all about gaining long-term commitment from customers. Malcolm Gladwell, among others, has described the use of flesh-and-blood brand ambassadors to win loyalty. The difference here is the scale and power of Facebook as both a research (Google algorithms are truly scary) and marketing tool.\" Facebook said it was very hard to control the age group who access any internet site, but insisted that it does all it can. \"At Facebook we have a clear policy \u2013 if you want to use the site, you should be at least 13 years old,\" said a spokesperson. \"We care a lot about people, young and old, and we know that the people who use Facebook will enjoy it more \u2013 and carry on enjoying it \u2013 if they learn more about using the internet in the safest possible way. We're keen to ensure Facebook is one of the safest places on the internet for users of all ages which is why we've already been working hard alongside industry experts such as Childnet to put in place features like our safety centre.\" \"It shouldn't be forgotten that making sure services are age-appropriate isn't an issue that is confined to Facebook \u2013 teens and young people use the wider internet every day, often accessing websites and online services that offer few or no safety tools. We feel that the best solution to using services in an age-appropriate way is for service providers like Facebook to carry on working with parents, safety experts and kids themselves to aid education and understanding.\" Diageo said it was working within the rules. \"Our collaboration with Facebook is subject to our internal global marketing code which mandates that we must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and industry codes, such as the codes for responsible marketing of the Portman Group, Ofcom and the ASA [Advertising Standards Authority],\" it said. \"We are 100% committed to responsible advertising and promotion of our brands and also believe that social marketing can play an important role in promoting responsible drinking through initiatives such as Nightlife Confessions in western Europe and Drinkaware's Why Let Good Times Go Bad. To ensure we only market our products to persons over the legal purchase age online, we currently leverage and continue to identify all available technologies to prevent underage interaction with our official digital marketing assets.\"",
