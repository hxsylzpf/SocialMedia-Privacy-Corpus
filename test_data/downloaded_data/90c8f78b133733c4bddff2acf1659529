  "content": "The BBC has had something of a Twitter push since late last month with all sorts of interesting people - editors and reporters included - signing up and trying it out. Richard Sambrook, director of global news at the BBC, mastered Twitter long ago but colleague Peter Horrocks made an embarrassing slip of the tweet yesterday. The head of the BBC's newsroom has just reorganised the multimedia division and recruited new section heads, and rather than confirming the new appointments in a direct, private message with Sambrook, Horrocks accidentally made them public. Doh! \"@sambrook Andrew Roy TV. Nathalie Malinarich online. Do you know her? bright. Go ahead. We should now push on with global editorial co-ord...\" We've all done it - slip an '@' in there instead of a 'd'. But in this case, the unsuccessful applicants hadn't yet been told, prompting him to tweet a follow-up apology. Worse still for Horrocks, the Sun picked up the error and dresses it up as a 'bungling BBC chief in tweet gaffe' story. Horrocks confirmed the appointments officially a few hours later, with Malinarich announced as executive editor of World Online and Roy head of news for BBC World News. He also told Journalism.co.uk that the mistake had \"had the perverse effect of making people who hadn't worried about it think 'oh god, if I'm going to get gossip from Peter then maybe it's worth signing up...\" There's a valuable lesson in here in a) double checking tweets before sending and b) not sending very important of confidential data via Twitter. Great as it is for conversation, you have to remember this is a free tool and you're reliant on their technology not to balls it up; there have already been cases of direct Twitter messages being accidentally made public. Keep all your discussion open, and if you can't - save it for offline.",
