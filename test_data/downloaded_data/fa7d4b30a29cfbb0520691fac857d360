  "content": "The Human League look set to have a top 10 single in the UK thanks to some unlikely help from Scottish football. Don't You Want Me may return to the top 10, more than 30 years since it became a hit for the synth-pop group. The track is a favourite among Aberdeen FC fans, and supporters started a social media campaign to boost its sales following the club's victory in the Scottish League Cup on 16 March. Sadly for supporters, although maybe not for music itself, the version charting will merely be the original, rather than a re-recorded version that incorporates the popular fan chant \"Peter Pawlett, baby\". The subject of the song remains a waitress working at a cocktail bar, rather than the talismanic midfielder who has scored six goals in his 93 appearances for the club. Richard Albiston, who founded the Facebook campaign, seemed happy to have any version making the charts: \"The page was set up as a bit of fun. I never expected it to take off as much as it has.\" Don't You Want Me is the UK's 24th biggest-selling single of all time. It is currently placed at No 12, but has been rising sharply. If it makes the top 10, it will be the band's first appearance there since Tell Me When peaked at No 6 in January 1995. It is currently climbing the iTunes top 10 singles chart.",
