  "content": "Dotcom fashion has left hordes of trends and hot names in its impatient wake but there is hope for those cast out of the digital mainstream: the gif is back. The gif format \u2013 a compressed image file that appears on computer screens as a two- or three-second video that is constantly repeated \u2013 was initially created in the 1980s, and is becoming the latest online phenomenon. The gif, which stands for graphics interchange format and was originally pronounced \"jif\", is behind a new wave of technology start-ups that are attracting tens of millions of dollars in funding from venture capitalists. Earlier this month, Riffsy, which has developed an alternative keyboard of gifs for smartphones, raised $10m (\u00a36.5m) in funding, just over a year after being created. The money will finance the launch of a version of its app for smartphones that use Google's Android operating system. The gif format was initially created in 1987 and used on loading screens, helping to demonstrate to a user that their computer was actually working. But gifs dropped out of fashion and were confined to use in internet chat forums as the increasing power of computers and the rise of broadband meant standard videos became easier to load. Now the rise of smartphones has given gifs a new lease of life. The brief animations are increasingly being used to express emotions instead of words, with users sending their friends clips from television shows or films, often with a caption attached, to demonstrate how they are feeling. For example, the gifs being promoted on Riffsy's home page include pop star Katy Perry winking, actor Brian Blessed getting very excited on an episode of Have I Got News For You, and Jennifer Aniston screaming \"No\" in a clips from TV show Friends. Riffsy has said that its gifs are viewed more than four billion times every month, while rival Giphy says it has more than 50 million unique users. Investors in the companies are betting that gifs will become a global craze in the same vein as emojis, which are symbols that smartphones can use in place of words. The use of gifs has been boosted by Apple opening up its iOS operating system so that developers can build alternative keyboards that make it easier to send the animations. Facebook also started supporting gifs in March, with Mark Zuckerberg showing them off at a developer conference. More than five million gifs are already being sent through Facebook's messaging app every day. Riffsy and Giphy are now looking to collaborate with film studios and television shows to use gifs to promote new releases. This would allow them to become an internet-age trailer that can be sent between friends and family. \"Gifs are a visual format \u2013 not only do people get a tease of the show but they use moments of the show to express emotions and interests in their conversations,\" David McIntosh, the founder of Riffsy, said in a recent interview with The Drum. \"On desktop, gifs have long been a novelty on forums and websites like Reddit and Tumblr. Now Riffsy is spurring a surge in gif usage by making it fast and easy to share gifs everywhere on mobile. The length of the gif is perfectly suited for short mobile attention spans, and gifs capture feelings and emotions by tapping into shared cultural moments and interests that are difficult to express by typing on a qwerty keyboard, particularly in a constrained mobile environment.\" McIntosh's comments highlight how far gifs have come since they were created by Steve Wilhite, a programmer at CompuServe, in the last 1980s. The launch of gifs sparked a row with rival technology group Unisys, which claimed it had patented the technique used to compress files for a gif in 1985. This eventually led to the creation of an alternative file format, portable network graphics (png), which is also still in use today.",
