For him, Twitter is like a wire service. He said: \"I travel a lot between our six offices and it helps me stay in touch, and lets me stay in touch, with what is happening. I follow a lot of people and in my job I have to know what the zeitgeist is. \"The world is split between Twitter haters and Twitter lovers and I am fascinated with Twitter haters. Lots of journalists love to write about Twitter haters. Since Ashton Kutcher got a million followers and it became famous, a lot of people hate it. But journalists particularly hate it, and maybe this is because Twitter may be a threat to journalism. So the best way to get a headline in a newspaper for a brand, is to get a study on how rubbish Twitter is. \"When I ask my clients: 'Are you in social media?' And the answer is: 'I don't have time'. Or they answer: 'Oh my God, I just got on Facebook and now I have to do Twitter?' Some journalists talk to me and say, 'I was on it for an hour and I don't get it. And I even wrote two tweets.' Well. \"One important question is, how to understand the change from a push model to a collaborative discussion. I find that clients struggle with that change. The good thing is, whatever is new and interesting gets a lot of attention. For a brand, last year it was the iPhone application, this year it is the Facebook page ... \"Twitter is used for a lot of different things \u2013 that is one of the interesting things about it. People are creating business opportunities, use it to communicate with friends, publish something or tell the people out there about a brand. This is why I don't understand Twitter haters. There is something really exiting about Twitter. This is going to be a platform that will lead to great ideas.\" Media140 London is a one-day conference which sets out to explore the impact of Twitter and real-time social media on agencies, marketers and brands. The conference in London is dedicated to brands, and the event will also travel to India, Italy and Australia.",
