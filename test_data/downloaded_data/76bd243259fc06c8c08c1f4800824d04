  "content": "Today at 9am, Antony Gormley's One and Other project begins on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, London. For the next 100 days, the artwork will involve members of the public stand on the plinth for an hour each, 24 hours a day. We're trying to document this project in its entirety - to photograph everyone on the plinth and record what they do in their allotted hour. It's a massive undertaking, so we need your help. We've set up a plinthwatch flickr group - please upload your pictures of the plinthers, tagged with when you photographed them. There's already a plinthwatch twitter feed, and we'll be retweeting the goings on there as people document the project. Then there's this space - please let us know below what you think of the project, and also get in touch if you're involved. The more information we have about this project, the better we can cover it. One and Other is a work of art which will be created by the general public. It would be brilliantly apt if our coverage of it could be made in a similar spirit of mass participation.",
