  "content": "Scottish ministers have been warned by the UK information commissioner that plans for a Scotland-wide ID database risks personal privacy and civil liberties, and had not been fully thought through. The Information Commissioner's Office said that proposals to put every Scottish citizen on a central database accessed by 120 public bodies, and give each person a unique number, risked breaching data protection laws and privacy standards. It warned bluntly that it opposed plans for the \"creeping use of such identifiers\" in case they became a national ID system by default \u2013 a key concern raised by civil rights campaigners, privacy groups and opposition parties at Holyrood. In a detailed letter to Scottish ministers, Ken Macdonald, the ICO's assistant commissioner, added: \"If we are to have a national identity number this should be the subject of proper debate and be accompanied by suitable safeguards. It should not just happen by default.\" It said ministers had failed to carry out the necessary privacy impact assessment before drafting proposals, and had failed to explicitly set out the reasons why the new national database was needed. It raised fears too about the decision by HMRC to use the database to build up the fullest possible list of all Scottish taxpayers to help trace everyone liable to pay a new Scottish rate of income tax. The ICO said that had to be subject to a \"rigorous\" privacy impact statement and inquiry, and that HMRC's use of the database be time-limited and heavily restricted. Any decision to press on with the project \"should be based upon due consideration of the public benefit in relation to the privacy risk to individuals and any subsequent sharing should be undertaken under strict procedures,\" Macdonald said. That should include \"strict control over the level of access such external agencies may or may not have to the data.\" Macdonald said that the ICO recognised there were clear grounds to introduce effective and accurate records in the public sector, including tracing children missing from school. There were numerous cases, including the death of Victoria Climbie in Haringey, where a lack of shared information contributed to their ill-treatment. But he warned that the Scottish government proposals \u2013 to include every person on a database with a single account which would merge an existing NHS registry, which now covers 30% of the Scottish population, with databases called a community health index postcode and a unique property reference number \u2013 carried risks that officials had not addressed. The new system would be effectively compulsory, and would move away from current consensual models without sufficient public interest justification. And its use to trace missing children had not been spelt out. Scottish ministers were also unwise to reject the much more privacy-friendly system for accessing public services now being considered by the Cabinet Office, where an independent third party body verifies someone's identity. Instead, the Scottish government wants a single central identity database known as \"Myaccount\", which public bodies would use to allow users to access services \u2013 a system similar to the UK ID card rejected on civil liberties grounds by the UK government in 2010. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said the ICO's warnings were a \"devastating blow\" to the database plans which needed full scrutiny by Holyrood and to be introduced under primary legislation. \"It would be nothing short of an insult to generations of civil liberties campaigners if we allowed ourselves to sleepwalk towards a national identity number.\" Jim Killock, executive director of the privacy campaign Open Rights Group, said: \"The ICO makes it clear that the NHS database should not be allowed to become a central ID register without public debate, and that this threat exists. \"They also make it clear that the 'myaccount' system may not be the most privacy-friendly design for a web log in system. The Scottish government would do well to heed this advice, and break from the legacy of intrusive IT systems designed ten years ago.\" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"The consultation has now closed \u2013 we are considering the responses carefully and will respond in due course. Identification of Scottish taxpayers and administering the tax are matters for the UK government and HMRC. \"The NHS central register has existed since the 1950s, and is already used by local authorities and health boards under strictly controlled arrangements, to ensure they are dealing with the right individual and to prevent mistakes being made. The Scottish government is opposed to the introduction of ID cards.\"",
