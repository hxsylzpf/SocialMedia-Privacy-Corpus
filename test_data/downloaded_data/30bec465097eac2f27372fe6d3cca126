Services like Twitter and LinkedIn offer the chance to come face to face with would-be employers, grabbing their attention in a way previously reserved to those willing to stand outside an office wearing a sandwich board. But with greater access comes greater chance to get things wrong. When this vicious rejection note to a a young jobseeker who tried to connect with a US marketing executive went viral, people were appalled. The sender, Kelly Blazek, now probably regrets the moment she pressed send. But if the incident is making young people think more carefully about how they use social media in a professional capacity, she has actually ended up doing young people a favour. Blazek has drawn attention to an unfortunate truth. Social media is a potentially dangerous tool for jobhunters who don't know how to use it. And a worrying number are getting it wrong. There's a horrible irony here because sites like Facebook and Twitter have been the bread and butter of twentysomethings' social lives for years. We're supposed to be the experts. But when it comes to using social media for professional networking, our knowledge and experience may be a hindrance. When my generation were teenagers, social media was our escape from the prying eyes of parents and teachers. It was a cyber extension of the playground pecking order \u2013 a place to impress, to embellish and experiment. It was a world based only partially in reality. You could find yourself in a three-hour conversation with someone on MSN and then completely ignore them at school. With careful picture/song selection for your MySpace page, you could become a mysterious emo overnight. And if you couldn't be bothered with conversation, \"poking\" people on Facebook was totally legit. Using social media in a professional capacity is a different ball game. But for some twentysomethings, the division is not clear cut. We first earned our online presence by being ballsy and brash, which could explain why some of us still think this is a good idea. But just because a lot of people \"knew you\" on MySpace, it doesn't mean you'll be good at using LinkedIn to show employers you're someone worth paying to do a job. We need to realise that our rules are out of date, and we must live up to employers' standards if we want to get on in the world of work. Its a tough lesson and some of us are learning the hard way. Speak to most professionals with a LinkedIn account and they'll tell you they've had \"odd\" or \"inappropriate\" messages from young people interested in jobs and internships. One of the most common complaints is young job seekers being too \"pally-pally\", and coming over as cocky. We need to address this because it perpetuates older generations' perception of us as an \"entitled generation\". Vivi Friedgut, financial educator for young people and director at BlackBullion, says the combination of social media and professional networking can be problematic for young people because they tend to be confident with the former but clueless about the latter. \"Far from being entitled, they are worried they will never get a job and that's why they are turning to social media. They are trying everything they can to get hired but a lot of the time they are accidentally giving off the wrong impression,\" she says. Friedgut warns jobseekers to avoid impersonal blanket emails, and keep the tone humble if they want to avoid leaving a sour taste in prospective employers' mouths. \"When you email someone, clearly explain who you are, and let the employer know what's in it for them. If you do that you'll have a better chance of getting a useful reply,\" she says. This phenomenon could be hurting the employment prospects of young people who \u2013 despite their communication faux pas \u2013 possess the skills and drive to become a valuable part of our workforce. It would only take some basic training to show them how to sell themselves better online. But the employers they are so desperately trying to reach don't have the time or the resources even to reply, let alone show them where they are going wrong. It would help if careers services at schools and universities did more to teach students how to use social media appropriately. Lousy pamphlets like this (pdf) are not enough \u2013 they lack practical guidance, and if students don't know they have a problem, they won't bother to dig them out and read them. Some forward-thinking universities have started teaching social media classes. London South Bank University has recently started offering them and the University of South Wales is also considering the option. I urge it and other colleges and universities to do the same. Social media can be a great way to get access to employers \u2013 but needs careful handling if you don't want the door slammed in your face.",
