  "content": "Woody Allen and Cate Blanchett have issued statements in response to the open letter posted by Allen's adopted daughter, Dylan, on a New York Times blog. The letter reiterates accusations of sexual abuse that were thrown out of court in 1993. On Sunday, Leslee Dart, publicist for Allen, 78, said in a statement: Mr Allen has read the article and found it untrue and disgraceful. He will be responding very soon. In the meantime, it is essential that your coverage make the following facts clear. At the time, a thorough investigation was conducted by court appointed independent experts. The experts concluded there was no credible evidence of molestation; that Dylan Farrow had an inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality; and that Dylan Farrow had likely been coached by her mother, Mia Farrow. No charges were ever filed. Cate Blanchett also responded to Dylan's accusation that the actor had acted thoughtlessly in working with Allen. Blanchett wrote: It's obviously been a long and painful situation for the family and I hope they find some resolution and peace. Likewise, Blanchett's Blue Jasmine co-star Alec Baldwin appeared to call for an end to the public nature of the row, terming Dylan's allegations \"this family's personal struggle\". The actor earlier engaged in conversation with Twitter followers but subsequently deleted the tweets. Responding to the claim that he owed Dylan an apology, Baldwin wrote: \"What the f&amp;@% is wrong w u that u think we all need to b commenting on this family's personal struggle?\" Another follower replied to Baldwin's tweet saying: \"@ABFalecbaldwin disappointed in your response. You have 2 daughters. You should know better,\" to which he replied, \"You are mistaken if you think there is a place for me, or any outsider, in this family's issue.\" Baldwin's timeline does still include two retweets which appear to be endorsements. Girls creator Lena Dunham, however, expressed sympathy with Dylan, and was heartened by what she perceived to be the widespread sharing of her views. Meanwhile Robert B Weide, who directed a documentary about Allen, tweeted that the letter contained nothing which hadn't already been discussed and dismissed in the original investigation. Weide's blog on the Daily Beast was published before Dylan's letter but seeks to debunk myths about the case that had resurfaced in the wake of Mia Farrow's Vanity Fair interview last October and her and son Ronan's tweets around the time of Allen's Golden Globes win last month. \u2022 Read the full article on Dylan's letter, Allen's refutal and the backstory to the case.",
