No one personifies the power of Twitter quite like Stephen Fry. This time last year he had 630,000 followers. Now he has more than 1.5 million. Why does this make him powerful? Because he sets the agenda. A tweet from Fry has become a key mobilising force for campaigns from saving Bletchley Park to the outrage over Jan Moir's Daily Mail column on Stephen Gately. A message from Fry retweeted by even a small proportion of his followers has the potential to reach many more people than would read him in a newspaper or watch one of his television shows. \"Like the printing press, Twitter changed the situation,\" said Fry. \"People like me, Twillionaires, we can cut out the press from our PR requirements. It used to be a pact with the devil. Today, Britney Spears tells her PR manager: 'Why should I care about this journalist of this newspaper with a big circulation? I will reach their circulation just by typing into my keyboard.'\" Fry played down his own influence, saying it was the \"Twitter millions who create the story. You can only point them in a direction.\" But few can point to quite so many people as Fry. Fry would never have been a Twillionaire without the extraordinary body of work \u2013 and fans \u2013 he has built up over the past three decades, from BBC Radio 4 panel games such as Whose Line Is It Anyway? and I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue to the TV shows A Bit of Fry and Laurie, Jeeves and Wooster, QI and the various incarnations of Blackadder. The newspaper columnist and author has presented acclaimed documentaries on HIV and manic depression, as well as fronting the BBC1 travelogue Stephen Fry in America and the natural history series Last Chance to See on BBC2. He also became an unlikely TV star in the US in the crime drama Bones. A committed Apple fanboy, it was a sign of Fry's enduring influence \u2013 and status as the patron saint of British geeks \u2013 that not only did he bother to make a short video of him unpacking his iPad from its box, it has been watched by more than 700,000 people on YouTube. But not all is well in the blogosphere. Fry took aim at the \"stinking, sliding, scuttling, weird, entomological creatures\" who leave abusive comments on blogs, whose \"resentment, their desire to be heard at the most vituperative level, at the most unpleasant and malevolent, genuinely ill-willed malevolent, level is terrifying\". And whatever you do, don't call him boring. Fry suffered one bit of bad news \u2013 his ITV1 drama, Kingdom, was axed last year. He revealed this on Twitter, obviously.",
