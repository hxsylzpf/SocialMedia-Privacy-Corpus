  "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, we offer you the frontrunner for tweet of the year, courtesy of National Rail Enquiries which came amid the faintly worrying news of Sunday night: It's a work of art \u2013 redolent as it is of previous great British creations such as The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin (whose given reasons for being late did once include \"escaped puma at Chessington North\" \u2013 which made him 22 minutes late rather than the previous 11) and of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy with its famous rant by Arthur Dent: Arthur Dent: \"You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them had you? I mean like actually telling anyone or anything.\" Council jobsworth: \"But the plans were on display \u2026\" AD: \"On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.\" CJ: \"That's the display department.\" \"With a torch.\" \"Ah, well the lights had probably gone.\" \"So had the stairs.\" \"But look you found the notice didn't you?\" \"Yes. Yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of The Leopard'.\" (We should admire the cosmic ordering that links the initials in that quote back to Reginald Perrin, of course.) Our thanks to Zack Whittaker for pointing it out. If you know of a better one \u2013 do tell us in the comments. A link would be useful, of course.",
