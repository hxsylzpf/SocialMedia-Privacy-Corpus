  "content": "Put yourself in the position of a US fund manager thinking of investing in Facebook at IPO stage. You think the stock is wildly overpriced but you know you've got to own a few of the damned things because the company will be a $100bn monster. You don't want to end up chasing the shares if there's a big \"pop\" in the first week of trading. So how many shares should you order? Then, miracle of miracles, you get word that Scott Devitt, analyst at Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter, has cut his short-term earnings forecasts for Facebook. Well, you knew the company's prospectus update, on 9 May, was downbeat about selling ads on mobiles, but you didn't appreciate it was such a forecast shifter. You also know news of the reduced forecast will not be revealed to the world because the rules say it cannot be. Your mind is made up: it's safe to be underweight; Facebook ain't going to fly on day one. Does this illustrative tale explain last week's IPO flop? We await the verdict of various US regulators, but it may be extremely hard to prove that Morgan Stanley did anything wrong. The IPO was an over-priced shambles, of course, but that is not the same thing as a conspiracy to fleece the public. If the rules say analysts at underwriting banks cannot publish research during an IPO period, but can talk to clients, then it is hard to see what Morgan Stanley should have done differently. The bank could have cut the price of Facebook shares, of course, but it seems to be claiming that it did at least contemplate that course. \"These revised views [of analysts at several underwriting banks who cut forecasts] were taken into account in the pricing of the IPO,\" says Morgan Stanley's statement. We'll judge the credibility of that statement when more details emerge. But, on the face of it, part of Joe Punter's anger should be directed at regulators for sanctioning a system that seems loaded against the little guy. Analysts on the inside should either be gagged completely or not at all. Imposing half a gag \u2013 a ban on published research but no limit on conversations with privileged clients \u2013 is asking for  trouble.",
