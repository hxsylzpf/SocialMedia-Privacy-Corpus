  "content": "The News of the World paid a private investigator \u00a3100,000 a year, the sentencing hearing for royal editor Clive Goodman was told today. The court was also told that News of the World journalist Goodman was driven to break the law because of the \"pressure\" he felt to break stories. The court heard from prosecution barrister David Perry QC that the News of the World paid Glen Mulcaire more than \u00a3100,000 a year for his services. A police search at Mulcaire's address uncovered a contract between the News of the World and Mulcaire's company running between July 1 2005 and June 30 2006 under which Mulcaire was to be paid \u00a32,019 a week or \u00a3104,988 a year, Mr Perry told the court. In addition, Mulcaire was paid \u00a312,300 in cash between November 9 2005 and August 7 2006. This was money paid to Mulcaire by Goodman, which the journalist then claimed under expenses using the codename Alexander to hide the identity of his source. Records of this payment file included references to \"Harry and Chelsy\" and \"Wills\", Mr Perry told the court. Defending Goodman ahead of sentencing at the Old Bailey today, John Kelsey-Fry QC said the News of the World journalist had an unblemished record before he conspired to hack into mobile phone messages for three members of the royal household. Mr Kelsey-Fry said at the time the conspiracy, with private investigator Glen Mulcaire began, Goodman had fallen from his place as the country's top royal reporter. \"He was respected, promoted, rewarded and commended by his peers, he was at the top of his tree,\" Mr Kelsey-Fry told the court. \"But by the end of 2005 that position was very different. The trouble with being at the top is you're expected to continue to produce the goods and to continue to excel, but by 2005 Mr Goodman's stories, once nominated for awards, were no longer considered adequate even by his superiors. \"He was demoted, sidelined and another, younger reporter was appointed to cover the royal family. Undoubtedly the newspaper business is a tough and ruthless business. \"By this stage Mr Goodman was under immense pressure to produce and under that pressure he feared for his job. \"It was whilst under that pressure and with a new wife and recently born first child that he departed from those high standards by which he had lived, a departure for which he will be forever ashamed. \"None of this is designed to seek to excuse what he did but it is at least an explanation of why he resorted to conduct so alien to his known character. \"It also demonstrates that his purpose was not personal enrichment beyond trying to protect his job.\" Mr Kelsey-Fry said Goodman had not known what he was doing was illegal. The journalist had been living in \"utter terror\" since his arrest in August and had effectively destroyed his career, Mr Kelsey-Fry added. Goodman and Mulcaire are expected to be sentenced later today for conspiracy to intercept communications contrary to the Criminal Law Act 1977. Mulcaire has also pleaded guilty to a further five counts of unlawful interception of communications under the regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
