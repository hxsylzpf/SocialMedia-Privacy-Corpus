  "content": "Twitter's share-price soared in the hours after the company published its latest quarterly financial results, as investors cheered its sharp growth in advertising revenues, and tactfully ignored another nine-digit net loss and sluggish user growth. The social network's earnings call with analysts provided more context to its latest numbers, including news of an iOS 8 bug that lost it four million users; Twitter's further plans for recommendation and curation; and a data-sharing deal with Google. Here are the highlights: Blame Apple (in part) for sluggish user growth Twitter had an average of 288 million monthly active users (MAUs) in the final quarter of 2014. That's up 20% year-on-year, but was only four million more MAUs than it averaged in the third quarter of 2014. Has the social network reached some kind of ceiling? Not according to chief executive Dick Costolo, who put the meagre quarterly growth of 1.4% partly down to \"seasonality\", and partly down to Twitter's integration with Apple's iOS 8 software, which launched in September. \"We lost approximately four million net users due to the rollout of the iOS8 integration,\" said CFO Anthony Noto, with Costolo adding that there was \"an unforseen bug in the release of iOS 8 as it relates to the specific Twitter integration\" \u2013 although neither gave specific details. Costolo claimed that Twitter is back on track for user growth so far in 2015, suggesting that \"our Q1 trend is likely to be back in the range of absolute net ads that we saw during the first three quarters of 2014\". The company added 14 million net users in the first quarter of 2014, 16 million in the second quarter then 13 million in the third. If it's back in that range now, Twitter should reach the milestone of 300 million active users by the end of March. More money, and mobile is still the key The main reason investors were so chuffed with Twitter's financials was its growth in revenues \u2013 up 97% year-on-year to $479m in the fourth quarter, leading Costolo to \"publicly congratulate everybody involved in building the business engine at Twitter\" during the earnings call. Twitter now makes $2.37 in ad revenues for every 1,000 timeline views on its service, and mobile is the key. 80% of its active users access Twitter from a mobile device at least some of the time last quarter, and mobile ads accounted for 88% of Twiter's $432m of advertising revenues. Twitter continues to work on deals to take its ads to other apps and websites, following its recent partnerships with Yahoo Japan and Flipboard. \"Because our primary ad unit is a tweet, the ads can go wherever tweets go, and our monetisation engine follows our content on sites across the web or another mobile apps,\" said Costolo. Is Twitter any closer to turning a profit from all this monetisation? Well, it recorded another sizeable net loss in the fourth quarter of 2014 \u2013 $125.4m \u2013 and its losses for 2014 as a whole reached $577.8m. Which, at least, is down from its $645.3m net loss in 2013. Investors seemingly aren't spooked about it, though. Recommendation and curation is a big deal for Twitter Twitter sees recommendations and curation as a key part of its business in 2015, especially when it comes to ensuring newly-registered users don't feel so intimidated at the prospect of figuring out who to follow that they drop out. The new Instant Timeline feature is the first big push on this front. \"We get them into a fully populated timeline that does not require them to immediately know the language of Twitter or who is on Twitter etc. Expect to see this on mobile in short order,\" said Costolo. \"By immediately dropping users into a high quality timeline of great content we believe we will be better able to convert those new signups into healthy long-term users.\" He later returned to the theme during the earnings call. \"We know that the follow action is the high-friction action for new users and by removing that action completely and dropping users into a really high quality timeline right away, we're hopeful we'll drive immediate engagement and create long-term users out of that large group of people we have coming into the top of the funnel.\" The algorithm being used for Instant Timeline is also behind a new feature for Twitter's existing users: \"While You Were Away\", which shows older tweets that it thinks they'll be interested in at the top of their timelines. \"There are more than 6,000 tweets a minute every day. What one person sees on Twitter is just a very narrow slice of all the amazing content we have on the platform and we have an obligation to better organise content and deliver it in compelling ways to our total audience,\" said Costolo. He later added that the recommendation algorithm is \"the number one priority\" for Twitter's engineers this year: \"It drives so much of the high quality engagement on the platform that, that's probably first and foremost where we'll devote a lot of resources.\" Mobile video is also a priority 2015 is going to be a year of intense development around video for Twitter. We've already seen the company launch video editing and sharing features within its mobile apps, joining its existing work with the standalone Vine app, and its Amplify scheme for broadcasters and brands to promote video on Twitter. \"We're clearly at the very beginning of mobile video sharing,\" said Costolo, who pointed to the 1.5bn daily loops of Vine videos as evidence of the demand for video from Twitter users. \"In expanding video to more people, we want to develop features that make video fast and easy,\" said Costolo. \"The simple video editor now in the tweet composer makes it super easy to capture moments as they happen with video on Twitter. We have a lot more coming on the mobile video front and I am personally investing a good deal of time in this area.\" One analyst asked how the new native video features will complement or compete with Vine. \"I think of Vine as really a creative medium in its own right, an artistic medium in its own right,\" said Costolo. \"You see the emergence of all these Vine stars and what they've been able to do on the platform as distinct from, but complementary to, native mobile video across the Twitter ecosystem.\" He also promised more tools for video creators on Twitter, to roll out over the coming months. Google and the opportunity to 'aggregate eyeballs' Ads might be Twitter's main way to make money, but the company also made $47m from \"data licensing and other revenue\" in the final quarter of 2014. That was up 105% year-on-year as it found new customers willing to pay for its firehose of data: a business-focused deal with IBM, for example. Twitter has started 2015 with a bang on this front, with reports of a new deal with Google to make tweets visible in the latter's search results as soon as they are posted \u2013 three and a half years after a previous partnership expired. Those reports of a new deal were true. \"We have a relationship that we've agreed to with Google. I don't have any more detail to share about it at this time,\" Costolo told analysts, and he was true to his word in remaining tight-lipped about whether Google is paying for the deal, and if so how much. He did warn that real-time tweets in Google search won't be available \"for several months\", while hinting that Twitter sees the partnership as an important way to bring internet users to its new \"logged out\" homepage, which will show a curated mix of tweets, trends and accounts. \"What's new about those deals is that they will drive traffic and distribute traffic to our logged out experience,\" he said, explaining what had changed since the companies' last partnership lapsed. \"We've got the opportunity now to drive a lot of attention \u2013 to aggregate eyeballs, if you will \u2013 to these logged out experiences, topics and events that we plan on delivering on the front page of Twitter. And that's one of the reasons this makes a lot more sense for us now.\" Twitter likes cricket, but analysts don't care about trolls Two smaller points of interest from the earnings call: Twitter is planning a big push around the cricket World Cup this year, building on its work with football in 2014. \"We're providing global cricket fans with an immersive experience similar to what we provided for the FIFA World Cup last summer,\" promised Costolo, highlighting India as a big part of this thanks to Twitter's recent acquisition of Indian mobile tech startup ZipDial. \"We'll be working with them to bring key moments and commentary around the cricket World Cup to a much larger audience on Twitter.\" Something that wasn't mentioned during the earnings call \u2013 by Costolo or by analysts \u2013 was Twitter's desire to crack down on abuse on its network in 2015. Despite the call taking place just a day after a Costolo memo admitting \"We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we've sucked at it for years\" was leaked, he didn't face a single question about Twitter's plans to do better. Its CEO may see dealing with trolls as a corporate priority, but until there's proof that toxic tweets are harming advertising revenues, Wall Street seems unfussed. #Business.",
