  "content": "Twitter's standalone app for live-streaming video, Periscope, now has nearly two million daily active users watching 40 years of broadcasts a day. Periscope published the stats to celebrate another milestone: its 10 millionth registered user since the app first launched for Apple's iPhone in March, with an Android version following in May. The app enables any user to broadcast live video captured by their smartphone's camera to fellow Periscope users, and promote the stream on Twitter to attract more viewers. In its blog post announcing the figures, Periscope stressed that the daily active users (DAU) and time-watched stats refer purely to people watching live on their smartphones, rather than on the web. \"Time Watched is the metric we care about most, and what we'll keep you updated on periodically,\" claimed the company. It's not alone in this attitude: over the last year, YouTube has also placed more emphasis in its analytics on how much time people spend watching, rather than the number of viewers or views. \"It's most reflective of the value we're creating for people and the world. Success for broadcasters means more time watched on their broadcasts,\" claimed Periscope, adding that the metric \"serves as a proxy for active user growth\" as an alternative to simply counting how many daily or monthly active users there are. Periscope's main rival this year has been Meerkat, which launched shortly before it on both iPhone and Android, but saw its access to Twitter's social graph cut off \u2013 hampering its ability to help users follow friends' accounts. Meerkat signed up 700,000 users in its first seven weeks after launching in March, and reached two million users by early May. It has not published an updated figure since. In July, research firm GlobalWebIndex claimed that in the previous month, 1% of internet users had used Periscope versus 0.9% for Meerkat. Periscope's main rival in the future may be Facebook, though. The social network has just introduced a feature called \"Live\" to its Facebook Mentions app, which is used by verified public figures like musicians, athletes and politicians. It enables them to broadcast live video to their Facebook fans.",
