Google removed the apps from the Market immediately on being alerted, but it is not clear whether it has removed them from devices to which they have been downloaded. As many as 200,000 Android devices could have been infected. The revelation comes from Android Police, a news site on Google's operating system, which calls it \"the mother of all Android malware\", noting that its examination had found that it \"steals nearly everything it can: product ID, model, partner (provider?), language, country, and userID. But that's all child's play; the true pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is that it has the ability to download more code. In other words, there's no way to know what the app does after it's installed, and the possibilities are nearly endless.\" Lookout, a security company, which in a blogpost lists the 50-plus apps discovered to be infected. (The list is also below, via Lookout.) Smartphones running Google's Android software have become enormously popular and are reckoned to be close to taking over worldwide as the fastest-selling smartphone platform, ahead of Finland's Nokia. Its growth has been fuelled by the fact that the software is free to license, and for developers there is no charge or checks to putting apps on the Market \u2013 unlike Apple's iPhone App Store, which checks every app against a suite of tests for suitability before allowing it on its store. That has led the Market to grow rapidly, but also makes situations like the latest one \u2013 which is not the first case of malware found on the Market \u2013 harder to avoid. The malware was first discovered by a Reddit user, Lompolo, who spotted that the developer of one of the malware apps had also posted pirated versions of legit apps, using the developer name \"Myournet\". But two other developers' products have also been found to include DroidReam. Lompolo noted that \"Myournet\" had \"taken 21 popular free apps from the Market, injected root exploit [code] into them and republished\". More worryingly, those had seen between 50,000 and 200,000 downloads altogether in just four days. DroidDream contains code which can \"root\" \u2013 take complete control of \u2013 a user's decice, and send detailed information such as the phone's IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) and IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) numbers and send them to remote servers. But as Android Police's team found, the code can go much further in rooting through a phone. Update: details of how the root code works are here. Note that this is a \"privilege escalation\" attack - once the app starts it uses the fact that it has user privileges to jump out of its sandbox and root the phone. It's a rather brutal reminder of the fact that Android's openness is both a strength and, at times like this, a weakness \u2013 though Google's rapid action, in which it pulled the apps from the Android Market within just five minutes of being alerted, is encouraging. It now looks likely that security companies will begin to compete to offer antivirus and anti-malware products for Android devices \u2013 which, given its rapid growth, could prove a fertile area for them with PC sales flat. If you have downloaded any of the apps below, you should contact your phone company.
