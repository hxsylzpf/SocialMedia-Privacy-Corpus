Some rights reserved Spotify fairly majorly tweaked its terms of use before the US launch and restricted free accounts somewhat - changes widely thought to be in response to record label demands. But its priority is to attract enough paying users that it can convincingly compete in the more competitive US market where Pandora, Rdio and Rhapsody are already established.

Spotify wouldn't confirm the number at the time but said the response had exceeded expectation. Brandwatch assessed mentions of 'pay for Spotify' this and estimated that 47% of sentiment was positive, down from 60% in the first week after launch.
