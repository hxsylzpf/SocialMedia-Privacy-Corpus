  "content": "Phorm, the server-side adware company, is poised to begin its next trial to provide ads based on peoples' internet browsing to a limited number of opt-in customers using BT Broadband: we hear that it will start imminently, perhaps even this week. But while it's caused a privacy storm here in the UK (with some protesters planning to picket BT's annual shareholder meeting) - see our coverage here and here (and listen to the interview with Phorm's CEO and chair, Kent Ertugrul) - there's also been moves to introduce similar systems in the US. Thus Charter Communications, the fourth-largest cable operator in the US, quietly said in May that it would trial systems from NebuAd, which uses a similar system to Phorm: it invisibly tracks what web pages you request, analyses the header and some of the text, and then tries to figure out what you're generally interested in finding out. Now Charter is backtracking: the trial has been put off, and \"privacy concerns\" are being cited. Quoth the Charter PR: \"As we do with all new service launches or initiatives, we conducted focus groups well in advance, which told us that most broadband consumers would look upon this service favorably,\" Charter said on Wednesday. \"However, some of our customers have presented questions about this service as well as suggested improvements,\" it said. \"We will continue to take a thoughtful, deliberate approach with the goal to ultimately structure an advertising service that enhances the internet experience for our customers and addresses questions and concern they've raised.\" Put that way, it all sounds like everyone was so pleased, obviously they had to delay it. Can't be pleasing people too much. The reality though is that US legislators had kicked up a storm, prompted by privacy advocates: \"The fact is that it would have allowed profiling of an individual - where they were going and what they were doing online, and there was no guarantee that this information could not ultimately be compromised,\" Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts who chairs the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet, told the Washington Post. \"They made the right decision in halting their test.\" NebuAd has been accused of forging Google data packets. The packets had extra Javascript code in them which loaded data from another page. (This sort of diversion is bad: if there weren't a company you trusted behind it, you'd conclude that your router or machine might be compromised. Which is what happened when BT did its early - quite feasibly illegal - trials of the Phorm system. Phorm has since changed its system so it doesn't inject Javascript.) And the other part of the reality is that Charter doesn't know when it's going to restart the scheme. That comes perilously close to \"dropping\" it, you have to think. Now, Phorm has insisted repeatedly that its system means that people can't profile you; if someone breaks into its database, all they'd find is a set of unique IDs, web pages pre-defined ad channel match, and times, but nothing with IP addresses or names or emails that could link the ID to a person. Will that be enough, though, if similar ideas are being put off in the US, where privacy online isn't usually as strongly defended at the individual level (and is certainly not as enshrined in the law as in the UK and Europe)? (Bonus link: an interview with the CEO of NebuAd at Gigaom, at the end of May. If you've followed Phorm, it will sound very familiar.) (Updated: 26 June: Phorm pointed out that it does not store web pages; it stores \"the unique ID, pre-defined ad channel match and time stamp\". Changed in the paragraph above.)",
