  "content": "Ladies and gentlemen of this very ad hoc jury \u2026 Let us consider the Question of the Epic Boobs \u2013 in conjunction, naturally enough, with the matter of Danni Minogue's early pregnancy. We'll inevitably come to Harry and strip billiards, but meanwhile the Press Complaints Commission book of what may be deemed relevant case law is open wide. Ms Minogue, you may remember, complained to the PCC because the Daily Mirror and Daily Record broke the news that she was having a baby much too early for comfort, certainty or taste. They said that they'd seen it on a blog and the Sydney Morning Herald website. The commission promptly slapped them down. \"Our code specifically requires us 'to have regard to the extent to which the information has previously appeared. This is no more than common sense: otherwise any reference online would represent automatic justification for a newspaper to print otherwise intrusive material.\" But when the woman with \"epic boobs\" found some pictures she'd posted on a social networking site downloaded by Loaded magazine and used in a rather tatty competition to identify her, she too went to the PCC \u2013 and got a different result. Hold on to that word \"extent\" because entering the word \"boobs\" on Google produced 1,760,000 matches related to her and 203,000 image matches as the \"Epic Boobs\" girl. \"The commission had to pay regard to the extent to which the information had already been made available, and also the context in which it appeared. It judged that it would not have been proportionate to criticise an editor for republishing this material, bearing in mind how \u2013 and how far \u2013 it had already spread\". It's difficult to see any successor body to the PCC, statutory or not, coming to a vastly different conclusion about the \"extent\" of the problem here. Nobody knows whether St James's Palace, which has three months to decide whether to make a formal complaint over Harry's Las Vegas antics, will do so. Nobody can tell whether 3,600 emails and letters from members of the public will trigger an inquiry anyway. And nobody can predict whether the PCC will be around long enough to complete such an investigation or offer meaningful redress. But if you Google something simple, say \"Prince Harry photos\", you'll get 254,000,000 results: which, deep down, is the extent of everyone's problem.",
