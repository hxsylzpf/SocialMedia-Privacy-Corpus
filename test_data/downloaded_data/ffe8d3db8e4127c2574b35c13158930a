  "content": "Independent senator John Madigan says the government agency overseeing doctors, dentists and chiropractors cannot be trusted to gain access to Australians' phone and web data. The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) has previously used doctors' phone and web data to help it investigate doctors who have sex with their patients. Ahpra is one of 61 agencies on a list released by the government who have purportedly applied to the attorney general, George Brandis, for ongoing access to be classed as enforcement agencies to gain warrantless access to telecommunications data. Ahpra said it is seeking guidance from the department on whether it would be granted access. They were removed from a list of agencies that could access the information from telecommunications companies with the advent of the government's mandatory data retention laws. Madigan made the remarks after allegations that Ahpra was targeting doctors who treated Lyme diseases who were \"harassed and bullied\" out of the profession. \"This is not an organisation to be trusted with this kind of access,\" he said. \"I am seeing firsthand a jackboot approach by Ahpra to doctors in Australian treating Lyme disease and I would be deeply concerned if any consideration was given to Ahpra's request to regain unrestricted metadata access, as has been recently reported.\" Madigan said he would write to Brandis to express his \"strongest opposition\" to the application. Madigan said he would support calls by independent senator Nick Xenophon for a sweeping inquiry into the medical complaints process in Australia. Under the new data retention laws, the attorney general must decide whether agencies can be granted warrantless access to telecommunications data. The access can be conditional or can be wholesale, and could allow agencies to directly approach telecommunications providers without a warrant.",
