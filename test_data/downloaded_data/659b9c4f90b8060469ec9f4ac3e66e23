  "content": "Dear fellow-artist, why so free / With every sort of company / With every Jack and Jill? / Choose your companions from the best; / Who draws a bucket with the rest / Soon topples down the hill. What a snooty arse that WB Yeats was, eh? The above stanza comes from his poem To a Young Beauty. Yeah, right. More like Creepy Old White Guy Pervs Over Attractive Younger Woman. William Carlos Williams is a tosser too: I have eaten / the plums / that were in / the icebox / and which / you were probably / saving / for breakfast. / Forgive me / they were delicious \u2026 I won't be reading that greedy, selfish bastard again. My pleasure matters more than yours, so be pleased for me, underling. Wow. Just wow. Is the above ludicrousness really the way we want to respond to poetry? Yesterday, Twitter answered with a resounding yes. Craig Raine published a poem in the London Review of Books about an encounter with a young woman at Gatwick airport. The narrator of the poem fancied the woman; he liked her \"big bust\". Raine imagined a beautiful older version of her, then decided she was likely to end up looking like her wide-hipped mother, whom he did not find attractive. Throughout the poem, the narrator did nothing more than smile and think. Like all of us, he fancies some people more than others. Some men prefer voluptuous older women to young thin ones. The narrator of Raine's poem happens not to be of their number. That's allowed, isn't it? Well, yes \u2013 and no one has stifled Raine's free speech. Nothing bad has happened to him, unless you count being torn apart on Twitter \u2013 called a would-be molester, a twat, creepy, entitled. Raine's \"horrifying\", \"depressing\", \"grim\" poem has been found guilty of \"perving\". One person wanted to \"kick his dick\", another to flush it down the loo. There's been an open invitation to anyone and everyone on Twitter to participate in writing a protest response. There's a cruelly ageist aspect to much of the bile: \"We need more leering old white guys.\" Many apparently find the sexual desire of an elderly man disgusting \u2013 why else use words like perv to describe one adult finding another adult attractive? Why do so, especially when the poet is old and perhaps sad that his sexual prime is behind him? We don't need more of the male gaze in literature, Twitter pronounced. Well, if you want to screen out the thoughts of half the population, you can choose not to read men. That's up to you. Meanwhile, Raine should be able to write about a fleeting moment of horniness without getting bullied for it. When dozens of people on Twitter attack the pariah du jour, there's no way to describe it apart from bullying. Choosing to participate, knowing others are doing so too and that more still might join in, is infinitely more horrific and grim than fancying someone and writing about it. Many poets would be devastated if what happened to Raine had happened to them. Such group attacks can seriously damage a person's mental health. Poets don't make their writing choices based on what's needed to correct injustices or societal wrongs. Poets write what they're driven to write; they express their messy, imperfect feelings. Raine, on the evidence of this poem, is feeling melancholic and absurd \u2013 aware of his powerlessness in the face of passing time and the inability of silly fantasies to console or save any of us. Thankfully, some people spotted this. The novelist Rachel Heath tweeted that the poem \"seems so clearly about frail ego\". The historian and novelist Lucy Inglis wisely tweeted: \"If poets aren't free to expose base impulses, complex identities and unfashionable thoughts we should abandon this pretence of a society.\" After this episode, many poets will nevertheless still dare to publish whatever they want to express on the subject of lust. I suspect there are as many who won't. As a poetry lover, I find that a terrifying prospect. Given the choice, I'd far rather Raine looked at my amply padded 43-year-old bottom and put his thoughts about it \u2013 complimentary or otherwise \u2013 in a poem.",
