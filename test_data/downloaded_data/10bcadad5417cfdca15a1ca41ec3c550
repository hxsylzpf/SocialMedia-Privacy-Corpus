  "content": "The first identity cards seen in Britain since the Second World War are to start replacing passports from March 2007 as the Government speeds up controversial plans to issue everyone with a method of proving who they are. The Conservatives last night attacked claims that an ID card would help tackle terrorism, but David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, has told officials that the first cards will be introduced for all foreign nationals in Britain from that date. British people needing to renew their passports will also be able to apply for an ID card although it will not become compulsory for all over-16s until a later date, probably 2010. Blunkett will introduce legislation next month setting out how the ID card will work. It will cost about \u00a380 to apply for, more than the present \u00a342 for a passport. It will be voluntary at first but the Government will eventually propose a compulsory system. Although it will be legal not to carry an ID card, the Home Secretary will urge everyone to keep the card on them at all times. Police will only be able to demand the card if the person is suspected of committing a crime. Similar to driving licences, individuals will then have a number of days to produce the ID card at a local police station. The Government will say that the increased price is necessary because the new ID card will contain complex 'biometric data' such as information for iris and fingerprint recognition. They are also looking at 'incentivising' people to take up ID cards, possibly by making passports more expensive than at present or giving the first people who apply for the card a cheaper deal. Ultimately the Government would like to introduce an ID card that combined both passport and driving licence, although that might have to be delayed because of technical difficulties. When the card becomes compulsory, it will be needed to access NHS care and claim benefits. Blunkett will say that an ID card will prevent people involved in crime and illegal immigration having 'multiple identities', one of the biggest problems for police trying to tackle the issues. He will also say that terrorists often successfully steal people's identities when they arrive in a country, enabling them to practically disappear from the view of the authorities. ID cards, he will say, will cut off this route of disguise. Critics of the Government's plans say that it will increase the ability of the state to monitor what people are doing. This weekend the Shadow Chancellor, Oliver Letwin, said that there was no evidence that ID cards would help tackle terrorism. He also said that the technology needed to implement a scheme could be prohibitively expensive and raised serious civil liberty issues. 'I haven't yet seen the slightest evidence from the Government, or indeed from anyone else, that ID cards would actually substantially contribute to the battle against terrorism,' he said. 'I haven't yet heard anything from the Government that persuades me that they have really thought through how having ID cards, with all the admitted civil liberties implications, would really help us in the fight against terrorism.' Letwin said that in 20 to 30 years time Britain could wake up and find itself 'a lot less free'. 'We really ought to be very careful before we go down that road that there is a practical outcome that is worth the candle,' he added.",
