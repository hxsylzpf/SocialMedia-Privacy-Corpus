  "content": "A month ago, two big pop-music events occurred online. One was Cee-Lo Green's Fuck You, an instant internet smash that vaulted to more than 2m plays via a quickie, follow-the-bouncing-lyrics YouTube clip (since supplanted by a live-action video). The other belonged to 20-year-old Nick Pittsinger, working under the name Shamantis, who slowed down Justin Bieber's U Smile till it sounded like a whale dirge and/or something from the 4AD label, then posted it to SoundCloud; it too has been played more than 2m times. Both are novelties that actually stand up, but the big difference is that most of the people who checked out the YouTube phenomenon knew about that site already. The slowed-down Bieber track, though, was likely the first encounter with SoundCloud for many of Pittsinger's listeners. SoundCloud began in 2007, the brainchild of programmers-turned-entrepreneurs Alexander Ljung and Eric Wahlforss, a pair of Swedes based in Berlin who wanted, Ljung recently told Billboard, to create a Flickr equivalent for musicians. The site's clean, orange-and-white design and waveform-pattern design gave it an instant visual appeal. Like most YouTube videos, SoundCloud players are easily embedded on to other blogs, ensuring access to the platform even without having to visit the website itself. In that sense, SoundCloud was both a better version of MySpace (minus the junky visual clutter of so many band pages) and third-party upload sites such as RapidShare or Megaupload. Sub Pop Records general manager Chris Jacobs reports that at this year's Midem \u2013 a big annual music-biz confab in Cannes \u2013 SoundCloud representatives handed out postcards that read \"Fuck YouSendIt.\" The service now has more than 1.5 million users under five different membership plans ranging from Free (uploads of up to 120 minutes total, downloadable 100 times max) to Pro Plus (unlimited minutes and downloads for \u20ac59 (\u00a350) per month or \u20ac500 per year). Users also have the option of adding comments to the music, in either freestanding fashion or keyed to specific moments on the time grid, allowing for pinpoint analysis or, in the case of a longer DJ set, to ID specific songs as they appear in the mix. And DJ music has been important to SoundCloud's platform from day one. \"The founders were, and are, dance music enthusiasts,\" says Todd Burns, editor of techno web-mag Resident Advisor. \"They gave a number of DJ/producers accounts before it was open to the public, hoping that they'd use it.\" Soon enough, they were \u2013 and other kinds of musicians, notably rock acts such as Sonic Youth and Beck, had jumped aboard. \"We've been using it pretty regularly for about six months now,\" says Sub Pop's Jacobs. \"It's a convenient and easy way to [create] portable, streaming players.\" Last month, as a riposte to Pitchfork's late-summer Top 200 Songs of the 1990s list, Sub Pop's staff uploaded 52 of their favourite 90s tracks from the label onto a trio of SoundCloud playlists. \"It's nice that we can post it on our website and then people can grab it and put it in a ton of different places,\" says Jacobs of the site's easy embedding. \"You can do it as a private thing and then, if you have an exclusive deal with a website to premiere a couple of tracks, you can just give that to them. With the lists, we can't just go, 'OK, you can download all of these things' \u2013 we don't have those rights, necessarily. We'd have to check in with all the old bands. The streaming is a useful tool in that regard.\" \"If I were an artist or ran a label, I couldn't see not having [a SoundCloud account],\" says Burns. \"Now it's easier to hear previews, skip through things and leave comments than ever before. It's grown as big as it has because people can use it for a lot of different purposes \u2013 some that the founders probably didn't even envision,\" says Burns. Exhibit A: Shamantis's Bieber slowdown. The moppet-headed pop star took the revamp in his stride, even boosting it on his Twitter account: \"This version of U SMILE is incredible to just chill out and fall asleep to. feels EPIC. gotta love music.\"",
