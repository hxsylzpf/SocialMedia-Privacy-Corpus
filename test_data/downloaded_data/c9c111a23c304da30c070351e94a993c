  "content": "pan1 has made lots of postings concerning the use of data matching by the Audit Commission, specifically to identify those who are falsely claiming the council tax single person's discount. Section 11 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 provides that the council tax payable for any household will be reduced by 25% if either there is only one person resident there or if there are more than one person resident there but all but one are people who the act says should be disregarded for council tax purposes (including students, people in various types of detention and people defined as \"severely mentally impaired\"). This 25% discount is commonly referred to as the \"single person's discount\". The Audit Commission is a body charged with ensuring that public money is properly used. Its governing statute, the Audit Commission Act 1998, was amended in 2008 to give it the power to conduct data-matching exercises \"for the purposes of assisting in the prevention or detection of fraud.\" \"Data matching\" is defined in the act as \"the comparison of sets of data to determine how far they match (including the identification of any patterns and trends)\" (section 32A of the amended act). The commission can require certain bodies (including councils) to provide information for the purposes of these exercises and can request information from other bodies. The commission is also required to publish a Code of Data-Matching Practice after consultation, among others, with the Information Commissioner. The code was published last July with an introduction from the Information Commissioner. Paragraph 2.1.5 of the Code makes clear that its scope does not extend to what steps the body required to send in data should take to investigate any possible false claims suggested by the results; that is for them to investigate \"in accordance with their usual practices for investigation of fraud and error\". In its recent report on local authorities' attempts to fight fraud, Protecting the Public Purse, the commission points out that 35% of households claim the single person's discount and that in recent years some councils have noticed a sharp increase in the number of households claiming the discount. It reports on its scrutiny of 11 councils that have taken a proactive approach to combating false claims for the discount and records that most of these reported fraud rates of between 4% and 6%. Applying a 4% rate nationally, it estimates that fraudulent claims for the single person's discount may be costing taxpayers \u00a390m each year. In the light of this it is perhaps unsurprising that false claims for the single person's discount are one of the targets of the Audit Commission's National Fraud Initiative. The commission's website shows that it is again requiring councils to submit their council tax records and electoral rolls so that the two can be matched. Obviously, the commission will be looking for households claiming the discount where more than one adult is registered to vote. The report of an unnamed local authority that pan1 cut and pasted into one of his postings shows the use that one council has made of the information that the commission's data-matching exercise produced. The report shows that the council has 16,700 households claiming the single person's discount. The commission's data-matching threw up 939 \"mismatches\" (as the report refers to them). Of these, the council managed to account for 269 cases from its own records or home visits. It then wrote to 670 households asking them to account for the discrepancy. By the time the report was written the council was satisfied that the discount was being properly claimed in 516 of the 670 cases. It is not clear whether the remaining cases were ones where the discount was being incorrectly claimed. Assuming all 154 were, this means that less than 1% of those claiming the single person's discount have been identified by the data-matching exercise as claiming a single person's discount that they were not entitled to. This is far less than the 4% to 6% that the commission refers to in its report. However, this is perhaps not surprising. Data-matching council tax records and the electoral register will only throw up those falsely claiming the single person's discount who are foolish enough to then register more than one adult as electors. It is also worth noting that, if it is the case that the 154 households of the 939 identified by the data-matching exercise were falsely claiming the discount, this gives the data-matching a hit rate of more than 16%. Data matching and data mining With the development of computer technology have come not only the ability to store vast amounts of information but also the ability to automatically sort, extract and compare data. Closely related to data matching is the process of data mining \u2013 looking at certain items of data or at patterns within data as indicators of a particular characteristic, tendency or behaviour. So a supermarket may look at patterns of spending on the part of its customers with loyalty cards to decide which customers to market high-end goods to. There is a lot of potential overlap between the two techniques. The concern is where it could lead. Data thrown up by these technologies, often without any initial human intervention, will inevitably throw up entirely innocent patterns as well as suspicious ones. The concern then is what is done with this information and how any suspicions are acted upon. While the throwing up of unusual data patterns might not justify the use of intrusive surveillance powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 1998 (Ripa), it might lead to a public authority seeking access to communications data (the record of telephone calls made, emails sent, but not the content). The concerns about data matching and mining are most acute when the government holds a lot of sensitive information on a single database. This was one of Liberty's many concerns when the government announced last year that it intended to create a massive centralised database containing records of all communications data in the UK. A centralised database of this kind could provide the basis for greater moves towards data mining, as it would potentially allow for millions of communication records to be sifted to identify potential criminality. Such a development would dramatically alter our approach to crime detection and prevention. Our ostensibly innocent communications would be subjected to unprecedented scrutiny premised solely on the \"just in case\" prinicple. Instead of an individual's activities giving cause for suspicion, cause for suspicion would be actively sought by the state. Thankfully the government has now announced it will not be bringing forward its plans for such a database in the near future, although the Home Office has yet to shelve plans for such a database altogether. The National Identity Register, which is the database that sits behind ID cards, also raises real concerns about the potential for data matching and mining given the wealth of information that will be contained on that database once it becomes fully operational. Right to respect for privacy Of course, in deciding whether the data matching of council and electoral records breaches the human rights convention, the courts will not consider what data matching and mining might lead to in the future but rather the concrete example before them. While the electoral register, at least in its edited form (people registering to vote can opt to be excluded from the register that is made available to commercial organisations), is a public document, council tax records are not publicly available. In any event, even if the two sets of records were not themselves private, the process of comparing them would in all likelihood be considered an interference with the right to respect for a person's private and family life protected by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 8 is not an absolute right and an interference with the right can be justified if there is a clear legal basis for it \u2013 the interference serves one or more of the legitimate aims listed in the second part of Article 8 and the interference is \"necessary in a democratic society\". There is a clear legal basis for the data matching here: the Audit Commission Act 1998. The legitimate aims listed in Article 8(2) are broadly construed and it is likely that the courts would accept that the data matching is a measure aimed at preventing crime and/or is in the interests of the economic well-being of the country, as it serves to ensure the full payment of council tax. The crucial issue will be whether the data matching is \"necessary in a democratic society\". This will involve consideration of the reasons for and necessity of the measure, proportionality and any safeguards that are in place. Apart from the reasons identified by the Audit Commission justifying this data-matching exercise (see above), factors that may be relevant here are: the fact that while the data matching may represent an interference with personal privacy it is far from the most serious; that a positive match is not taken as proof of wrongdoing but is rather the spur to further investigation; the relatively firm and tenable presumptions on which the exercise is based; restrictions in the Audit Commission Act on who the results of the data-matching exercise can be disclosed to; the relative success, at least in the case of the unnamed council, of this example of data matching in identifying people who are falsely claiming the single person's discount. In the light of these factors it seems unlikely that the courts would consider this particular example of data matching to be a breach of Article 8. But that is not to say that all data-matching and data-mining exercises will pass this test. Do you have a question for Liberty's lawyers? Post it here.",
