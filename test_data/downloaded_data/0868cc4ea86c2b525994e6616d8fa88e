  "content": "Popular social networking websites such as MySpace and Friends Reunited were last night given an alarming wake-up call when Britain's leading site for gay and lesbian people moved to slash 30,000 people from its membership list amid fears some were 'cyber-stalkers'. Outeverywhere.com, Britain's largest networking site for the gay community, which has signed up more than 200,000 people, is believed to be the first of its kind to start axing members amid growing concerns that such sites are being exploited by criminals trawling for personal information. The site organises more than 5,000 events a year in the UK. Its online discussion forums attract 1.2 million postings a year. Such activity means the site contains a vast amount of data on members' personal characteristics. Over the past two years the popularity of sites such as MySpace has rocketed. The stratospheric valuations of many of them has been largely predicated on the numbers of members they boast, but the dash to build up membership may mean some are becoming easy targets for scam artists, experts believe. Outeverywhere.com has identified 30,000 individuals who do not participate in any of its social networking events and therefore remain anonymous, and will email them to warn them they are about to be removed.",
