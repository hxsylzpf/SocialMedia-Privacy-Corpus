  "content": "The young are doing it, so it must be worth doing - join Facebook! You put your little face in, or not, if you can't work out how to do it. Other people who've done the same can now claim you as a \"friend\". Facebook emails you, to ask if they're really your friend. Depending on your mood, you can accept or reject these tendrils of companionship. Upon accepting, the person might message you with some sort of goodwill and you'll chat away, and then realise you've had their email address for ages anyway, so if you wanted to chat that much, why not just email each other? I have almost no lower limit for what kind of friendship I'm prepared to accept. I've yessed a guy who took my broken espresso machine off my hands, and another I haven't, strictly speaking, met, but I did tell his girlfriend a good way to get pregnant was for your special friend to greet each new day by immersing his nads in ice-cold water. So I think it's fair to say that, however soon I forget him, he ain't never gonna forget me. I should admit before I start this tirade that I am a Luddite who claimed for ages that mobile phones would never catch on because people always like to know where the person they're calling is. Nevertheless, I will concede that an awful lot of internet services are, indeed, revolutionary. It has changed the way we shop and the way we date. It's had a knock-on effect on privacy, decency, copyright and other laws. I could continue to list the claims made for the impact of the wondernet forever, but old-fashioned goodwill prevents me. The most flagrantly and frequently overegged assertion is for the importance of cyber-social networking. MySpace was the frontrunner here, Craigslist was the MySpace for grownups. Controversy and cash accrued to both enterprises in tandem - would MySpace take responsibility for old people pretending to be young in order to communicate with young people? All cats are grey in the dark, and most cats in cyberspace are 17. Would Craig Newmark sell out or reject the dotcom millions for cred? (\"How much money does a human need?\" was his final verdict.) MySpace threw up the odd pop sensation, a droll video of a cat falling down the back of a sofa. Like so much internet traffic, it's just You've Been Framed without a decency filter. In the end Craigslist is a shiny, US version of Loot, and MySpace is a way for teenagers to waste time. New media gurus characterise these networking experiences as anonymous and pseudonymous by their nature, which is where Facebook gets its notoriety. As blogger and professor Jeff Jarvis wrote in this paper, of Facebook: \"So, we are the masters of our identities and our communities, which establishes trust.\" We're using our real names, in other words. But whether as ourselves, under pseudonyms or on Second Life as avatars, we are still messing about. What does it mean, to have 183 Facebook friends? That you will waste a small amount of time communicating with them, irregularly, or ignore them and feel a tiny amount of social guilt. What does it mean, to be yourself rather than an avatar? That your communication is more authentic? Who cares, if all it boils down to is a periodic \"hello\"? The internet is like the wheel - a lot of work has become faster or more tolerable as a result of its invention. People, once with a bicycle and now with Guardian Soulmates (not a shameless plug - truthfully, what most daters use!), can look further afield for sex, and in the long term this will probably be a boon to genetic diversity. But cyberspace hasn't changed our natures, any more than transport did. Meaningful communities are still small in scale, built on time, effort and contact. Gangs of 200 people saying hello to each other are just so much landscape. mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk",
