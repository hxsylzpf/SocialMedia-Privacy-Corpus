The latest round hits US banks \u2013 institutions that have not been particularly close to Americans' hearts for a few years. As banks attempt to build a following on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, they confront a big obstacle: their customers just don't seem to care. Half the consumers feel that the use of social media by banks is ineffective, according to a recent survey by the Carlisle &amp; Gallagher Consulting Group. Even worse: 87% of the 1,002 consumers surveyed think banks' use of social media is annoying, boring and unhelpful. Perhaps out of some aversion to being bored, only about 7% of those 1,002 consumers actually follow banks on social media. Out of those 70 people who did click that follow button, the majority follow their bank on Facebook (83%), while just fractions follow them on Twitter (26%) and LinkedIn (16%). That means most of the people who describe the banks' social media efforts as unhelpful, boring and annoying have seen little to none of whatever it is that these banks are actually posting on Facebook or Twitter. Banks, as a result, are working to liven up their social media efforts. JP Morgan Chase, with 40,000 Twitter followers, highlights everything from its philanthropic efforts to how to pick the perfect March Madness bracket. Citigroup, with 263,000 followers on Twitter, goes heavy on career advice, highlighting resume-improvement tips, advice for entrepreneurs, and the occasional plug for TV appearances by one of the bank's experts. Wells Fargo, with over 80,000 followers, heavily promotes its products, with a bent towards philosophy (\"If you could travel back in time and give yourself a Small Biz tax tip, what would it be?\") and a nod to internet norms with the occasional retweet of a happy puppy picture. But let's be honest: there's a lot of history here. Banks aren't doing that great of a job so far of proving to their customers that they are worth of a Facebook \"Like\" or a Twitter fave, much less a follow. Just look at what happened when JP Morgan tried to host a Twitter Q&amp;A session and attempted to promote it with a hashtag #AskJPM. It didn't take long for the hashtag to be used in tweets that reminded the bank of its legal problems, highly paid executives and the complaints of struggling consumers. \"How are you planning to spend the savings made from firing your social media team?\" one Twitter wag asked. In the end, the bank canceled the Q&amp;A, tweeting: \"Bad idea! Back to the drawing board\". The root of the problem is that there is a huge disconnect between banks and their customers, and not just on social media. For one thing, there's magical thinking. One out of three consumers who complained to their banks about a problem with their accounts said the matter was not completely resolved, according to Patricia Sahm, senior manager at Carlisle &amp; Gallagher. \"Yet banks' metrics for resolutions show results much higher than 67%,\" she says. What's left is a disconnect between what consumers wanted to happen and what banks think actually happened. Helping customers on social media comes with its own set of problems, the main being that no one wants their private account information whipping around social media, even through private messaging. \"There are privacy issues. [Banks] are a highly regulated industry,\" says Sahm. As a result, banks trying to assist consumers with issues on Twitter or Facebook are limited to bland repetition of their customer-service numbers, which are already widely available offline. Customers aren't impressed by \"Oh, we are sorry. We'd like to help. Give us a call at this number\" types of messages. It's not just the banks that stray away from resolving problems on social media \u2013 90% of those surveyed said that they prefer to discuss their problem in private with their bank. Two-thirds say they would never use a social media to solve a problem with their bank. Yet \u2013 and this is important \u2013 about a third would use social media to complain. So why bother? Social media is a good way to filter complaints, comments and inquiries, says Sahm. It's like a public suggestions box that never gets full and is always there. Banks know this. In 2013, 80% of banks around the world said that they use Facebook to monitor and respond to customer comments, according to the Global Retail Banking Digital Marketing Report. Yet suggestion boxes only work if the suggestions are really read and considered. Consumers can never know if the battering ram of complaints will ever make it through to the banks themselves. \"Remember, there are a lot of folks on the other side,\" says Sahm.",
