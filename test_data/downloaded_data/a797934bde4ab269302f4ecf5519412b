  "content": "Police have raided the offices of Closer magazine searching for the identity of the photographer who took pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge topless while on holiday in the south of France. Officers arrived at 10am on Wednesday morning at the magazine's headquarters in the Paris suburb of Montrouge. They were reported to have searched the publication's offices and examined journalists' computers. A French court on Tuesday ordered Closer to hand over all copies of the photographs published on the front page and several inside pages of the magazine, within 24 hours or face punitive daily fines. The court also opened a \"preliminary inquiry\" following a criminal lawsuit lodged by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge into a breach of the royal couple's privacy by \"person or persons unknown\". Aur\u00e9lien Hamelle, representing the couple, said they had been \"profoundly shocked and troubled\" by the photographs, which he said revealed \"deeply intimate moments in the life of this couple, that have no reason to be on a magazine cover\". The Tribunal de Grande Instance at Nanterre agreed and granted the duke and duchess an injunction preventing further publication of the pictures and ordering Closer to hand over the electronic files containing them. The photographer has not yet been identified. \u2022 The French prosecutor's office later denied that the magazine's offices had been raided.",
