But it didn't stop the news spreading like wildfire across Chinese cyberspace. Internet censorship in China, like death and taxes, is always with us, but like taxes, at least, the burden can vary, depending on the state's need of the moment; and as any tax inspector will testify, the existence of a tax doesn't mean everyone will pay it. The last 18 months, with its succession of high-profile state events and serious unrest in Xinjiang and Tibet have not been good for Chinese web freedoms. Since the riots in Xinjiang, the entire province has been propelled back to the pre-internet age as the authorities simply shut down access across the board. But the outcome of the long-running war between Chinese web users and the censors is far from decided. Obama's visit itself became another excuse for official censorship: according to Chinese tweets, the authorities ordered all internet sites to exercise strict control of content, eliminating references to public letters to the president, meeting with dissidents (many of whom have, in any event, been detained in advance) offline protests and attacks on the Chinese government in vague and disguised language. As one Chinese tweeter responded, in an example of the kind of disguised language that enrages the censors, \"f**k the river crabs\". The river crab is a pun, one of many with which rebellious Chinese netizens taunt the censors. The word for river crab is a homonym for the word for \"harmony\", a reference to the government policy of building a \"harmonious society\". When a blog is shut down in China, netizens describe it as being \"harmonised\" and pictures of river crabs abound on the Chinese web. The curiosity is that Chinese tweets are available at all: Twitter, along with Facebook has been officially blocked in China for months. But a glance at the Berlin Twitter Wall, set up as part of the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall the Berlin Wall, reveals that the space has been taken over by Chinese tweeters calling for the destruction of the Great Firewall of China, demonstrating once again their agility with proxy servers and other evasive strategies. As to the official response to Obama's appeal, while his own election campaign benefited hugely from its effective internet strategy, this is unlikely to impress a Chinese leadership whose risks of facing popular election, to put it mildly, are remote. But the lack of ballot box opportunities does not mean that public opinion has no value for a Chinese leadership whose other claims to legitimacy are precarious. What is said on the web matters a great deal. Their dilemma is that censorship is a crude instrument, and each time it is used it further alienates a constituency they would prefer to co-opt. The culture of savvy Chinese netizens \u2013 the ones who are expanding the public space the web creates, rather than shopping, gambling or downloading pornography \u2013 is more rebellious than compliant, more inventive than passive. Government-sponsored bloggers \u2013 the 50 cent party, as the Chinese call them \u2013 have the difficult task of generating exciting propaganda in a culture where satire is more appealing. Between the party line and the river crab, the river crab still rules.",
