  "content": "This year's Brits has set the record as the most tweeted about television show in the UK, while the TV audience for the music awards event slumped to its lowest level since 2006. The ITV show notched up 4.17m tweets \u2013 easily beating previous record holder last year's Comic Relief, which drew 1.5m \u2013 as the decision to allow fans to vote via Twitter for the first time proved a social media publicity masterstroke. There were 2m tweets about the first awards Twitter vote, for the best British video, with One Direction's Harry Styles the king of retweets notching up 155,000 for a post thanking fans for voting. Unsurprisingly, One Direction took home the award for best British video. There were about 2.17m tweets about the show itself, which alone is enough to make the Brit Awards 2014 the most tweeted about UK TV programme. Last year's event generated 1.5m tweets. \"The live, public and conversational nature of Twitter also makes it the perfect accompaniment to TV,\" said Twitter in a blogpost the show based on statistics from analytics firm SecondSync. \"Fans come together on the world's biggest sofa and share TV moments like the Brits with fans across the globe\". The show also set a new tweets-per-minute record for a UK TV show of 78,000, with Beyonce proving to be the most talked about performer of the night on Twitter, followed by Arctic Monkeys. There was less to cheer about on the live TV front with ITV's coverage, hosted by James Corden for the fourth year in a row, slumping to its lowest level since 2006. The show attracted an average of 4.6 million viewers between 8pm and 10.15pm, an 18.4% share of all viewing in the time slot, well down on last year's 6.5 million. BBC2's coverage of the tense men's Olympic semi-final curling clash \u2013 which saw Team GB come from behind to beat Norway with the final stone of the match \u2013 drew a peak audience of 3.5 million. The event, which aired between 3pm and 6pm, helped BBC2's block of coverage that captured most of the semi-final (4.15pm to 7.30pm) reach an average audience of 2.5 million. Earlier in the day, a peak audience of 1.9 million viewers caught the women's curling semi final, in which Team GB were defeated by hosts Russia. BSkyB's decision to simulcast Arsenal's Champions League clash with Bayern Munich on Sky 1 attracted an average of 839,000 viewers, a 3.7% share of all viewing between 7.30pm and 10pm. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
