  "content": "When your nickname is King James, you come to expect the royal treatment. But now the basketball superstar LeBron James has landed a Miami cop in hot water, after posting an online video of himself and his fianc\u00e9e receiving a flashing-lights escort, past gridlocked vehicles, on their way to a rap concert. \"They treat us so well! Needed it cause traffic was nuts!!\" wrote James, of the Miami Heat, in a Tweet praising the officer who helped them reach a Jay Z/Justin Timberlake concert at the city's Sun Life Stadium on time. The post links to a short Instagram video which shows James's car following a police car or motorcycle into oncoming traffic on the wrong side of the road, speeding past block after block of jammed vehicles to the right. The celebrity's royal ride outraged many fans who were subsequently late for the start of the concert and prompted an investigation by the Miami-Dade police department, which admitted that its officer had breached regulations. \"It has been brought to our attention that a video was posted on the internet by LeBron James, a professional basketball player, where it shows him being escorted on to the property of Sun Life Stadium for a concert,\" a police spokesman said in a statement. \"The Miami-Dade Police Department did facilitate Mr James from one intersection to another in the adjacent area of the stadium. This was not a scheduled escort and although all safety precautions were taken, the department has identified these actions as a violation of departmental policies.\" The officer was one of a number of employees working an off-duty security assignment at Friday night's concert, the final show in Jay Z and Timberlake's Legends of Summer tour, and responded to a request over the police radio to meet James's car several blocks from the stadium. In the video, James, basketball's highest-paid player with earnings of more than $56m last year, according to Sports Illustrated, says: \"Light police escort on the wrong side of the street. Headed to the big homie concert, JT. Holla!\" The unnamed officer could now face disciplinary action, including a written reprimand or suspension, the police spokesman said. James, 28, has been a polarising figure in basketball since his highly publicised switch to Miami from the Cleveland Cavaliers in July 2010. He announced his move in a live telecast on ESPN called The Decision, and was criticised by several prominent former players for arrogance. But he has also been one of the game's most successful players, winning two NBA championships with the Heat, six Most Valuable Player awards (two in the NBA Finals and four for the whole season) and two Olympic gold medals. He has 3.5 million fans on Instagram and almost 9.5 million Twitter followers. James is engaged to his high-school girlfriend, Savannah Brinson, with whom he has two children, and his LeBron James Family Foundation has helped raise millions of dollars for children's developmental and educational charities. James has not directly addressed the controversy over his VIP escort to the concert, but he posted an entry on Twitter Tuesday morning with the hashtag #HatersBreedEnvy and linking to an Instagram picture of an unattributed quote, which read: \"Whenever you're happy and in a great place in anything, someone or something will try to put a virus in it to make it all unravel.\"",
