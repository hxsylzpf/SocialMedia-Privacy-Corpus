  "content": "The former News International executive chairman Les Hinton is understood to be in talks to give evidence to the Commons culture, media and sport select committee about allegations of phone hacking by the News of the World. The committee of MPs reopened its existing inquiry into press standards, privacy and libel in July after the Guardian revealed that News International had paid about \u00a31m in damages and costs to three individuals to settle legal cases over alleged phone hacking by NotW journalists. However, the committee has previously been unable to secure an appearance by Hinton, who ran News International during the period that saw the News of the World royal editor, Clive Goodman, and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire jailed in January 2007 for hacking into phones of royal aides. The committee has scheduled a hearing for next Tuesday, 15 September, and MPs hope that Hinton will appear. Hinton left News International in December 2007 to become chief executive of Dow Jones, the New York-based Wall Street Journal publisher and another News Corporation subsidiary. Nothing has been confirmed, but it is understood Hinton might give evidence to the select committee via video link from New York. Scotland Yard detective chief superintendent Philip Williams told a committee hearing last week that the police suspected Goodman and Mulcaire of hacking into the mobile phones of princes William and Harry. News International said it had no evidence of this. The committee has already heard from the former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, who resigned after Goodman's sentencing in January 2007, denying knowledge of the scandal. John Whittingdale, the Conserverative MP who chairs the culture select committee, has said that subsequent evidence \"might contradict\" that which Hinton gave about News of the World phone hacking when he appeared before the committee in 2007. Whittingdale said: \"When the committee saw these stories it did raise questions. It appeared there might be some contradiction between [them and] the evidence given by Les Hinton two years ago.\" Hinton said when giving evidence to the culture select committee in March 2007, two months after Goodman was jailed: \"I believe that Clive Goodman was the only person who knew what was going on.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
