  "content": "A married Premiership footballer who had affairs with two women yesterday made a last desperate attempt to prevent the media identifying him in a case with important implications for privacy laws and press freedom. For almost a year Garry Flitcroft's lawyers have kept his name out of the headlines by claiming that under human rights and confidentiality laws, his privacy was being invaded by a Sunday tabloid which wanted to tell the women's stories. However, earlier this year the country's most senior judge ruled that a high court judge had been wrong to stop the tabloid, the Sunday People, from publishing. Over the past few days tabloid newspapers have been putting the finishing touches to in-depth stories about the 29-year-old Blackburn Rovers player and his affairs in readiness for midnight last night when an injunction preventing him being named ran out. Yesterday his lawyers made a last-ditch effort when they argued his name should be kept secret until he had heard whether he had been given leave to take his case to the House of Lords, the country's highest court. Though Flitcroft's wife is understood not to have known of his affairs last spring, when the People first planned to publish, she has since been told - and other newspapers have tried to persuade her to tell her side of the story. The footballer has also been offered large sums of money for his story but, according to his lawyer, Mark Lewis, has rejected the offers. Ironically, naming Flitcroft will almost certainly be a letdown. Though successful and respected in the game, he is hardly a household name. The story, standard kiss-and-tell fare, has snowballed because of the legal implications. The People planned to run the women's stories in April last year, but Flitcroft's lawyers secured an injunction halting publication. They claimed that confidentiality laws - which are often used to prevent employees from revealing an employers' secrets - could also be applied to two parties in a love affair. They also argued that under article eight of the European convention on human rights, Flitcroft had a right to privacy. The European convention, incorporated into English law in the Human Rights Act, has been seized upon by media lawyers since Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas claimed successfully in the appeal court that their privacy had been breached by a celebrity magazine which printed unauthorised photographs of their wedding. Jamie Theakston, Sara Cox and, most recently, Naomi Campbell have all tried to invoke the Human Rights Act to protect themselves against alleged invasions of privacy. When details of Flitcroft's case emerged last November, editors were aghast. In a judgment - which named neither the footballer nor the newspaper involved - Mr Justice Jack ruled that sexual relations were by definition confidential. It was felt that the ruling could affect not only kiss-and-tell stories but serious investigative journalism. It was pointed out that the Profumo affair might not have come to light under the new laws. On the Sunday after the ruling the People claimed that the judgment would \"protect adulterous politicians and cheating celebrities and prevent abused women telling of their ordeals at the hands of such sexual predators\". Lord Wakeham, then chairman of the press complaints commission, wrote: \"This judgment seems to me fundamentally to threaten that freedom and the public's right to know.\" The People printed the women's stories anyway, though it could only identify them as Miss C and D and could not even say which position the footballer played in. Miss C, a nursery nurse, claimed that the footballer had seduced her with lies about love and promises of marriage. Miss D, a lap dancer and former air stewardess, claimed that he lied to her that he was single before revealing he was married in a text message. As the legal wrangles became more acrimonious, the People also claimed that the footballers' union, the Professional Footballers' Association, had helped the player to meet his legal costs. Gordon Taylor, chief execu tive of the PFA, said the players' union would continue to support the footballer, but he would not comment on claims that it had paid \u00a3100,000 towards the legal costs. Earlier this month Lord Woolf, the country's most senior judge, ruled that Mr Justice Jack was wrong to prevent the People publishing the interviews with the women. He said public figures were entitled to privacy, but had to recognise that their public position meant that their actions would be subjected to close scrutiny by the media. Blackburn Rovers are playing in Leicester today. Flitcroft, who has played for England schoolboys and England under-21s, is bound to face derision from opposition supporters when he runs out. But Mr Lewis, his lawyer, said: \"He will be getting on with playing football and will continue to try to keep his private life just that - private.\"",
