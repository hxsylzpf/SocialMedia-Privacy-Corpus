  "content": "On Friday morning my Twitter feed was filled with bad puns about Findus and its horsemeat burgers. A fair number, admittedly, at my encouragement; I'd apologise to the freezer chain, but a fetlock of good it would do them. Churchill said that \"a lie can be halfway around the world before the truth has got its boots on\", but nowadays it's the truth, or a shade of it, that whistles through the wires while its subject is still rubbing their eyes, to say nothing of finding boots. The effect is amplified by social networks and rolling news. Once a meme (even an untrue one) gets started on Twitter or Facebook, it becomes a snowball rolling downhill; you're pretty fortunate if you can divert it. Rolling TV and radio news, meanwhile, remind me of those charity coin collection games where you insert a coin and watch it circle around and around before it vanishes into a hole. You can spend a day watching rolling news and realise by the end that almost nothing beyond the initial event (Chris Huhne pleading guilty, say) has actually happened, right up the moment you turn it off. But watching the coin go around and around is entertaining, isn't it? It's a dramatic day in 24-hour news when something that was taken as gospel in the Today programme's 7am headlines has been refuted by the time Newsnight's music heralds Jeremy Paxman's concerned face. The problem for those in PR and communications is that once a topic takes flight, shifting public opinion is astonishingly hard. Journalists, and readers, like their stories like their ready meals: simply labelled, ready to reheat, easy to cook up, quick to consume. These days, a news titbit can leap off the pages to become a running joke and source of japery online, and won't shift until it's stopped being a trending topic. Even then, it will remain embedded in web pages' DNA, where search engines will slurp it up and re-serve it to anyone who happens to do the appropriate search. You don't have to think hard to think of a few, of variable accuracy: that the UK is immigrants' primary destination in Europe; Britain can't deal with a bit of snow; Apple's Maps are terrible; Google's social network Google+ is a ghost town. They become embedded in our virtual psyche. And you can scrub like Lady Macbeth (and watch the PR business try) without shifting belief one jot. As Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans put it on Twitter, \"Good luck all at the Findus PR dept. Findus lasagne alleged to contain 100% horsemeat! Jaap Stam [the burly ex-Manchester United defender] couldn't defend that one.\" But what if the ingredients of the stories are rubbish \u2013 or even worse, the recipe is simply outdated? It turns out to be pretty hard to clean up the supply chain. Take one of the more amusing memes of last year, that Samsung \u2013 having been ordered to pay $1.05bn in damages to Apple by a jury in a patent lawsuit \u2013 loaded trucks with nickels (five-cent pieces) and paid it that way. It wasn't true, but the idea that it was remains embedded in lots of searches. For both journalists and practitioners of PR, though, this combination of speed and penetration means that life becomes an incredibly difficult balance. Get it wrong as a journalist, and your error will be promulgated around the net, with millions of social networks lining up like Nelson Muntz in The Simpsons to chant \"Ha-ha!\". But the pressure to get the news \u2013 any version of it \u2013 out there becomes greater and greater as sites compete for eager clicks. Is there an answer? Hell, no. There's only reputation: as journalists, if we screw up too often, people won't trust us. For the PR field, recognise that one false step will dump you in \"the wrong type of snow\" \u2013 the brown sort \u2013 but that not doing anything will dump you in it too. Sorry, Findus; but you probably won't be the butt of jokes furlong.",
