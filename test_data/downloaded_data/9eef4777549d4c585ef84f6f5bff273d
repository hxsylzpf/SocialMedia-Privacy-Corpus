Information including the bank account numbers, phone numbers, mothers' maiden names and signatures of 1 million customers of American Express, NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland were reportedly found on the computer. The buyer, Andrew Chapman, an IT manager from Oxford, found the information on the computer's hard drive, according to a report in the Daily Mail. The computer had belonged to data processing company Mail Source, part of Graphic Data, a firm that holds financial information for organisations, and was originally used at the firm's archive centre in Shoeburyness, Essex. The machine had been removed from the company's secure storage facility in Essex and sold on the internet auction site. In a statement, Mail Source said it had no idea why the computer was sold on eBay, but added: \"Investigations are still ongoing to find out how this equipment was removed from one of Graphic Data's secure locations. \"We take customer privacy and data security very seriously. This incident is extremely regrettable and we're taking every possible step to retrieve the data and ensure this is an isolated incident.\" A spokesperson stressed that the sale had been an \"isolated incident\". \"We know which employee took the server and sold it, but we believe it was an honest mistake and it was not intentional to sell it without the server being cleared,\" she said. James Jones, a spokesperson for credit reference agency Experian, said people should not panic as the information had not fallen into criminal hands. \"This case is just a bit of a close shave, although [it is] hardly isolated,\" he said. \"Unless you've been particularly careless with your personal details the bank will always cover the cost of any fraudulent activity on your account.\" He added: \"Of course people still suffer potential damage to their credit records, which can be annoying not just in terms of the cost of phone calls or time spent sorting out the problem to the individual, but it may also hold up applications for credit like a mortgage, for example.\" After calls from the National Consumer Council, all three credit reference agencies - Experian, Equifax and CallCredit - joined forces this month to launch a service to help the victims of fraud repair their credit records. The service aims to reduce the trauma suffered by victims of fraud, so if a defrauded consumer now contacts one agency, it will automatically alert the other two firms. All three agencies will then work simultaneously to case-manage the restoration of the individual's credit file. The firms also aim to provide an on-going update of progress to victims on the case. Identity theft is one of the UK's fastest growing crimes, affecting more than 100,000 people every year. The Home Office estimated recently that identity fraudsters steal \u00a31.7bn annually. According to a YouGov poll in November 2007, 1 million UK employees admitted losing disks, drives or laptop computers containing confidential personal information.",
