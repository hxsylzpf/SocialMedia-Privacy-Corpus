  "content": "How can any bride and groom expect privacy at a wedding that is an inherently public event, declared James Price QC on behalf of Hello!. The judge trying this case appeared to accept this view, at least in relation to the ceremony itself, which allows a member of the public to cite reasons why the marriage should not go ahead. \"It would be absurd to make the wedding so secure as to exclude any possible objectors: it is by its very nature a public occasion,\" he said. Notwithstanding this indication Mr Justice Lindsay has found that Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta Jones and OK! are entitled to damages under the \"tort\" of confidence as well as under the Data Protection Act. Furthermore, he has granted an injunction that there will not be any further publication of the unauthorised photographs by Hello! or, for that matter, any other magazine or newspaper. This case is another in a line of decisions that started following the incorporation of the European convention on human rights, in particular article 8, the right of the individual to respect for his private and family life, his home and correspondence. These cases, which have tended to involve celebrities, have relied on the \"tort\" (legal wrong) of confidence, a legal duty that is greatly bolstered by article 8. So what is the duty of confidence? It is (as so many are) an ancient legal right that protects an individual or company from the disclosure or use of information that is not publicly known and that has been entrusted to the disseminator (loud mouth!) in circumstances imposing an obligation not to disclose that information without the authority of the individual or company. This economic, property-based right, before October 2000, was used, for example, to protect confidential information that an employee became aware of during the course of his employment. The incorporation into a book written by a former police officer of Myra Hindley's confessions to the Moors murders was confidential information, for instance. Fast forward to 2003 and a premiership footballer/celebrity has an extra-marital affair, that affair is conducted in private (hotel rooms etc), a duty of confidence will be owed by both parties to each other, not to disseminate facts about their relationship. Therefore, we have had a succession of what are known as \"gagging injunctions\", which have been obtained preventing newspapers from publishing kiss-and-tell stories in these circumstances. This is to be contrasted with the case of footballer Garry Flitcroft, whose relationship was not restricted to private places, similarly the case of Jamie Theakson, who unsuccessfully tried to prevent a story being published about his visits to a brothel. Mr Justice Lindsay, contrary to his earlier comment, decided the wedding of Douglas and Zeta Jones was private in character. He cited the elaborate steps taken to exclude the uninvited, to include only the invited, to preclude unauthorised photography, to control the authorised photography and to have the Douglases' intentions in that regard made clear to all those attending as imposing the duty of confidence. This included Rupert Thorpe, whose camera took the offending photographs. The judge, as he was bound to, considered the competing European convention right of freedom of expression and in arriving at the right balance applied the \"relevant privacy code\" - the press complaints commission code. That code states the use of long lenses to take pictures of people in private places without their consent is unacceptable, which he read as applying also to the covert use of short lenses in order to take pictures of people in private places. Although normally the Plaza Hotel in New York would undoubtedly be a public place, the massive security measures imposed, as well as the efforts Mr Thorpe (who was not an invitee to the wedding) went to, to effect entry, in the judge's view amounted to a breach of the PCC code which he decided Hello! either knew of, or closed its eyes to. In so doing, the judge gave more weight to the article 8 privacy entitlement than to freedom of expression. The other claim on which Douglas and Zeta Jones succeeded was the more technical Data Protection Act point, which imposes on anyone processing personal data [Hello!] a duty to comply with the data protection principles. These include processing the data in accordance with the data subjects' (Douglas' and Zeta Jones') rights. No consent to the processing (including publication) was even given in this case, nor was the processing justified as legitimate as the publication of the photographs in Hello! amounted to a prejudice to the rights and the legitimate interests of Douglas and Zeta Jones. Although the decision as to the amount of the damages to be paid by Hello! has yet to be decided (the hearing will take place later this year), the judge has made it clear that there will only be a nominal award for the breaches of the Data Protection Act. On the question of the amount of the likely award that Douglas and Zeta Jones are likely to receive for the breach of the duty of confidence significantly, the judge found they had both suffered real stress (which did not just include the now infamous \"feeding\" photograph) but the stress of wondering if one of the guests at their wedding had betrayed them. They also make a claim for the share they were due to receive for the lost syndication receipts. OK! is claiming an amount equivalent to the profits made by Hello! from the edition that included the offending photographs, which OK! says are in the region of \u00a31.75m. What is the impact of the decision in this case? This is not in any way a pyrrhic victory on the part of Zeta Jones, Douglas or OK!. This will be a case that will be relied on by future celebrities claiming a breach of duty of confidence in respect of any future kiss-and-tell story. This is also the end of the \"spoiler\" edition and, in that sense, you could say OK! has cut off its noise to spite its face. OK! was as much in the habit of spoiling rival exclusives as Hello!. Perhaps most significantly on the subject of privacy, Mr Justice Lindsay made it clear that, in this case, there was more than enough to impose the duty of confidence, he did not need to deal with whether there was an existing law of privacy. However, he pointed to the recent decision of the European court of human rights of Peck v United Kingdom as an example of circumstances where the law of confidence was not adequate to protect an individual right under article 8. Mr Justice Lindsay made it clear that if parliament does not step in and pass legislation that protects an individual that deserves such protection, then the courts will be obliged to. This is a very clear warning shot across the bows of the media - particularly the press - that if they misbehave the courts will act. \u00b7 Paul Gilbert is a media lawyer at Finers Stephens Innocent Associates",
