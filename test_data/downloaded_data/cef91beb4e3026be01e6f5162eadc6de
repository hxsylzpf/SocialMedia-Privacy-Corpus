  "content": "France saw record numbers take to the streets on Sunday to commemorate and celebrate the victims of last week's terror attacks. They were joined by dozens of world leaders in an unprecedented display of unity. But for Daniel Wickham, a 21-year-old government and history student at LSE, the politicians' presence didn't quite stack up. He began tweeting about the press freedom abuses and human rights violations that had been carried out on behalf of the governments that were being represented \u2013 and quickly noticed that his tweets were starting to attract some attention. He published tweets about 21 representatives and had, by the end of the day, been retweeted more than 18,000 times, including by a number of prominent figures. The Media Network spoke to Daniel yesterday about the response. So what inspired you to do this? I just thought the hypocrisy was so obvious. There were so many representatives there from countries with really awful human rights records, like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain. I'd already seen people tweet that the march was like a who's who of authoritarian leaders, and I just thought it was a real shame that the event, which is supposed to be for the victims of human rights violations, was being hijacked by human rights abusers. Did you expect such a phenomenal response? No, I was really pleasantly surprised. It's been quite overwhelming. My phone's been buzzing non-stop and I gained about 11,000 new followers in a day or something. I was also pleased because the response wasn't partisan. Everyone was saying \"good, you're going after everyone\", rather than getting defensive because I was criticising particular countries. I was happy to see people in the human rights community tweet about it, and it was also good to see a wide, proactive background responding. People from different regions, with different political views and so on. Can social media be used as a tool for debunking spin? Yeah definitely, social media can be effective if it's used in the right way. I find Twitter useful because you can find out what's going on in a part of the world before there's a media story about it, and then get your opinion out quickly. But at the same time, you need more than just a hashtag or some retweets to really make an impact. Is slacktivism an issue for our generation? Some people are overly cynical. There's definitely a role to be played by social media in activism. But then others go too far and call the Arab Spring a Facebook revolution, which is just a massive exaggeration. I think Twitter is useful for bringing attention to human rights issues, but the important work is done on the ground, not on social media. Anything else you want to add? While I was really critical of foreign governments there, I do think it's fantastic to see so many people coming out and showing solidarity with the victims. I still recognise that's a fantastic thing. The fact that millions of people turned up is far more important than the fact that hypocritical and authoritarian leaders were there. That's the main thing to take away from it in my opinion.
