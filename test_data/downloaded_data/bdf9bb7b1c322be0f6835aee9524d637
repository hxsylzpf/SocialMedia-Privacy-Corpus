  "content": "The Sun has apologised to Nicole Kidman and agreed to pay her libel damages and legal costs over false allegations that she had an adulterous affair with Jude Law. The allegations, which appeared in the Sun on March 5, caused the Hollywood actress \"considerable embarrassment and distress\", her solicitor, Keith Schilling, told Mr Justice Eady at the high court today. Mr Schilling said the Sun's story implied the Oscar-winning actress \"had an adulterous affair with Jude Law, who was at the time married with young children\". \"The article implied that the claimant had led Jude Law to cheat on his wife Sadie Frost, and by her behaviour caused the breakdown of their marriage,\" he added. The Sun's solicitor, Daniel Taylor, said that the newspaper, editor Rebekah Wade and journalist Victoria Newton - who were all named in the action - accepted the allegations were untrue and apologised \"for the distress and embarrassment this article has caused\". The article was illustrated by a photograph taken in a bar while the stars were filming in Transylvania. The newspaper has agreed to pay Kidman an undisclosed sum in damages as well as her legal costs. In July Kidman won \"substantial\" libel damages from the Daily Mail after it published similar allegations that she had had an affair with Law, her co-star on the film Cold Mountain. The Mail article appeared on March 6, the day after the Sun story. The Sunday Telegraph also repeated the allegations, but issued an apology to the star. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857",
