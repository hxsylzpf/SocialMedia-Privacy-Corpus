  "content": "Savvymum has mostly organised a meetup for Cif belief readers, to which some writers at least will come, on Saturday August 8th, in the Churchill pub, on Kensington Church Street, in London. The only thing she has omitted to fix is the time; naturally I feel it is my duty to turn up at opening time and drink steadily until everyone else arrives, but for those of a less professional disposition, it would be helpful if she were to make it clear when the festivities are to start.",
