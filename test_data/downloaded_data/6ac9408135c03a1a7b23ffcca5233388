  "content": "The Financial Times is launching a social networking service for top executives in the media and technology sectors, with membership costing as much as \u00a32,000 per year. FT Media and Technology Executive Membership Forum aims to enable senior executives to \"maintain contact with peers and luminaries operating within the digital, new media, mobile and telecoms sectors\". The new FT service is trying to marry the paper's events and conferences with a new social networking offering. Membership of the new forum includes free attendance at any one conference from the FT Global Conferences and Events series \u2013 plus 20% off subsequent events \u2013 access to an online networking tool, face-to-face members' networking events and a 12-month premium subscription to FT.com. The online networking element of the membership is described as a \"user-friendly, simple, efficient and secure system\" that will enable members to \"search for and make unlimited private contact with fellow members \u2013 including leading industry figures such as conference speakers and editorial figures from the FT\". This forum is the first in a series the FT plans to launch, with similar offerings planned for the luxury goods and property sectors later this year. \"Busy executives in the media and technology industries are increasingly networking, communicating and connecting online and the launch ... provides a highly-targeted network where executives from these fast-moving industries can connect and share their knowledge,\" said Jayne van Hoen, the global conference director at the FT. According to the FT website, the price for a \"standard\" 12-month subscription to the FT Media &amp; Technology Executive Membership Forum costs \u00a31,700 before VAT. However, discounts are available for corporate registrations and for individuals registering for more than one forum. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
