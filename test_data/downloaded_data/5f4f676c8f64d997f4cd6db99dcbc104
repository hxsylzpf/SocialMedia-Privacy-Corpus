  "content": "Adobe is warning of a \"criticai\" vulnerability in its Flash Player, Adobe Reader and Acrobat software, installed on almost all PCs, which it says is already being exploited by hackers and which \"could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system\". All platforms - Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris - are vulnerable, says Adobe. The affected versions are: Adobe Flash Player 10.0.45.2, 9.0.262, and earlier 10.0.x and 9.0.x versions for Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Solaris; Adobe Reader and Acrobat 9.3.2 and earlier 9.x versions for Windows, Macintosh and UNIX. Windows users who want to continue to read PDFs can choose from a variety linked to on Wikipedia, or see Jack's recommendations from January - though not Adobe itself, obviously. Apple users may wish to avoid using Adobe Reader or Acrobat by using OS X's built-in Preview app, which is anyway a lot less hassle than Adobe Reader, especially on OS X. There's no schedule yet for a fix, but some people are deciding that the best way to avoid the risk is to download the Flash Player 10.1 Release Candidate - and Adobe says that it \"does not appear to be vulnerable\". It adds that \"Adobe Reader and Acrobat 8.x are confirmed not vulnerable.\" But the vulnerability will still persist - and seems to lie in the authplay.dll file: Adobe recommends that \"Deleting, renaming, or removing access to the authplay.dll file that ships with Adobe Reader and Acrobat 9.x mitigates the threat for those products, but users will experience a non-exploitable crash or error message when opening a PDF file that contains SWF [Flash] content. The authplay.dll that ships with Adobe Reader and Acrobat 9.x for Windows is typically located at C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Reader 9.0\\Reader\\authplay.dll for Adobe Reader or C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Acrobat 9.0\\Acrobat\\authplay.dll for Acrobat.\" As with all such security warnings, there is a lot of over-reaction, and we've already seen one super-over-excited email which suggests that the flaw will let hackers take over your computer, siphon your bank account, kick the cat, cancel your house insurance and leave a rude message on your mother-in-law's answering machine. That's not quite the case, but until Adobe has a fix, it's best to be wary.",
