  "content": "Rape \"jokes\", lewd propositions and sexual name-calling are among the worst examples of Hollywood sexism highlighted in a new blog aimed at encouraging female film and television workers to anonymously post about their working experiences. The Tumblr blog, titled \"Shit People Say to Women Directors\", is designed as a platform \"to expose some of the absurd barriers women face in the entertainment business\", according to its creators. Female film-makers continue to struggle in Hollywood, with only 23% of directing positions and 26% of key behind-the-scenes roles filled by women, according to a study sponsored by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University last year. A separate earlier study of the top 100 domestic US grossing films in 2013 found that women comprised just 15% of protagonists, 29% of major characters and 30% of speaking characters \u2013 a degree of marginalisation largely unchanged since the 1940s. Comments on the Tumblr blog go some way to explaining why women feel pushed to one side in Hollywood. \"A rigger was telling a bunch of other technicians a story and when he saw me he said: 'Oops, I shouldn't swear when there's a cunt in the room,'\" posted one respondent. Another described asking her male producer about their next project at work drinks. His response: \"I think we should fuck\". Another director described overhearing a comment about her by a producer to another crew member. \"We need to get her boyfriend here for the weekend,\" she recalls hearing. \"She needs to get fucked.\" One female film-maker described being asked by a talent agent: \"How did you get so far so fast, besides the fact that you give good head?\" A writer's assistant described the punchline to an ongoing \"in joke\" referring to her between a male TV boss and a newly arrived male PA who kept making mistakes: \"That's bad, but not bad enough for you to rape her yet.\" The blog's founders told Mashable they launched it as \"kind of a crisis intervention.\" \"Our hope was for women to let off a little steam while shining a light on a pervasive problem,\" they said in a statement. \"We figured at first we would just source stories from all of the women we are connected to in the business. What we did not anticipate, however, was the overwhelming amount of submissions we got from the public.\" The creators say they are remaining anonymous because \"the fear of retaliation is severe,\" adding: \"Women have been cowed into silence over these issues for fear of being further shut out, marginalised and denied networking opportunities after being labeled 'whistleblowers' or 'difficult'.\" Two-time best actress Oscar-winner Jane Fonda said in January that Hollywood studios which maintain gender-biased policies deserved to be publicly shamed. \"The studios are run by men and they have the bottom line to meet and they give jobs to people like them,\" she said at the Women at Sundance brunch. \"It's a matter of gender, not that we don't have the experience. \"We have to shame the studios for being so gender-biased. We have to prove we can be commercial.\"",
