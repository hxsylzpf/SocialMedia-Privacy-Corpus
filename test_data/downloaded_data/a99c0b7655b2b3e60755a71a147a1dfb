After it emerged that Google had also been targeted along with Facebook and Twitter, speculation began to swirl . Facebook security chief Max Kelly told CNet that it was a strike targeted at a single user, pro-Georgian blogger Cyxymu, while Bill Woodcock of Packet Clearing House told the Register that it was a spam-based attack.

As a tribute to teen comedy writer/director John Hughes - a man who had a remarkable affect on many people of my generation (I watched Pretty in Pink just last weekend) - I'm going point you to a couple of online tributes: Pitchfork has collected a lot of classic music moments; while this slightly odd video celebrating his producer of the year award in 1991 features plenty of famous faces. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
