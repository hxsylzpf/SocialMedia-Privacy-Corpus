  "content": "The Mail on Sunday will be forced to return Prince Charles' diaries after the House of Lords today rejected the paper's request for leave to appeal the case. Today's House of Lords decision means that a December court of appeal ruling in favour of the prince stands. In December, the court of appeal ruled that Prince Charles had an overwhelming case that the Sunday newspaper had infringed his copyright and committed a breach of confidence in publishing extracts from one of his journals about the 1997 handover of Hong Kong, in which he described Chinese leaders as \"appalling old waxworks\". The court of appeal also rejected the Mail on Sunday's attempt to have the matter sent to trial. Today's House of Lords ruling means that the prince could pursue the paper for damages, as one of his lawyers previously indicated, because he suspected it had obtained the diaries illegally. The paper has in its possession seven other diaries, but has not published extracts from them. In May, the Mail on Sunday gave up its fight to win a legal right to publish extracts from the diaries, but sought leave to appeal to the House of Lords on the grounds of public interest. The MoS retained its copies of the journals until the House of Lords reached its decision. The Mail on Sunday had not commented at the time of publication. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
