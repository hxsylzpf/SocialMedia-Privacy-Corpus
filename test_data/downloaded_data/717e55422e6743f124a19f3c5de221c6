  "content": "\u2022 What's going on with the investigation into Aurora, the hacking attack that struck Google and other before Christmas? Well, following a report in the New York Times on Friday that two Chinese schools were linked to the attacks, the state news agency has reported denials from them both. But now the Financial Times is reporting that US investigators have found out who wrote the exploit (paywalled link) and that his work was picked up by the Chinese government. This one keeps on developing. \u2022 Remember Acta, that notoriously secret international governmental agreement that could change copyright laws around the world? Well, BoingBoing notes that somebody has uploaded a PDF claiming to be an early draft of the proposals. Is it real? Possibly... the trouble is that since the whole process is taking place behind closed doors, it's impossible to know what's happening. \u2022 Those who are fans of Joel Spolsky's blog, may soon be left without his regular musings on the programming business, after he said he was considering retiring it. Marco Arment has some worthwhile comments on why this isn't a good thing - but perhaps inevitable.
