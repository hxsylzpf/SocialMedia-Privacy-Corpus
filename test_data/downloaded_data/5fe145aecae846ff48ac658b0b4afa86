Nasr, who joined Twitter in 2012 initially running its sales operation, is currently UK sales director of the social media company. He replaces Bruce Daisley, who was named vice-president of direct sales for Europe earlier this year. \"Over the last few months we've been taking a look at the UK office and business,\" said Adam Bain, Twitter's chief operating officer, said in an internal note to staff. \"It's such an important site for the Twitter business \u2013 for advertising, engineering, media and more. We wanted to ensure that we appointed someone who was respected in the market, with a breadth of vision beyond their own area of specialism, and someone who was focused on building a special culture for us.\" At Google, Nasr was responsible for key agency relationships for YouTube and display advertising. \"In just a few years Twitter's UK office has gone from strength to strength,\" said Nasr. \"From small communities to big brands, Twitter's a part of everyday life in the UK and I'm thrilled to be taking the reins as we prepare for the next chapter.\" Twitter opened a UK office in 2011 and employs about 200 people.",
