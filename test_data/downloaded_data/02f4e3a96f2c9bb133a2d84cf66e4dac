The three security chiefs who appeared before parliament's intelligence and security committee today did not break into sweat. But the session \u2013 the first to be televised \u2013 was by no stretch of the imagination a tight corner. There was no Bond villain, no white cat, no steel-rimmed bowler hats \u2013 just a gentle 90 minutes of polite questioning in which little was demanded or gleaned. The afternoon came briefly to life only when the spies united to identify the real bad guys: the media. The fact that the intelligence chiefs are now required to come out in public and speak about what they do is obviously a step in the right direction. And it is only fair to acknowledge that the ISC has more powers and resources than once it had. But, as a genuine exercise in transparency, the event seemed stilted, restricted, sometimes coded and more than a little stage-managed. There were many reassurances offered: the agencies are excellent value for money; they operate within the law; they are successfully adapting to changing technologies; and they reject any accusations of intelligence failures or improper behaviour. No MP or peer seriously tested any of these assertions. Nor \u2013 in public at least \u2013 was it possible to query the eye-catching claim that terrorists were \"rubbing their hands in glee\" at the Snowden allegations. In private, some members of the committee voice concern about the scope and interpretation of laws under which the services operate and their limited knowledge of specific programmes which have recently made front-page news around the world. But these worries were, at best, hinted at. An American or European visitor would have been most struck by what the committee did not ask: it barely touched on the substantive issues raised by the Snowden documents. It skated over any serious questioning about the complex issues to do with mass surveillance, civil liberties or privacy. There were no questions about GCHQ's reported involvement in agencies helping themselves to traffic between Google data servers. There was nothing on the bugging of world leaders who might be considered allies, not enemies. Nothing on the reliance on corporate partners \u2013 \"well beyond\" what they are legally required to do. And nothing on the issue raised by Sir Tim Berners-Lee \u2013 the \"appalling and foolish\" weakening of internet encryption with potentially terrible consequences for individuals and businesses. These matters have been widely discussed in this country, including in such subversive journals as the FT and the Economist. Indeed, they have been debated in every serious newspaper and legislature in the world. They will become manifest in reformed laws, treaties and alliances. But there was little suggestion today that much of this was of true concern. Instead there was a kick at the \"global media\". Let us be clear. The loss of Snowden's material was plainly damaging for western intelligence. The disaster was that the US agencies have, for the second time in three years, proved incapable of keeping enormous secret databases secure. After WikiLeaks it is astonishing that 850,000 people worldwide were able to peer into the heart of secret operations in Cheltenham. No NSA official has apologised or resigned for this devastating failure and there were only the mildest questions today as to why GCHQ went along with these bizarre arrangements. The intelligence agencies were saved from true catastrophe by only one thing: the fact that Snowden didn't dump the material on to the web, but handed it instead to journalists. Together with the New York Times and Washington Post, we have worked carefully and responsibly (in consultation with governments and agencies) to disclose a small proportion of what he leaked. Some would like newspapers gagged or prosecuted. Be careful what you wish for. Kick newspapers by all means, but, without them, be prepared for something much worse.",
