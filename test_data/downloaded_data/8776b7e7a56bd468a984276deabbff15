  "content": "\u2022 There's been plenty of talk in recent years about YouTube - more specifically whether it makes money, deals with movie studios and potential entry into video rentals. That last idea may be on ice, after figures that suggest that the company made little more than $10,000 during a short experiment in movie rentals. Not exactly chump change (if you can spare $10k, let me know) but certainly a long way from where Google would have wanted it. \u2022 Facebook has been doing more work with the open source community of late, but its latest effort sounds pretty interesting: HipHop, a PHP compiler that it says reduces CPU load by an average of 50% (at least for Facebook itself). Actually, it's not really a compiler, but a system that converts PHP into C++ and then compiles it... will it make a real difference to web developers? Or will it only really make a difference to Facebook-style operations? \u2022 And it's time for another episode of our Tech Weekly - and apologies to anyone who is iPadded out, but we couldn't ignore the Apple - so we drag along Nick Carr to help us ponder what it all means. We also hear from a top-ranking literary agent on Amazon's tussle with Macmillan. Thirty-three minutes of aural excitement at the click of a button.
