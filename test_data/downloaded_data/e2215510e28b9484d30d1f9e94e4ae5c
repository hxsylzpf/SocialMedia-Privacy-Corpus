  "content": "There was a time, before the Facebook reign truly began, when specialist networks seemed to be the direction in which social networks were headed. Although a handful of big-name sites now dominate the space, there are still opportunities, now the marker has matured a little, for a well-executed niche network to build a strong business. That's exactly what ResearchGATE has done for the scientific research community by building a site that crowdsources research. With an impressive set of experienced investors, the Berlin and Massachusetts-based site is announcing its first major funding round today. Medical doctor and PhD Ijad Madisch founded the site two years ago to build a community around scientific research but also to capture what he describes as \"research redundancy\". \"People only report positive results, whereas research is really often based on what didn't work,\" he said. ResearchGATE has 2,600 groups covering various projects and lab methods, with those communities replacing what had traditionally been published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at seminars. It's about presenting work in progress and sharing practical research tips. Madisch said scientists and researchers from 196 countries and principalities are contributing to the site, with users in the US, UK, Germany and India making up the bulk of the 500,000 registered users. Madisch said the undisclosed amount of funding will be used to expand the staff team in Berlin and accelerate growth of the company and audience base. The round was led by Benchmark, with Accel and various UK superangels including Bebo founder Michael Birch, Accel's Simon Levene and Rolf Christof Dienst of Wellington. Scout24 founder Joachim Schoss, idealo.com co-founder Martin Sinner, Sedo.com co-founder Ulrich Essmann and MyVideo.de found Christian Vollmann have all joined the funding round. It's like buses. Benchmark's Matt Cohler, with Leven and Schoss, join the board. Is this is threat to UK research startup Mendeley? Madisch doesn't think so. \"I believe in more diverse apps. Mendeley is more about literature - we cover literature but also collaboration, events, jobs... I want to be very diversified because everyone needs something different.\" Different, but also with every chance of making a real difference. This is where the promise of crowdsourcing and collaboration could really be fulfilled.",
