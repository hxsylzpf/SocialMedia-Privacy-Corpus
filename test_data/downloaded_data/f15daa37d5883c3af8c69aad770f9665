Still, no problem in deciding the news agenda as long as someone could get Mail Online, eh? \u2712Now Richard Desmond owns Channel Five as well as OK!, \"synergy\" between his interests is expected, such as a focus on celebrities in Five News. But the latest issue of his celeb weekly suggests OK!-isation could require Natasha Kaplinsky to radically alter her interviewing technique. One obsessive question is mandatory, whether phrased as \"how do you feel about Botox?\" (to Tess Daly), \"what's your take on plastic surgery?\" (Julia Roberts), \"You've had Botox \u2013 did you get his-and-hers pre-marriage procedures?\" (Michelle Heaton), \"would you ever have plastic surgery? (Emma Bunton) or the politely indirect \"more and more people are looking to procedures such as Botox for that 'youthful' appearance ... \" (Lulu). Scope to transform the political interview, as Kirsty Young did in '97, is clearly there: \"How do you feel, Mr Cameron ...\" \u2712It is possible to be too impatient for the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International TV Festival to arrive: the latest issue of Broadcast, which hit the streets on Thursday, bears the date 28 August 2010, bang in the middle of the festival. \u2712AA Gill's Sunday Times review of BBC4's Britain by Bike was so obnoxious (calling its presenter Clare Balding a \"dyke on a bike\" with a \"muscular backside\" ) that it provoked Balding into joining Twitter last week; there she fumed that Gill was a \"twat\" and a \"bully\", while receiving supportive tweets from, among others, Kirstie Allsopp, Caitlin Moran and Rebecca Front. So her roughing-up by Gill, though still understandably resented, happily had a positive outcome: \"This is like walking into a party where all the fun people are\", the sports anchor enthused, telling Emma Freud that \"anger made me join but now I feel Twitter joy\". \u2712There may be an upside to the BBC's latest embarrassment over next year's exodus to Salford, caused by MediaGuardian's revelation that Peter Salmon (director, BBC North) will initially only rent a place in the city he once enthused about as \"the promised land\", and the subsequent disclosure that Adrian van Klaveren (controller, 5 Live) will also be renting. The good news is talk of a BBC sitcom called WeekEnders which would depict their bachelor-like northern weekdays as vibrant (big floodlit games at Old Trafford and the City of Manchester stadium, MEN Arena gigs, clubbing, etc) and their southern weekends en famille as suburban and stultifying. Ralf Little must be in contention to play the boyish Salmon, Alun Armstrong is ideal for Van Klaveren, and Sarah Lancashire, aka Mrs Salmon, could be lined up as a more dragon-like version of herself; there are opportunities for supporting roles for fellow-rascals Alan Yentob (Antony Sher), often bumped into en route to Glasgow for BBC1's Imagine, and Ed Stourton (Simon Russell-Beale), ditto en route to Manchester for Radio 4's Sunday.",
