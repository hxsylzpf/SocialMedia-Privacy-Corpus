  "content": "After feeding the corgis on left-over marmalade toast and scanning the columns of the Racing Post, it is a reasonable bet that the Queen choked on her Earl Grey at the sight of the Daily Mirror yesterday morning. The home secretary, David Blunkett, may have had a similar reaction if the first 15 pages of the newspaper - detailing lapses in palace security, the royal breakfast routine and what Prince Andrew says to his footman - were read out to him. The fact that a journalist could get a job as a servant inside Buckingham Palace on the basis of a forged reference is embarrassing enough, but it was the timing of the revelation that made it politically explosive. Just down the corridor in the Belgian suite George Bush and his wife, Laura, were waking up on the first day of their long-scheduled state visit. Two members of the US secret service and two British officers stood guard outside their door, the last line of defence in one of the most comprehensive peacetime security operations mounted in London. If the Queen and the president met after breakfast, perhaps the leader of the most powerful nation on earth had the decency not to mention the breach of vetting procedures or the fact that a newspaper reporter, Ryan Parry, had put out the chocolate mints in his suite the night before and wandered around unchecked. The American embassy yesterday declined to comment on security lapses at the palace. \"Had I been a terrorist intent on assassinating the Queen or American president George Bush, I could have done so with absolute ease,\" Parry wrote in the Daily Mirror after quitting his job as a footman on Tuesday night. \"Indeed, I would have been serving breakfast to key members of his government, including national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and US secretary of state Colin Powell. Such is the shocking incompetence at the heart of the biggest security operation ever in Britain.\" The expose forced Mr Blunkett to make an emergency statement to the Commons in which he insisted vetting procedures on Parry had been carried out \"robustly and correctly\". The Home Office's security and criminal records checks had been successful, he explained, but he conceded that employment checks \"proved insufficient in this case\". The \"system as a whole needs to be reviewed urgently\", the home secretary agreed. \"The prime minister, with the support of the royal household, is therefore asking the Security Commission, which is an independent body responsible for overseeing breaches of security, to conduct a thorough review,\" Mr Blunkett said. \"I would expect this to cover all aspects of the process of checking those who form part of the royal household.\" Earlier the home secretary sought to play down the significance of the breach. \"While it is a matter of great concern to us, this person did not represent a risk to the president or the Queen,\" he maintained. The Security Commission, established in 1964, is part of the Cabinet Office and has met only three times in the last 17 years - in 1986, 1995 and 2000. Its most recent report in February 2000 examined the circumstances of a leak to the Sun in 1998 concerning an alleged Iraqi anthrax threat. Scotland Yard and the security services, as well as Buckingham Palace, confirmed yesterday they had launched separate investigations into the affair. A palace spokeswoman said: \"We are conducting a full investigation into how the Mirror reporter came to be employed at Buckingham Palace.\" In August Parry responded to a job advertisement on a recruitment page of the palace's official website. On his CV he excluded details of his journalistic career and included one fake reference and one real one, according to the Daily Mirror. The only phone call made by palace staff to check the details was to a pub in Anglesey, the paper alleged, where Parry once worked behind the bar. A regular said he knew him. The shadow home secretary, David Davis, added his voice to the criticisms. \"This is clearly a grave and worrying breach of security at a very important time,\" he said. \"The potential consequences are obviously very serious. Important lessons should have been learnt after the security breach in Windsor Castle earlier this year.\" The furore over that affair - when the \"comedy terrorist\" Aaron Barschak, dressed as Osama bin Laden, gatecrashed Prince William's 21st birthday party in June - has barely died away. Last week the Guardian highlighted concerns among the police that Buckingham Palace was a potential weak link in the state visit, reporting that \"officers [are] concentrating much of their efforts on making sure the palace cannot be breached\". A simple search on Google, an internet research tool, shows how cursory the palace's checks were. The 10th result after typing \"Ryan Parry\" into the search field reads: \"Daily Mirror reporter Ryan Parry ... has spoken out about his investigation that exposed security lapses during the Wimbledon tennis championships.\" That story also involved him going undercover to pose as a security guard. Most of the details revealed by Parry after two months' employment were more embarrassing than politically compromising. The question of whether there had been any breach of duty of confidentiality and whether legal action might follow was being urgently investigated by palace officials last night. As well as the Queen's fondness for feeding her corgis at breakfast time, it emerged that Prince Philip's radio is on the breakfast table in the same place every morning opposite the Tupperware containers full of cornflakes and porridge oats. President Bush, the Daily Mirror reported, had been due to get up at 5.30am yesterday, a timing set out in a detailed itinerary handed to palace staff before his arrival. Parry, who claimed he was not searched during his period at the palace, said there had been an earlier security alert when a bulky letter addressed to the president arrived. It contained tea bags. Parry's ceremonial duties included riding, in his scarlet footman's uniform, on open carriages with visiting dignitaries. The palace, he was told, always put two footmen on the door when a Conservative prime minister made the fortnightly visit; none is supposedly on hand for Tony Blair in case the sight of liveried staff upset \"the socialists\". Princess Anne, the Mirror reported, likes \"a very black banana and ripe Kiwi fruit\". The Countess of Wessex, who has just given birth to her first child, is said to be the most popular among palace staff. As for Prince Andrew, according to Parry, he has been known to greet footmen who pull back the curtains in the morning with the words \"fuck off\".",
