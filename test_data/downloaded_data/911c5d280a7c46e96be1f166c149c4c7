  "content": "When Now That Was 2016 airs on BBC2 in 2034, someone of great cultural importance \u2013 a member of Little Mix, or Nick Grimshaw perhaps \u2013 will mumble into the camera, \"Well, everyone started to moan a lot back then; everything was 'problematic'. Wearing Native American war bonnets to music festivals stopped; calling our dads 'derp face' was out; that kind of thing.\" The millennial tranche of the liberal left wing demands the height of political correctness and social fairness from the films, TV, books, politicians and celebrities that have been foisted upon us by those older gens. Friends and family don't escape our policing, either. Random people on public transport get it. The cat. Us older millennials \u2013 cult film T-shirt and hoodie wearers; those who remember late-80s WWF and The A-Team without any snorting sarcasm \u2013 we're whiners, and very, very loud about it. We want the best of everything and everyone around us. Even those who make a concerted effort to shut out and ignore yells for social change can't block the questioning of Generation Y, not if they're near anything that can spew out the angry and disappointed Twitter feed that amplifies our bad feeling until it is soothed. Careful apology or change works \u2013 we don't demand blood. Why doesn't Michael B Jordan have an Oscar nom (#oscarssowhite)? Where's our Rey Star Wars merch (#wheresrey)? Who's still booking Jim Davidson for gigs (#jesustakethewheel)? The \"why?\" echo chamber is a remarkable weapon; anyone who's wanted to put their own face in a blender after hanging out with a toddler in the middle of their \"why?\" phase knows that. There are rules held sacrosanct around the use of language and of power dynamics; rape culture, gendered language, stereotyping. Awareness of privilege is encouraged, and ignorance of it is scoffed at. Everything can be worthy of scorn: \"Aren't there bigger things in the world to worry about?\" is not a valid position, not for us. Straight-identifying and cisgender Matt Damon commenting on the experiences of marginalised gay actors in Hollywood did not go unchallenged or unsnarked at. Murmurs of assault surround a childhood hero or cultural icon \u2013 no conviction yet; no matter. The digital bitchery gets retweeted and shared until shows are cancelled, and rumours are investigated. The millennial urge for justice and awareness has to be sated; less than that isn't to be accepted. And less isn't to be tolerated of ourselves, either: \"What do I think about this, and how can I phrase that?\" being a frequent \u2013 necessary \u2013 torment to live and work with. If that restriction sounds harmful or Orwellian, it's not, nor are the carefully filtered results dishonest. Thought policing, Newspeak? Bullshit. Language run through a PC filter can reveal just as much about a person as stream-of-consciousness chat can \u2013 in fact, it's quicker. Use of the word \"kyriarchy\" means you're mindful of difference, or pretentious (both OK). \"Feminist\"? Meh. \"Intersectional feminist\"? Better. The other way round, the use of the word \"gay\" as a pejorative is an efficient way to tell me you're an arsehole. White people who refer to anyone who isn't white with race-related qualifiers during every anecdote (\"this black guy\" versus \"this guy\") is also a possible arsehole. \"I watch Game of Thrones\" without a customary \"but all the scenes of sexual assault make me uncomfortable\". Why? Just why? Someone once said: \"The difficult part in an argument is not to defend one's opinion, but rather to know it.\" You know who? Andr\u00e9 Maurois. How do I know that? Some other uptight and demanding millennial out there tweeted it. \"Why?\" isn't just an exasperated question for others; we ask it of ourselves most often of all. Always difficult to answer, but it's worth it. That questioning search for improvement is a very millennial trait. And that's something for future Little Mix or Nick Grimshaw to be proud of.",
