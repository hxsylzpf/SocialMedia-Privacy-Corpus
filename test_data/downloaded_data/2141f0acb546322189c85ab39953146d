A survey revealed on Friday that Google's 26,000 employees earn a median salary of $141,000 (\u00a386,800) a year, compared to the UK private sector average of \u00a321,500. Google, which gives all of its staff free gourmet meals, massages and numerous other perks not found in most offices, pays its staff 23% more than workers are paid for similar roles at rival technology companies, according to the PayScale survey. In January Google gave all its employees a $1,000 tax-free bonus and a 10% pay rise to stop staff defecting to rivals, such as Facebook. The report also found that Facebook has the youngest staff in the technology sector, with an average age of 26 \u2013 a year younger than chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. \"We really don't believe that you have to have a lot of experience to make a big difference,\" Zuckerberg says in a video on the company's careers website. \"Look at me, right? I started this from college.\" Al Lee, director of quantitative analysis at PayScale, said: \"Not only do many of the large tech companies pay their typical employees well into the six figures \u2013 not surprising given the large number of well-paid engineers on staff \u2013 they also pay a premium of as much as 23% above typical pay for the same kind of employees working at 'normal' companies.\"",
