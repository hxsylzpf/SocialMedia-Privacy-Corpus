  "content": "Last-minute hotel deals could become easier to find from tomorrow, with the launch of Inoqo (inoqo.com), a Twitter-based hotel booking engine that will publish special deals for check-in within 48 hours. Travellers can log on and choose the city they are in to see a list of the latest deals, or register their interest so they receive an alert when a new offer is released. From the hoteliers' point of view, the service will let them seek out customers to fill empty rooms, albeit at knock-down prices. The new service is part of a growing trend towards travel companies using Twitter, which lets users communicate using short messages of up to 140 characters. Travelodge recently became the first budget hotel chain on Twitter (twitter.com/travelodgeuk), and Marriott and Mr and Mrs Smith are also using the platform. \"Twitter is such a powerful medium,\" says Bretton Putter, founder of Inoqo. \"I think an increasing number of hotel companies are looking for ways to commercialise Twitter in the way we've done.\" For now, Inoqo remains tiny in comparison to sites such as Laterooms.com, with just 45 hotels and some quite underwhelming offers. However it predicts rapid growth and promises thousands of hotels across hundreds of cities by September 2010. The benefit of using Twitter is that the offers are updated in real time , which should mean you are less likely to find them sold out by the time you try to book. \"The challenge is that currently most people will go to search engines or comparison websites before Twitter,\" says Matt Ilston, director of Mr Zen, which builds travel sites. \"But it is relatively easy to pump out late deals in this way and I think tour operators will increasingly use Twitter for offering last-minute availability.\"",
