  "content": "Hear that noise in the background that you can't quite make out? That's the sound of Gray Collins tweeting away as he spends 60 hours on Twitter to raise money for the National Autistic Society. That's 60 hours. Non-stop. On Twitter. Surely too much even for Stephen Fry to handle in one sitting. His \"tweetathon\" \u2013 what else? \u2013 began at midday today and he will tweet at least once every 10 minutes for 60 hours until midnight on Wednesday 13 October. Go on, send him a tweet @diaryofaledger and bung him a retweet. You can also donate here. He has even set up a live stream so you can check out his home furnishings at the same time.",
