  "content": "The concept of Sky News's first ever Twitter correspondent was always a slightly tough one to grasp. Wouldn't it drive you ever so slightly crazy to do nothing but trawl through Twitter all day, every day? Now Sky's Ruth Barnett has swapped her short-lived Twitter beat for a new role working with the broadcaster's Westminster political team as an online producer. Monkey asked Sky News if they would be appointing their second ever Twitter correspondent, but they haven't got back to us yet. Maybe they could tweet us. So is there a Twitter job going, Ruth is asked on (inevitably) Twitter. \"I think it's more a case of there being dozens of us engaging with it now, not just one!\" she replies. Dozens, eh? Never let it be said it was a faddish appointment. Oh no.",
