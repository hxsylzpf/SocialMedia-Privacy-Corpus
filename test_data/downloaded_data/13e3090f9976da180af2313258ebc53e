  "content": "John Travolta has apologised for his already-legendary Oscar-night fluff when he mispronounced the name of Frozen star Idina Menzel as he introduced her performance of Let It Go, the song that would go on to win the Oscar for best song. According to Deadline, Travolta commented: \"I've been beating myself up all day \u2026 then I thought \u2026 what would Idina Menzel say? She'd say: 'Let it go, let it go!'\" Travolta managed to completely mess up Menzel's name, calling her Adela Dazeem, and became one of the viral hits of the night. Not only was an @adeladazeem Twitter account swiftly set up, with more than 20,000 followers at the time of writing, but Slate magazine has also created a widget to \"Travoltify\" anyone's name, asserting: \"You're no one until you've had your name mangled by a confused, squinting John Travolta.\" Menzel, who voiced the character of Elsa in Frozen, as well as singing Let It Go, has not yet commented on the blunder.",
