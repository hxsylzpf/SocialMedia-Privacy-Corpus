  "content": "As a professional caricaturist, Sam Klemke has lived a strange and interesting life, earning his crust touring fairs and markets across the United States. He has accumulated many stories over the years and met many people, but his day job isn't the focus of Sam Klemke's Time Machine, a documentary by the Adelaide-based director Matthew Bate. Klemke, 58, has compulsively filmed himself for more than four decades. In 1977, then a pimply 19-year-old with braces, he started recording news bulletin-inspired direct-to-camera monologues he called \"annual personal status updates\". The intention was to reflect on the previous year and set goals for the next one. Over time, updates became more regular and the role of the camera morphed from a diary to a confession booth, capturing revealing reflections from an often anguished subject. Bate's documentary draws parallels to current online trends and the man at the heart of it has been described in many ways, from \"the original selfie guy\" to the inventor of the self-confessional video. \"I think the difference between me and the young kids who are talking on their selfies is most of them are taking their pictures going, 'I'm so happy, aren't things great, I'm with my friends,' \" says Klemke. The illustriously bearded, scruffy-looking, braces-clad DIY film-maker is beaming in, true to form, via Skype from his Denver home. \"They are very cognisant of the fact they are talking to somebody in particular, talking to their friends on social media,\" he says. \"People who are going to comment on that footage. I was talking to posterity but I was really talking to myself.\" The internet eventually gave Klemke potential for something he had never contemplated: an audience. In 2011, after uploading a reverse time-lapse compiling some of his lighter moments, the video went viral and Bate came knocking. Klemke nervously agreed to hand over his lifetime supply of footage Sam Klemke's Time Machine, which premiered at Sundance 2015 and has been released digitally on demand, is a warts-and-all biopic quite unlike any other, fascinating as a time capsule but also exhaustively personal. Klemke says the decision to surrender ownership of his life's work, if you can call it that, wasn't easy: \"I would sometimes wake up in the middle of the night thinking: 'Oh my god, what have I done?' There's this feeling in some ways you want it to be a failure so that it doesn't change your life too much.\" To say Klemke bares all in his many videos puts it lightly. The loquacious American opens up about many things, including his traumatic ongoing battle with his weight, his romantic relationships, various kinds of addiction (including food and prostitution) and the generally angst-ridden state of his professional and personal life. He rationalises his long tradition of blabbering endlessly to nobody in particular as a by-product of an on-the-road existence often devoid of friends and family. \"I've spent a lot of my time alone, as you might have been able to tell by the film. Suddenly it'd be late at night, in my van sleeping or in my hotel, and I just felt like conversing with someone,\" he says. \"I'd have had all these little, short, five-minute relationships with people throughout the day. I really wanted a full-on conversation and, uh oh, look who it is: my camera. I didn't really think of it as confession, at least consciously. I think it was just sharing.\" A pause. \"In my case posterity was a very old friend. Posterity will always listen.\" Klemke has always been fascinated with ageing. As a child he loved to explore photo albums and observe differences in physical appearances over time. He was fascinated he could watch a movie with John Wayne or Cary Grant as a young person, then watch another movie with the same star as a much older person. \"I wanted a record like that of my life. That's what really was the impetus for me,\" he says. \"I knew that my youth was fleeting. As a young person I was different to most kids because I was very aware of how fast life was going.\" This desire for then-and-now comparisons helps explain why Klemke chronicled, in head-turning and literally naked detail (imagine a big man scarfing pizza and nachos in his bedroom), the evolution of his bulging waistline. It is compelling to see a trim and terrific Klemke appear in the 1990s, rejuvenated about life, only to relapse. Having been exposed to so many of his anxieties, divulged in such full-blown and honest ways, the audiences roots for our kind-of hero to triumph. But his victory feels painfully short-lived. It also helps explain why, when he was 17, Klemke thought filming himself walking around naked in his parents' lounge room with an erection was \"just a natural thing to do\". And why, two decades and many kilograms later, we watch him re-create that scene. \"I deliberated on whether I should send that or not,\" he says. \"I finally concluded that what the hell, if it's going to be an open book it might as well be open all the way, right?\" \u2022 Sam Klemke's Time Machine is available via Vimeo on Demand",
