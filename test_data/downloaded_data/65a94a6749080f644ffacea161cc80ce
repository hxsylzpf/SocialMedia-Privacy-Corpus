The bitter accusations flew as Mr Blair drafted in heavyweight Charles Clarke to fill the vacancy created by Ms Morris's dignified and much lamented departure. Her family and friends revealed that newspapers, especially the London Evening Standard, had been pursuing them in an attempt to write stories on why Ms Morris, 50, had never married. Ms Morris and her parents were deeply upset at the intrusion into her private life. Her sister, cousins and uncle had all been pursued. Questions were asked by the Sunday Times about whether her relatives sent their children to private schools. Inquiries had also been made about Ms Morris's competence as a teacher in the Midlands, although officials regarded those questions as legitimate. A member of her family said: \"We found it very upsetting. She is a very private person.\" Ms Morris resigned on Wednesday night saying she was unable to manage her vast department and admitting she had not been good at coping with the modern media. However, the leader of the Commons, Robin Cook, said Ms Morris had been hounded out of office by the media. He added: \"I think we should respect the fact that people in public life should be judged on their job and should not find media pursuing other aspects of their private life.\" The home secretary, David Blunkett, blamed the frenzy of the past six weeks when Ms Morris was accused of making mistakes over A-levels and school discipline. Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary, revealed the anguish that Ms Morris had experienced: \"I think that she felt a very clear choice: that either she was going to grow some more layers, become more thick-skinned and therefore less human in her own terms, or she had to step aside and take some time out.\" Mr Blair's appointment of Mr Clarke, the candid party chairman, as the new education secretary was not greeted with universal acclaim by the teaching unions last night. Although they praised his knowledge, some feared his pugnacious style would mark the end of the trusting relationship forged by Ms Morris. Mr Clarke, a former education minister, said the job was a fantastic challenge. He is likely to quickly say he will work closely with the unions. His departure led to John Reid, new Labour's philosopher king, taking on the role of party chairman and effectively chief spokesman. Mr Reid admitted that leaving Northern Ireland at such a time of crisis was a wrench but said he was delighted to take charge of \"the engine room and inspiration\" of the government. In an effort to minimise the disruption in the province, Mr Blair recalled Paul Murphy, the wily former Northern Ireland minister, from the Wales Office. A Roman Catholic, he played a key role in negotiating the Good Friday agreement and is respected on all sides of the political divide. Peter Hain, the Europe minister, is to take over at the Wales Office where he conspicuously praised his former foe, Rhodri Morgan, the Welsh first minister. Mr Hain has been asked to remain as Britain's representative at the convention on the future of Europe whose head, former French president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing, will publish his draft constitution for Europe on Monday. Mr Blair told aides yesterday he believed the outcome of the talks were crucial to setting the context next spring on whether to go ahead with a referendum on the euro. Mr Hain has also been told he will play a campaigning role in any referendum. The new minister for Europe may not emerge until the weekend. Mr Blair led the glowing tributes to Ms Morris that poured in from her Labour party colleagues. Speaking at a headteachers' leadership college in Nottingham, he said: \"I think the manner of her leaving, which was very, very difficult for her of course, and the way she left, resigned last night, underscored the dignity and integrity that was her hallmark throughout her time as education secretary. \"She was someone who was an extraordinarily honest person. She cared deeply about education.\" Her mentor, the former education secretary Mr Blunkett, said: \"I think we all had more confidence in her than she had in herself.\"",
