  "content": "Happy 20th birthday, email! Next week \u2013 on 11 March, if you're planning a party \u2013 it will be precisely two decades since the first email with an attachment was sent, rescuing email from its academic niche and sending it out into the big wide world, like the young Orca Willy, liberated from the amusement park hell and set free to make backflips in the sea (until it's time for the sequel). Maybe you are thinking, Why write this celebratory column now when it would surely make more sense to do it next week? Ah, but we live in an internet age now, in which news is supposed to break at least a week before the event itself happens. Get with the programme, grandad! So congratulations, email; in one more year you can legally get drunk in the US and then send late-night misguided missives to your ex-lovers on your own medium, and then suffer meta remorse. But as one matures, one's parents cease to treat one like a child. This at times shocking development (\"Wait, you expect me to do my own washing when I stay at yours for Christmas? MY OWN WASHING?\") often manifests itself in them not praising absolutely every little thing you do. Once a simple finger painting was viewed as proof that you were \"very advanced, developmentally \u2013 should we put her down early for an MA at the Courtauld, do you think?\" Now it's: \"Horizontal stripes? On your hips, honey? Are you sure?\" So it has proven for poor little email. On Monday, Nathaniel Borenstein, the frequently dubbed \"father of email\", said at a conference that, actually, he is disappointed in his child prodigy. Something about its cumbersome code, which makes his kid look bit of a chubster, or it clutters up the internet, which is basically the same thing in parenting terms. This code, according to Daddy Dearest Borenstein, was supposed to have changed as email evolved but instead has remained locked in the internet and this has caused Borenstein paroxysms of guilt. Well, Mr Borenstein, suffer no more. If you think a pesky code is the worst retort to the initial optimism we all had about the internet, you clearly have never been on dailymail.co.uk. My God, in the eyes of some of us, or possibly just one of us, the internet is nothing but one hot, bubbling sea of disappointment and human failure. So to slake Mr Borenstein's nights of insomnia, here are the worst things about the internet, all of which make a pudgy code look like a downright blessing: 1. Twitter feuds Just edging past retweeting of compliments, detailing your lunch in your Facebook status update, the concept of quantifying your friends as if they were currency and getting LinkedIn requests from the jerk who used to bully you at school, Twitter feuds are the worst of the detritus trailed by social media. Hearing about other people's petty quarrels is dull enough; having to watch them conducted on Twitter between the likes of Miley Cyrus and her ex-boyfriend makes one doubt Darwinism: \"I can't change you're [sic] mind \u2026 Maybe YOU'RE the one pretending you're fine,\" scribes the Achy-Breaky fille. Oh, Dorothy Parker \u2013 whither thou now? 2. The black hole of dailymail.co.uk's righthand column Look, I'm a journalist, ergo I'm very much on Team Journalism. Yay! So, fine, let the Daily Mail exist in all its fetid form. But not even an empty box of Krispy Kremes can cause as much self-loathing and act as a testament to the addictive nature of the product within as the righthand column of celebrity photos on the Daily Mail's home page. I look at that website more times a day than I go to the loo (forgive me, merciful God!) and I didn't even realise there were other stories on it besides those photos until about a month ago. What does Imogen Thomas wear to the gym? Why can someone called Lauren Goodger not stop eating? And how does Ice-T's wife maintain those curves? These are questions I have never asked myself and yet I seek their answers as soon as I am on the Daily Mail's website and the hours slip away. But what I lose in time, I gain in knowledge. Um, right. 3. Bankruptcy Wait a minute, I'll get to you as soon as I've bought this dress on theoutnet.com. And then done my Ocado order. Oh! And I meant to order those things off Amazon yonks ago! Here's the thing about spending money on the internet: it doesn't feel like you're spending money, and don't even get me started on the devilish taunt of websites asking if you want them to \"save your payment details.\" Damn you, netaporter.com! So if Borenstein really wants to improve an internet algorithm (oh yeah \u2013 I saw The Social Network), when you buy something over the internet, you should physically have to insert the money into the screen, one note at a time. It's the only thing standing between me, bankruptcy and death caused by drowning in my own flat beneath a sea of netaporter.com shopping bags.",
