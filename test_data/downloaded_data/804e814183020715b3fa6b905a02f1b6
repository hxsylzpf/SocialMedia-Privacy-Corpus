  "content": "The mass theft of sensitive and private images from celebrity accounts subsequently sold or \"dumped\" on 4chan has raised significant questions about the security of cloud-based storage systems. At the centre of the furore is Apple's iCloud, which has come under significant scrutiny after reports emerged that a weakness in its service may have been the source of the leaked information. While the leaking of private images of the young and famous is an issue of discussion in itself, this case also raises wider concerns for all of us, whether you're an individual or a business. Just how secure is your data? The answer lies in a clear understanding of how cloud systems work and their vulnerabilities. A cloud system is a remote data centre that stores information, a hosting company (such as Apple) will have many physical storage centres with multiple serves spanning many locations. These physical entities can be the source of breaches or leaks (these are rare) and this particular case doesn't appear to indicate an external breach of these kinds of systems. In some cases IT systems can be subcontracted to another supplier which may not have adequate encryption systems that match those of the main supplier, such as a robust encryption key management systems like salting (which defend against so-called \"brute force\" attacks). The alleged iCloud hack has also highlighted a concern over the deletion of data. Some of the affected individuals reported their images were deleted long before being leaked. A user needs to understand that their data is not always gone because they pressed the delete button. A device itself (such as a tablet) can leave behind residual information in the cloud, from the cloud data storage servers and from a host companies backup servers. In addition to this, a third party may also hold data which could go unaccounted for. Businesses and consumers are unlikely to have the time or full expertise to know the intricacies of their cloud suppliers. A business, however, does have the option to seek IT assurance to map out and manage risks. Consumers on the other hand must rely on passwords and two-factor authorisation as their first lines of defence. It is possible that the Apple iCloud system was compromised using social engineering techniques, where the hacker persuades a user or supplier to reveal passwords and other security details through deception. These are most commonly in the form of phishing emails or malware but can also involve direct calls and deception. As a result of this individuals and businesses both need to be thinking more about how secure their password really is. The adoption of better security techniques such as two-factor authentication (where a user can only access their account through a passcode from a unique device) is not widely adopted. The inherent reluctance stems from the fact that the more secure an account is, the more complicated it is for the user to access it. It is also generally recognised that many users either share their passwords across multiple websites and cloud systems or reuse old ones, so a breach on one system can easily snowball into multiple breaches across all of a users' or firms' cloud systems. Users and businesses also need to look closely at the devices they operate. It can be easy to leave a phone on its default setting without properly configuring its security functions. Even with Apple devices, which are generally regarded as being very user-friendly, the devices often have a bewildering array of security options that many confused users can simply ignore, leaving them vulnerable to attack. The best possible outcomes from this are that consumers and businesses start taking data vulnerability seriously and alter their behaviour by adopting more of the security features available to them. If a user believes one password can act like a thick padlock on their front door, then they are likely to be caught out when a hacker comes in through one of the many potential windows to their private data.
