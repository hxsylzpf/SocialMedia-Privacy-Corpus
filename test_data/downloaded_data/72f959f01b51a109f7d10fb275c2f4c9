  "content": "Transport for London has become the latest employer to ban Facebook access after concerns that its staff spend too much time on the social networking website. The company behind London's Tube and bus network is one of the capital's biggest employers with more than 20,000 staff - although the majority are not office-based. The company's Facebook users include London mayor Ken Livingstone, the chairman of the TfL board, and David Brown, the managing director for surface transport. \"As a major employer we regularly appraise internet access in accordance with our own policy under which we reserve the right to prevent access to certain internet sites,\" said a TfL spokesman. UK users spend an average three hours 11 minutes on the site each month, according to data from web monitoring firm comScore, slightly lower than the global average of three hours 41 minutes. London is now the largest network on Facebook with more than 882,000 of the UK's 3.2million users. Facebook has said its typical growth is around 3% a month, but London membership has been growing by 6%. The Telegraph recently reported that as many as 70% of UK employers - including councils, banks and law firms - had banned access to the site, while others warn that using the site during office hours is a sackable offence. LloydsTSB, Credit Suisse, the Metropolitan Police and Camden council are among the employers that have blocked the site in the UK. In the US, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have blocked the site, while in Australia telecommunications company Telstra has stopped staff logging on. Some technology bloggers have speculated that the ban could hamper the growth of the site, which is often used by people to connect professionally as well as socially. Other companies are exploring how to integrate Facebook into their corporate communications network. German technology firm Siemens has 6,430 employees on its Facebook network and is looking at developing an application for Facebook that would link the site with internal staff blogs. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
