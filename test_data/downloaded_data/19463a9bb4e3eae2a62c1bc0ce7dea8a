Russian company Digital Sky Technologies, which already invested $200m in the social network, is offering up to $100m more to buy shares from current and former employees. \u2022 Here's a strange one for you: the backers of so-called Disruption Tolerant Networking are suggesting that the internet could stretch to other planets in less than two years according to National Geographic. Nasa is planning to adopt the system, which can send messages back from around the universe, by 2011. \u2022 I intended to share this exchange with you yesterday, but it gets even better after re-reading: First blogging stalwart Anil Dash wrote a very insightful post on why Google should think very carefully about what it does - which has now been picked up by the search giant's own Matt Cutts, who says all Googlers should read it. Great brain food. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
