  "content": "Whether you plump for Polly Morgan's mafia-style greeting or Michael Craig-Martin's Christmas cornucopia, there are many ways in which you can send your G2 Christmas cards. You could go for the Blue Peter style and just cut them out from the pages of G2, stick them on to card and send. Or you can either: Tweet Just click the \"tweet\" button next to the image of your choice, add a message and tweet it @ your intended recipient. The image will appear in their Twitter stream. Post You can print the images (which are in PDF form) on to paper or card, fold them where we've indicated and send them. G2 is not responsible for the non-arrival of any well-considered greetings. Email Click the \"send to a friend\" email icon, add a message and a link to all six images will appear in your loved one's inbox. And then . . . If you think that you can do better yourself, why not send us your own, brilliantly designed cards. You can email your designs to your.pictures@theguardian.com, or upload them to our Flickr site at flickr.com/groups/christmascards. The best designs will be published in G2 before Christmas. You can also share the images via Facebook and other social networking sites. Happy Christmas everybody!",
