  "content": "The woman who produced evidence that Prince Edward traded on his royal connections has described how out of touch he is with the real world of TV production. Christine Carter, a TV producer, said the prince had been a victim of his inexperience and had worked with people who exploited his naivety. \"If they go filming they know they can book a table in the best restaurant in town and probably won't have to foot the bill. He thinks it's normal to stop production for a big lunch rather than just grab a sandwich - he's never seen any different,\" Ms Carter said. Ms Carter worked with the prince on the documentary, Edward on Edward, and she later developed other projects for Ardent Productions. A letter she received from Prince Edward prompted strong criticism of his business activities when it was published in the News of the World yesterday. In his letter, the prince boasted of his media pulling power. Referring to a particular project, he claimed \"no private finance could be even considered without my name being attached\" and \"the ultimate attraction of such a project to a wider audience will be enhanced by my presence\". Ms Carter said the row surrounding Ardent's \"stalking\" of Prince William at St Andrews university had prompted her to release the letter to the press. In an exclusive interview, carried out with MediaGuardian.co.uk before the letter was published, Ms Carter said she had felt \"sorry\" for the prince when working with him. \"Everybody wants a piece of him. He can never just be a producer because whatever he does, people can still see who he is,\" she said. Ms Carter first worked with the prince in 1996 when she was a producer with Desmond Wilcox's Man Alive Group, which made Edward on Edward. Ardent, however, now claims the credit for the programme. Shortly after this, when Ardent won a commission to make Annie's Bar, a Channel 4 comedy drama series about the Houses of Parliament's watering hole, she said she felt the prince had \"potential\". \"He could have been quite a good producer and earned an income,\" Ms Carter said. \"At that time, I felt he had a lot of promise. He was on a roll and there was a lot of interest in him. Then it started to dwindle as he continued to make a loss.\" Ms Carter said Prince Edward worked \"terribly hard\". \"He really tries,\" she added. \"I remember once calling him at 9pm on the night of his birthday - he was still working.\" But she also felt his royal background would always work against him. \"Whatever he does, he's going to have a target on his back. It's very unfair but he needn't have done it. \"If he'd joined an already established production company and worked with someone more experienced, he would not have attracted so much flak. \"But because he launched his own company against people with 30 years' experience, he was given no quarter. People were gleeful about the failure of Annie's Bar.\" Ms Carter said she believed Prince Edward was unlikely to have been closely involved with the film crew accused of stalking his nephew at St Andrews last month. \"It's not Edward who would've done that,\" she said. \"It's people who use his name and, in this case, they probably used it to get special access. \"People use his name to his disadvantage all the time and he ends up having to defend himself.\"",
