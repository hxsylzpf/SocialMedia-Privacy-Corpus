  "content": "It's been over a year since scientists announced we had reached #peakbeard. And this time last year, Movemberists complained that the mainstreaming of facial hair undermined their cause. Lumber sexuality \u2013 an urban lifestyle characterised by a back-to-nature romanticism of facial hair, flannel shirts and semi-ironic appropriation of hyper-masculine tropes \u2013 has become the new normal. Yet, somehow, beards are still confused with terrorism. On Saturday, 30 bearded gentlemen from all over Sweden got together for a photo-shoot at Brahehus's scenic ruins. In their finest suits, hats and suspenders they hugged, laughed and posed for a professional photographer under the clear autumn skies and the banner of their international bearded brotherhood. Then a man driving past called the police to report a suspected gathering of an Isis cell. When the cops arrived, everyone had a good laugh at the misunderstanding (\"It is obviously disappointing that someone mistook us for terrorists but also a bit funny,\" one member said) but some left the gathering with a bad taste in their mouth. \"We never thought that the beard could be a 'terrorist accessory',\" says the club's Swedish chapter leader, John Ekeblad. \"The beard is a natural male attribute \u2013 indeed, it's the men who shave that break the 'natural' order.\" While Arab hipsters have struggled for a while, it is the first time Bearded Villains, a self-described club for elite men with beards, has been confused with jihadis. The media attention was new too, as newspapers from all over the world contacted the brotherhood for comments on the tragicomic event. \"Saturday's commotion feels exaggerated, surreal and absolutely amazing,\" says Ekeblad. \"We got a free ride in getting our message out, thanks to one judgmental person. I'd like to both thank and correct the person who called the police.\" An international community for men with beards may be easily dismissed as a vanity project. Yet, Bearded Villains' members insist it has become more than that: a lifestyle, or even a movement, set out to correct and play around with outdated stereotypes while building unbreakable bonds between men worldwide. Despite the name, the Bearded Villains insist they're good guys. Charity campaigns range from clothing drives to refugees in Europe to prostate cancer fundraisers and feeding homeless in Miami. To Ekeblad, Saturday's incident seemed all the more ironic given the brotherhood's raison d'\u00eatre: building a global network founded on the pillars of loyalty, support and love through small good deeds performed by men society might otherwise dismiss as hipsters or \"bad boys\". \"This is an important 'mistake',\" Ekeblad explains. \"This is exactly what we are trying to teach the world: that we must look beyond gender, religion, looks and sexual orientation.\" The small-scale revolution Bearded Villains' members often talk about wasn't necessarily the intention of founder and president Fredrick von Knox, a bearded model based in Los Angeles, when he started a web platform for curating bearded selfies last year. Prospective members would be scouted on Instagram and receive a patch in their mailbox, then had to prove they had the \"right attitude\" (no homophobia, racism or sexism allowed) in order to carry the brand's black-and-white creed on social media and T-shirts \u2013 a process that can take several months. Today, Bearded Villains has snowballed from the American west coast to thousands of members across 80 nations with chapters in major cities across the world. Von Knox himself deals T-shirts, beard combs and is about to launch a shoe line. Mark, a survivor of testicular cancer, started growing his beard for no-shave November last year, when he stumbled upon Bearded Villains' Instagram. Black and only a few inches long, his may not be the brotherhood's most impressive beard, though his moustache has curled, carefully waxed ends. His arms are covered in tattoos: snakes, skulls, flames and Chinese characters. \"A beard is not a fad,\" he explains. \"It's not fashion. It's a lifestyle.\" He arrives on a Harley Davidson motorbike, and hugs his bearded friend Justin (@the_bearded_shiznit) who is already at the bar. They found each other on Instagram a year ago, talk almost every day and have called each other \"brother\" since the day they met. Both bearded, tattooed and New York natives, they order a pint and a whiskey each. \"This is more than just guys not wanting to shave: camaraderie has been built between us, friendships have been made that otherwise probably would not have been there.\" There's an invisible bond between bearded men, they explain: a silent nod at the supermarket, or a compliment on the street (\"nice beard, man\"). As if on command, another bearded man walking past comments on Justin's reddish beard, which reaches all the way to his chest. \"When people think of masculinity they have negative connotations,\" says Mark. \"They might think of a macho type of person. But machoism is very different from masculinity. To be masculine is to be universal.\" More than anything, he says, the beard is a conversation starter: something all men everywhere can relate to. \"Men of all walk of life came together: straight, gay, black, white, Hispanic,\" Mark explains. \"You get a Jewish brother with a beard and a Muslim brother with a beard to sit down and discuss things and have an open forum and be masculine at the same time. And say: what the fuck were these differences we were fighting about?\" He continues: \"The biker and the gay guy who maybe thought their worlds didn't match but because we had this common bond here we are, and hey \u2013 you're just like me.\" Inclusivity and tolerance is at the heart of the global beard community, members insist. And it isn't just men: while Bearded Villains (for obvious reasons) may have an all-male membership, girlfriends and wives are prominently featured in social media feeds, and some have even united to show their support via #villainqueens. Even the beard itself isn't a strict requirement. By the time Mark's membership was approved by headquarters, he had just found out that he had a relapse. Thanks, but no thanks, he wrote back: most likely he was about to lose his hair \u2013 including his beard \u2013 in chemotherapy. Instead, Mark was asked to become the captain of the New York-New Jersey chapter. Support poured in from all over the world, and when he received the club flag in April he was already beardless. In July, he started growing it back. Mark isn't surprised with the weekend's incident in Sweden \u2013 people will always judge \u2013 but if anything, he is annoyed that headlines referred to Bearded Villains as \"hipsters\". They don't grow their beards because it's trendy, and they have a grander agenda: his and Justin's joint fundraiser, Bearded Dudes for St Jude, has almost reached their goal of $10,000 towards research for childhood cancer. As the beard itself has become gentrified, Bearded Villains insist their facial hair is here to stay. At the same time, the brothers have to respect the hipsters copycats \u2013 not judging goes both ways, and a bearded brother has to practise what he preaches. \"You're gonna get a biker guy that's gonna grow his beard out the same way someone labelled a hipster. And he's gonna think he's better than him \u2013 but no, motherfucker, you're not.\" He pauses. \"It's a personal choice and no matter the reason, I respect it. There's discipline to it. Do it. Let it grow, do your thing and be happy! Do it, brother.\"",
