  "content": "It is \"totally unacceptable\" for Ordnance Survey not to provide maps suitable for the digital economy, said former Cabinet Office minister Tom Watson at the Guardian's Activate 09 summit - part-sponsored by Ordnance Survey - last week. Watson, the Labour MP for West Bromwich East - who appeared on the platform with Adam Afriyie, the Conservatives' shadow minister for science and innovation - said that as taxpayers, we have already paid for the information the organisation holds and sells to commercial companies. But he also said that privatisation would make matters worse. Afriyie, who has previously encouraged the idea of better access to government data, backed the idea of better access at the local government level and pushed for local versions of They Work For You - the MySociety-created website which mashes up Hansard into a more usable form. Meanwhile, Ed Parsons, geospatial technologist at Google UK, said government agencies should allow greater access to more of their data so the mobile industry could take full advantage. The early optimism about the possibilities from GPS (a US government-provided free data service) had been premature, but, said Parsons, \"it's a reality now\" and government needed to develop services \"to allow the geeks out there to produce services and products in the near future\". Parsons cited the National Rail Enquiries iPhone app, which offers localised UK train times but costs \u00a34.99 - having forced a free version of the same application from a different company to shut down.\"That's ... because developers have to pay National Rail for access to the times,\" Parsons said. However, National Rail is owned by the train operating companies, not the government, meaning its data would not fall under the Free Our Data remit. For Ordnance Survey, Liz Ratcliffe, the head of product marketing, admitted OS had been through a \"painful period of self-reflection\" but that had led it to launch its OpenSpace API more widely in April. She encouraged people to work with OS to create new online maps. \u2022 The search for Ordnance Survey's \"internationally recognised expert\" who read and approved its report on funding models goes on. Last week, one commenter on the Free Our Data blog wondered if it might have been Max Craglia, of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, a specialist in geographic information policies. But Dr Craglia told the Guardian: \"I regret I am not the expert you are looking for.\" OS says it is awaiting the permission of the expert before releasing their name. Further information is due by 23 July under an FOI Act request.",
