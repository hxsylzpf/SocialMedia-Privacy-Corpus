  "content": "Security researchers have identified a new type of \"ransomware\" which blocks internet access and turns users' computer into a bitcoin miner pending payment of a ransom. The malware, named by researchers at Emsisoft as \"Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Linkup\", differs from previous examples of ransomware. \"It does not directly lock your computer or encrypt files,\" the researchers explain. \"Instead, Linkup blocks internet access by modifying your DNS and can also turn your computer into a bitcoin mining robot.\" When an infected computer loads up any page, they are taken to a fake website which accuses them of having viewed \"child pornography\" and demands payment of a \u20ac0.01 fine. The \"payment\" is taken by the user inputting a credit card number, making it extremely unlikely that the malware developers will limit themselves to just one cent; Emsisoft describes it as \"most likely a blatant lie\". Once installed, the malware also attempts to download bitcoin-mining software. When installed, the software uses the computer's processor to perform the energy-intensive tasks used to mine for bitcoin, which runs the risk of damaging the machine and will certainly run up a large electricity bill. \"In the case of Linkup, the most important thing to understand about bitcoin mining is that if a hacker can get more computing power, he can earn more bitcoins,\" Emsisoft writes. \"That's why in addition to blocking internet browsing, Linkup also attempts to connect your computer to a bitcoin-mining botnet, which can combine the computing power of multiple infected computers to earn new bitcoins for whoever is behind the attack.\" But while Linkup is a fearsome combination of different types of malware, it's not the most dangerous to recently hit the internet. Cryptolocker, the virus which recently forced a US police department to pay an \u00a3800 ransom in bitcoins, has a number of features which render it more concerning than Linkup. Cryptolocker's modus operandi is to encrypt the victim's hard drive, and then ask for money \u2013 usually two bitcoins \u2013 to decrypt it. Because the files really are encrypted, simply removing the virus won't help, unlike with Linkup. But the most dangerous thing of all is that many variants of Cryptolocker actually keep their promise, and unlock the files when payment is received. Whereas victims of Linkup have a simple challenge, those infected with Cryptolocker have a much harder decision: do they pay up at all? \u2022 Meet Cody Wilson; creator of the 3D-printed gun, anarchist, libertarian",
