  "content": "The Labour candidate sacked for making offensive remarks on Twitter apologised tonight, saying he was \"young and stupid\". Stuart MacLennan, who described old people as \"coffin dodgers\", branded one woman a \"boot\" and joked about slavery, said sorry for distracting the Labour campaign. MacLennan, who had been the candidate for Moray, told the Guardian: \"I am sorry to anyone I offended but I am specially sorry for having distracted from what should have been quite a good day for Labour. \"I am young and stupid but that doesn't quite cut it and that's why I'm gone.\" Jim Murphy, the Scottish secretary, took the decision to fire MacLennan after details of the tweets were published in the Scottish edition of the Sun today. The Scottish Labour party earlier attempted to play down the controversy by saying MacLennan, 24, was \"a young candidate and has been very foolish indeed\" but was forced to act as the controversy escalated. Out on the campaign trail, Gordon Brown said: \"A candidate has made a mistake. It's unacceptable. That candidate has got to resign. \"I have made it absolutely clear what my views are: we cannot have people standing as candidates for the Labour party who express these views, so that candidate will not be a candidate for the Labour.\" An earlier apology by MacLennan failed to save him from the sack. Speaking to the Guardian, MacLennan rejected criticism from other parties that Scottish Labour had been slow to react. \"The rules of the Labour party stated I have to be dismissed by the general secretary and the moment I saw the general secretary he dismissed me,\" he said. \"The second sentence that came out of his mouth after 'Hi Stuart' was 'You've got to go'. I don't think there was the delay and obfuscation that's been suggested. \"I am sorry to anyone I offended but I am specially sorry for having distracted from what should have been quite a good day for Labour. I am young and stupid but that doesn't quite cut it and that's why I'm gone.\" Comments by MacLennan included calling people in the north of Scotland \"teuchters\" and he repeatedly expressed regret at having to drive north to Moray. MacLennan was a party researcher at the Scottish parliament and northern organiser and secretary for Scottish Young Labour. The party pointed out that the controversial tweets were a year old. His profile was swiftly deleted from the Labour party's website after his dismissal. Labour's aggressive action against MacLennan, which included suspending him from all his party posts, was an attempt to avoid allowing the controversy to be dragged out by their opponents. Labour had sought to exploit earlier controversies involving Scottish National party officials who published defamatory and abusive blogs about the SNP's opponents, rows which several times overshadowed Alex Salmond's minority government in Edinburgh in recent months. A Scottish Labour spokesman said: \"On reading the comments in full, the Scottish Labour party was outraged by their content and Scottish Labour's general secretary took the decision to suspend his membership of the Labour Party. Stuart MacLennan is no longer a Labour party candidate nor eligible to hold office as a Labour party representative. \"All political parties must uphold the highest possible standards on the internet and we urge the SNP, the Tories and the Lib Dems to be prepared to take similar action if necessary.\" MacLennan never had a chance of winning the Moray seat; Angus Robertson, the SNP's Westminster leader, has a rock-solid lead over the Tories, with Labour trailing in third. Robertson, the defending MP, claimed the u-turn was evidence that the Murphy had failed to grasp the importance of the issue. \"Only an hour before this announcement Jim Murphy was saying he could stay as a candidate and trying to brush off these outrageous comments. However, he has been over-ruled and clearly has no authority. Did Gordon Brown tell his Scottish Secretary what to do? This incident has completely devastated Labour's campaign launch today \u2013 but questions must be asked as many of these comments have been online for months, and presumably Labour colleagues have been well aware of them.\"",
