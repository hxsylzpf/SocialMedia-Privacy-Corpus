  "content": "Frankie Boyle looks to have made his final appearance on Channel 4, following the latest outrage provoked by the controversial comedian with jokes about Paralympic athletes on Twitter. Channel 4 declined to officially back or condemn Boyle on Friday, after he branded Saudi Arabian Paralympians as \"mainly thieves\" and a Paralympics GB high jumper's performance as \"Taliban assisted\". However, Channel 4 insiders admitted the comedian \u2013 on the network as recently as Monday with The Boyle Variety Performance as part of its Funny Fortnight \u2013 was unlikely to feature again. The comments were made on Boyle's personal Twitter account, but are an embarrassment for the Paralympics broadcaster. Channel 4 commissioned his series Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights after he quit BBC2 show Mock the Week following controversial jokes, including one about swimmer Rebecca Adlington that the BBC Trust ruled should never have been broadcast. In 2011 Channel 4 refused to apologise over a joke Boyle made on Tramadol Nights about Katie Price's disabled son \u2013 even after media regulator Ofcom had ruled that it \"had considerable potential to be highly offensive\" and was in breach of the broadcasting code. However, this time Boyle appears to have gone too far even for Channel 4 executives. The broadcaster said in a statement: \"Frankie Boyle is not under contract with Channel 4 and we don't have any shows planned with him.\" This is a marked change of tone from May, when Channel 4 chief creative officer Jay Hunt said the broadcaster was in discussions with Boyle about future projects but had not found the right one. Those discussions are understood to have been about taking part in Channel 4's Funny Fortnight. Channel 4 also broadcast a show featuring footage of Boyle's 2010 standup tour during the season of comedy programmes. The channel is cutting its ties with Boyle less than a fortnight after head of comedy, Shane Allen, announced he was to leave Channel 4 to become head of comedy commissioning at the BBC. Allen was widely seen as Boyle's main ally inside Channel 4 as he refused to severe ties with the Scottish comedian despite numerous controversies, Ofcom investigations and legal threats over his close-to-the-bone jokes on Tramadol Nights, including the remarks about Price's disabled son and racial language in jokes about the war in Afghanistan. In an interview with MediaGuardian in August 2011, Allen said Channel 4 was planning to film a pilot for a new series, Frankie Boyle's Rehabilitation Programme, in the autumn of last year. Dan Scorer, the senior campaigns and policy manager at Mencap, praised Channel 4's commitment to disability programmes, but added: \"It would be disappointing if these steps were undermined by providing a comedian who has repeatedly caused profound offence to disabled people opportunities to do so again.\" Boyle remained unapologetic in messages posted on Twitter later on Friday. He described his jokes as \"celebratory, not discriminatory, pretty funny\". He added: \"Nobody thinks it's a good thing to laugh at the disabled. But it is a genuine problem that we're not allowed to laugh with the disabled.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
