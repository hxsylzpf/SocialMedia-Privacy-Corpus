  "content": "Stan Collymore's stormy relationship with the tabloid press continued today when the Daily Mirror was forced to apologise to Sophie Dahl for claims it reprinted from the footballer's autobiography. The Daily Mirror said it had paid damages to the model for wrongly suggesting she had been involved in a sexual relationship with Collymore. The claim appeared in the tabloid on September 27 when the paper serialised his autobiography, Stan: Tackling My Demons. \"We suggested that Sophie Dahl had been involved in a sexual relationship with Stan Collymore. We now accept that this is incorrect,\" the paper writes today. \"We are happy to set the record straight and apologise to Sophie Dahl for any stress and embarrassment which the article caused to her. \"We have agreed to pay her damages and her legal costs.\" The Sun apologised to the former England and Liverpool star on New Year's Eve after the tabloid was found guilty by the Press Complaints Commission of a \"serious\" breach of its code of practice. On November 3 it published a \"confession\" by the footballer without making clear that it was faked. The front page story appeared to include a signed \"confession\" by Collymore admitting he was a \"lying scumbag\" who had \"wasted his talent\". But only in the fifth paragraph of the story did the paper revealed that the former Liverpool and Aston Villa player was tricked into signing the confession at a book signing. Last week the footballer's lawyers complained that the apology had been buried in the paper and not given the prominence required by the PCC. The footballer lost his job as a BBC Radio Five Live pundit last year after he admitted \"dogging\" - looking for sex with strangers in car parks. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
