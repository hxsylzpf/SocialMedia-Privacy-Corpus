  "content": "The government is to hand business \u00a320m to cover the cost of installing \"black box recorders\" from which the security services will be able to intercept internet traffic, including emails. The announcement, due shortly, follows protests from businesses that burgeoning e-commerce will leave Britain because of the crippling costs of installing and maintaining the boxes. One report by a group including the London Scool of Economics which was dismissed by the home secretary, Jack Straw, claimed the new surveillance burdens on companies will run to over \u00a346bn over five years, including the estimated cost of lost internet business. A report compiled for the Home Office by the Smith Group, an e-business consultancy, puts the cost of installing the capital equipment and the first four years' running costs closer to \u00a320m. Ministers have come up with the offer following talks with the Internet Service Providers Association. They have also sought to reassure business by saying they will only require the boxes on about 10% of internet service providers. Use of the intercept capacity will still require the warrant of the home secretary. The regulation of investigatory powers bill, imposing the requirement on business, is facing attacks in the Lords. Critics say the bill provides a snoopers' charter for the intelligence services. The bill also includes powers to compel companies to surrender software keys for encoding private electronic documents. The Home Office minister, Lord Bassam, has sought to allay fears that the security of UK businesses and overseas business partners will be compromised by this requirement. A new amendment tabled by Lord Bassam will require government to keep such keys in a secure place at the highest possible classification. They are likely to be kept at M15 headquarters.",
