PaidContent reports that she also revealed that the 700 layoffs conducted under her watch cost the company $27m. Meanwhile, points out critic Eric Jackson, Bartz herself stands to make between $20m and $30m in her first year on the job. \u2022 The heat is still from many quarters for Twitter to start making money - but co-founder Biz Stone said on Tuesday that \"any kind of approach to advertising is going to be a while\". That's despite the company recently tweaking its terms of service in a way that \"leaves the door open\" for ad placements. \u2022 If you haven't seen the images of a dust storm that hit Sydney, then prepare yourself for some incredible stuff: this Flickr gallery compiling pictures from across Sydney, as well as this frankly insane video of the sky turning black as the dust moves in.
