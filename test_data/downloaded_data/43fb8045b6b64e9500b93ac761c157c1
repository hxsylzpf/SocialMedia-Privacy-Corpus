He was chosen during ENPA's general assembly in Oslo at the weekend. Black said: \"I look forward very much to working closely with colleagues from across Europe, and with the ENPA team in Brussels, on the vital and complex issues we face in order to ensure that we retain a free and fearless media. \"Data protection, copyright, taxation, the so-called 'right to be forgotten' and many other issues are high up the agenda, and we have a big job to do in representing European newspaper publishers and putting our case to the new commission and parliament.\" Black succeeds the Norwegian publisher, Ivar Rusdal, chair of Nordsj\u00f8 Media AS. The assembly adopted a resolution underlining concerns about the draft EU regulation on data protection. ENPA believes it could have a serious detrimental impact on press freedom, investigative journalism and protection of sources, as well as the storing and archiving of press articles. Source: ENPA",
