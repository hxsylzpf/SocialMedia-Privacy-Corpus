Australia stands out as a country that does not provide an actionable right to privacy \u2013 that is, the ability to sue someone who has seriously invaded the secrets of your private life. The courts have dabbed at it and tried to develop a privacy tort or bend the law relating to breach of confidence so that it extends to protecting personal privacy. So far, there's been nothing certain, comprehensive or clear. Into the void has arrived a heap of law reform proposals, both commonwealth and state, saying that we are seriously behind the eight-ball when it comes to providing remedies for those who feel their privacy has been breached. Unlike happiness or clear air, privacy is now elevated to the status of human right, even though it can't be properly defined or nailed-down. The latest recommendations are from the standing committee on law and justice from the upper house of the NSW parliament, with a report this month called Remedies for the Serious Invasion of Privacy in NSW, and a similar exercise from the South Australian Law Reform Institute at the University of Adelaide. Both reports are urging prompt action and for NSW and SA to go it alone \u2013 piecemeal is better than no meal. The NSW committee recommends that NSW adopt the key features of another report, this one from the Australian Law Reform Commission in 2014, called Serious Invasions of Privacy in the Digital Era. The work of the ALRC on this topic has been studiously ignored by the current attorney general, George Brandis. The digital era, with cameras on mobile phones, social media platforms, drones, surveillance and hidden recording devices, has opened up a new frontier for assaults on privacy. The findings in both NSW and SA are that suburban life is rife with privacy threats. People have cameras trained on their neighbour's driveways, backyards and bedroom windows and, even though there was no direct evidence of this, citizens live in fear of being filmed by drones. Stalking former partners with tracking devices is rife and so too revenge porn, where images of intimate sexual encounters of former lovers are posted online. The NSW committee says that there are around 3,000 revenge porn sites and that one in 10 Australians between 18 and 55 have had a naked or semi-naked image of themselves circulated without their permission. The belief is that these problems could be solved if people had a right to sue those who trample on their \"seclusion or private affairs\". Even so, it's not as though we are without remedies. The Crimes Act can deal with revenge porn, intimidation, voyeurism, filming a person engaged in a private act, filming a person's private parts, and installing cameras so that someone can be observed or filmed. There are laws relating to AVOs, surveillance and a commonwealth bill is in the pipeline that criminalises revenge porn. There are also torts of trespass and nuisance. The various law reform bodies say there are too many gaps in the patchwork and we have to go further. There have to be ever scarier remedies than criminal enforcement \u2013 such as injunctions and damages. Media organisations have genuine concerns. Would publication of a sexual affair involving a prominent politician be subject to a successful privacy suit or not? Of course, that very much depends on the circumstances. It was always hard to see the public benefit in publishing details of NSW politician David Campbell's visits to what used to be known as Ken's Karate Klub. However, there could be a public interest in publishing details of an Australian cabinet minister's affair with a member of China's ministry of state security, or maybe even a tryst across party lines, such as we saw in the case of Cheryl Kernot and Gareth Evans. The proposed requirement in NSW is that for liability to arise, privacy would have to be invaded intentionally or recklessly. However, for corporations, including media publishers, the threshold is a lot lower and their liability arises if they publish offending material negligently. The most likely available defences are flimsy and would, in all likelihood, involve a tribunal or court weighing the public interest in personal privacy against the public interest in freedom of expression. Three guesses who is going to win a round where legislatively protected personal privacy is weighed against the nebulous concept of the public's interest in freedom of expression? There is no Australia-wide human rights act, so for courts and tribunals to balance competing interests is a speculative endeavour. There is also a smorgasbord of proposed remedies available to privacy plaintiffs: damages, injunctions, account of profits, take down orders and apologies. Interim injunctions will be the first port of call. It is not an overly burdensome exercise for a plaintiff to successfully apply for an interim injunction to stop publication of a story, pending a full hearing. In many instances, this would have the effect of killing a time-sensitive scoop stone dead because it would usually be weeks before final orders would be made \u2013 another impediment to the already fraught endeavour of investigative journalism. There is a further unattractive proposal in the NSW law and justice committee's report \u2013 giving power to the privacy commissioner to make orders for publishers to take down stories from their news websites, to cease and desist from further publishing and to make apologies. Orders of this nature, exercising editorial control by a public servant, no matter how worthy and well-intentioned, are anathema to media defendants. If what has happened in England is any pointer, it is the rich, notorious and famous who predominantly used, and misused, the cause of action in privacy. Injunctions and super-injunctions generally kept their extra-curricula activities under wraps \u2013 until the dam burst and the gossip was spilled into the public domain. It is governments that make the deepest incursions into our lives, so that might explain their reluctance, so far, to do anything to protect the privacy of their citizens. The difficulty is getting the balance right \u2013 to protect people's seclusion and sense of self from vengeful former partners and harassing neighbours, while not hamstringing genuine public interest journalism. So far, it has been a balance that has been beyond the reach of the proposals coming from law reformers.",
