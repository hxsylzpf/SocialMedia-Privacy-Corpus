  "content": "A US firm that uses in-store CCTV to provide real-world analytics to shopkeepers has raised $15m in series B funding. Prism Skylabs uses data from video cameras located in shops to track the routes of users around brick-and-mortar stores, providing a physical analogue to the analytics packages used by online retailers. Employees equipped with mobile phones and laptops can use Prism Skylabs' package to look at any store in a retail chain, and get on-demand visual summaries of consumer paths through the location. The analytics package is intended to allow business owners to discover the information buried within their CCTV footage without having to rewatch hundreds of hours of surveillance tapes. Prism Skylabs promises to answer questions such as whether the store was open on time, which products customers pick up the most, and how long people waiting in line. The company also promises to protect customers' privacy. Indeed, one of the key features is the ability to remove shoppers from CCTV images, \"both protecting privacy and giving retailers an uninhibited view of any product, shelf, or display\". The focus is very much on providing aggregate data for shopkeepers, and not, for the time being, tracking individual customers in the manner that some US retailers have started doing with mobile phone data. Prism Skylabs' series B funding follows the $7.5m it raised in its 2011 series A.",
