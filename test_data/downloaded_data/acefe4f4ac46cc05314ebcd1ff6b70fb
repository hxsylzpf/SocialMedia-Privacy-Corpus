  "content": "So, he won. Paul Chambers has had his conviction for tweeting a \"message of menacing character\" overturned. By the lord chief justice no less, who was as plain as he was brief: \"The appeal against conviction will be allowed on the basis that this 'tweet' did not constitute or include a message of a menacing character.\"  It was a case that has felt like an absurdist operetta about English law. At the appeal it seemed that at any moment Stephen Fry would stand up to proclaim: \"Are we not Englishmen? Is it not our right to make jokes?\" and then Paul would be carried shoulder high into the street. But the limits of the state's right to proscribe what we can and can't say have been clearly outlined \u2013 as well as reconciling itself to the Twitter stream as a new context and how the law has to respond to it. What Paul's victory doesn't mean, as I've had to explain more than once, is that anyone sending actually menacing messages will be able to say, \"well, he got off\". It also doesn't mean that \u2013 a comparison some have made \u2013 if you're in a queue at the airport and say you've got a bomb in your bag, you'll get away with it. Because he didn't do that.  It means that discretion in wielding the law, a precisely blunt instrument, has to be on the agenda when dealing with electronic media. The response from some has been: \"You should watch what you say\" \u2013 a retort that, for me, contains far more menace than any tweet I've ever seen.",
