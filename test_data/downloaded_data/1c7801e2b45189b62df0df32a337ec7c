  "content": "The Sun is planning to give its website a massive boost by tying it to the recently acquired and hugely popular MySpace.com community and networking site to create a \"MySun\" online readers' network. The plan, in its early stages, would allow readers to go to a MySun portal and create their own web pages, blogs, as well as share pictures and video clips with friends using MySpace.com software. News International, which owns the Sun and the Times, is understood to have considered linking MySpace.com with TimesOnline, the website of the Times and Sunday Times, but thought its older audience would not be as good a fit as the Sun. MySpace.com has 60 million registered users in the 16- and 34-years-old category, a group highly desired by advertisers. The website, a social networking phenomenon that is hugely popular with teenagers, proved its power recently when it propelled the Arctic Monkeys band to stardom after the group posted its demo tracks on the site. In February MySpace.com overtook the BBC site in terms of visitor numbers and grew six-fold year on year, according to internet monitor Hitwise. At his speech in London on Monday, the News Corporation chairman, Rupert Murdoch, sang the praises of the network. \"This is a generation, now popularly referred to as the 'MySpace generation', talking to itself in a world without frontiers,\" he said. \"It is just one example of how the media, with its ability to reach millions with information, entertainment and education can use the achievements of technology to create better and more interesting lives for a great many people. \"And it is one reason why I believe we are at the dawn of a golden age of information - an empire of new knowledge. In January, Mr Murdoch said MySpace would be the the kernel of News Corp's online activity and that the media group would start offering video downloads on the website. Last July, News Corporation bought MySpace.com as part of a $580m (\u00a3331m) deal to acquire Intermix Media, a US internet company with more than 30 entertainment and community sites. \"Intermix's brands, such as MySpace.com, are some of the web's hottest properties and resonate with the same audiences that are most attracted to Fox's news, sports and entertainment offerings,\" Mr Murdoch said in statement. \"We see a great opportunity to combine the popularity of Intermix's sites, particularly MySpace, with our existing online assets to provide a richer experience for today's internet users.\" News International refused to comment. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
