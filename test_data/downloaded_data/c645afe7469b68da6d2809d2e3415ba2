  "content": "It's been another week of great debate and discussion among Guardian.co.uk readers, with commenters taking on government plans to clamp down on social network use during riots and sharing personal stories on cuts in careers advice to young people. Here's a look at what's been getting you talking this week: The stress of commuting \u2013 a female phenomenon? Commenters on the Guardian Facebook page were eager to give their two pennies in response to research suggesting that female commuters find it more stressful than men. David K pointed out: \u200eReport on the effects of commuting on psychological health says greater responsibility for childcare and household chores increases the burden on women\" \u2013 might it be that the greater stress on women has nothing to do with commuting and everything to do with working double shifts? Feminists have been observing the phenomenon for at least 30 years Oliver A added: Isn't the fact that commuting is stressful interesting full stop. Not to mention a waste of time and resources. I know \u2026 \"thinking time\". Well, every cloud \u2026 Lesley R quipped: Maybe because they think there is a dinner waiting for them when they get home, while women know when they get home they have the dinner to make! Whereas Navjot S disagreed: This can't be right. I travel a hour to work and same back and I love it. It gives me some me time. Takeo K wanted to see data on commuters in Japan: Let's hope those studies would be done in Japan. There are some different factors b/w UK and Japan. For instance, women could have more responsibilities for those, whereas commuter trains are more punctual in Japan. Career advice cuts Criticism from experts of government plans to cut careers advice for young people and make schools responsible for guidance to under-19s was backed by many readers in the comments, who discussed the problems caused by existing cuts to the independent youth advice service Connexions: emac, one of the Connexions advisers working in schools \"lucky enough to have survived the cull in March, says: For years opposition to Connexions said it \"was patchy and inconsistent\". Under new arrangements schools will have to buy in their own careers provision. Now schools are now being targeted by organisations offering them private arrangements for careers advisers ranging from \u00a3150 - \u00a3200+ a day. Schools are having to choose between buying in an adviser and retaining teachers, admin staff and TAs. Many of the schools in my area are working with a deficit in the budget, so how they are supposed to buy in impartial advice with no extra funding when they are balancing these other demands. thereisnobox, who has taught for seven years in two inner-city state schools, writes: If schools are to be expected to provide this service then significant training and investment will be required so that a quality service can be provided. Schools will have to create posts and provide time for teachers to deliver this service. However, none of this is likely to happen \u2013 tutors will be expected to \"deliver\" this once a term using an outdated pre-prepared lesson plan and a Powerpoint that someone downloaded off the TES resources website. Maybe we do need more accountability in terms of schools being held responsible for pupil destination \u2013 because I have found that unless something will be appearing in a league table, local newspaper or Ofsted report then often schools are not really interested in ensuring that it actually happens. Seasidedave says there is a need for review of the Connexions service, but is concerned about these proposals: In my experience the Connexions service was indeed patchy and inconsistent. I don't think the \"one-stop shop\" approach was the right one \u2013 too generic &amp; bound to be inefficient. It was not accessed (outside of school/college) by many young people in my home town. However some advisers / youth workers were very committed &amp; did catch some youths who fell through the net. Overall it was not an efficient or excellent service in my view. It needed to improved, even if it was kept. I also think the main focus of careers advice should be within educational institutions, prisons, institutions that work specifically with the homeless &amp; job centres. That is where they are needed most. Facebookers on use of Facebook in the riots Commenters on Facebook were keen to add to the debate about the role of social media during the riots, as government ministers met with the heads of Facebook, BlackBerry and Twitter. Katrin S voiced the majority opinion: Seriously, why is it so hard to understand for certain people that social networking sites are just tools for communication and not the cause of either riots or revolutions, like, you know, telephones, letters, smoke signals, language \u2026 Fay F added: The right response would be the government focusing on dealing with the underlying causes of civil unrest instead of censoring free speech. Last time I checked, the UK was not a police state. Vie V added: That kind of intervention is is not the solution; it is in fact a kind of a drug that might help to stop the disease (or better say the symptoms) from spreading but the side effects could eventually lead to bigger maladies \u2026 Higgs Boson signal fades A report from Cern and the Large Hadron Collider (LCH) that \"no striking evidence of anything that could resemble a discovery\" in hunt for Higgs Boson has been found, sparked a discussion about scientific funding and discovery. YoungEverest writes: Can we please make this clear. The LHC was not specifically set up to look for the Higgs Boson. It was built to look for new physics, whatever that might be. For those that are moaning about the money, just remember this was approved and started before the global recession when governments chucked money around, everywhere (and no one complained). We are now looking on \u00a37bn in hindsight. The money came from several different countries and so the cost to the taxpayer is nominal, the return in future quality of life will be substantial. Reader53 asks for patience: The LHC has been operational for only a short while. Given the amount of time it took Newton, Einstein and others to develop their ideas and push forward our knowledge of the universe the work being done with the LHC is but a blink of an eye. MaxCairnduff hopes for a change in fortunes for the project: An inconclusive result would be deeply disappointing. Either a positive or a negative result would be pretty exciting, and a negative one would spark a whole field of new thinking. A whole field that wouldn't get any funding in the current climate, but that will eventually change. The battle of Lydd airport Proposals to expand Lydd airport in Kent \u2013 and opposition to them from activists \u2013 have been dissected by our readers this week. Manonbv gives their assessment: The practical reality of Lydd airport is that it is miles &amp; miles from decent transport links. There is no train station immediately near it, &amp; the nearest is a slow branch line; unlike Kent International airport near Ramsgate further up the coast, which is on the fast line into London. I accept that the area needs investment, jobs &amp; housing, but I'm not convinced this airport is a viable solution. HalfEmptyAndHalfFull adds: Lydd airport is too far away from major centres of population to make its expansion viable. It has very poor transport links, and even if those were improved \u2013 which would be enormously expensive and would never be paid for out of any sensible government's funds \u2013 who would actually use it? I doubt there would be many people who would prefer Lydd to Gatwick even if it had a decent rail link and could be reached via a dual carriageway. At the moment, if two large vehicles want to pass each other on its approach road, one has to pull over! So, even if Mr Pickles gives it the go-ahead, it's very doubtful whether it would ever be commercially viable. But Mevagissey strongly disagrees: Most of the people against Lydd airport are retired people or people who have moved to the area from elsewhere and commute to work so aren't worried about the abysmal employment prospects for people who live on the marsh. The naysayers just want to maintain their quality of life \u2026 Most local people are in favour of expansion at Lydd. When Dungeness power station closes down local employment opportunities will all but vanish. The expansion of the airport is the only viable economic alternative for the local community as a whole.
