  "content": "I was in a coffee shop the other day and someone asked the barista if she could hand in her CV. The barista said yes and the CV was transferred in a friendly way. I'm wondering what that CV could have said that would have made any kind of difference. What it should have had was a Twitter feed, a Facebook page, a LinkedIn profile and possibly a CRB check. Two pages of double-spaced A4 with snappy bullet points really doesn't cut the mustard any more, which I think is a relief all round. Virtually every part of the traditional CV was a minefield. Details of previous salary is one of the most difficult questions you can ever be asked in life: too low and you're obviously not worth it, too high and you're clearly over-qualified. The \"interests\" section looked innocuous but was in fact the most difficult. If you're into quad bike polo and nude bungee jumping are you really going to be committed to that archiving and clerical role? CVs have moved online to LinkedIn but that has its own special dangers. Anything less that 500+ connections shows that you're clearly not the serious networker you pretend to be. And then of course there is the unwritten rule of LinkedIn: if more people want to connect with you than you want to connect with, then perhaps it's time to come off. Even so, LinkedIn is still better than Facebook which is like having your drunk friends writing your CV for you. Both Facebook and Twitter allow any potential employer to follow you home and sniff your fridge. In the good old days employers used to hire private detectives to find out what you're now merrily posting online. Before you despair about your online anti-employment campaign console yourself with the fact that you'll probably have to apply for your job online and that a loftily disinterested computer will make the first cut. Employers often say they hire on attitude rather than skills and then use a computerised system that filters out anyone lacking the right skills. Which is not a pretty or sensible algorithm but it saves time and therefore money. Computers have their limitations but surely they can help promote diversity in recruitment? When you have a stack of CVs to sort you tend to pick the ones that feel familiar, most like your own in fact. Anonymised applications help to get past this but at some stage you also want to get a feel for the person and a feel normally means a look and that's when looks start to matter. So it sounds like we're back to square one with the CV and photo. But not quite. One of the reasons CVs have lost their power is that generations X, Y and Z are much pickier about what they do and who they work for (even in a recession). They're looking for a lot more than salary and pension, they're looking for ethical, engaged, empowering things to do. With the internet they have all the career information they'll ever need, so it's really down to employers to sell to them. Increasingly organisations have to worry about their own CVs. And funnily enough their CVs are also on social media, a textured weave of opinions from customers, staff, whistleblowers and robotically pleasant corporate communication types. Surely top people are still appointed in private smoke-filled rooms? Not really because there's precious little real or metaphorical smoke in offices. The big change is that the whole employment world is now more transparent. Forums and user groups introduce people horizontally across whole sectors. There are very few dark horses or surprise candidates. People live their whole working lives in a permanent always-on interactive CV. Swapping actual host employers is almost the least remarkable part of a CV. One lovely part of old-style CVs was references. Ideally this would be a magistrate and a bishop or a friend willing to pretend they were both. Now a LinkedIn profile means you can be recommended and endorsed publicly by everyone, although this carries as much weight as being \"liked\" on Facebook. What would be really useful is a \"Steer Clear\" button. It works on TripAdvisor, so why not on Employee Advisor? In fact, I can sense a business opportunity right there (send me your CVs if you're interested).",
