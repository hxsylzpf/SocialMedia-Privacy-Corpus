  "content": "It's good news for social commerce apps; New York-basedFancy has just raised $53m (\u00a335.5m) on a valuation of $600m (\u00a3401m). Fancy, a site where users can upload images of items they 'fancy' or 'want', has received investment from the likes of Will Smith and American Express in their latest round of funding, according to Bloomberg. Previous funding rounds have seen them raise a total of $60m, with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey among its investors. In addition to selling individual items, Fancy users can subscribe to receive monthly 'boxes' in the post, with a number of these endorsed by celebrities such as Ashton Kutcher, Pink and even Jennifer Love Hewitt. It is no wonder then that the company generates \u00a33 in revenue each month, according to the Bloomberg report. Based in New York's SoHo, the Pinterest-rival will likely use the funding to expand its operation but the company is being fairly discreet about their future.",
