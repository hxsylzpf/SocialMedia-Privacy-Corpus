  "content": "Hundreds of friends, relations and sympathisers obeyed the request to \"dress cheerfully\" and turned up in bright colours including yellow, pink and purple onesies for the funeral of Hannah Smith, the 14-year-old who killed herself after being tormented by bullies on the Ask.fm website. The church was decorated with purple and white balloons, and a banner reading \"be happy for Hannah\" hung from the pulpit. Her father David Smith wore a blue T-shirt and jeans as he helped carry the coffin \u2013 coloured purple which was her favourite colour \u2013 with the words \"I love you\" written on the side. Instead of a hearse, he drove the coffin himself in the family car to the church of St Mary's in Lutterworth, Leicestershire. Her 16-year-old sister Jo, who found the body in Hannah's bedroom two weeks ago, followed the coffin wearing a pink onesie. The service began with the Phil Collins track In the Air Tonight, ended with the Madness song One Step Beyond which she loved to dance to, and included readings by her headteacher Nora Parker and her cousin Ben Hubbard. The celebrant, the Rev Charlie Styles, said they had tried to create an informal and joyful feel for the service, respecting her father's insistence that it should be a celebration. \"We had a reading that expressed something of what the family felt about Hannah's life \u2013 it was called The Unfinished and it really spoke about how, even if a life is short, it doesn't make it less valuable.\" Afterwards, to a count of \"1-2-3 \u2013 goodbye!\" from Styles, more than 400 mourners released balloons into the air from the churchyard. Despite relentless rain, the commemoration ended in a barbecue. \"Today isn't a day for campaigning or politics; it's a day for saying goodbye, but instead of flowers or anything like that, Dave has asked for donations to Harborough Against Bullying,\" Styles said. After the funeral, the group posted on its Facebook page: \"A beautiful service, surrounded by people in all colours coming together to say goodbye to Hannah. Travel safely Angel. There were tears and smiles. Our thoughts are with all of her family and friends. We will carrying on fighting for change and educating people on how they can stay safer on line. Together we make a difference . Please do not suffer in silence. We are here.\" Hannah was relentlessly bullied by anonymous users of the Ask.fm question and answer website, including some who urged her drink bleach or to kill herself. The Latvian-based company's review of its anti-bullying measures was due to be announced on Friday, but was postponed until Monday as a mark of respect to Hannah and her family.",
