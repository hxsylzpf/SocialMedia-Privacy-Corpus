French authorities are pondering this question after a series of giant public cocktail parties inspired by the social networking site Facebook. The phenomenon of \"ap\u00e9ros g\u00e9ants\" (giant aperitifs), which first appeared in Brittany last year, has thrown the country's leaders and lawmakers into a spin. Should they turn a blind eye and hope the drinkers will get bored, or should they crack down on them? Large numbers of young people getting together and drinking until they fall over is hardly new, even in France where \"le binge drinking\" is not part of the traditional cultural heritage. Some official party-poopers saw something vaguely sinister, unpredictable and possibly revolutionary in the prospect of thousands of strangers being brought together by the web, and banned them. Other local authorities allowed the ap\u00e9ros to go ahead but sought to dissuade youngsters from turning up. In the event, more than 50 such parties have taken place across France over the last year without making the headlines and with consequences hardly worse than the average rave party, music festival or football match. That changed earlier this month when a 21-year-old partygoer didn't just get drunk and fall over; he fell off a bridge and died after reportedly drinking up to 15 glasses of spirits. It was a tragic and entirely avoidable death, but not exactly singular in the history of youthful excess. Overnight the ap\u00e9ro g\u00e9ant became an issue of public order and political concern, particularly to president Nicolas Sarkozy's right-of-centre government, which was elected on a tough law-and-order platform. Although it pulled up short of imposing an outright ban, the official response to the ap\u00e9ros was heavy-handed at best, repressive at worst. Last weekend, French riot police, in their Robocop outfits, descended on the Eiffel Tower, where they vastly outnumbered the revellers who had turned up for the latest advertised ap\u00e9ro. True, drinking alcohol is banned on the Champ de Mars, the open space by the tower. True, failing to get permission for a \"public demonstration\" carries a possible \u20ac7,500 fine and six months in jail. And true, the authorities could not possibly know how many people would take up the invitation, as many a naive teenager has discovered after announcing their party on Facebook. Even so, the sight of armed police rifling through tourists' bags searching for bottles of alcohol in a country that prides itself on being the cradle of civil liberties was shocking. These giant ap\u00e9ros have the French authorities running scared on several fronts: being a potentially explosive mix of the unpredictable, the uncontrollable and le binge drinking. That this negative Anglicism, like \"les hooligans\", \"les hackers\" and \"le fast food\", appears to have escaped the censure of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise \u2013 guardians of the French language \u2013 reveals perhaps a subconscious effort to single them out as pernicious Anglo-Saxon imports. There is a popular misconception that French children learn the art of moderate drinking with a glass of diluted red on maman's knee. But there is nothing moderate in the drinking behaviour of French university students enjoying an \"open bar\" evening \u2013 another Anglicism \u2013 where for a nominal entrance fee drink companies, sanctioned by the university or college authorities, supply unlimited free alcohol. Threats to track down and charge the organisers of Facebook ap\u00e9ros also show that while the French like their individual civil liberties, they place an even greater importance on collective rights and freedoms. As French MP Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9 remarked recently when talking about the potentially even more explosive issue of France's proposed ban on the burka: \"Individual liberty is vital, but individuals, like communities, must accept compromises that are indispensable to living together, in the name of certain principles that are essential to the common good.\" But many French internet commentators were less than impressed with the scenes at the Eiffel Tower. As one wrote: \"Has someone decreed a state of emergency? \u2026 Vive la Libert\u00e9!\".",
