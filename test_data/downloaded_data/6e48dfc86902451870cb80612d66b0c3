It will replace the Vodafone Live suite of mobile internet services, which was heralded as the company's most important launch ever when it was unveiled seven years ago but has been made to look \"tired\" by the recent proliferation of mobile applications and the success of devices such as the iPhone, Palm Pre and handsets using Google's Android software. Vodafone 360 is an attempt by the world's largest network to retain the direct connection between mobile phone operators and consumers which these new devices have undermined by allowing users to download their own applications from third-party \"app stores\", such as the Android Marketplace. The explosion in touchscreen devices and the success of the iTunes apps store has made downloadable mobile widgets the hottest thing in mobile technology and has given handset manufacturers a way of making revenues from users above and beyond the initial sale of a handset. Nokia, with its Ovi store, RIM, with its Blackberry App World, and Samsung have all leapt into the applications market. But all these services risk turning the mobile phone operators into little more than providers carrying traffic for other people's services. Vodafone stocks the iPhone in 11 countries and sells the HTC Magic, which uses Google's Android platform, in the UK; but it has long maintained that the most important relationship for a mobile phone customer should be with their network, not with the maker of their handset. In May, the company announced it would be launching its own application store later this year and gave software developers the information they need to design applications for phones supporting the new Vodafone store. Unlike Apple's iTunes and Google's Android Marketplace, however, users will be able to buy applications by adding the cost to their phone bills, instead of having to register a credit card with a third party such as Apple. Last year Vodafone also snapped up a small mobile start-up called Zyb for \u20ac31.5m (\u00a328.5m), which had developed software that lets mobile phone users share information and messages between friends and colleagues held in their mobile phone's address book. It has used Zyb's software to produce a social networking service called Vodafone People which will also form part of the new Vodafone 360 service. But Vodafone 360 goes further, integrating a host of social networking services so that users can see at a glance what their friends are doing without having to switch between different applications on the phone. It will initially be launched on a new Samsung phone, to be unveiled on 24 September but Vodafone intends to roll Vodafone 360 across its global footprint in the same was as Vodafone Live extended across countries and handsets. When it unveiled Vodafone Live in 2002, the company underlined its importance because it was designed to persuade customers to do far more than just make phone calls and send texts. Two years later the company migrated Vodafone Live onto its 3G mobile broadband platform, adding services such as downloadable music tracks and maps. The news of Vodafone 360 comes as the company ponders the challenge raised by the recently announced merger between Orange and T-Mobile, which will create the UK's largest mobile phone company. Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao, who will provide a brief strategy update on Thursday when Vodafone 360 is announced, is understood to have asked the board whether they would back a sale of some of the company's overseas assets in order to provide the funds to buy T-Mobile UK. The board, however, is understood to have ruled that Vodafone UK should instead be given the marketing flexibility to compete hard with the merged entity, which is likely to spend the next two years organising itself. There is still the possibility, however, that Vodafone could do a deal with the UK's fifth mobile phone network 3. The Hong Kong-based owner of 3 UK, Hutchison Whampoa, is currently talking with both Orange and T-Mobile \u2013 with both of whom it has network agreements \u2013 to see whether it can get better financial terms under their merger. But Vodafone has already done a deal with Hutchison in Australia, where the two companies pooled their networks, and such a move is understood to be an option in the UK if Hutchison decides to jump ship.",
