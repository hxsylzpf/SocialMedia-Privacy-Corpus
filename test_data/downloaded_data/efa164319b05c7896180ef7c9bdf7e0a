  "content": "The Daily Mail runs another resounding editorial: \"Only a free press can lift the lid on scandal.\" Though a few dossiers short of a load, this is at least a good point. The Mail plays a bravura role whenever press freedom is threatened, including the supposed right to be forgotten. But do ordinary readers judge by deeds as well as by words alone? Did they choke when, that selfsame day, a story about George Clooney's fianc\u00e9e and her family was withdrawn apologetically after an irate George dismantled it? And did they gag over half a front page given to \"hollow-eyed, pock-marked \u2026 Angelina Jolie, the junkie, captured on camera\"? Captured, that is, in 1999 by a convicted drug dealer who dished his old dirt to the US National Enquirer, which seems to have done a deal with the Mail. Thrill to her \"emaciated frame\" and \"dirt-encrusted fingernails\". Wonder how this young, troubled actor went on to have six children with Brad Pitt and travel the charitable world with William Hague. It would all be utterly surprising \u2013 if Ms Jolie hadn't talked frankly, years ago, about the \"heavier, darker times\" in her life. \"I didn't die young, so I'm very lucky\". None of this was new, then. Even the drug dealer has peddled his memories before. \"Watch the astonishing footage on Mail Online.\" No thanks. There's no remote scandal here, just grubby leftovers in Jolie's long march (on a suddenly kindlier day two) from \"heroin to heroine\". Perhaps UK print Mail and worldwide Mail Online dance to different tunes. Perhaps there isn't a right to be forgotten, any more than American privacy rights can survive moral transfer, via the National Enquirer, to Britain. But there is, surely, an opportunity for redemption, a chance to make a new, better life. You might even call it a human right to be treated with humanity by a free but humane press?",
