  "content": "Brands are wrangling \"big data\", trying to make sense of it and build social media marketing strategies upon its findings. Marketers have whipped themselves into a frenzy over the possibilities of social data, and the number of providers has proliferated to meet this demand; Twitter recently purchased Gnip for an undisclosed amount. However, here are five inconvenient truths about what the data can't tell you, even if data providers tell you it can: 1) Social media profiles: Lies and half truths Using social data to identify a target demographic is limited by what social media users choose to share about themselves and the self-proclaimed titles they select. Given that Twitter is infested with spam \"robot\" accounts (those with the \"sequential\" account names, suspicious-looking tweets and extreme following/follower ratios) and Facebook estimates it has 83m fake accounts, it's highly likely that any social data haul will net spoof accounts. If a brand wants to target UK-based female directors, for example, a caveat is that the data collected is merely representative of this demographic; including profiles based on unverified information and excluding profiles that do not use the exact search terms or do not list additional information indicative of gender, such as \"mum\". Why this matters: Brands want to profile, segment, and listen to their fan base to understand who they are, what they like and who they are connected to for richer segmentation and incisive planning. Social data offers an imperfect but noteworthy additional tool to achieve this. 2) Social conversation mapping by geography According to Pulsar, a social data intelligence platform, fewer than 5% of social media users make their location publicly available on their profiles. This means that while the technology exists to enable social media conversation \"mapping\", limited user data tends to make the findings statistically irrelevant. Why this matters: Brands want to pin-point where a target audience is based, making it easier to allocate marketing and event sponsorship spend and more likely to provide increased return on investment (ROI). If statistically relevant, this data could have huge ramifications for budget and resource allocation. 3) Automated sentiment analysis is pretty pointless without human 'overlay' Social data providers will typically tell you that automated sentiment analysis is between 70% and 80% accurate. However, research by FreshMinds, an insight and innovation consultancy, found that since the majority of posts (in one test case, 80%) are neutral in sentiment, the accuracy of assigning positive/negative sentiment to the remaining posts drops to around 30% (compared with a human analyst). \"More often than not, a positive comment will be classified as negative or vice-versa. In fact, no tool managed to get all the positive or negative statements correctly classified. Sentiment analysis can be useful when making relative comparisons between brands or products in a similar space as the algorithms will broadly get it just as wrong for all the brands,\" said Matt Rhodes, digital director of FreshMinds. Human linguistics are complex and comments are open to interpretation, particularly where context is lacking and sarcasm used so sentiment analysis, whether via human or algorithm, continues to be subjective. Why this matters: Brands use social data for a wide variety of reasons. As a leading indicator, sentiment analysis can help predict outcomes (from political events to product launches) and provide real-time insight into how people feel about a brand and its products \u2013 and how this sentiment compares with the brand's competitors. As a lagging indicator, sentiment analysis can help with anything from measuring the ROI of a marketing campaign to highlighting dissatisfaction with customer \"touch points\" that could be addressed internally. Ultimately, a brand may do well to use a data provider to discount the \"neutral\" posts and employ a human to sift through the remaining posts for real insight. 4) Keyword and topic searches can seriously disappoint Interrogating the content of social media posts should provide insight into the nature of relevant online conversations. However, potentially due to the high volume of \"neutral\" posts and retweets, keyword and topic searches can disappoint and provide a huge amount of unrelated nouns such as \"time\", \"help\" and \"2014\", which without context are as good as meaningless. Most social media comments are not about brands or services, and where they are they tend to be polarising views (the very good or very bad). This leaves great holes in the information gathered. Why this matters: Brands want to know what their target audience are actually saying, what terminology they use and what they care about. In my experience, keyword and topic searches promise the world but under-deliver. Arguably, the overall data collection may provide much-needed context but the data alone can't replace a significant investment of human analysis hours. 5) Changing social media dynamics As the demographics of users joining social networks change, new social networks emerge and user behaviour evolves, the tougher it is to make meaningful comparisons between social data sets. Why this matters: Social media is in constant flux; without consistency, the accuracy of social media measurements is limited and marketers struggle to compare campaigns or activities, for example this year versus last year. The verdict With \"big data\" comes big noise and while social data providers are staking their futures on slicing and dicing this information into commercially relevant insights, the algorithms and practices are still at the initial stage. A huge caveat is that data providers differentiate themselves based on the algorithms they use to capture and interrogate data, the API arrangements they have with various social network platforms and the quality of their data visualisations which help transform the mass of information into a meaningful insight. I am hugely excited about the potential of social data to serve marketers but to do big data right requires solid, \"clean\" information, plenty of context and the human investment to draw proper conclusions.
