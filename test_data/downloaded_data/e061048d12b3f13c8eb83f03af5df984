Digg Dialogg will accept text or video questions and, using the familiar Digg voting system, questions will be voted up or down in priority according to their popularity with the Digg community.

Digg is partnering with CNN's iReport for the first batch of these during the US party conventions and the first interview will be with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. As of this morning, the most Dugg questions were: \u2022 \"Please describe what Net Neutrality is and your position on the issue.\" \u2022 \"Will the Democrats do the right thing if Obama wins the presidency and vote to repeal anti-freedom measures such as the Patriot Act, ban warrantless wiretapping, and make sure that all prisoners held by the US enjoy the same civil rights (including habeas corpus)?\" \u2022 \"As a taxable resource, what stops marijuana from being legalized, for medicinal or recreational purposes, throughout the country?\" \u2022 \"Why has the Democratic Party failed to stand up to or oppose the Bush Administration on anything of any significnace in the last eight years?\" \u2022 \"Does your support for telecom immunity have anything to do with the fact that your husband has millions invested in AT&amp;T?\" Questions are open for another 20 hours (and counting) and there's some feisty, well-considered and robust arguments in here. It's fascinating to see how effective the Digg community is when focused around a particular topic in this way; would a UK equivalent have the same momentum?",
