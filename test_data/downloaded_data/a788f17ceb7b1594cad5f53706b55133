North Korea had been assumed to be behind last week's DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks on South Korean websites and prominent US targets including the White House, Pentagon, treasury department and the Nasdaq stock exchange. However, Nguyen Minh Duc, security director at Bkis in Hanoi, Vietnam, says his company has \"located the attacking source in [the] UK\". Bkis was brought in by KrCERT, the Korean Computer Emergency Response Team, to help analyse the malware that was performing the attacks using a botnet of at least 166,908 \"zombie\" computers in 74 countries. The zombies mount attacks by flooding servers with traffic til they can't cope. They are unable to handle normal traffic, and may be taken down. This may be electronic vandalism, but DDoS attacks have also been used in attempts at blackmail. PandaLabs has published a list of the sites attacked. Most belong to the governments of South Korea and the US.In a blog post, Bkis says the botnet was controlled by eight Command and Control (C&amp;C) servers via code embedded in a file named \"flash.gif\". Every three minutes, a zombie would connect to one of these servers to receive orders. \"Especially, we found a master server located in [the] UK which controls all of the eight C&amp;C servers,\" says the post. Bkis thinks it should be possible to catch the hackers. However, an official from the Korea Communications Commission told the Korea Times: \"We don't know that the attackers were actually based in Britain, or mainly hacked a British IP address and used it for delivery.\" Also, the malware industry operates on a commercial basis, sometimes offering performance guarantees and other terms of service. Botnets are available for rent, and the real perpetrator of the attacks could simply have paid for them. However, there is evidence against that speculation. Vincent Weafer, vice-president of Symantec Security Response, told USA Today that some zombie machines had been instructed \"to erase all work files associated with office, business and development applications\" and to destroy \"the master boot program so as to render the PC inoperable the next time the user reboots\". Bot-herders tend to look after their money-making flocks. The malware used in the attack is known as MyDoom.HN, and only affects Windows computers. It was first used in 2004 to mount a DDoS attack on SCO Group, which was claiming that Linux used some of its copyright Unix code. SCO offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person who had developed it, who appears to be from Russia. Microsoft also offered a $250,000 reward for information about the creator of a variant, Mydoom.B, used to attack Microsoft sites. Google was attacked later. MyDoom was typically distributed as an email attachment or via the Kazaa peer-to-peer filesharing network. However, it has been recognised by competent antivirus software for the past five years.",
