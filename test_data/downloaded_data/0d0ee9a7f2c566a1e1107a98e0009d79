But the message \u2013 \"Chapa tu choro\" or \"catch your thief\" \u2013 has gone viral, triggering a social-media driven vigilante movement across Peru, and prompting a wave of violent reprisals against suspected criminals. Since the campaign began in August, more than 100 \"Catch your thief\" Facebook pages have popped up, exhorting brutal punishment for criminals and posting graphic online videos of vigilantism. Dozens of videos show savage beatings. Suspected thieves are stripped to their underwear, bound to posts, punched and kicked, and beaten with belts or pieces of wood. One video shows a woman stripped half-naked and forced to walk with a placard saying \"I'm a thief\". Another online video shows a man accused of robbing a lorry being beaten; it later transpired he was a curious neighbour who had nothing to do with the crime. Since the campaign began, three men have been killed: two suspected murderers were burnt to death in the town of Andas, in the Andean region of Huanuco, while in the northern city of Trujillo, a 17-year-old was shot dead after allegedly stealing a mobile phone. The campaign began when Cecilia Garc\u00eda, a journalist in Huancayo, described how she and her neighbours had caught a thief and handed him over to the police, only to see him released after half an hour. She was so outraged she began the campaign calling for people to take justice into their own hands rather than hand criminals over to the authorities, she told RPP, a national radio station. \"The people are expressing their indignation through social media,\" she said. Garc\u00eda has rejected accusations that she should be held responsible for any deaths caused by vigilantes, telling El Comercio newspaper: \"The government doesn't want to accept its ineptitude and is looking for someone to blame.\" In Cerro El Pino, one of Lima's most crime-ridden neighbourhoods, Holler V\u00edlchez echoed such sentiments. \"There were so many muggings, residents started to take justice into their own hands,\" he said. Local vigilante groups known as ronderos patrol these steep, labyrinthine streets where almost every house, however humble, has a wrought-iron door and metal bars on the windows. \"The police never came when we most needed them, they would say they didn't have a car, or didn't have enough fuel, or would arrive an hour later. So we catch our criminal and punish him ourselves,\" said V\u00edlchez. Taking out a tattered envelope, he selected an image of a young man wide-eyed with terror surrounded by men whose faces are concealed by balaclavas. Other photos show the same alleged thief chained to a sign a few metres from where Vilchez stands. It reads: \"Here we hang criminals, drug addicts and rapists. We will burn them alive.\" The original \"Catch your thief\" Facebook page has spawned ever-more violent copycats, including \"Catch your thief and leave him paralysed\", \"Catch your thief and castrate him\" or even \"Catch your thief and hang him\". Earlier this month the interior minister, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds P\u00e9rez Guadalupe, attempted to rein in such vengeful urges: \"Catch your thief but hand him over to the police,\" he said. \"If they want to take justice into their own hands, the country's justice system must also judge them.\" But few Peruvians trust that system to deliver justice: A recent Ipsos poll of Lima residents showed 55% do not trust the police, and 79% have no faith in the judiciary. Another poll, by market research company GfK, showed that 72% of Lima residents broadly backed the \"Catch your thief\" movement. And other officials have proved more ambivalent in their reaction to the spate of violence. Lima's mayor, Luis Casta\u00f1eda, said the campaign could have a \"dissuasive effect\" on crime. Jorge Yamamoto, a social psychologist at Lima's Catholic University, said that while popular justice has long been a part of Peruvian life, social media has triggered the escalation of vigilante acts. \"When the police and judicial system is dysfunctional, it's like a powder keg which can be set off by the media and people's own experiences,\" he said. \"Social media has such penetration in society that it can act as a trigger to this kind of behaviour.\"",
