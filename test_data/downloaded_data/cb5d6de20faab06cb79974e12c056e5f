  "content": "Oscar Wilde described foxhunting as \"the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable\". If Wilde had been able to see the diminutive tyrant who is currently president of France going on last week about bringing the internet to heel, he might have updated his hunting metaphor to \"the clueless in pursuit of the unattainable\" perhaps. Sarkozy was speaking at the eG8, a gathering of those whom the French government thinks are the important players in the online world. But in a way, he was just acting as a mouthpiece for the political, judicial, commercial and security establishments which are becoming increasingly hysterical about the way the internet is upending their respective applecarts. In that sense, Sarky was echoing the fulminations of England's lord chief justice that \"technology is out of control\", by which he meant, as Peter Preston has pointed out, is beyond his control. Establishment panic about the net's disruptiveness is matched by renewed outbreaks of an age-old neurosis \u2013 moral panic about the impact of new communications technology on young people. This was fuelled last week by a report that Facebook was going to allow children under the age of 13 to become members. US law currently insists that websites that collect information about users (as Facebook does) aren't allowed to sign on anyone under the age of 13. But Mark Zuckerberg is, apparently, determined to change this. Learning is a social process, he argues, and social networking has great educational potential. This is true, but what Zuck omitted to mention is that kids also represent a great, er, marketing opportunity. I'll be amazed if US lawmakers let Zuckerberg have his way, so this may turn out to be a damp squib. A more enduring problem is the fixed conviction of the adult world that young people are being seduced, hoodwinked, fixated, dumbed down (insert favourite downside here) by Facebook and Twitter. The story of the young graduate applying for a job and being confronted at the interview with daft or embarrassing photographs from his or her Facebooked past has become a tiresome cliche. What it overlooks is the fact that in five years' time, the interviewers will themselves have embarrassing photographs on Facebook. The caravan moves on. Much of the moral panic about social networking is a projection of adult fears. A neurosis, as Ken Tynan wisely observed, is a secret that you don't know you're keeping. Many teenagers do silly things online; what their parents forget is that they also did silly things in their youth. So the more obstreperous aspects of Facebooking are neither here nor there. What's much more interesting is that anthropological research into teenagers' use of social networking sites is unearthing evidence of complex and sophisticated behaviour. One sees this, for example, in the ways Facebook users handle the difficult business of relationship break-ups. In thinking about this, I was struck by a story from the field studies conducted by Danah Boyd of Microsoft Research, who is probably the world's leading expert on this stuff. \"Case #1: Carmen, a 17-year-old Latina girl living in Boston, was having a bad day. She and her boyfriend broke up and she wanted her friends to know that she was feeling sad. Her first instinct was to post a sappy song lyric to her Facebook, but she decided against doing so out of fear that her mother would take it seriously and think she was suicidal. Instead, she chose song lyrics from 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life', knowing that her mother wouldn't recognise the song or the reference while her friends would immediately recognise that this song was sung in Life of Brian when the main character was about to be executed.\" This probably won't make much sense to the French president or our lord chief justice, but to anyone who is really interested in understanding what's going on, it's intriguing. \"Carmen,\" says Boyd, \"is not trying to restrict access to content, but trying to limit access to interpretation. This can best be understood as a 'social steganography' technique; Carmen is hiding in plain sight, assuming that anyone can access what she is saying but that only some people understand the meaning. She relies on the fact that her mother doesn't recognise song lyrics, let alone bother to look them up: she takes text at face value. Meanwhile, Carmen also assumes that anyone who knows the Monty Python movie but doesn't know her won't understand why she's posting the lyrics in the first place. In controlling the meaning, Carmen asserts agency over the social situation.\" Deep waters, eh? What Boyd's research suggests to me is that before presidents, judges and politicians pontificate about social networking, they might first consider reading Wittgenstein. \"Whereof one cannot speak,\" he wrote in the Tractatus, \"thereof one must be silent.\"",
