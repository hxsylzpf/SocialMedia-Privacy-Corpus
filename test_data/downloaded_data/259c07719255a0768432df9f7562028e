  "content": "Neil Diamond and Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst are, er, tweeting. The travesty began when Diamond, singer-songwriter extraordinaire, suggested some books to fans on his official Twitter account. \"2 book recommendations,\" he wrote. \"Going Deep by Gary Smith \u2013 inspirational sports stories &amp; The Soul of Nature by Herb Cohen \u2013 deep and fascinating.\" While most of Diamond's Twitter followers \u2013 and there are almost 7,000 of them \u2013 were busy reaching for their library cards, one particular fan sent him a message. \"@NeilDiamond,\" wrote Fred Durst, the red baseball-capped frontman of Limp Bizkit. \"I am a huge fan of yours. We should do a collaboration \u2013 Neil Diamond meets my band Limp Bizkit. Sounds fresh.\" Whereas we would expect Diamond to say \"Limp who?\" and, hopefully, \"Limp no thanks!\", the man who wrote Sweet Caroline instead seemed to leap from his seat. \"@freddurst I'd love to, where and when?\" Durst responded with jubilant tweeting. \"FANTASTIC!!!!! Incredible!!\" he Twittered. \"What a dream come true thanks to Twitter!! I'm in LA. Follow me and we can direct message.\" And there the trail goes cold. At this moment, Durst and Diamond may be direct messaging lyrics, chord tabs, or ideas for album photoshoots. Worse, they may in a Malibu recording studio, trying out a rap-rock cover of Cracklin' Rosie.",
