  "content": "The Faustian deal involved in modern celebrity culture was never more clearly illustrated than in the painful exposure of the Beckhams' home life in last Sunday's News of the World. The Beckhams are mega celebs. No one disputes that they have, over the years, exploited every possible media opportunity to promote their talents - football and music - as well as their relationship. Brand Beckham. The price they must now pay is evidently to have every detail of their marriage disgorged - presumably for a considerable fee - by the nanny who for two years lived under the same roof and who looked after their children. The nanny, Abbie Gibson, signed a confidentiality agreement before starting work for the Beckhams. But at the weekend a judge decided that the public interest in the \"true\" nature of the Beckhams' marriage overcame any obligation of confidence. And so it was that millions of readers were treated to seven pages of eavesdropped marital rows, tearful confessions, diaries and text messages. Can you believe in freedom of expression, disapprove of hypocrisy and yet still feel troubled by these articles and by the ruling of Mr Justice Langley? We can. The effect of the ruling is to say that the Beckhams have no right to privacy at all. There are now no circumstances in which they can employ anyone without fearing that their innermost secrets can be traded for cash. They might as well employ a News of the World reporter as their next nanny (step forward Mazher Mahmood?). That, indeed, would be preferable to living in a relationship of trust with a supposed confidante. In defending libel cases, newspapers find it extraordinarily difficult to plead the public interest, as the Wall Street Journal recently found to its cost. In kiss-and-tell cases - thanks to Lord Woolf's judgment in the Gary Flitcroft case - the public interest bar is much lower. Can it be long before newspapers try to place \"nannies\" with celebrities knowing that they will be protected if the nanny encounters evidence of hypocrisy. It may all be the price of freedom of the press. That doesn't mean we have to like it.",
