I use my photos to create a register of this amazing city through its spaces.\" He believes one of the most interesting things about the architecture in Caracas is \"the mix of cultures reflected in the buildings \u2013 from reinterpretations of the country's native architecture to the styles which were adopted after the arrival of the Spanish. This results in a city of contrasts, where architectural treasures are hidden in the streets.\" Follow @guardiancities on Instagram and tag your best city shots with #guardiancities.",
