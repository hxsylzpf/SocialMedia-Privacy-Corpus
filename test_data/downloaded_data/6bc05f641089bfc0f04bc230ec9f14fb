  "content": "Name: Tinder. Age: Launched in September 2012. Appearance: An identity parade of shags. What is it? It's an app. What kind of app? The kind that helps you meet people for sex. There are a lot of those about. Yep. Sex has become pretty popular. So what's this one done? The technical term is \"popped\". Meaning? Meaning people are going wild for it. How wild? Pretty wild. Within six months of its launch Tinder had an estimated 500,000 users and a day-over-day growth rate of around 5%. The founders haven't released official figures but, on those numbers, it is almost certainly past the millionth user mark by now. So how come it popped? Because it does something different. Which is? Rejects rejection. Tinder users browse photos of potential partners and indicate whether they \"like\" them with a swipe of the screen \u2013 but their decision is made known only to people who have \"liked\" them in return. Potential mates can get in contact only when both of them \"like\" each other. Why is \"like\" in inverted commas there? Because it means \"would be willing to have sex with\". Ah. So what's so good about the Tinder system? It does away with the very worst parts of online dating: for the people sending messages, the pain of knowing that every unanswered \"How you doin?\" is a flat-out rejection; for the highly pursued hotties, the tedium of wading through a thousand sleazy \"How you doin?\" messages to find the one who's asking \"What's your favourite Toto song?\" So what kind of people are on there? You mean apart from horny people? Yeah, that was a given. Well, anyone and everyone. The average age of users is 27 and most are just looking for something casual \u2013 but, according to Sean Rad, Tinder's CEO, there have already been several weddings and there are a fair few celebs on it too. Hah. Sure. Something tells me Ryan Gosling wouldn't \"like\" me back. Well, at least if he doesn't, he won't find out you fancied him in the first place. Do say: \"Hey, Ryan, how you doin'?\" Don't say: \"So glad Ryan Gosling doesn't know I fancy him. Imagine the embarrassment!\"",
