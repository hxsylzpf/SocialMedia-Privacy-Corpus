The two latest prototypes caught my eye because they are both music tools. Firstly, Chris Riley's latest version of Track Playing shows the current track on BBC stations Radio 1, Radio 2, Six Music and 1Xtra and then aggregates biographical information, track listings, links to online retail stores and any other information it can find about that artist. By adding your Last.fm username, it will also show whether you like that artists or not - just in case you weren't sure. Apparently I'm indifferent to Kid Rock. Something like that, yes. The second is, I'm afraid, a Twitter application. (I know I hardly ever mention Twitter, cough...) Adam Lindsay's 'Twitter bot with a memory' trawls sites like Last.fm and the BBC's programme pages to find music recommendations. So send a message (@ or DM) to @recomme with an artist name, and it will reply with recommendations. I said Vampire Weekend, Recomme said: \"Try Black Kids, White Rabbits, The Affair, epo-555, Shout Out Louds, Remy Zero.\" I said Bon Iver, Recomme said: \"Phosphorescent, Castanets, Bowerbirds, Chris Garneau, Peter and the Wolf, Julie Doiron.\" Both early days and seeds of ideas but very interesting. What will they be when they grow up? \u2022 Update: Muxtape is reborn - as OpenTape. It's really a closed version of Muxtape; download the Opentape software, put it on your server and then upload the tracks you want on your mixtape. It doesn't feel the same, somehow...",
