  "content": "On Saturday 5 February, at least 80 events will be taking place across the UK as people protest against library closures. We would like you to help us build up a picture of the level of protest to save libraries across the UK. Give each protest that is taking place at a library near you a score for the intensity of its efforts (on a scale of 1-5 - see below) and we'll plot the results on this map. All you have to do is tweet your postcode and score with the hashtag #savelibraries eg NW10 3 #savelibraries or CV32 4 #savelibraries. If you don't use Twitter, you can enter the information using the form next to the map. We'll update the map regularly with your findings. What level of protest is taking place at your local library? 1) One person holding a \"Sssh\" sign 2) Several people have gathered to protest 3) An organised read-in/sssh-in with more than 20 people 4) An author turns up to speak/read 5) There are no books left on the shelves",
