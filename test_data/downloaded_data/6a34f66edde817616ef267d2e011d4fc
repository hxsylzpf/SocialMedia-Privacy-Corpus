  "content": "Johnston Press has confirmed its decision to fire Jon Stokoe, editor of a weekly newspaper that managed to defy the circulation trend by adding sales. Stokoe, editor of the Whitby Gazette, has been on \"gardening leave\" since early March after the publisher, as part of its strategic restructure plans, closed the paper's office and placed it under the control of the Scarborough News editor. As I reported at the time, Stokoe's sympathetic colleagues accepted that Johnston Press would not change its mind. Nor did a campaign on the editor's behalf, with a petition plus obligatory Facebook and Twitter support, make any difference. The Press Gazette also gave him firm support but its editor, Dominic Ponsford, conceded today that the campaign \"was probably doomed to failure from the start.\" Ponsford believes that Stokoe is \"a victim of the brutal economics of a newspaper business which is still shackled by huge debt.\" He argues that Johnston Press's chief executive, Ashley Highfield, has little choice but to rationalise the business because of \"the massive debts he inherited from predecessors.\" So why back Stokoe in a doomed campaign? Here's Ponsford's explanation (which I heartily support): \"Press Gazette backed Stokoe because we instinctively felt it was a terribly negative move not just for Johnston Press, but the entire regional newspaper industry, to make one of the company's most successful editors redundant. The Whitby Gazette was the fifth best performing fully paid-for weekly newspaper in the country in the second half of 2012. Only 13 out of 373 paid-for weekly titles audited by ABC managed to increase their sales in that period. But instead of rewarding one of its most successful editors, Johnston Press gave Stokoe his marching orders because editors have become a luxury it cannot afford to have at every title. In common with many other local weekly newspapers across the UK the Whitby Gazette will now come under a group editor.\" The Gazette, as with every Johnston Press title, is profitable. Johnston Press is profitable. But the profits are falling, revenue is falling and the debt mountain, \u00a3319.4m, must be serviced. Highfield is saddled with the problem of trying to pay down some of the debt and renegotiating the rest to achieve a lower interest rate. As Ponsford concludes: \"In a sense he has little choice at present but to bleed the company for the benefit of the banks. But this is little consolation for Stokoe, or the people of Whitby. \"And it is a tale being told up and down the country where towns are losing local newspaper offices and locally-based editors.\" But should we journalists sit back and let this happen? Should politicians, who supposedly love the local and regional press, allow papers to be treated to cut after cut? Is it not time to consider a new way of funding local journalism before it's too late? Journalism is too important to our democracy to be permitted to wither on the vine because rapacious bankers are squeezing companies that put profit before public service.
