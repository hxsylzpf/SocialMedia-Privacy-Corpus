  "content": "Yes Joanna Moorhead So, 11- and 12-year-olds across Britain and the US are standing by in the hope that Mark Zuckerberg's plea for under-13s to be allowed to use Facebook is heard by their countries' decision-makers. Only, of course, they aren't . . . because they are already on it, tapping away furiously like all their mates, finding out what shopping centre to meet in after school tomorrow and what park to hang out in on Saturday afternoon. Under-13s might be banned from having Facebook accounts, both here and in the US, but that hasn't stopped hundreds of thousands of them from using false dates of birth to rule-dodge. Yes, of course parents like me worry that means our kids are at risk of both being bullied and of bullying others . . . but the important thing to realise here is that Facebook is only an arena for bullying, like the school lunch hall or the playground. No one is trying to ban under-13s from those places. Some fear that their children are prey for paedophiles, advertisers and other baddies on Facebook: again, does your kid travel alone, or go to a shopping centre without you? Most children do, from the time they go to secondary school. And just as you teach them the rules for staying safe when they're out and about alone, so you teach them the rules for staying safe online. Facebook is about what life is about, which is connecting with others. When children are young, we supervise them: as they get older, we trust them to connect without us around all the time. And what Facebook does is teach our kids a language that will undoubtedly be crucial to their future: because today's children are going to be interacting online with friends and, in the future, business colleagues and customers, for the rest of their lives. Why, when we're trying to educate them in useful skills on other fronts, hold them back on this one? No Jenni Russell I hope Zuckerberg is stopped. Allowing the official Facebook user age to drop below 13 will expose children to emotional pressures and public scrutiny they can't yet handle. Users love the site because they can run their social lives through it, and because they can present themselves to the world in the way they wish to be seen. Those huge attractions have their dark sides. While a user can say anything they like about themselves, others can say anything they like about them. Cyberbullying is a problem no one knows how to fix. Children have always dealt with feuds and social isolation, but now those can happen publicly and indelibly. It's hard enough for teens to deal with this; it's too cruel to expose younger ones too. Bullying only affects a minority, but everyone is affected by Facebook's essential elements; the need to manage one's image, and the underlying sense of social competition the site creates. Last week I sat next to a thirtysomething woman on the tube who spent 20 minutes complaining to her sister about how inadequate her friends' boastful updates and online conversations made her feel. People don't confess sadness and loneliness on these platforms, as they do to real friends, and that makes all of us unhappier as we assume that other people's lives are more successful than our own. Image construction is something that even adults are only starting to grasp \u2013 and it's not just tomorrow's impact that matters. What goes on Facebook can be there forever. Pictures or statements that look cool to your peer group today could be horribly compromising in the future. It's ridiculous to expect young children to be making sophisticated judgments about the effects of what they release online. And that's even before we get to the paedophile issue. Children might want this, but they're not ready for it. They need protection.",
