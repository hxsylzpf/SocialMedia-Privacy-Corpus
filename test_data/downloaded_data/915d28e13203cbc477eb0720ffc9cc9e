  "content": "Teachers tempted to twitter all day about classroom life should take note of the cautionary tale of a colleague who faces disciplinary action for revealing rather too much information about her pupils. The social networking site Twitter, popularised by the comedian Stephen Fry, gives subscribers fewer than 140 words to \"tweet\" updates of their movements. The Scottish secondary schoolteacher's revelations \u2013 posted up to 20 times a day \u2013 featured repeated criticism of her headteacher and the school's senior management. But it was her posts about excluded pupils, classes of \"interesting\" boys with Asperger's and musings as to who was least motivated \u2013 her or the pupils \u2013 that have landed her in trouble. Parents at the school are said to be outraged at the sensitive information revealed. And Argyll and Bute council, responsible for the school where she was based, has now blocked social networking sites in all its schools. England's ministers are keen for schools to teach children how to twitter \u2013 and this teacher is among the few that couldn't be accused of lagging behind students in technological know-how. Unlike many, she was clearly able to school pupils in the ways of the twittersphere. Should she be punished for wasting time complaining on Twitter and offering up her pupils as tweet topics? Or should she be applauded for giving a modern insight into what teaching is really like?",
