  "content": "The failure of the Beckhams to obtain an injunction against the News of the World (rather than the revelations themselves) has been the story of the week to a media lawyer (Report, April 25). Mr Justice Langley rejected the emergency injunction sought by the celebrities, who argued that the newspaper would be breaching their confidentiality, particularly as the nanny had signed a contract guaranteeing that she would not talk about her ex-employers. But lawyers acting for the newspaper convinced the judge that the story was in the clear public interest. This decision was a surprise, particularly when one reads the revelations, which, although no doubt fascinating to fans, contained little new and the couple are still very much together. The failed injunction highlights the randomness of injunction applications that come before the duty high court judge (rather than specialists), who have little detail and no time to make decisions that can have huge ramifications. But in the Beckhams' recently announced legal proceedings against the nanny and the newspaper, it will be interesting to see how a judge with the luxury of time will view the nanny's betrayal. But the News of the World will not give up without a fight - as it made clear on Sunday: \"Our lawyers are watching - and they are very good.\" Duncan Lamont Partner, Charles Russell",
