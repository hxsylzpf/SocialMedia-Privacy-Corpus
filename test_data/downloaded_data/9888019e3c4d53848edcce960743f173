  "content": "The editor of the Coventry Telegraph, Darren Parkin, has been suspended. He was, according to a story in a rival paper, the Coventry Observer, escorted from the office last Wednesday. The paper says unspecified \"concerns\" about Parkin were raised by his staff. These are reputed to relate to his use of a Twitter account, @CovTelEd. A spokesman for Trinity Mirror would say only that a member of staff in Coventry had been suspended. He is said to be on full pay pending the outcome of an investigation. Parkin, 38, was appointed as editor in 2009. As chief reporter on the Solihull Times and later Birmingham Metro News, he won a young journalist of the year award three years in succession. He was only 24 when he became editor of the Wolverhampton News. Sources: Coventry Observer/Trinity Mirror PR",
