  "content": "Guardianmusic.tumblr.com is the place where our writers post songs, videos, pictures and other music-related odds and ends they come across during their incessent web trawling. Here are our top five Tumblr posts from the past week. 1. Man Like Me's new video Described by one Guardian music editor as the \"silliest song of the year\", and by Michael Cragg as \"arch, knowing and a little camp \u2013 but also completely amazing\", Squeeze by Man Like Me now has a suitably silly video. Brilliant. 2. Extremely desirable posters Graphic designer Rob Ricketts has made these striking posters \"detailing how some of the most notable drum sequences were programmed using the Roland TR-808 drum machine.\" The series also includes Voodoo Ray by A Guy Called Gerald, Cybotron's Clear, Adonis's No Way Back. See them all at robricketts.co.uk. 3. Kwes explores lift tension @chrissalmon writes: \"This brand new video from London pop experimentalist Kwes is an enjoyable exploration of elevator awkwardness.\" 4. 'Why I should edit the NME' Manchester-based writer Mof Gimmers has posted a rather florid application letter for the NME editorship on his blog. Heartfelt genius? Overly wacky? Judge for yourself: \"The NME has that unique corner of the market that allows it to be thoughtful and thorough, as well as acting like a bratty fanzine. That's always been the case. The monthlies can spout endlessly about the hallowed grounds of rock music from their comfortable armchairs \u2013 the NME has always been the runt who actually went to the gigs, bought the lousy knockoff T-shirts from the one-toothed bootlegger outside the gig and puked up five pints of watery beer while the support act goaded from their transit van with a stained mattress in the back. Leave the Barbican gigs to Sunday supplements and awful people in linen trousers.\" Read on here. 5. Lovely stop-motion mouse action @lizlalia tweets us to say: Hiya, I made a stop-motion music vid for @SBTRKT using mice knitted from your pattern. Can't donate these ones to Battersea Cats' Home as they have wire inside \u2013 I've sent them some cuddly ones! Find out how to knit a mouse for Battersea Cats' Home here. \u2022 Seen any good links, videos, songs or pictures you think deserve a wider audience?
