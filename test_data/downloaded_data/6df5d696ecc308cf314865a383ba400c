The free internet telephony service has around 700m users worldwide, including at least 20m in China and an unknown number in Middle Eastern countries. Among areas that Privacy International has identified as weaknesses are: \u2022 the use in the Skype interface of names rather than unique IDs, meaning that people can be impersonated in the user list; \u2022 Skype downloads are not made through a secure connection (to, say, https://skype.com), which means that other sites can masquerade as the main site and offer compromised versions of the software - something that has happened in the past in China; \u2022 the audio compression system used in Skype allows phrases to be identified with an accuracy of between 50% and 90%, even with encryption applied. \"If the company cannot address and resolve these issues for those who are seeking secure communications, then vulnerable users will continue to be exposed to avoidable risks,\" Privacy International's human rights and technology adviser Eric King said. \"Skype's misleading security assurances continue to expose users around the world to unnecessary and dangerous risk. It's time for Skype to own up to the reality of its security and to take a leadership position in global communications.\" In response, Skype said: \"Privacy International has not been in touch with us so it will take us some time to read and digest the report before we are in a position to respond. We will look into the points they have raised and will reach out to them. Skype takes these issues seriously and aims to provide users with the best possible levels of privacy and security.\" Skype's system offers free peer-to-peer voice-over-internet calling, in which calls are encrypted between the two ends using a proprietary system. Skype has refused to produce methods that would let other Voice over Internet Protocol companies hook into its system and does not use standard VOIP protocols. It made around $860m in revenues from call charges to landline and other phones last year. Privacy International offers a number of criticisms. On user IDs, it comments: \"When you create a Skype account, you are asked to register a unique user name and password, in conjunction with an arbitrary profile name. This arbitrary profile name is what appears on your contact list, and permits people to easily impersonate others. Average users are easily tricked as a result. Does Skype intend to remedy this security flaw in its user interface?\" In 2006, it emerged that a Skype partner in China was filtering text in Skype chats, which meant some words would not be displayed. Skype insisted it would not affect the security and encryption systems, but it pointed to the possibility of people interfering with the app. Additionally, the lack of SSL for downloading means that a \"man in the middle\" attack is possible for someone who thinks they are downloading Skype. Privacy International alleges that the Chinese government has produced a \"Trojan-infected\" version of Skype, \"leaving users exposed to interception, impersonation and surveillance\". Facebook, Twitter and Google Mail all offer default SSL connections, it points out: \"Why is Skype unprepared to do so?\" It also points to the VBR audio compression codec which it says is an \"extremely specious and vulnerable means of protection\", despite encryption \u2013 recent research at the University of North Carolina suggests that phrases can be identified with a high degree of confidence.",
