  "content": "Heather Mills McCartney is to sue three newspapers over \"false, damaging and immensely upsetting\" statements in stories about her divorce from Sir Paul McCartney, her solicitors announced yesterday. Her law firm Mishcon de Reya said legal proceedings had already been started against the Daily Mail and the Evening Standard, and action would soon be taken against the Sun. The storm over the McCartneys' increasingly bitter divorce escalated last Tuesday when parts of Ms Mills McCartney's cross-petition for divorce against the former Beatle, containing lurid and damaging allegations about his behaviour, were leaked to the press. Each is seeking a divorce decree on the grounds of the other's unreasonable behaviour, after a four-year marriage which produced a daughter, Beatrice, now three. Yesterday it also emerged that the anonymous fax leaking sections of the draft cross-petition may have been sent from a newsagent's in London. The fax arrived at the Press Association's office in Howden, east Yorkshire, just after 1.30pm last Tuesday. It gave no clue to its sender but the Press Association's IT department has examined records of incoming calls and believes it probably came from a newsagent's in Drury Lane, London. The national news agency appears to have received a fax from the central London number at the time the McCartney divorce document was received. It did not run the story on its news wires because it was unable to authenticate the document and had legal concerns about the publication of court documents. The shop's owner, Peter Mehta, remembers a woman coming in to send a fax on that Tuesday afternoon. He described her as aged between 35 and 45, about 5ft 6in tall and brunette, with a \"different\" accent, possibly American or Canadian. Details of the allegations were published in the Daily Mail, which received the document later in the day, and in its stablemate, the Evening Standard. Yesterday neither Mishcon de Reya nor Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Mail and Standard, would say whether Ms Mills McCartney was suing for libel or breach of privacy or both. In a statement released last night, Associated Newspapers said: \"The stories published by the Daily Mail and the Evening Standard about Heather Mills McCartney's claims in respect of her divorce were obtained by proper methods and in accordance with good journalistic practice.\" \"Our exclusive stories were extensively followed up in detail by all other newspapers and media outlets.\" \"We have received a claim from solicitors representing Heather Mills McCartney. We will deal with that in the normal way.\" Last week, Sir Paul said he would \"vigorously and appropriately\" defend himself against the allegations, but in the divorce proceedings, not in the media.",
