  "content": "John Hemming, the Liberal Democrat MP who named Ryan Giggs, is something of a loner who has developed a knack for grabbing headlines by outing public figures who have taken out injunctions to protect their privacy. The full extent of superinjunctions, whose existence cannot even be reported, was brought to public attention by Hemming in March when he told MPs that Sir Fred Goodwin had obtained one. This prompted headlines that the press was not even allowed to report that Goodwin was a banker. It was left to Lord Stoneham, a Lib Dem colleague of Hemming, to explain the reasons for the injunction when he told peers last week that Goodwin took out the order to \"hide\" an alleged relationship with a colleague at the Royal Bank of Scotland. Hemming, who was first elected as MP for Birmingham Yardley at the 2005 general election, is not a clubbable figure at Westminster. But he is an energetic campaigner who used parliamentary privilege last month to name a woman involved in a child custody case who was threatened with jail for speaking to politicians. Until he focused on injunctions, Hemming was best known for campaigning against what he regards as an overly tough approach by family courts. As chairman of Justice for Families, he has campaigned on behalf of a mother who was forbidden from seeing her daughter on the grounds that she was not \"clever enough\" to look after the child. Politicians were highly critical of Hemming for naming Giggs. Lord Prescott, the former deputy prime minister, told Channel 4 News: \"It is an abuse. We handed over to them [the courts] to make the judgment.\" Tom Harris, the former Labour transport minister, told Radio 4's PM: \"It is behaviour that is unacceptable for an MP. Suddenly you have a self publicist like John Hemming. He has done it before. To do it this time [when] there is no justification for it whatever. He is obviously enjoying the reputation of being something of a maverick.\"",
