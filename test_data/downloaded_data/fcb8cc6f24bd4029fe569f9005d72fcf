  "content": "Can you turn a tweet into a job? In an attempt to find the answer, discover just how effective a job-seeking tool Twitter can be and test how responsive employers are to approaches via social media, the Guardian Careers team set its followers a Twitter job challenge. The premise was simple: target your top employers and, using Twitter, convince them to give you a job. The response, however, has been huge. More than 500 job-seeking tweets have been posted to our hashtag, #twitterjobchallenge, and the buzz around it has even reached Brazil. Excitante! But what's really interesting is the advice and insight that can be skimmed from the other jobseekers taking part. Scouring the best bits of the hashtag is like a mini-masterclass in what does \u2013 and doesn't \u2013 work if you want to use Twitter to give your career a boost. And social media gurus often say that to get to most out of Twitter, or if you're new to it, you should stand back and observe others; absorb the lingo, culture and idiosyncrasies of the platform first. So, here are some highlights, observations and tips we've gleamed, to help you do just that. We liked @JMChadd's no-fuss approach: \"Fancy hiring me then @guardiannews?\" But, alas, it didn't work. Like @JMChadd, lots of tweeters used the challenge to try to catch the attention of prospective employers for the first time, but it was those working their existing contacts \u2013 and giving the employers a solid reason to pay attention \u2013 that had the most impact. Take this tweet by @jenloubee, aimed at communications agency @DDB_UK: \"You liked me at interview but I wasn't strategic enough. This comes with experience + I'd love some this summer.\" Nice, right? You've also got to love this sassy tweet from @rachaelevans89, who tried something similar: \"@LabourParty Had many rejections from you because of my lack of experience. Hire me and I'll prove you don't need it!\" Building a relationship with the companies you want to work for is not the only traditional, offline, jobseeking tactic that still applies on social media. As proven by @interninglasgow, who, keen to show they had done their research about a company, dedicated precious characters to communicating a knowledge of the business: \"I blogged about u a while ago &amp; have followed your growth @pennies_orguk. Can I join your team?\" Confidence and creativity also stood out. @liamwilson23 was great at this and paid homage to lonely hearts, the forebearer of attracting others in a restricted space, with this kitsch but effective tweet: \"GSOH advertising student seeks attractive Advertising Agency for work placement, possibly more.\" It wasn't all graduates looking for their first break, though. @philswales has an impressive work history and he's not afraid to tweet it: \"Highly experienced administrator/assistant buyer looking for work in London. I type to 70wpm with good IT skills.\" Likewise for @hashistweeting, who gets qualifications, experience, enthusiasm and even a bit of Beano-esque humour into one update: \"Econ. Grad, 6 years media exp, worked with volunteers, awesome w/ IT, pro writer, will work anywhere UK \u2013 gis a job?\" Grad @emmamaymills, demonstrated ever- important digital skills and beat the space constraints by adding links to an online CV: \"@Publicasity interested in graduate opening positions please check out my digital CV http://bit.ly/hQo0L5.\" As for employers, the companies we've talked to have said the beauty of Twitter is they get a much richer picture of what a candidate is really like and what sort of personality they have. Well, there was certainly plenty of personality. @nlewendon tweeted: \"got hit by a lorry last Friday. was playing badminton the next day. committed.\" And we liked this one from @FlamingJune: \"ran 4 times last week, yesterday I biked for 14 miles, painting tonight, jiving on Wed \u2013 multitalented, multitasking!\" While we're yet to receive the victory tweet from someone who's managed to secure a fully-fledged a job offer via the challenge, there's been lots to celebrate. Contacts have been made, email addresses shared, advice given and followers gained. Blogger @emlgx has done very well indeed: \"3 replies: 1 contact made, 1 spec application suggestion and 1 email alert suggested, good progress!\" The secret to her success? Well, for starters, she kept an eye on the feed and swiftly responded when this opportunity came up: \"@MC2Manchester: Really like @GuardianCareers #twitterjobchallenge. We love it when people approach us via Twitter \u2013 don't be shy!\" Plenty of other employers are wading in now, too, and the challenge continues at #twitterjobchallenge.
