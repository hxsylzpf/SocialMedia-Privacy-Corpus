It was just before dawn. Yesterday, the computing enthusiast, who used the online name Phreeze, and his friend Andrew Harvey, known as Doom, were jailed at Newcastle crown court for controlling the TK worm that inflicted an estimated \u00a35.5m of damage across the internet. Bradley, now a 21-year-old electrician, received three months and Harvey, 24, unemployed, of Sherburn, County Durham, was given six months. \"The reason for all this activity is power and ego to see how much you could do,\" said Judge Beatrice Bolton. \"This worm was capable of doing a lot more than you did with it. Public business and the computing community must have faith in their computers and you demonstrated that two young boys can interfere and for a long time get away with it.\" Their ingenious program at one stage controlled as many as 50,000 machines, hijacking, among others, sites run by the US defence department. They pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to conspiracy to cause unauthorised modification of computers. Adrian Waterman, prosecuting, said: \"This was an agreement to create, release and control malicious software. They were doing what they were doing because of the control it gave them, not with a view to an end result. This was a highly sophisticated worm.\" Counsel for the men, Robin Patton, insisted it had caused little damage. \"This is not a case where we have a business coming forward saying that they could not operate for three days.\" Another member of the Thr34t Krew, Raymond Steigerwalt, 21, from Indiana, was jailed for 21 months earlier this year and ordered to pay $12,000 (\u00a36,800) compensation for damage to computers. Once released on to the internet, the TK worm exploited a known weakness in Microsoft programs. The compromised computers formed a \"botnet\", a hijacked network which could launch streams of emails in \"distributed denial of service\" attacks on other computers or websites. The investigation began after a computer user in California found a strange file on his machine. Lieutenant Dan Seltenberger, who was then working for the local computer and technology crime hi-tech response unit, said: \"The TK worm is self-replicating. It's still out there and will be for years. \"It had the ability to take down significant portions of the internet; it could have knocked out one of the 13 root servers which operate the internet globally. What the kids did was pretty ingenious. They all had a talent. It's a shame they didn't put it to better use.\"",
