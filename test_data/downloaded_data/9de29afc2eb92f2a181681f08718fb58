  "content": "Payments to Goodman and Mulcaire Paul Farrelly MP: \"Mr Mulcaire was convicted on six counts, a convicted criminal, who breached the press code of conduct all over the place, yet at the end of it he still has claims against the company in terms of employment rights?\" Tom Crone: \"If you don't get the process right, you have to pay them.\" News of the World editor Colin Myler: \"In all seriousness, HR laws on employment are incredibly complicated. I think it allows people to do rather extraordinary things and still come back on an employers and say you still have not got a right to fire me.\" Crone and Myler both said they were not aware whether Goodman had been paid. The outgoing News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner said that an agreement was reached with Goodman after his conviction. \"As far as I know, arrangements or agreements were made with them [Goodman and Mulcaire],\" he said. \"I have no details at all of the substance of those agreements.\" James Murdoch's involvement in decision to pay \u00a3700,000 to settle Taylor case Colin Myler: \"James Murdoch was apprised of the situation and agreed with our recommendation to settle. It was an agreed collective decision.\" Disagreements between MPs and News International Tom Crone: \"Mr Watson is in litgation with us at the moment. It seems to us quite improper that Mr Watson is sitting on this panel.\" Tom Watson: \"I happen to think that this is News International trying to interfere with the work of this committee and I think that it is improper.\" Phone hacking at News of The World Old Bailey judge Mr Justice Gross, sentencing Mulcaire in 2007: \"As to counts 16 to 20, you had not dealt with Goodman but with others at News International. You had not been paid anything because no stories had resulted.\" Tom Crone: \"I was in court and I remember him saying that and my immediate reaction was 'Why did he say that because the prosecution did not say that in its opening'?\" Colin Myler: \"No evidence or information emerged to suggest that others at the News of the World knew of these activities or were complicit in them.\" Colin Myler: \"Mr Hinton's evidence was based on what was known at the time and was entirely truthful.\" Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson: \"As far as I am aware there is no evidence linking the non-royal phone hacking by Glenn Mulcaire with any member of the News of the World staff.\" Evidence of the 2005 contract with Mulcaire and email to Mulcaire about the Gordon Taylor transcript Tom Crone: \"The first piece of evidence we saw in relation to that was in April 2008.\" Crone said that the contract might have been \"mentioned\" at Old Bailey court hearing in 2007. But he did not see a copy until April 2008. Andy Coulson: \"I never asked for a Gordon Taylor story, I never commissioned an Gordon Taylor story, I never read a Gordon Taylor story, I never published a Gordon Taylor story. With all respect to Gordon Taylor, he is hardly a household name.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
