  "content": "When Patak's launched a new version of its top-selling lime pickle last year, it no doubt seemed like a good idea at the time. But curry fans thought otherwise. In an about-turn reminiscent of Coca-Cola's climbdown over the introduction of \"New Coke\" in the 1980s, the power of social media has forced Patak's to go back to its old recipe. The Indian food producer introduced what it said was an improved recipe for lime pickle early last year. It had less oil, extra lime in smaller chunks and extra kalonji seeds for a peppery flavour. But devotees were horrified. One customer wrote on Patak's Facebook page: \"The old lime pickle recipe was SO much better. That's the first and last jar I buy of the 'new improved' pickle. Yuk!\" Another said: \"Bring back the old lime pickle recipe. Time for a petition!\" As the year wore on, more customers complained. About 250 contacted the company by email and social media, and comments on Amazon, which sells the pickle, were vitriolic. One reviewer wrote: \"The current version of this lime pickle is foul. There is a lime pickle-shaped hole in our weekly shop.\" Another asked: \"Why does it taste like toilet cleaner?\" Patak's relented in November and jars in shops now bear the message \"It's back!\" and say they contain the old recipe. Some fans are not convinced the formula is the same but Patak's said the recipe was the original. Patak's sells 1.5m jars of pickle a year and lime pickle is the most popular with sales of 580,000. Separately, the company sells bulk quantities to wholesalers who sell it to the majority of Britain's Indian restaurants. The recipes for mixed and mango pickle, which also changed in early 2015, have not been switched back. A spokesman said customer unrest was muted over those products. Patak's was founded in 1957 by Laxmishanker Pathak who arrived in Britain as a refugee from Kenya with his wife and six children, with \u00a35 in his pocket. The family sold the business to Associated British Foods in 2007 for more than \u00a3100m.",
