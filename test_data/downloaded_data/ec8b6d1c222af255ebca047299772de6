  "content": "Max Mosley may have failed in his attempt to secure a prior notification amendment to the European Convention of Human Rights, but it is not the last newspapers will hear of this determined man. I don't know whether he will appeal. But I am certain that he has not yet finished with the News of the World. My hunch is that he has been holding back until this Strasbourg decision to pursue the paper in court actions in other countries where it circulates. So we can expect actions - for invasion of privacy probably, libel possibly - in various jurisdictions outside Britain. He was awarded \u00a360,000 damages by the UK high court in 2008 for a gross intrusion into his privacy. But he did not sue for libel at the time, even though many lawyers thought he would succeed. His eye was, of course, on the larger target of changing the law. Now, freed from that, he still burns with resentment at his treatment by the News of the World. So I am sure he will not let this matter go. While News International continues to face the legal flak over phone-hacking, it could well be on the verge of new writs arriving very soon.",
