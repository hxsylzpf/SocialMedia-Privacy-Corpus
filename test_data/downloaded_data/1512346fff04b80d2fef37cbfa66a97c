  "content": "A leading public official has labelled the government's current data-sharing practices \"deeply frustrating\", as it emerged that the government could make \u00a333bn of savings by making better use of big data. The remarks were made following the publication of a report authored by think tank Policy Exchange and supported by EMC Corporation, which called for more public sector resources to be focused on data analytics in a bid to meet cost cutting targets. Speaking at a round-table discussion, Margaret Hodge of the Public Accounts Committee stated her belief that data should play a bigger part in government decision making, but cautioned that it would not be able to reach its potential without improvements in collaboration between departments. \"The use of data should support better decision-making. A problem still remains as there is not enough collaboration between departments. The government remains siloed and doesn't share intelligence across departments, leading to very poor decision-making\", she said. The Policy Exchange report, titled 'The Big Data Opportunity', recommends the establishment of an 'Advanced Analytics Team', which would be tasked with identifying areas where big data could be best put to use and educating departmental staff in the use of best practice tools and techniques. James Petter, Vice President and Country Manager for EMC UK&amp;Ireland, warned that the public sector is in danger of being outpaced in terms of its ability to handle and exploit big data. \"There are clear challenges ahead for the public sector, both in meeting aggressive cost cutting targets and in getting to grips with big data. If it is slow to the table, there is a risk of being left behind. Clear leadership and a willingness to adopt a culture of change are needed if big data is to achieve its great potential\", he said. Analysis of big data is proving an effective cost-cutting measure for governments across the world, with Australia and the US among the leading exponents. Petter highlighted tax evasion and healthcare provision as areas where the public sector could see early results. \"Big data could return benefits by cutting back on billions of pounds of fraud through comprehensive analysis of tax submissions, or deliver even greater savings by using stratified health to make a transition from a health system that deals with chronic care to one that deals in preventative, predictive care and a focus on wellbeing\", he said. Any concerted move to make more and better use of big data would inevitably lead to an increase in demand for skilled professionals. Chris Yiu, Head of Policy Exchange's Digital Government unit, singled out the role of data scientist as being integral to a move toward analytics-driven policy. \"To make the most of Government data sets the capability factor is the most problematic. In particular, what you don't find in training is a track for data scientists, with a focus on how to tell a compelling story and visualise it\", he said. Yiu's comments came as the University of Dundee last week announced that it will be launching an MSc in Data Science in January, joining UK institutions including University College London, the University of Greenwich and the University of Manchester in offering the specialised qualification.
