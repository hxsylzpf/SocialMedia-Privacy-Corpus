The advertisement for lamb, by industry group Meat &amp; Livestock Australia, has received an unprecedented 300-plus complaints since it went to air on Monday. In the ad Chin leads a military operation to extract \"stranded\" Australians from around the world, bringing them home for an Australia Day lamb meal. But hundreds of viewers have complained about the violence in the commercial during which a vegan's home is torched by the military. A spokeswoman for the watchdog told Weekly Beast up to 90% of the cases considered by the board are dismissed. Complaints about the Australia Day lamb campaign featuring \"lambassador\" Sam Kekovich have been dismissed in previous years. Each year only about 10% are upheld and in those cases the ads have been found to have breached the advertising codes of practice. When a complaint is upheld, the advertiser has to pull the offending ad off air. The ABCs of running Aunty Michelle Guthrie was named before Christmas as the next ABC managing director but she still has a job back in Singapore and doesn't start at Aunty in Sydney until April. She'll have a month to learn the ropes from Mark Scott, who has been in the high-profile role for a decade. On Wednesday Guthrie was named as a judge in the region's top advertising awards, the Asia Pacific Effie awards to be held in April, so it would appear she is not slowing down in her current role. But the former Australian media lawyer would be advised to brush up on her interview skills as well as her knowledge of the ABC and Australian media before she arrives. Her first interview, with Joe O'Brien on ABC News 24, was not seen inside the ABC executive as very impressive. Guthrie appeared extremely nervous and unprepared despite the soft interview. Guthrie also unwisely left a question mark over whether the ABC should accept advertising. \"It is important on an overall basis in budget-constrained times to really look at all options around monetisation,\" Guthrie told O'Brien, sparking headlines and widespread anxiety. ABC insiders say while she seemed to be a genuinely smart, warm person in the meet and greets with staff, she will need to polish her style if she is to survive a hostile Senate estimates committee hearing, at which Scott has proven himself to be a master. Logies \u2013 don't cringe, vote You may not know your Home and Away starlets from your Neighbours hunks, but you can still vote in the 2016 TV Week Logie Awards if it takes your fancy. The Logies are owned by magazine TV Week, which has always made them hard to take seriously \u2013 but they have been around for 58 years and they are our only dedicated TV gongs. There are two categories of votes: one which is peer-voted (outstanding) and one which is voted by the public (best). The Gold Logie is for most popular person on TV and is also voted by the public \u2013 last year it was won by The Project's Carrie Bickmore. However the popular votes are influenced by media campaigns run by the networks who choose which personality to promote and push the message on screen endlessly. How else do you explain that in 2014 the most popular person on TV was tradie Scott Cam, the host of Nine's The Block? Voting closes on Sunday and the awards will take place on Sunday, 8 May, at Crown casino's Palladium Room in Melbourne, with the event telecast on the Nine Network. Aussie finalist for Super Bowl ad An Australian director has again made the finals for the annual Dorito's Super Bowl ad competition. Contestants have to think up an idea for a 30-second Doritos\u00ae brand commercial to air during the broadcast of Super Bowl 50. \"Make it bold. Make it action-packed. Make it funny. Make it something we've never seen before. It's up to you. Just make it awesome,\" is the pitch. This year local director Peter Carstairs is one of only three finalists in line for the $1m prize. The grand-prize winner will be selected through online voting by the public and the winning ad will be aired during the Super Bowl broadcast. Carstairs and the other two finalists will enjoy the game from a private suite at the Super Bowl. You can see his entry here. Streaming tide Australians are rapidly changing the way they watch television, with streaming services Netflix, Stan and Presto becoming popular additions to free-to-air and pay TV. (Stan announced on Wednesday the streaming service was now available on Microsoft's Xbox One via a new app which allows users to use voice controls to browse and play video.) According to the Australian Communications and Media Authority communications report tabled in parliament last month, 34% of Australian adults watched online television or video content in a given week and 11% of us watched Netflix Australia in a given week. But the broadcast networks are also reaping the benefits of audiences changing their habits and watching programs at a time of their own choosing. Some programs, usually Australian dramas, are being watched by hundreds of thousands of people after they first aired. In 2015, the most time-shifted program was House of Hancock about Gina Rinehart, which was watched by an additional 260,000 viewers, making the total audience 1.7m after one week. Also popular on catch-up platforms were Downton Abbey (Seven), Catching Milat (Seven), Gallipoli (Nine), Peter Allen: Not the Boy Next Door (Seven) and Love Child (Nine). Facebook premiere wins the internet The decision by SBS to show its new comedy, The Family Law, on Facebook over the weekend has paid off. According to SBS, there were 1.1m video views on the social network, which is more than a good start. A total of 2.1m people saw the post on Facebook, 9.6k liked it, 3k shared it and 1.6k left a comment. The Family Law premieres in the old-fashioned way at 8.30pm on Thursday 14 January on SBS TV.",
