  "content": "Name: The safety pin. Appearance: Everywhere. Age: Three days old. Really? I'm sure they were around before that. You're thinking of the common fastener, which has a hooded clasp at one end to protect the user from its sharp point. Exactly. There was one stuck on the England flag I pulled off the window and stamped on the other day. I'm talking about the campaign, #safetypin. Which is what? A symbol in the fight against racism in the wake of the Brexit vote. Does it involve actual safety pins in any way? Yes, a Twitter user has proposed that people wear an empty safety pin to show that they are \"a safe person to sit next to on a bus, walk next to on a street, even have a conversation with\". And the idea has gone feral? I think you mean viral, although \"trending\" would be more accurate. The hashtag #safetypin has been seized on by people showing photographs of themselves thus adorned. I like the sentiment, although it is odd to be living in a country where you now have to publicly identify yourself as non-racist. Odd, but perhaps necessary. The National Police Chiefs' Council announced a 57% rise in hate crime reports between last Thursday and Sunday compared with a month ago. Is there an enduring link between safety pins and solidarity with the foreign-born? Not really, although safety pins are themselves foreign. Distantly related to the fibula, an ancient form of clasp that Romans used to hold their togas together, the modern safety pin was invented by an American, Walter Hunt, in 1849. He must have made a fortune. No, he sold the patent for $400 to pay off a debt. And then they became the ubiquitous fabric-repair solution that we all know? They also had a bit of a fashion moment, first as part of the DIY spirit of punk, then later as a couture accessory. Couture? In 1994, Liz Hurley memorably wore a Versace dress that was held together with dozens of oversized gold safety pins. She must have really loved immigrants. If you ever see her on a bus, feel free to sit next to her. Do say: \"There is no room for racism in the country, but my trousers were falling down.\" Don't say: \"Ow!\"",
