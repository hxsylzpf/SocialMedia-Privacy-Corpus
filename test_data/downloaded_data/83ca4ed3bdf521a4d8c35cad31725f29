  "content": "The photograph of two young children embracing looks professionally taken. \"Came from the sky in Lockport,\" reads a Facebook caption describing the image, likely once a framed family memento, found in a town 114 miles away from the town of Washington, Illinois. Washington bore the brunt of a system of storms that battered towns across the midwest on Sunday. 'Found items from the Washington Illinois and Diamond Illinois Tornadoes' wants to reunite families with lost mementos, pets and financial documents. The page has drawn thousands of followers interested in the effort. Another Facebook group \u2013 'PHOTOS found from Nov 17, 2013 Illinois Storms / Tornadoes' \u2013 aims to do the same thing. So far, several photos of lost pets and possessions have been matched with volunteers willing to join them with their families.  What's most striking is the sheer distance some of the items traveled from the Washington area: \"Found in my Joliet yard! Mailing address is Peoria! That's 128 miles from my house,\" wrote one volunteer hoping to unite a financial document with its owner. Elsewhere, this photo of a married couple below was originally posted on a ChicagoNow.com blog just hours after the tornado Sunday: The image was found in Plainfield, Illinois, and shared to the found items Facebook page. Eventually, a comment arrived: \"I used to work with them ... They live in the Washington IL. I will repost.\"  This means the image may have covered a distance of 89 miles. On Twitter, Illinois residents are also posting their findings:  For some, the mementos will be a silver lining to the storm. For others, tattered papers like a student's lost school worksheet posted to one of the Facebook pages might not provide enough relief. \"Thats my cousins name,\" wrote the respondent. \"They lost their house today in the tornado.\"  Are you involved in a cleanup effort after the Midwest tornadoes?
