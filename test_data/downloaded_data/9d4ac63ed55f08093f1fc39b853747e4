  "content": "The DV Labs blog has run a Pwn2Own Wrap Up about its hacking competition, which saw three browsers hacked and one unexploitable hole in Chrome. More than that, it raises the question why all the mobile devices emerged unscathed -- and fails to answer it. It looks as though they weren't seriously attacked. However, mobile phones may do worse next year. Possibly the most interesting part of the event at CanSecWest in Vancouver, Canada, was the appearance of \"the mysterious Nils,\" who now has the honour of having found the first security vulnerability in IE8. It won't be the last. Another development was that two Pwn2Own winners, Dino Dai Zovi and Charlie Miller, said they were beefing up their Metasploit tool \"to make Mac OS X a first-class target\". According to IDG News: Although there are still many more exploits available for Windows software than for Macs, the new payload code means there is now \"more or less the same functionality if you want to target a Mac box or a Windows box,\" Miller said. The IDG story reports: Miller and Dai Zovi say their work is designed to bring attention to serious security problems in the Mac platform, which has largely avoided the wide-scale attacks that have plagued Windows for years. Dai Zovi said he considers the Mac safe, but not secure. \"There's a difference between safety and security,\" he said. \"It's like leaving your door unlocked. ... Leaving your door unlocked is always insecure, but it may or may not be safe.\" (I think \"largely avoided\" means \"completely avoided\".) Insofar as Pwn2Own might have some small effect on the market, Google Chrome was the winner and Apple's Safari the loser. Whatever their other merits might be, the event suggested Safari was the most insecure browser while Chrome was the most secure (bearing in mind that some were not tested, including Opera). Most Windows users are probably happy to have one or two browsers, and by a long way, those are Internet Explorer and Firefox. There's diminishing appeal to having three, four or five browsers on a singe PC, but Chrome is now the obvious third choice, on security grounds, while Safari is the one to avoid. Apple chief executive Steve Jobs implied that Safari was intended to wipe out Firefox, which has made some headway on Mac OS X. It will be interesting to see if it can fend off Chrome.",
