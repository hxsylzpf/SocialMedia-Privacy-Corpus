  "content": "A mistake in today's Daily Telegraph about the nationality of Ireland's fighting female, Katie Taylor, prompted many an Irish blogger and tweeter to complain. For example, Cormac Eklof, writing on Irish Central, called the paper \"incredibly crass, docile and ill-informed\" because it referred to Katie as British in a preview paragraph about her semi-final boxing bout. Among the many tweets, I liked this one by Fergus Murphy: \"Dear Daily Telegraph. Katie Taylor is IRISH. However, please feel free to claim Ronan Keating, Jedward, Louis Walsh...\" Eklof was so upset he delivered a history lesson on how Ireland gained independence from an \"often brutal British imperialist state.\" But, sportingly, he later gave \"credit where credit is due\" when the Telegraph issued an abject apology, via Twitter, to \"fantastic\" Katie. In fact, no history lesson was required since the Telegraph's editor, Tony Gallagher, is very proud of his Irish roots and has been a frequent visitor to Ireland throughout his life. I just hate to think of the dressing down handed out to the sub-editor responsible for failing to spot what does rank as a silly error. It clearly didn't affect Katie. She won her semi-final and has now given herself a real chance of winning Ireland's first gold of the London Games. Sources: Irish Independent/Irish Central",
