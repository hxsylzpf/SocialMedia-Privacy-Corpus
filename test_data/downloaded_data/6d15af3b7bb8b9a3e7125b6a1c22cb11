  "content": "Facebook has made a U-turn on its controversial new advertising system, Beacon, after protests by users. The social networking site, which has more than 55 million users worldwide, came in for heavy criticism after it launched a system that published details within Facebook of individuals' activities on other websites. The system, called Beacon, allows other websites to tell your friends and family about some of your activities elsewhere on the internet - for example revealing that you have bought a particular DVD. In return for feeding the information back to Facebook, the other websites get a free advertisement for their services. Because Beacon required users to actively opt out of having their information shared with others, rather than opt in, it was accused of spoiling thousands of Christmas surprises and - perhaps more importantly - infringing privacy. A group on the website calling itself \"Facebook: Stop Invading My Privacy\" has grown to more than 50,000 members, and several other organisations including political activism site MoveOn.org protested about the system. After a week of pressure the Silicon Valley company last night said it would change Beacon so that users would not have their information about their activities published automatically. \"We appreciate feedback from all Facebook users and made some changes to Beacon in the past day,\" the company said. \"Users now have more control over the stories that get published.\" However, it is still impossible for Facebook users to opt out of Beacon entirely.",
