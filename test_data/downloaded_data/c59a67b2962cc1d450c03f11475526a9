The group was launching a campaign, Unsubscribe, to highlight human rights abuses in the war on terror and reach out to websites such as Bebo and Facebook, Amnesty officials said. The campaign is the latest step into the 21st century for Amnesty, which was set up in 1961 and has traditionally engaged in letter-writing campaigns to encourage action over human rights abuses around the world. Kate Allen, the director of Amnesty International UK, said: \"Unsubscribe will engage with the millions of people who passionately believe in the right to a fair trial and the right not to be tortured. \"Unsubscribe is about rejecting the false choice between terrorism on the one hand and abuse of human rights on the other.\" The campaign has direct support from Bebo, the British-based social networking website. Joanna Shields, the president of Bebo, said that she hoped Amnesty would be able to use the website's virtual word of mouth in order to spread its message further. \"The Unsubscribe campaign really speaks the language of Bebo,\" she said. \"We are all about people coming together to explore ideas and share their passions and to make a positive impact - key aspects of Amnesty's new campaign.\" At the launch of Unsubscribe in Birmingham today, Amnesty also unveiled a series of hard-hitting posters and adverts including images of a dog attacking a prisoner at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, and images of a detainee at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay camp. The organisation has tried other internet campaigns to engage new supporters, including the Irrepressible.info project, launched last year, which focused on protecting freedom of speech online. The Irrepressible website now has nearly 75,000 supporters, but by harnessing popular networking sites officials hope they can drum up even more backing. The move into social networking comes after huge interest in a Facebook group dedicated to supporting pro-democracy protesters in Burma. Launched three weeks ago it has swelled to nearly 400,000 members, and helped organise protests and demonstrations around the world. But although the large membership shows a weight of support around the world, one of the organisers admitted that it would need more than just signatories to help change the situation in Burma. \"We don't imagine that the generals in Burma are really taking any notice of this group,\" said Johnny Chatterton, the UK organiser for the Burma campaign. \"We just hope that by showing how much support there is for the protests we can put pressure on local politicians here in the UK and elsewhere and get them to change their policies.\"",
