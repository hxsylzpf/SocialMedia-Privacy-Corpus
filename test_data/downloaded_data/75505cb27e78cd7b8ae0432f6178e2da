  "content": "Whether you love it or hate the idea, snapping pictures of food and uploading them to Instagram is a popular activity. Hashtag your pic of those delicious pancakes and voila! \u2026 other pancake fans will come flocking. The photo printing company Photoworld has created an interactive map showcasing the food capitals of Instagram. They used the social network's open API to capture more than 100,000 snaps posted over a week from across the world. By looking at specific hashtags, the creators of the map were able to see where the biggest fans (or more prolific Instagram posters) of foods such as #bacon, #pizza and #sushi are located. London tops the table for #pulledpork (7.5% of all tags) and #burgers (5%), while New York ranks highest for a variety of different types of food, from bacon to jerk chicken. With 10% of all #curry tags in their dataset, Tokyo beats Osaka, London and New York. It may also be skewed by population. For example, #pizza tags are more prevalent in New York than in Naples, Rome, Milan and Bologna put together. However, some food does not travel so well \u2013 all the locations near the top for #currywurst were in Germany, with little mention of it elsewhere.
