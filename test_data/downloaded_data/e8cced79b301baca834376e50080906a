  "content": "Will the war between palace and paparazzi break out all over again? Now that Kate Middleton is officially engaged to Prince William, are we going to see a re-run of the battles between his mother and photographers? The London Evening Standard explored that possibility yesterday and, as its headline suggests - Fair game or respect: paparazzi are at odds over pursuing Kate Middleton - there was no agreement within the photographic pack. That's hardly a surprise. These guys (and some girls) are freelance operators, individuals out for a buck, and they do not adhere to any collective pact. But the ones who want to sell their pictures to British newspapers and magazines do appear to be aware of the need to obey the editors' code of practice. Or, at least, a version of it. One of the paps quoted - Jan Almasi who works for the Eroteme agency (which I can't locate online) - spoke of photographers needing to \"respect the 100-yard rule.\" I'm not quite certain about that. The editors' code does not spell out a required distance between photographer and subject. But the key clause (No. 4), which was formulated following the death of Princess Diana, concerns harassment. This outlaws the pursuit of people and states that photographers must stop snapping away \"once asked to desist.\" A sub-clause states: \"Editors must ensure these principles are observed by those working for them and take care not to use non-compliant material from other sources.\" There is a public interest exemption, however, that does allow for editors and/or photographers to justify harassment in certain circumstances. (They would need to be very, very good). Anyway, the important point for all to grasp is that the code is applied to all - princes and commoners, celebrities and so-called ordinary members of the public - without distinction. Though the press (and newspaper readers) are more likely to be interested in princes and celebrities, there is equal treatment as far as the Press Complaints Commission is concerned when considering complaints. The PCC is also able to circulate concerns that are raised by people about paparazzi behaviour to editors, enabling them to make informed decisions about the provenance of pictures they are offered. About 60 so-called \"desist requests\" go out each year on behalf of celebrities and members of the public. There could be a problem with freelance journalists working for international publications, but as long as British editors refuse to buy their material, this is unlikely to be a popular sport. What has been striking about Middleton has been her eminently sensible response to having hordes of photographers around her. She has walked purposefully past them, refusing to be goaded into doing anything silly (hiding behind a handbag, lashing out, screaming, pulling faces). If she managed that over the years without royal protection officers then surely she will find it easier still now that she is afforded security. She did make one formal PCC complaint, in 2007, after the Daily Mirror published a picture of her taken in controversial circumstances. That was resolved when the paper issued a public statement and published an immediate apology. In March this year, she received \u00a35,000 in damages for a breach of privacy, plus legal costs from picture agency Rex Features, which distributed pictures of her on a tennis court in Cornwall. The second incident is a reminder that the developing law on privacy - which didn't exist during Princess Diana's lifetime - could be used against intrusive photographers in future. I noted in the Standard article that a veteran pap, Max Cisotti of Xclusive Pix, said: \"It's all fair game.\" If we accept the word game, it's the adjective that counts. The press will need to be fair.",
