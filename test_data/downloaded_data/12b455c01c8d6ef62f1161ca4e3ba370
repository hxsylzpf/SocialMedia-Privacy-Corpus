  "content": "Twitter is not to everyone's taste \u2013 it's no secret that many readers of this blog suspect that the Guardian gives the microblogging service far more attention than it deserves and might agree with Oyl Miller's stream of consciousness piece in McSweeney's this week that begins: \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by brevity, over-connectedness, emotionally starving for attention.\" But \u2026 yes, of course there's a but, the current Twitter conversation between publishers and readers, writers and booksellers is worth a look. Gathered under the hashtag \"dearpublisher\" (hashtags are how Twitter users group topics to make it easy to find all the tweets on one subject \u2013 just put dearpublisher in the search box and all tweets that include the phrase #dearpublisher will show up on one page) are questions and comments that are starting up a direct debate between publishers and readers. The publishers say they are listening: SceptreBooks: If anyone's got a specific question ask away \u2013 and will join in the conversation when I can add something to it. HodderBooks: Just so you all know, we're listening if you've got something to say! WalkerBooksUK: Just came back after meetings to discover #dearpublisher. Keep them coming \u2013 we love all feedback! PanMacmillanAus: Reading the #dearpublisher chat \u2013 keep them coming, people, we're listening! And readers are making their views known. OK, so there's only so much you can say in 140 characters \u2013 it's not the place to go into the complexities of e-book pricing and DRM \u2013 but readers are making succinct and forceful points and the initiative is encouraging debate about all areas of publishing. Vampire-fatigue is coming across strongly: Maria_Disidoro: Telling me something is \"the next Twilight\" guarantees I will never pick it up. BloomsburyBell: Please, no more vampires Well, mostly: tehawesomersace: People of color don't all live in the ghetto or have abusive parents or wish they were white. Why can't we be vampires? Other comments range from content to marketing: StuartEvers: #dearpublishers remember: the book that became a success wasn't always an obvious bestseller in the first place ... MarilynFactor: being black can be fun not in a we make the best out of the worst kind of way and does not have to involve an identity crisis SekritEmuSister: That book you feel is a risk in the market that's too edgy and provocative? I'll read it. So will all my friends. RyanMCFC: don't allow poor scans of your picture books to be used on Google Books. As an illustrator that would drive me nuts. Empireofbooks: It's okay to have quotes on the back and inside, but please not on the cover. It spoils amazing artwork. The publishers have started responding as well as listening and the debate is hotting up: Vintagebooks: Just to add to the #dearpublisher debate - often we do publish amazing/translated/odd/bizarre books (like you want!) and no one buys them! Whatever you think of Twitter, I'm not sure that this kind of open forum dialogue would have been possible on any other platform and, personally, I think more direct interaction between readers and publishers is an overdue and welcome development. Do you think it's progress or a superficial gesture? And, if you're not a twitterer, what would your short message to a publisher be?",
