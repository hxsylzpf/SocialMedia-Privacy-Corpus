  "content": "One of the most prolific and best-loved purveyors of horror and suspense has finally joined the twitterati. @StephenKing has stacked up 172,258 followers in three days and is already one of most-followed authors on Twitter. King, who has produced 56 novels in his 40-year career, beginning with Carrie in 1973, started out uncertainly in the 140-character form. His first text read: \"On Twitter at last, and can't think of a thing to say. Some writer I turned out to be.\" King chose just \"author\" for his Twitter bio, in a similar style to other high-profile literary tweeters. Bret Easton Ellis (@BretEastonEllis) and Paulo Coelho (@paulocoelho) both describe themselves as \"writer\", while Jackie Collins (@jackiejcollins) opts for the more strident \"Kick-ass writer!\" One of King's early followers was his son, the author and novelist Joe Hill (@joe_hill), to whom he tweeted; \"@joe_hill Tweet whatever you want. Just don't let me catch you with your hand in your pants.\" Hill retorted, \"@StephenKing Talking to you on Twitter is easier than in real life, cos I don't have to wait for you to paste in your false teeth here.\" King later tweeted about what he was watching on TV: \"Watching THE RETURNED. Scary and sexy. Fun to see a foreign TV show that hasn't been Americanized. That kid Victor's giving me nightmares.\" The Returned is a French TV series set in a small mountain town in which dead people reappear. It won an International Emmy this year, and was broadcast in the UK on Channel 4. King's latest novel Doctor Sleep, a sequel to The Shining, revisits Danny Torrance in an attempt by King to \"scare the shit out of people\".
