  "content": "1. Adjust exposure on iOS With iOS 8, Apple has given iPhone and iPad users the ability to manually adjust the exposure on photos. Previously, tapping on a part of a picture in the Camera app would set both the focus and the exposure; now, you can tap to set the focus, then slide your finger up or down anywhere on the screen to lighten or darken the image. The yellow sun icon moves accordingly to indicate the change in exposure. To start again from scratch, tap on a different part of the screen. 2. Straighten photos in iOS Another addition in iOS 8 and above is a straightening tool. Once you've snapped a photo, tap the thumbnail next to the shutter button to view it, then choose \"Edit\". Tap the Crop button (far left) and you can slide your finger along the the dial at the side of your image to straighten it as necessary. As you make changes, the picture is automatically zoomed and cropped to preserve its original dimensions. Tap \"Done\" to save your edits. 3. Turn on HDR+ mode on Android The latest versions of Android include an HDR+ mode in the default Camera app \u2014 turn it on with a tap on the \"More\" button (three dots) and a tap on \"HDR+\". When you press the shutter button the app actually takes several photos in a row with different exposure settings, then combines them for the most evenly balanced shot. Picture processing takes a couple of seconds longer but it can really make a difference when there's a wide contrast between the darkest and lightest parts of an image. 4. Apply Lens Blur on Android In the default Camera app on the most recent versions of Android you can swipe in from the left (or the bottom in landscape mode) to bring up a list of photo and video options. One of these is Lens Blur: it lets you take shots with a sharply focused foreground object and a blurred background. Compose your shot, press the shutter button and you'll be asked to tilt the phone slightly \u2014 after a few seconds your photo is ready to view and can even be refocused afterwards. 5. Hide your least favourite Instagram filters Save some time thumbing through Instagram's filters by hiding the ones you never use: scroll all the way to the right, tap \"Manage\", and you can re-order the filters in your list or hide them by unticking the relevant circle. Alternatively, tap and hold on the thumbnails on the main Filters screen, dragging them to a new position or onto the photo itself to hide them. You can always bring a filter back again if you change your mind. 6. Change the intensity of filters on Instagram Tapping once applies an Instagram filter, but you can tap again to bring up a slider that changes the intensity of the effect. If you love an effect but find it just a little bit too strong, then this is the place to go \u2014 you can also add a border from the same screen. Other Instagram effects, like brightness, contrast and warmth, can be added via the spanner icon and again adjusted manually through a slider. 7. Tweak white balance with VSCO Cam VSCO Cam is one of the leading mobile camera apps for both iOS and Android and lets you take more control over your pictures. One of the ways in which it does this is by enabling you to tweak the white balance of your shots: on the capture screen, tap the settings wheel at the top, then the \"ADV\" button to bring up the slider at the bottom. One tap on the brightness icon lets you switch to white balance instead. 8. Use the rule of thirds in VSCO Cam VSCO Cam, like several other camera apps, lets you overlay a grid of nine rectangles on top of your picture before you hit the shutter button. This relates to an old photography trick called the rule of thirds: the idea is you try and get the most interesting parts of the shot close to the lines or the intersections between them. To get it up on screen, tap the settings wheel at the top and then the icon showing a cross inside a square. 9. Change shutter speed in Camera+ One of the reasons you might want to get yourself a third-party camera app is the extra settings you can gain access to. Camera+ for iOS is one example, an app that lets you tweak the shutter speed of your iPhone's camera among other settings. Tap the menu button (lower right), then \"Advanced controls\", then toggle the \"Always show\" switch to on. Back on the capture screen, tap the middle \"Auto\" button to pick an appropriate shutter speed for the subject you're trying to shoot. 10. Pick the right mode in Camera+ Another useful Camera+ feature can be found in the lightbox (tap the flower icon in the lower left to see it). Choose to edit a picture from here, and you can choose from 16 different scene modes: everything from Concert to Beach. Once you pick one of the scene modes from the list, Camera+ automatically adjusts the colour, brightness and other image settings to match your choice \u2014 there are options for darkening an image, reducing the effects of fluorescent light, improving the image clarity, and more. 11. Create an antique look with Camera Zoom FX Check any list of best camera apps for Android and Camera Zoom FX is likely to be on it. One of the app's best features is the stack of filters it comes with, available in the photo library component \u2014 choose a picture then open up the edit pane via the crayon icon button to find it. Some of the filters require a small payment, but there are a few free ones to play around with: Holga 35mm (in the Favourite/ Ready Made section) makes your pictures look like they were taken by a classic camera of the past. 12. Get better macro shots with Camera Zoom FX Camera Zoom FX also offers a variety of focus modes for you to pick from to get better pictures. When you're composing your shot, tap on the settings icon (three sliders) then select Focus from the list \u2014 choose Macro to tell the app to focus on objects in the very near foreground. Give it a try when taking close-ups of whatever subject (you can still tap anywhere on the display to set the focus point as usual). 13. Change ISO settings in Afterlight The polished Afterlight brings with it a stack of helpful tools for iOS, Android or Windows Phone: its primary focus is filters, textures and frames for your pictures, but it includes its own photo capture component too. Tap on the \"M\" button on the capture screen to bring up the manual controls, then choose \"ISO\" to adjust the light sensitivity of the image. A higher ISO means better pictures in low light, but the noise of the photo can increase too. 14. Experiment with filters in Afterlight Back to those Afterlight filters, and there are 74 to pick from, whether you're taking a new picture or importing an existing one. Tap on the coloured swirl icon to begin browsing the available filters \u2014 each one is previewed as you select it and you can adjust the intensity using the slider underneath. There are also dozens of textures on offer behind the roll of film icon, which can make your image look like it was taken using real camera film. 15. Build Instagram collages with Pic Stitch Instagram now has its own separate collage-making app (Layout) but Pic Stitch has been helping users get multiple photos into one Instagram square for a long time now. From the app's front screen, choose one of the layouts from the many on offer, then tap once in each square to snap a picture or choose one from your camera gallery, Facebook or Dropbox. Images can be rotated and zoomed inside their frames, so you can focus in on the most important parts of each picture. 16. Improve your portrait shots in Facetune Make sure your Facebook friends or potential Tinder matches always see your best side by touching up your portrait selfie shots with FaceTune \u2014 it's like a mobile Photoshop dedicated entirely to your face. From the main editing screen, tap \"Whiten\" to brighten up your teeth, \"Smooth\" to get rid of wrinkles or \"Tones\" to conceal dark patches underneath your eyes. \"Details\" lets you boost your eyes (or another winning feature) and \"Patch\" can remove blemishes, while \"Reshape\" improves the symmetry of the image and lets you move parts of your face around like putty. 17. Cut people from the shot with A Better Camera One of the tricks that Android app A Better Camera brings to the table is removing objects or people from of your pictures with a few taps of your finger. It focuses on moving targets, so essentially you can save your landscape shots even if someone wanders in front of the lens. On the capture screen tap the Modes button (bottom right) then choose \"Smart multishot\" \u2014 when you tap the shutter button, several images are taken in quick succession. Choose \"Object removal\" and you can then tap on moving objects or people to remove them. 18. Sort your photos more easily in SmugMug SmugMug doesn't let you capture photos but it's a handy app for keeping them organised on your mobile devices and the Web. One of the ways it does this is by letting you filter by keyword, so you can instantly call up all your photos of the kids with a simple search, even if they're spread out over several years (assuming you've assigned all the correct keywords first). There's also a photo rating filter in SmugMug to enable you to keep your favourite five-star snaps close at hand. 19. Straighten perspective issues with 500px 500px is great for discovering new photographers and sharing your own work, but the photo-taking part of the mobile app is worth a look too \u2014 it actually features tools developed by Adobe for its own Photoshop software. Tap the \"Upright\" button underneath a picture to correct perspective problems (if you've shot a lighthouse from the bottom of it for example): \"Level\" straightens the main lines in the photo without changing their angle, \"Vertical\" adjusts the image so vertical lines run straight from the top to the bottom, and \"Full\" corrects both vertical and horizontal lines. 20. Adjust shadows and highlights with Snapseed Google just pushed out an update to its photo editing app Snapseed, and one of the bigger changes is a new highlights tool to go alongside the existing shadows one. These features let you brighten up dark areas of your picture and tone down lighter sections to make details clearer \u2014 with an image open, tap the plus icon, then \"Tune Image\". Tap and drag on the picture to choose \"Shadows\" or \"Highlights\" and then drag your finger from left to right across the screen to make adjustments. 21. Use the hardware buttons For some this will be second nature but not everyone has stumbled across this tip: on iPhones and most Android phones you can use the volume control buttons to take a snap rather than pressing the shutter button on screen \u2014 in fact Windows Phone devices have a separate hardware button on the side especially for this purpose. A lot of the time it's a more natural way to take a picture and lets you hold your smartphone more securely while you're trying to compose the perfect shot (or selfie).",
