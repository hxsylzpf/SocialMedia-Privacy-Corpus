  "content": "Hello. Good weekend? Mine started most amusingly on Friday night with Fiona Bruce trying to explain Twitter on the 10 O'Clock News. It was a real don't-scare-the-horses moment. Then on Saturday I watched The Killing of Sister George (\"A flawed, credible cow!\"), which I really enjoyed, plus Demons and Your Country Needs You, which I did not. When folks talk about the revival in Saturday night telly, the renaissance in family viewing, the dazzling originality of such and how the formats are being sold around the world, they do not refer to these dreadful, derivative shows. And let's not even get started on Total Wipeout. While the BBC's hunt for a British Eurovision entry is as abysmal as you'd expect (though it was interesting to see Diane Warren), I'm really disappointed with Demons. It just gets worse. And worse. And - oh there it goes again - worse. And the worst thing is, it could actually be good. The sad news that Tony Hart died coloured my Sunday, so to speak. Sending a bit of one's \"art\" into the Gallery was something of a rite of passage, especially if it didn't appear. Obviously none of my efforts ever graced the Gallery - not even what I thought was a good depiction of an underwater scene, complete with coral and seaweed and a diver and everything. Did I get an acknowledgement that the drawing had been received? Tips on how I might improve my octopuses? Suggestions that I might add a shipwreck or submarine? Did I hell. Anyway, this experience is filed under Childhood Disappointments along with realising that Jonathan and Jennifer Hart were not my real parents, never winning a competition or getting through on a phone-in to Swap Shop, or Saturday Superstore, or Going Live (because, I reasoned, it took longer to dial the number on account of living outside London) and not ever having Jim'll Fix It fix it for me. (There are others, but I shan't go into them here.) Despite my repeated letter-writing efforts to Jimmy Savile - I once asked to be a contestant on The Adventure Game and on another occasion to join the Kids From Fame - the old bugger never wrote back once. In retrospect, I realise that I might have been aiming a little high with the Kids From Fame aspiration, but would it have killed them to let me on The Adventure Game? It was a bloody BBC programme. And even if neither dream could come true, you'd have thought that Savile (or some researcher who's now in charge of the BBC's children's output) might at least have had the courtesy to break the news to me personally. Or even impersonally. But did I receive any such notification? No. Instead, I eyed my mum suspiciously and quizzed her as to exactly where and when she'd posted my letters, convinced she was trying to keep me from my destiny. (See also Jonathan and Jennifer Hart.) Still, these rites of passage made me the person I am - a sullen misanthrope with a chip on each shoulder. I do wonder what kids today do for such rites - other than sneer at people who use the phrase \"kids today\". Catch chlamydia, I suppose. I have never met anyone who actually had something in Tony Hart's gallery - or indeed had Jim fix it for them - so I now invite you to share with the group your childhood disappointments. I would suggest you dig your neglected artwork out of your (or your parents') attic, scan them and then post them in a special Guardian Gallery, but there probably isn't the bandwidth (or whatever) for such a thing - and I'm really not that bothered. Kidding. I am bothered. Share!",
