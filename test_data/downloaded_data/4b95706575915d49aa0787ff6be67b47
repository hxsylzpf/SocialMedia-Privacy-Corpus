In a post on the Microsoft blog one of the company's most senior competition lawyers makes a series of digs at its rival - and ultimately tries to bolster its own opinion that Microsoft never did anything wrong, while simultaneously suggesting that if Google falls foul of competition law, it will only be getting what it deserves: \"Microsoft would obviously be among the first to say that leading firms should not be punished for their success... our concerns relate only to Google practices that tend to lock in business partners and content... and exclude competitors\". \u2022 The Operation Aurora attacks - those ones that hit Google, Adobe and others - may have been more widespread than previously thought.
