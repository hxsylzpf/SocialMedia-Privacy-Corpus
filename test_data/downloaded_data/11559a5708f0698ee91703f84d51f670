Editors will only be allowed to print material gained in these ways if they can show the articles concerned have got a strong public interest defence, the PCC said. Yesterday's announcement was too late for David Beckham, whose sexually suggestive text messages to his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos were splashed across the News of the World last month. The new rules come into force on June 1. Among other changes the code states that publications subject to criticism must include a reference to the PCC in the headline. This is a compromise: the chairman, Sir Christopher Meyer, had hoped to persuade editors to agree to a common \"branding\" for adjudications. The code will also apply to online editions. Matt Wells",
