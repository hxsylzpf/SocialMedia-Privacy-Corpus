The Brighton-based Swede runs his channel under the wing of the multi-channel network Maker Studios, which is in the process of being acquired by Disney in a deal worth up to $950m. PewDiePie \u2013 aka Felix Kjellberg \u2013 ended April with 26.4m subscribers to his channel, which is an audience rivalled only by YouTube's own channel, which has more than 22m subscribers. The chart of YouTube channels is produced by the industry site Tubefilter. Its latest rankings reveal that Katy Perry was the second biggest star on YouTube in April with 256.2m views on her channel, and more than 510,000 new subscribers, taking her total to 12.2m. The third- and fourth-placed channels provide a reminder of the large audience of children watching YouTube. The DisneyCollector channel posts video reviews of children's toys from popular brands, and generated 192.3m views in April, ending the month with 1.3m subscribers. Stampy, a Minecraft-exploring cat \u2013 aka Joseph Garrett \u2013 notched up 177.2m views during the month, adding more than 268,000 subscribers to take his total past 2.5m. Garrett, who is British, is also part of the Maker Studios stable, and is preparing to launch a second channel focusing on education. Garrett disclose those plans at the MIPTV conference in April, and Maker this month showed off the new channel \u2013 called Stampy School \u2013 at its Newfronts event for brands and advertising agencies in New York. The American wrestling body the WWE also enjoyed a strong April on YouTube, thanks to the buzz around its annual Wrestlemania event. Its channel generated 145m views that month, adding more than 218,000 subscribers to reach 3.3m overall. Overall, the chart shows the diverse ecosystem of established stars, new faces, big media organisations and newer digital brands jostling for attention on YouTube. For example, the dance music channel Spinnin' Records, with its 141m views in April, was bigger than Shakira (133.4m) and One Direction (115.9m). YouTube creators The Fine Brothers (118m), Smosh (86.8m) and Rooster Teeth (85m) drew bigger audiences than official channels from the NBA (82.8m) and BBC (59.6m). The charts also show how the audience for the most popular YouTube channels has grown over time. In April, the top 100 generated 8.1bn video views in total, up from 5.8bn in October 2013, and 5.2bn in June 2013 \u2013 the first month Tubefilter produced its monthly chart.",
