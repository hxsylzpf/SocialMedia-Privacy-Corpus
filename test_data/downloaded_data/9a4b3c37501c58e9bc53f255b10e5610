  "content": "Taking tough action that purports to protect children has long been thought a political trump card, something no would-be statesman can afford to oppose, whether the action in question is effective or not. It is thus both remarkable and welcome that, after days of bad publicity, the children's secretary Ed Balls yesterday agreed to review the details of the government's clunking fist of a scheme to vet those who volunteer or work with children. The new system of blackballing went through parliament by acclamation three years ago, as MPs moved to show a response to the terrible though unusual murder of two children in Soham in 2002. But after a weekend of excited stories about hearsay evidence being deployed against Brown Owls and providers of lifts, Mr Balls yesterday signalled in a letter to the chair of the children's select committee that he was asking the bureaucrat in charge of implementing the scheme to look again at exactly who it should cover. While commendable, it is highly doubful that this move will address everything that is awry with the plan. There are two basic concerns. First, it will do little to make children safer. The chief lesson of the Soham case \u2013 where the murderer Ian Huntley managed to become a school caretaker despite past suspicions about him from a police force in another part of the country \u2013 was the importance of local police computer systems talking to one another, rather than the need for a new database. And as Baby P's death has underlined, the chief danger to children most often comes from within the home, not from service staff or volunteers. Secondly, the vetting scheme \u2013 under which local newspaper stories might be counted as evidence and which provides for only limited appeal rights \u2013 is part of a pattern. Like Asbos and the defeated plan for 42 days of pre-trial detention, it extends the power of public authorities to make punishing decisions without the need to sustain allegations to the criminal standard of proof in a court of law. (Any claim that being barred from volunteering does not amount to punishment would wear pretty thin when faced with telling fellow-parents in a lift-sharing club that one was dropping out because of unfounded paedophilia allegations). Assuming innocence until guilt is proven means running all sorts of risks, sometimes terrible ones, but it is a cherished principle nonetheless. Casting a pall of suspicion on those wanting to work or volunteer with children warps relationships while deterring community-minded behaviour and affording little protection. Perhaps Mr Balls's concession yesterday is a sign that the public has at long last woken up to this reality.",
