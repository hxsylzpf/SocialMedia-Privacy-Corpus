Eye instead the company's S-1 filing with the US securities and exchange commission, and the key figures that stand out are that it took seven years to create a company with $3.7bn in revenues and $1bn in profit. No wonder, then, that from nothing Mark Zuckerberg may have amassed a fortune that, give or take, is worth $1bn for each of his 27 years of age. The growth may, or may not continue but, in an era where the media business is supposedly in decline, out comes one man to create an online environment that is so popular that it is becoming the make-or-break environment for other media brands, whether it is the games company Zynga or the all-you-listen-to Spotify. Then ask, why does nothing like this happen in Britain: why is this country unable to create a globally significant disruptive media or internet business? It's not as if Britain has the excuse of speaking a foreign language to the US , or that the internet is some sort of secret environment only available on secure computers to the citizens of northern California. But never mind, because in London, at least, we have the entertainment provided by the Leveson inquiry, where we can rake over the past 20 years of press intrusion and non-regulation in the hope that we might end up with newspapers that can, if nothing else, sort of agree on the rules of the game \u2013 while leaving Facebook-land and the internet as untouched and unregulated as before. Britain may be a country without a constitution, but its fourth estate seems to have developed with its own enduring features and strongly held notions of checks and balances. Many newspapers are more than a century old, with entrenched political positions to match; the broadcasters may be newer but they, too, have become solid, permanent institutions in two generations. In all this mix, the principal disturber in the past 40 years was Rupert Murdoch, whose Sun and Sky came out of nowhere \u2013 and who only overreached himself when he tried to combine ownership of the two. But whether it is the power of an existing oligopoly, a lack of capital for start-up alternatives, or just an exaggerated sense of deference, it is traditional British media that hold sway in the current era. Media, that, at the same time, are largely worrying about their own long-term survival, whether because of falling readerships, fragmenting audiences or deteriorating advertising. This is not to say that Leveson is unnecessary when Zuckerberg is making his billions; the testimony, say, of Baroness Hollins, whose daughter Abigail Witchalls was stabbed and left for dead in 2005 and who only learned that her daughter was pregnant from a newspaper article, was a case in point. But it is dispiriting that so much energy has to go into solving the problem of press regulation \u2013 statute or not statute? \u2013 when minds might be occupied elsewhere. And yes, while it is unlikely to be the case that the next generation of internet entrepreneurs will become inert because they are glued to the testimony of newspaper lawyers, it is the discussion about remedying the mistakes of the past that dominates the agenda. A recent effort to explain the big media stories in London to a New Yorker left him bemused. Never has the prevailing narrative in the two countries been as divergent. How did it happen? Perhaps our institutional media stability creates too much hierarchy and too much deference. So was groupthink in response to a perceived need to please a proprietor how phone hacking came about? Staying in the office and being told what to do certainly doesn't help create any more Zuckerbergs.",
