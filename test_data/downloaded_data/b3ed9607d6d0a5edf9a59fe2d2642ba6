  "content": "What might be the impact of social networking on the general election? Party political communications officers are sure it will be significant. Steve Grove from YouTube has been to parliament to urge parties to use his site. And Mumsnet is the site of the newest key election battlefield. All of this promises to cause us much pain. If party election broadcasts are inexplicably poor on television why would they be any better on a laptop? YouTube will simply magnify the clumsy oratory and charmlessness. Fear also, the Twitter election. Tim Montgomerie of ConservativeHome is keen for Cameron to make another policy U-turn and stake his claim in 140 characters. Kerry McCarthy MP (apparently Labour's Twitter tsar) \u2013 thinks it will drive news agendas. But underneath such froth social networking media may still be of electoral significance \u2013 just not for the reasons many politicians think. Three things are important to appreciate. First, there are some rather odd things about voting decisions and behaviours. For instance, there is a lot of evidence indicating the \"bandwagon effect\": people voting for the party they think most likely to win. Then there are the contorted calculations people have to make if they live in marginal constituencies but want their vote to count. If you think the candidate you really want has no chance then you might ask which candidate will beat the candidate you least like. But is that other party likely to do well enough? If it isn't then you might as well vote for your first choice. How can you be sure? Second, this is, I think, going to be an odd election. All elections have some unique features. But this one will not be defined by a particular party or issue. It will be defined by the horrible void around which our politics currently swirls: a void of trust, ideological conviction and expectations into which will step the \"others\" (nationalists, Greens, local independents and Nazis) and all those urging us to stay away from the polls, or to spoil ballot papers and \"teach them a lesson\".   Third, for all the bluster of lobbyists, spin doctors and campaign managers it has always been clear that a most significant immediate influence on voting choice is simply what other people we know think.   With these three things in mind, think about what social networking does: it allows us easily to track the moving opinions and attitudes of one or more social groups. As users of services such as Facebook we can get a sense of \u2013 and share in \u2013 reactions to news events by seeing what friends are joining what campaigns and what the others are becoming fans of. We can know what events people are and aren't attending, identify music, films or books worth a second look. We may get a better barometer of some trends than we can from newspapers or broadcast media. Put that into the electoral context and the point is clear: social networking is all about stimulating bandwagon effects and letting us know what other people are thinking. If I am uncertain which party to vote for in a three-way split marginal constituency, what will I think when I can see how many friends (and friends of friends) are considering voting for a minority party? Choices that may, in the official media of the campaign, look wacky or marginal will suddenly seem \u2013 within some social groups \u2013 much more mainstream. Add in email circulars (jokes, rumours and propaganda) plus a few smart and easily forwarded YouTube videos and it is not hard to imagine the void of the election becoming filled by status updates. The effect may be marginal. But in this election there are a lot of marginal seats. All of this could be terrible. But it just might be a good thing and I really do hope that people are prepared to let their politics show online. Here is why. The secret ballot is a vital democratic procedure. But it makes the vote into a private confession rather then a public declaration of faith. There is something to be said for the public raising of hands in the town square. Often the \"public\" is a no more than a fiction authored by opinion pollsters and vox-popping news editors. In public votes we can see directly what each of us is choosing and an electorate, revealed as the true author of its own collective fate, can begin to hold itself to account. If people are willing to do their electoral thinking in public and online then, this election, social networking will create new, albeit socially skewed, town squares. What will matter won't be the inane tweets of politicians or of hunter-journalists \"on the campaign trail\", still less the absurd rantings of partisans in the political blogosphere. What will matter is what happens when an old school friend intimates interest in the BNP; when a number of friends' friends announce that they will vote for the Greens; when you find you are not the only mum online who thinks the way you do. If the screen that separates the public from itself is lifted what conversations or arguments will then be provoked? For a fleeting moment the thick fog of overexcited news media will clear and a great archipelago of online publics show itself. How much we like what then we find, remains to be seen. But it will be each other that are looking at.",
