  "content": "Privacy The committee's recommendations on privacy have been keenly awaited as high-profile cases have continued to stream through the courts, and the scrutiny of Mr Justice David Eady has provoked debate about how far parliament intended to introduce a law to protect privacy in the UK. The report acknowledged there were problems with the law. \"The high costs of litigation combined with the legal uncertainty, owing to the small amount of case law, undoubtedly discourages the media from contesting privacy cases,\" the report states. But it rejects any change to the law on privacy, concluding that more judgments are needed by the courts. \"Law relating to privacy will become clearer as more cases are decided by the courts,\" the report found. \"Matters relating to privacy should continue to be determined according to common law, and the \u00adflexibility that permits, rather than set down in statute.\" The committee also rejects calls by Max Mosley, the Formula 1 president who successfully sued the News of the World in 2008 for a story about sex sessions with prostitutes, that newspapers should be required to notify the subject of damaging allegations in advance. Instead, it recommends a change to the PCC code and procedural rules so that journalists develop the practice of notifying the subject of their articles, unless it is in the \"public interest\" not to do so. The committee also defends Judge Eady, the high court judge at the centrre of complaints that privacy law was being introduced \"through the back door\". \"The focus on this one judge regarding the development of privacy law \u2026 is misplaced and risks detracting from the ongoing national debate on the relationship between freedom of speech and the individual's right to privacy,\" the report says. Libel The report identifies numerous problems with English libel law, including the difficulties of proving facts are true, and arguing that comment is honest and based on some facts. The cost of libel proceedings is mentioned, with recommendations that more is done to provide certainty at an early stage in a case \"to cut the enormous cost of cases\". The committee describes the burden for the media of proving that allegations are true as \"complex, time-consuming and expensive\", adding that the government should examine the requirement that defendants, rather than the person making a libel claim, bear the burden of proving their case. The committee urges the government to conduct its own assessment. \"We recognise the difficulties with the whole burden of proof being placed on the defendant, but believe that in the interests of natural justice, defendants should be required to prove the truth of their allegations.We urge the government to examine this aspect of the operation of the UK's libel laws.\" The difficulties for scientists such as Simon Singh, whose case was heard by the court of appeal today, is acknowledged by the committee, \u00adparticularly in light of \"libel tourism.\" Although judges and lawyers have disputed claims of libel tourism, the report found that the problem is \"more than an embarrassment to our system\". \"The reputation of the UK is being damaged by overly flexible jurisdictional rules and their application by individual high court judges,\" the report states.There was some suggestion of a new law to codify aspects of the defences available to the media in libel cases, particularly with regards to the \"responsible journalism\" defence to protect investigative reporting and the work of NGOs. But the report falls short of concrete suggestions for a wide-reaching codification of libel law, which many believe is necessary to reverse years of piecemeal changes. Superinjunctions The committee was highly critical of the use of \"superinjunctions\" in several cases raised by the Guardian, after the oil trading company Trafigura and Barclays bank prevented reporting of a story or of the fact of the injunction itself. In the case of Trafigura, the report says, the situation was made more serious by the attempt to enforce the injunction against parliament after a member of the committee asked a question regarding the proceedings. \"The free and fair reporting of proceedings in parliament is a cornerstone of a democracy \u2026 the confusion over this issue has caused us the very gravest concern that this freedom is being undermined,\" the report says. \"[We] strongly urge that a way is found to limit the use of superinjunctions as far as is possible and to make clear that they are not intended to fetter the fundamental rights of the press to report the proceedings of parliament.\" As well as the principle of seeking injunctions on this scale, the report suggests they are increasingly impractical, in an age where information is often rapidly leaked on the internet. \"The impact of the internet on the leaking of information has fundamentally altered the dissemination of information, and consequently breaches of confidence,\" the report states. \"The Trafigura and Barclays cases raise issues over the use of injunctions\u2026 the ease with which they appear to be granted.\" But there is no clear recommendation for reform, simply an indication that parliament could make \"a clear statement regarding the way forward\" before the next election. On costs, the report calls on the government to look at \"measures to reduce costs and to speed up libel litigation will help address the mismatch in resources between wealthy corporations and impecunious defendants.\" Madeleine McCann The report is scathing, saying that newspapers were guilty of \"an inexcusable lowering of press standards\" in reporting the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in 2007. The intense interest in the case, the efforts of the McCann family to publicise their campaign and the lack of official information from the Portuguese police provided no justification for \"inaccurate\" and \"defamatory\" reporting, MPs on the cross-party committee said. Reporters in Praia da Luz, where Madeleine went missing just before her fourth birthday, were competing to satisfy a \"very unusual\" public demand for information, although it was not possible to say whether inaccurate articles were written as a result of pressure from editors. \"It is, however, clear that the press acted as a pack, ceaselessly hunting out fresh angles where new information was scarce,\" the report said. \"Portugal was also a foreign jurisdiction, where contempt of court laws were unclear, and no consideration was given to how reporting might prejudice any future trial. It is our belief that competitive and commercial factors contributed to abysmal standards in the gathering and publishing of news about the McCann case.\" Newspaper groups eventually paid out more than \u00a31.5m in damages over their reporting of the case: Express Newspapers paid the McCanns a reported \u00a3550,000 and another \u00a3375,000 to the so-called \"Tapas Seven\" group of friends who dined with the McCanns on the night Madeleine disappeared, while the expatriate property consultant Robert Murat received \u00a3600,000 from four newspaper groups \u2013 Express Newspapers, Associated Newspapers, News International and Mirror Group Newspapers. The MPs criticised newspapers for suggesting in evidence to the committee that the McCann story was so unusual that there were no grounds for changing their procedures or the Press Complaints Commission's code of conduct. Press Complaints Commission It says the body should have the power to fine newspapers that step out of line and even stop them printing for an issue. The PCC should also be renamed the Press Complaints and Standards Commission to reflect its role as an industry regulator that is more than a complaints-handling service. The MPs backed the idea of self-regulation of the press but said the PCC needed to have its powers enhanced because it was \"toothless\". \"In order to command public confidence that its rulings are taken seriously by the press, we believe that, in cases where a serious breach of the code [of practice] has occurred, the PCC should have the ability to impose a financial penalty,\" the report said. \"The industry may see giving the PCC the power to fine as an attack on the self-regulatory system. The reverse is true. We believe that this power would enhance the PCC's credibility and public support.\" The MPs suggested that this regime could be established by the newspaper industry independently of any statutory backing. In the most serious breaches of the newspaper code, the PCC should have the \"ultimate power\" to order printing of the offending publication to be suspended for one issue, the MPs argued. This would provide a \"very visible demonstration of the severity of the transgression\", the report said. The PCC has come under fire for not being sufficiently independent from the press, with newspaper figures including the editors of the Sunday Mirror and Mail on Sunday making up seven of the commission's 17 members. The MPs suggested that lay members should form a two-thirds majority on the commission to make it \"absolutely clear that the PCC is not overly influenced by the press\". They also recommended that the editors' code of practice committee, the body that writes newspaper industry guidelines enforced by the PCC, should include lay members, one of whom should be the chairman. At present it consists only of editors and is chaired by the Daily Mail's editor, Paul Dacre. The MPs said the PCC must become \"more proactive\" to deal with controversies such as the press coverage of Madeleine McCann's disappearance in 2007 and the spate of suicides of young people in and around Bridgend, south Wales, in 2007 and 2008. \"If there are grounds to believe that serial breaches of the code are occurring or are likely to occur, the PCC must not wait for a complaint before taking action,\" the PCC said. To provide an incentive for newspapers to subscribe to the self-regulatory system, the committee suggested that the government should consider whether proposals to reduce the costs of defamation cases should be made available only to publications belonging to the PCC that offered the public an alternative to taking grievances to court.",
