As plans are revealed for popular CV (and email pestering) site LinkedIn to lower its age limit in order to attract \"tweenagers\" who are \"already planning their careers\", it seems we must assume so. You may argue that this move demonstrates a distasteful failure to allow children to be children by inflicting upon them the inherent melancholy of the knowledge that one's destiny is merely that of a wage slave in a riddled service-based economy, and you'd not be wrong. It's a hard lesson which we all must learn, myself included. At 13, I was still intent on becoming an international pop sensation by stubbornly refusing to allow something as inconsequential as a terrible singing voice to stand in my way. (If I were writing my CV's skills section today, I would add \"blind optimism in the face of overwhelming contradictory evidence\".) Do you think a 13-year-old is too young to be subjected to the harsh realities of advanced capitalism? If an eight-year-old girl can be described as a \"leggy beauty\" by a tabloid newspaper, then a 13-year-old can be put to work. Only this century, it's less chimney sweep and more customer service representative. In an article this week, anthropologist David Graeber of the London School of Economics discussed the phenomenon of bullshit jobs. \"What does it say about our society that it seems to generate an extremely limited demand for poet-musicians, but an apparently infinite demand for specialists in corporate law?\", he asked. I don't know, but I know it's not good. On the bright side, if we allow 13-year-olds to upload their CVs to LinkedIn, the balance will be somewhat redressed. I must confess at this point to not just loathing LinkedIn (I receive an email notification purporting to be from my mother, demanding that I join, on an almost daily basis), but worrying that I may actually be allergic to it. Anything with a whiff of \"young professional\" about it gives me the willies. Try asking me for a business card at a networking event and you'll see what I'm talking about. In fact, try asking for me at a networking event. Of course, the real career news this morning is about the gender disparity in managerial bonuses, with male bonuses last year revealed to have been double that of women's. It makes for depressing reading. Nevertheless, having just been both amused and alarmed by the documentary Crazy About One Direction, I'm convinced that 13-year-old girls will not stand for this. They just won't have it. Seeing as they will do almost anything to gain the attention of their beloved Harry Styles on Twitter, I'm expecting to see tweets of \"Harry, my cat/nan/hamster died\" losing popularity in favour of \"Harry, my bonus sucks\". That's if they stop screaming for long enough to check their payslips \u2013 after uploading their CV to LinkedIn, of course.",
