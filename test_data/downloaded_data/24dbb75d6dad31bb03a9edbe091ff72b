  "content": "Here's our Twitter topic of the day: Republican congressman Pete Hoekstra is facing criticism over his use of Twitter during a trip to Iraq. Hoekstra, a member of the House intelligence committee, sent out Tweets using his BlackBerry making announcements such as \"Just landed in Baghdad\" and \"Moved into green zone by helicopter\". Although the updates seemed innocuous, Hoekstra's actions have riled up Democrats who say his updates endangered the safety of the cross-party delegation he was travelling with.

UPDATE: Here are some responses from Twitter users dslunceford as the mgr of @GovTwit, I think we should encourage elected officials to use Twitter; follow basic rule: think 1st/tweet smart bethbeck Govt officials may someday use Twitter 4 primary communication tool. World is changing. War zone twitters may become commonplace fleurbrown twittering in war zones? Same rules should apply as 4 journo/photojournos. Just b/c its real time doesn't make it wrong Saraguin I think reps should twitter the heck out of the war zone gonzomehum Pretty obviously a huge security risk if you're going to broadcast your position in near-realtime while in Iraq. Hoekstra's dim. JonathanEx Really depends on the content: specific movement details could be a risk, so no, but reactions and thoughts should be fine. d_gasser Only if they're not idiots about it (cf \"Rivera, Geraldo\") crewislife If has nothing to do w/ troop movements or sensitive info, I don't see a problem. But there should be limits. Thank you for all the great contributions. \u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday February 12 2009. The congressman in question is Pete, not Mike Hoekstra. This has been corrected.",
