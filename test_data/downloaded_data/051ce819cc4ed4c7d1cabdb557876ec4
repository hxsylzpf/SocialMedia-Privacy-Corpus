  "content": "\u2022 If the decision by Activision to take control of the Call of Duty franchise from its Infinity Ward subsidiary was a surprise, then the next stage of the story is anything but: Jason West and Vince Zampella, the two executives who mysteriously parted ways with the company on Monday have filed a $36m lawsuit. In it, they allege wrongful termination and breach of contract and say that they are not being paid for what they have rightfully earned (the game has brought in more than $1bn in revenue). \u2022 Forget the idea that America is losing a cyberwar, put forward by senior former officials at the RSA security conference this week. In fact, says Obama's cybersecurity adviser there is no cyberwar. More accurately, Howard Schmidt says it's a bad idea to think of a 'war' at all. Tell that to Hillary Clinton, who dredged up a bucket load of cold war rhetoric in a recent speech laying into China. \u2022 Meanwhile the conflict between China and Google - the thing that really kicked off this whole bag of beans - seems to be getting somewhere. Chinese officials say they're working to alleviate Google's concerns. Remember, though: for all of the tough talk from the Silicon Valley company, we're now almost two months on from its threat to lift the censorship of its Chinese search engine... and there's been nothing. All talk and no action, or clever diplomacy? You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, @gdngames or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
