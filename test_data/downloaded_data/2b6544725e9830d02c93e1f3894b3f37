  "content": "Britain has backed away from confronting China over cyber attacks preferring instead to emphasise the threats and opportunities it said all countries faced through the rapid growth of cyberspace. William Hague, the foreign secretary, said on Wednesday that the London Cyberspace Conference he hosted was not \"judgmental\" and that the source of cyber attacks was \"very difficult to verify\". He said he was not going to publicly name the \"guilty men\" responsible for such attacks. He went as far only to acknowledge \"a difference\" between western governments and China towards freedom of expression \"off line as well as on line\". Privately, British officials say western governments will back off criticising China given its potential for helping the west, and the eurozone in particular, out of their economic problems. Officials privately are also not so diplomatic as ministers, blaming China for attacks on British government computer systems. Hague said in February that the Foreign Office had repelled a cyber attack a month earlier from \"a hostile state intelligence agency\". Sources told the Guardian at the time that the attack was believed to be from Chinese intelligence agencies. Lady Pauline Neville Jones, the prime minister's special adviser to business on cybersecurity, said earlier this week that Russia and China were some of the worst culprits involved in cyber-attacks. \"It's damaging in the end to try to play both sides,\" she said. \"If you are a company that comes from a country like China you can suffer if in the end people believe it's threatening to employ your products.\" Hague on Wednesday said four messages for governments had come out of the conference which was attended by 700 delegates from more than 60 countries. They were: \u2022 a rapid rise in cyber crime is a growing threat to every country; \u2022 governments cannot treat cyberspace as if it belonged to them; \u2022 state-sponsored cyberspace attacks are not in the interest of any country in the long term, and; \u2022 those attempting to hinder transparency and the free flow of ideas will fail. \"More and more citizens in more countries are going to expect to be able to hold people to account by being able to have vastly more information available about what governments are doing than ever before\", Hague said. \"State-sponsored attacks are not in the interests of anyone in the long term,\" he added. Hague acknowledged that China and Russia advocated tighter regulation of the internet through a code of conduct. Hague insisted at a press conference at the end of a press conference that the British government would not shut down social media in the event of criminal investigations by law enforcement agencies. Their action would \"not include the shutting down of social media\".",
