  "content": "A student who raised $1m through internet advertising is being blackmailed by hackers, it emerged yesterday. Alex Tew, who hit an internet jackpot with his Million Dollar Homepage website, is being targeted by internet criminals who have sent a series of threats demanding a $50,000 (\u00a328,000) ransom. They finally launched an attack which brought down his website. \"Hello u website is under us attack,\" one email reportedly said. \"To stop the DDoS [distributed denial of service] send us 50000$.\" The milliondollarhomepage.com site has been experiencing problems for several days, despite the best efforts of the American company that hosts it. But Mr Tew, 21, has refused to respond to the blackmailers' demands. \"I haven't replied to any of them, as I don't want to give them the satisfaction and I certainly don't intend to pay them any money,\" he told the BBC. Mr Tew, of Cricklade, Wiltshire, made more than $1m in advertising after coming up with a novel idea to clear his university debt. Advertisers were offered a prime piece of internet real estate in exchange for cash, and within weeks the page had become a web phenomenon. The demands, from an organisation calling itself the Dark Group, began in early January. But it was only last week that the criminals launched what is known as a distributed denial of service attack on the website. These strikes first involve thousands of computers being infected by a virus enabling them to be commanded from a remote location. So-called \"zombie\" PCs are then told to visit the target website all at once, causing it to collapse under the weight of traffic.",
