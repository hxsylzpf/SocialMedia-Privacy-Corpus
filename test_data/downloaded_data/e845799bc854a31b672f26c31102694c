  "content": "He might have missed the traditional Christmas book rush, but Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams is publishing a book of his best tweets. The party's bookshop website says that the tweets by the \"well known public figure\" have been described as \"bizarre, weird and as part of a clever strategy\". The tweets in the compact book have been \"selected by the man himself\". The blurb continues: \"His tweets range across the political and the personal, the serious and the humorous, often featuring rubber ducks and teddy bears! This little books shows the lighter side of his personality and allows the reader some insight into his private life. The inevitable selfies are included showing that many years experience of politics have taught him not to take himself too seriously!\" We cannot be sure that any of these tweets are in the book, but here are some Adams classics that definitely should be included. And this from Thursday night: My Little Book of Tweets costs \u00a36.88 plus shipping (it weighs 450g) and gift wrapping options are available. It is released on 29 January. However, if that does not appeal there are no less than 13 titles by Adams to choose from, including An Irish Voice: The Quest for Peace, Who Fears to Speak? and the autobiography Before the Dawn.",
