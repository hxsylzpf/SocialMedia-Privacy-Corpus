  "content": "It is extraordinary how little politicians know about the newspapers they both seek to influence and attempt to humble. And it is also depressing to see them make much of very little. So it was yesterday when MPs and peers on the joint parliamentary committee on privacy and injunctions questioned Viscount Rothermere about his proprietorship of the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust (DMGT). When he told them about his so-called pact with Express owner Richard Desmond - which dates back to more than a decade ago - they registered amazement. He explained that a deal had been struck between Desmond and one of his executives - Murdoch MacLennan, who was then managing director of the DMGT division, Associated Newspapers, that owns the Daily Mail - to refrain from publishing personal criticisms of each other. Rothermere said: \"I believe that Mr MacLennan... had lunch with Mr Desmond and reported back to me that Mr Desmond and himself had agreed that it was not in the interests of the respective groups to use the pages of our newspapers for mudslinging.\" Lord Myners called it \"an extraordinary incursion into editorial independence.\" Well, not quite, milord. First off, it is hardly a new revelation and was certainly no secret at the time. In February 2001, as The Guardian reported at the time Desmond met MacLennan at London's Howard hotel to agree on a truce. It happened days after the Daily Express had made what was reported as \"an unprecedented attack\" on the Rothermere dynasty and the Mail. MacLennan and Desmond were said to have reached \"a gentlemen's agreement\" to ensure that their papers would refrain from publishing any more personal attacks on their owners. Anyone who knows MacLennan, who left Associated in 2004 to become chief executive of the Telegraph group, will be aware of his own deep-seated belief that newspapers should not be critical of rival owners and managers. I am not suggesting he met Desmond off his own back without Rothermere's knowledge, but Rothermere did say MacLennan set up the lunch \"of his own volition.\" And it has always been clear to me that in negotiating that deal MacLennan happened to be pursuing his own agenda. (That may indeed be seen as sinister, a restriction of press freedom, but no-one should doubt MacLennan's sincerity: he genuinely thinks we should be nice to each other). Anyway, as it turned out, the truce didn't hold, as these examples - here and here and here - clearly illustrate. I would have expected Myners to know all this. He was, after all, chairman of the Guardian Media Group from 2000 until 2008. To accuse Rothermere of hypocrisy, as Myners did yesterday, was surely way over the top. It was a one-off incident and, in fairness, there has never been any indication that Rothermere interferes in editorial matters. Indeed, what was so interesting about the rest of his interrogation by the committee was their incredulity that he had not brought his influence to bear on the Mail's coverage of the Madeleine McCann disappearance. They seemed to imply that he should have got involved (and thereby undermined his hands-off policy). Rothermere talked of his sympathy and \"personal concerns\" for Gerry and Kate McCann, saying: \"I think what the McCanns went through was very difficult for them, but I would not bring up the issue with Paul Dacre.\" He added: \"If I picked up the phone every single time I disagreed with an article then I would think I'd make their job an awful lot harder to do.\" Who can say fairer that that?
