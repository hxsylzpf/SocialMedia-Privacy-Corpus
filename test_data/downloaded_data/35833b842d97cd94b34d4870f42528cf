  "content": "Darren Bent, famous for using his Twitter Page and once to reveal that his mother had been racially abused by a Sunderland fan before the team's Premier League game at Wigan Athletic in November, has left the site. \"I have shut the Twitter down,\" the sometime England striker said . \"I had a good chat with the manager and I just thought that, with the run we're on at the moment, I needed to get rid of the distractions. I have to solely focus on getting Sunderland out of the relegation battle. \"Twitter became a distraction I didn't need, I thought I would concentrate fully on the football. People were writing stories in the papers about me from what I put on Twitter \u2013 there was a lot made of it.\" Before the unfortunate incident involving his mother and a fan \u2013 the latter is now banned from attending matches for three years \u2013 Bent used his Twitter page to detail his frustration at a delayed \u00a310m transfer from Spurs to Sunderland last summer, undiplomatically painting Tottenham Hotspur's chairman, Daniel Levy, as the bad guy. Steve Bruce, Sunderland's manager, said of Bent's move to stop tweeting: \"I think it's the right decision for Darren. I think when things aren't going too well for your team, especially, it's a good thing to be seen focusing entirely on your football.\" Bent added: \"I don't even go on Twitter any more to look at what other people are posting. I felt that, for me, it's run its course and I should get out of it. I got a lot of positive feedback from people on Twitter, though, and I've not stepped back because of anything that's been said on Twitter to me or about me.\" The unavoidable suspicion is that Sunderland became alarmed by the frankness of some of Bent's posts and were more concerned about what their principal striker might come out with next.",
