  "content": "For 75 minutes last week I appeared before Gerald Kaufman's Select Committee on privacy and media intrusion. It was an unusual and alarming experience, but I could not help feeling I had been there before. Sure enough, two nights later, it came to me in a dream. There before me was Gerald Kaufman, a truly scary amalgam of the King and Queen of Hearts. 'Give your evidence,' he barked, 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot.' Kaufman's show trial had been a spooky revival of Alice in Wonderland, faithfully reproducing all the logic and fair play of Alice's dream. I was a bit player in this drama, appearing as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission's code committee of editors, which writes the journalists' code of conduct - so important they actually forgot I was going to be there. The star witnesses were Guy Black, director of the Press Complaints Commission, and Professor Bob Pinker, the PCC's acting chairman. You could tell it was going to be a rough ride when the first questioner accused the PCC of 'protesting too much' because it had provided such a detailed submission. If Guy Black had been a married man, the first question would surely have been 'When did you stop beating your wife?' I tried early on to complain that a member of the committee had published an article the day before containing provocative criticism of press self-regulation - a mildly unfair advance judgment, I thought, of evidence the committee member had yet to hear. Guilty until proven innocent, surely? My complaint was brought to a sudden, furious halt. 'Order, order,' bellowed the chairman. Kaufman stared ahead after his outburst, ashen, still, and silent. Everyone must have thought for a moment we were to lose the chairman mid-hearing. Luckily, he just needed time to compose himself before announcing what a worthy piece Chris Bryant MP had written, and how much he enjoyed it. That's all right then. This 'jury' won't need too long to decide what it thinks. And so it went on. The eager-eyed Bryant, peering beneath his fastidious crop of red hair, tried so hard to be aggressive, but left you with the sense of being savaged by Alice's dormouse. He wanted us to know he had evidence that journalists gave money to policemen. What were we going to do about it? Er, Mr Bryant, this is a criminal issue. You are the one with the evidence. Give it to the police. Kaufman wanted to know what action had been taken since a woman MP three days before had spoken in the House of Commons of 'rumours' that media were intruding upon families who had lost relatives in Iraq. How were we to know such a thing unless we scoured the written record of every forum in the country where such a complaint might be raised? Kaufman gave us a look that managed somehow to be both lugubrious and jubilant. 'Ah ha,' he seemed do think, 'now I've caught them!' We tried tell him that the issue of avoiding intrusion upon the grief-stricken was a daily difficulty for reporters everywhere. There were firm guidelines in the Code of Practice. Every editor knows the rules without having to be reminded of them. Indeed, we had a record of organising the mass withdrawal of newspa pers from scenes of great private grief, such as Dunblane or Soham. Mr Bryant kept plugging away. 'Clean up your act,' he cried, in a further vivid demonstration of his objectivity. How could we let Neil Wallis, former editor of the People, serve on the PCC after being censured? Reasonable question, although in five years as editor Wallis was censured only twice. But then Bryant went on to tell us it was as if Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken were allowed to judge MPs' ethics. Hang on. One took cash in brown envelopes and the other is a crook who went to prison. Was Bryant serious, or showboating in search of some rare publicity? At this point it was tempting to draw the committee's attention to the fact that the House of Commons got rid of its own internal regulator because she was too diligent. However the atmosphere was heated enough. Our answers were sometimes obtuse, it's true, but only in response to obtuse questions. Debra Shipley MP asked an impenetrable question about the identification of paedophiles - hardly ordinary folk. As our repeated attempts to answer failed to satisfy, a victorious Shipley began to sway so perilously backwards and forwards in her chair you feared she might topple over. In the end, Kaufman came to the rescue of his confused colleague. Another committee member seemed more concerned about the difficulty he was having with the Mail on Sunday over his own personal complaint. And so it went on. It compared so oddly with the elaborate courtesy extended earlier during a love-in with representatives of the BBC complaints authority - a body so open it had to confess to not even list ing its telephone number. Through it all I remember one or two constructive moments, glimmers of serious attention, the recognition that the tricky balance between privacy and public interest needs constant attention. John Thurso, a cool and dapper Lib Dem MP with an impressive squadron leader's moustache, asked why we did not have an independent auditor to verify the PCC's procedures. A perfectly sensible thought. 'We will reflect on it,' responded Prof Pinker, relieved at last to have a serious exchange. In the end we were saved by the division bell. Some committee members had stayed silent. You prayed they had more serious questions, or at least an interest in hearing of the PCC's work. As the committee hurried off to vote, leaving us sitting bewildered, you wondered what had happened. Was it all a set-up? Was this the tip of the iceberg of Labour control freakery? Did they detest so incurably the existence of free, penetrating, rowdy, impolite, vulgar, newspapers? Was it merely that Kaufman's skill as a tough and fair-minded parliamentarian had faded in his twilight years? The PCC's chance to discuss its strong record of service to the public had been obscured in prejudice, deliberate misunderstanding and 'rumour'. It had lost the opportunity to put the case that press standards had vastly improved under the PCC. The huge amount of proactive work with the most vulnerable groups in society - the mentally ill, refugees, prisoners, transsexuals, you name it - was brushed aside. It had been unable to talk constructively about improvements to the Code and to customer service; or its success as a complaints resolution body; achievements in protecting the public from abuses of press freedom; the speed with which complaints are investigated; the growing number of requests from other countries for help setting up exactly the system of self-regulation that the MPs were pillorying. At the end, you could not help recalling the climactic moment of the trial in Alice. 'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. 'Who cares for you?' said Alice, 'You're nothing but a pack of cards!' \u00b7 Les Hinton is chairman of News International and chairman of the PCC's code committee of editors.",
