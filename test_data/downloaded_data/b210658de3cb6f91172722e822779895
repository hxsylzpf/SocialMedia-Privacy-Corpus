  "content": "Name: Anton Casey Age: 39. Appearance: Pasty expat Brit. That's not very nice. I don't think you'll find many people who have a good word to say about Mr Casey. What does he do? He's a fund manager. In that case, fire away. Amazingly, Casey's job is the least unattractive thing about him. What's his problem? Casey \u2013 who lives in Singapore \u2013 had to leave his Porsche at the garage, obliging him to take the train. Good for him to see how the other half lives. He then posted a picture of his son sitting on said train on Facebook, along with the caption: \"Daddy, where is your car &amp; who are all these poor people?\" Nice. Casey later posted another picture of his son sitting in the newly repaired Porsche, with the words: \"Ahhhhhhhhh, reunited with my baby. Normal service can resume, once I have washed the stench of public transport off me ...!\" He doesn't come across well on social media, does he? No. Soon another of Casey's Facebook postings went viral: a picture of his bundled-up taxi driver, with the caption: \"Today's cabbie retard award goes to ... Mr Arm Warmers, stripy mittens &amp; towel on the lap man ... After all it's only 37C outside.\" Maybe Mr Arm Warmers was chilled by the full-on air-conditioning required by his sweaty expat clientele. That was pointed out in the torrent of online abuse that followed. Perhaps a man's character should not be judged by unguarded comments, but by how he responds to the subsequent death threats. Casey changed his profile name to Anson Stasey, and when that failed to put people off the scent he deleted the account, and that of his wife, former Miss Singapore Bernice Wong. That last detail is perfect. As an encore he issued a by-the-numbers apology (\"I have the highest respect and regard ...\" blah blah blah) through a public relations firm. How are his employers taking it? Crossinvest Asia said: \"We will take appropriate action once we are in possession of all the facts.\" Do say: \"Actually, Singapore's public transport is among the cleanest in the world.\" Don't say: \"If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all or I'll kill you.\"",
