  "content": "On Saturday 26 March, while loads of people marched on Whitehall, a bunch of geeks descended on Kings Place for the 3rd annual National Hack the Government Day. It was a mixture of old faces and new, some of whom got the hack day bug from the SXSW hack we ran a few weeks ago. The day was spent translating publicly released data to build digital products that either helped government save time or money, aided transparency, or just made everything a little bit better \u2013 for government and citizens. After eight hours of coding they showed what they had made to an audience made up of government, geeks, industry types, friends from the march, data-junkies and groupies. Around 40 hacks were built on the day, including 13 making better use of crime and justice data and a selection of others using transparency, transport, parliament, and public service information. Details of these hacks and others can be found on the Rewired State projects page \u2013 they are being loaded very slowly as the developerss recover enough to actually load the info. The grand-prize winning hack was created by Rob McKinnon, who developed a government data validation service: GovTrace. This showed 69% of public data released for re-use is \"partial data\" or \"bad data\", thus making it unsuitable for building from, and analysis. For a full write up of hacks that were shown and winners, see the list on the Rewired State site.",
