As we await the last ever Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, welcome to Monday Morning with Media Monkey. \u2712No one dislikes Ross quite like the Daily Mail, whose sister paper, the Mail on Sunday, broke the Sachsgate story. Since then Paul Dacre's papers have never missed a chance to have a pop at the BBC's controversial \u00a317m man. But they weren't only angry about those unfortunate phone messages and the size of his pay packet. Oh no. They have also taken Ross to task for ... buying a sports car, not spending enough money on his wife's birthday party, buying a marble bath tub, hosting the Baftas, taking a skiing holiday, reading comics, smoking a cigar, watching Sex and the City while he was suspended from the BBC, putting on weight, losing weight, getting locked out of his home in his pyjamas and \u2013 most controversially of all \u2013 apparently sparking a police raid on a wildlife sanctuary after making a joke about a dormouse. It's a wonder he survived as long as he did. \u2712Monkey's quote of the day: \"The more I read about him, the more I like him.\" Trevor Nelson, Blackpool, commenting on the Daily Mail website. \u2712Things you may not have known about Ross (1): He once co-owned a comic shop in London with fellow BBC Radio 2 DJ Paul Gambaccini. The same Gambaccini, you may remember, who later said Ross's \"exorbitant\" contract had made him an \"icon of greed in this country\". Ross said Gambo was an even bigger comic fan than him. \"He knows much more about DC [Comics], I think he might also know more about Marvel.\" Rumours that Ross is to star in his own comic \u2013 The Further Adventures of Megabucks Man \u2013 are wide of the mark. \u2712Those Friday Night with Jonathan Ross highlights in full. To David Cameron: \"Did you think of her as a woman? Do you think she might be pin-up material? You didn't want to see her in stockings? Did you or did you not have a wank thinking 'Margaret Thatcher'?\" To Nicole Kidman: \"I'll be talking ... to Nicole about a Jacuzzi after the show. It's all booked under the name Smith ... See, she wants me already? She's gagging for it ... She sounds a bit of a hard bitch your mother?\" To Gwyneth Paltrow: \"If you want to have sex I will phone my wife. If she gave permission I would fuck you because you asked so nicely. Clearly you are gagging for it ... Did you enjoy getting back into movies full time?\" \u2712Reassuringly for Ross fans, he has promised not to give up Twitter. He may not have as many followers as Stephen Fry \u2013 483,432 at the last count \u2013 but is a much more enthusiastic tweeter, posting nearly 10,000 updates compared with Fry's measly 5,308. It is thanks to Twitter that we know that one of Ross's new year resolutions \u2013 to stop scowling at paparazzi \u2013 lasted precisely four days. \"Dagnabbit. Just accidentally broke New Year's resolutions. Paparazzi parked outside neighbour's house. I went out neighbourhood-watch style ...\" Better luck next year, JR. \u2712Things you may not have known about Ross (2): His first appearance on BBC television was as an extra in the sitcom It Ain't Half Hot Mum, in 1981, according to the Internet Movie Database. Word has it he played a soldier. He was also the voice of the Ugly Stepsister in the UK version of Shrek 2. \u2712Ross's music choices have occasionally left something to be desired. After being awarded the OBE in 2005, he opened his Radio 2 show with the Sex Pistols' God Save The Queen. Boom boom! And when the BBC broadcast the first of two on-air apologies in the wake of Sachsgate, which it was required to do by Ofcom, Ross began his show with Fun Boy Three's The Lunatics Are Taking Over The Asylum. It led to a whole new round of complaints that Ross and the BBC weren't taking the apology seriously enough. It was, insisted the corporation. Honest. \u2712Things you may not have known about Ross (3): Despite his enormous salary, he has never been able to get a decent haircut. And what they said about Ross on Twitter. Chris Evans: \"Sad to hear about @wossy Inevitable in many ways but he'll be back\"; Chris Moyles: \"@wossy Hey. Sending wishes and kisses. PS Can I have your parking space please?\"",
