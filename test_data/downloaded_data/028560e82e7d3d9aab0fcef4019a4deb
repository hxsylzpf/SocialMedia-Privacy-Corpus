  "content": "It's a little unclear whether Joseph Stalin actually said, \"the death of one man is a tragedy; the death of millions is a statistic\", but it seems about right. The number of lives the Soviet dictator ended is so large that it is mind-boggling. And it seems \"mind-boggling\" is a literal description of what happens when we encounter large numbers. It seems humans don't really know how to process figures which they can't personally relate to, and this has surprising consequences. In 1992 a study entitled Measuring Nonuse Damages Using Contingent Valuation: An Experimental Evaluation of Accuracy explored how we assign value to things that don't have a market price (like the environment, or life itself). This field of study, called contingent valuation, means asking people to put a price on, say, a view. Or non-oil-covered seabirds. That's exactly what this study did. Researchers asked people how much they would pay to save 2,000, 20,000, or 200,000 seabirds that were covered in oil, to test how the scale of a disaster affected the perceived cost of fixing it. What they found was that the scale didn't really affect the number at all. For 2,000 seabirds the average value assigned was $80. For 20,000, $78, and for 200,000, $88. This phenomenon is extension neglect. It seems that we don't cope well with escalating numbers: so much like with oil-covered seabirds, the loss of a million lives is a statistical reality, not a personal one. The implications of this are huge. Behavioural economics has demonstrated that we navigate most of life through heuristic shortcuts, best guesses and instinct. But if one of those heuristics is blindness to scale, it's a bigger issue than just not being able to process. It implies that bigger numbers are inherently dehumanising. We become detached from the people, or birds, or wild habitats behind them. Given that nearly every corporation and government that touches our lives is in thrall to the big data juggernaut, that's something we should pause and think about. A starker version of the seabird experiment was carried out by two academics, Loran Nordgren and Mary-Hunter Morris McDonnell. They applied this form of extension neglect to human interactions. In their paper, The Scope-Severity Paradox: Why Doing More Harm is Judged to be Less Harmful , Nordgren and Morris McDonnell describe two experiments: In the first, two groups of people are told that a financial advisor has defrauded some clients and they are asked to set a punishment of between one and 10 years in prison. The first group is told there are three victims and the second group is told there are 30 victims. The first group, on average, handed down a sentence of 4.8 years. The second group \u2013 the group that were told there were 10 times as many victims \u2013 handed down on average just 3.8 years. Nordgren and McDonnell's second experiment was even more revealing. They described a food company that knowingly allows a product that would make people ill to go on sale because a recall would bankrupt them. One group is told that two people become ill; the second group is told that 20 people become ill. Again, the punishment dealt out by the group where there were two victims (5.8 years) exceeded that from the group with 20 victims (4.2 years). They also introduced a third group \u2013 this group was also told 20 people became ill but was shown a picture of one of the victims, a 22-year-old student called Sara. This group handed down an average sentence of 5.8 years. Nordgren and McDonnell could not find a way to make the punishment for causing greater harm more severe than for less harm. This was as close as they got. The impact of \"Sara\" demonstrates how the face of an individual can help counteract our blindness to the numbers. Charities are pretty good at utilising this: they've learned that to drive disaster relief or regular donations, an image of a single victim is more powerful than any number of facts, figures and statistics. But focusing on individual people has fallen out of fashion. Empathy is seen as kind of hokey, a throwback to a time when grand pronouncements or broad themes could be made without the pesky interference of facts. We mistrust those who make an appeal to feelings rather than facts. And so much of our world, and nearly all of our digital world, is developed using data points and numbers. The consequences of this gap are far-reaching, in smaller and more pervasive ways than Stalin's quote or the seabird study demonstrate. As our interactions with the world become more digital, from the way we access government services to how we manage our money \u2013 even how we stay in touch with our friends \u2013 this oversight gains significance. When you start to look for it, you see these gaps everywhere. Whether it's the governments' unauthorised spying, smart TVs eavesdropping on users to improve voice commands, Facebook broadcasting whatever people are doing to their friends without their knowledge, or Uber's endless PR gaffes as it plays with our data, our inability to connect large datasets with real people is rampant. Big numbers dehumanise us, and the bigger the numbers, the worse the effect. Dan Hon, content director at Code for America writes regularly about this \"empathy gap\", which he describes as the \"distance between an organisation and its audience such that, at worst, it's clear that the organisation is wilfully ignoring how its audience might feel\". The use of the word \"feel\" is important here, because feelings are very difficult to measure. Organisations (Uber is a perennial example) can be amazing at understanding what their audiences want, but totally blind to how they might feel. Feelings don't really create a lot of data points. The social, economic, and even humanitarian impact of the data we produce and use is enormous, even if it's not quantifiable. Perhaps it's time we acknowledge the value of empathy, whether we can measure it or not. Martin Harrison is planning director at marketing agency Huge",
