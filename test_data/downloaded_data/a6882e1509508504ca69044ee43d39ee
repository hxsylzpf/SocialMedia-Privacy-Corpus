  "content": "Hollywood actress Kate Hudson is threatening to sue publications including the Daily Mail, Heat and Closer magazines over \"seriously false and misleading\" stories alleging she suffered from an eating disorder so grave she was \"wasting away\". Hudson - the daughter of movie legend Goldie Hawn and star of films including Almost Famous - has instructed London solicitors Schillings to take legal action against five publications, including the National Enquirer and Star magazine, over photographs and accompanying stories that ran in September and October. According to a statement from Schillings, the pictures were used to illustrate articles \"which suggested she had an eating disorder that was so grave and serious that she was wasting away to the extreme concern of her mother and family\" and insinuated that Hudson's potential movie and commercial deals were affected. The actress wants the publications to print prominent apologies and for a statement to be read out in court asserting the articles were incorrect. If her demands are not met within seven days she has instructed Schillings to sue. If the issue goes to trial in front of a jury next year Hudson will argue that \"the images in question gave a seriously false and misleading impression as to her true physical condition, in that she was portrayed as being dangerously thin with an eating disorder\", according to a statement released by Schillings. The portrayal was \"contrary to the true position of her weight and diet being of a healthy nature, both at the time of the images being taken and at present\", said the statement. A key part of Hudson's case will consist of how the offending photographs were taken, sold and published. A spokeswoman for Emap, the publisher of Heat and Closer magazine, said: \"We are in receipt of a letter which we got on Saturday afternoon. It was sent to our lawyers on Sunday where it sits at the moment. We are doing due diligence on it, in terms of gathering information at this end, and will respond in due course.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
