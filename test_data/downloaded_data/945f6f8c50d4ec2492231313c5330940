  "content": "\u2022 Still plenty to chew over from yesterday's news that New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo was suing Intel over allegations that it bullied, bribed and coerced partner companies to keep AMD out of the chip market. Cuomo has aggressively pursued a number of high-profile cases in the past, but Intel's still appealing the \u20ac1bn fine levied against it by European regulators amid similar accusations. \u2022 Google might be one of Rupert Murdoch's favourite scapegoats at the moment - but the shoe could have switched to the other foot. Remember MySpace's exclusive deal that saw Google pay up to $900m for the right to provide search services on the site? Turns out that the social network is struggling to hit its targets and the resulting income could fall short by as much as $100m this year, as Murdoch confirmed from our colleagues at PaidContent. \u2022 Thursday, as always, marks the latest outing for the printed version of Technology Guardian - featuring the first in a security series - this time looking at the state of malware, my interview with the man behind 8-bit revolutionaries PlayPower and a look at whether forests in the desert could be the answer to climate change. Much more besides, as always, with your \u00a31 Guardian or online here. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
