Following controversy over coverage of the death of the lawyer Katherine Ward, who was pictured by some newspapers jumping from a hotel window in Kensington, west London, in January, groups led by the Samaritans have lobbied for the introduction of a specific provision covering suicide. After consulting international research highlighting the dangers of imitative deaths after reports of suicide, the editors' code of practice committee, the arm of the self-regulatory body charged with composing and revising the code, has written a new clause into the provisions covering intrusion into grief or shock. Les Hinton, chairman of the publisher of the Sun and the Times and also chair of the committee, said the new rules codified practices already followed by many editors. \"We have attempted to minimise that risk [of copycat suicides] - while maintaining the public's right to know - by emphasising the need for care to avoid excessive detail, unless it is in the wider public interest to give that information.\" Complaints by friends of Ms Ward over photographs in the Sun, the Times and the London Evening Standard were dismissed at the time because the PCC ruled that her suicide had been sensitively handled. However, a mention by one complainant of the possibility that the pictures could encourage copycat suicides, along with other cases around the the world, led the code of practice committee to consider introducing the new clause. Samaritans chief executive David King, who compiled a detailed submission, collating evidence from around the world on copycat suicides and detailing other concerns about what it saw as over-sensational and graphic reporting, said the move was \"a great step forward\".",
