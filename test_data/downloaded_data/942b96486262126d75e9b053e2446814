  "content": "American Airlines has taken to Facebook to \"provide the actual facts\" after Alec Baldwin complained on Twitter that he was booted off a flight for playing Words With Friends on his phone as the plane was about to depart. Without naming Baldwin, American Airlines said on its Facebook page that \"an extremely vocal customer\" declined to turn off his phone when asked to do so by a flight attendant. The airline said the customer stood up and took his phone into the lavatory, slamming the door so loud the pilots heard it. It also described the customer \u2013 obviously Baldwin \u2013 as being \"extremely rude\" and using \"offensive language\". AA's Facebook statement, which was posted on Wednesday morning, read: \"This passenger declined to turn off his cell phone when asked to do so at the appropriate time. The passenger ultimately stood up (with the seat belt light still on for departure) and took his phone into the plane's lavatory. He slammed the lavatory door so hard, the cockpit crew heard it and became alarmed, even with the cockpit door closed and locked. \"[The cockpit crew] immediately contacted the cabin crew to check on the situation. The passenger was extremely rude to the crew, calling them inappropriate names and using offensive language.\" Baldwin boarded another American Airlines plane after Tuesday's incident, but said he wouldn't fly with the airline again.",
