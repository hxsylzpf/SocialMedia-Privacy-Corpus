Lord Goldsmith brushed aside criticism of his intervention in high-profile cases before they go to trial, saying he would not hesitate to continue to issuing warnings to the media and intends to stamp out trial by the media. He also denied suggestions he is acting as a government stooge in his capacity as minister, instead of taking a neutral role as attorney general. \"I have been acting to protect the administration of justice, not to protect individuals. \"I have been acting not as an arbiter of taste and decency, or as a government minister trying to achieve a particular result, but solely out of concern for the operation of justice,\" said the law chief, speaking to Jewish ex-servicemen and women yesterday. He vowed to continue to intervene in media coverage before details emerged in stories that could prejudice a criminal case. \"That will mean warning or even intervening with newspapers to say that they ought not to publish certain material facts, or the consequences will be a risk of serious substantial prejudice of a court case. \"What matters at the end of the day is to have a fair trail, in court, rather than to have a trial in any other way,\" he added. His remarks come two weeks after Lord Goldsmith phoned newspaper editors to warn them against making reports that could prejudice a potential trial. His determination to pre-empt anything that would create \"a serious risk of prejudice\" in the reporting of the \"football rape\", which dominated the front pages of the tabloids for almost two weeks, was also underlined by a letter he sent on September 30 to newspaper editors. However, his remarks have caused friction with newspapers. The Times' legal manager, Alastair Brett, said Lord Goldsmith's attempts to warn off editors was \"quite exceptional\" and reflected the government's obsession with spin. \"This takes his action well beyond what pervious attorney generals have done, putting him out on a limb and making it look as if this government cannot resist trying to manipulate the media,\" said Mr Brett in today Times. Martin Cruddace, the former legal chief of Trinity Mirror and now a partner at Schillings, the law firm that has acted for Naomi Campbell, Nicole Kidman and Sara Cox, said Lord Goldsmith appeared to be looking for an editor to prosecute in order to set an example. Earlier this month Tom Crone, the legal boss for the Sun and the News of the World, accused Lord Goldsmith of sending out a message which \"intimidates, chills and frightens the media\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857",
