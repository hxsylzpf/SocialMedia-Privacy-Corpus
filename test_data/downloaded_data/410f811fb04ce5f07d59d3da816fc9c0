  "content": "The son of the woman who spoke to the attackers in Woolwich has inadvertently spawned a Twitter meme: #MyMumisaMotherfuckingBadass. Ingrid Loyau-Kennett was one of several women who spoke to the terrorists or attended the body of the victim (another woman pushed past, apparently oblivious, with heavy shopping). Loyau-Kennett spoke to the two men moments after the attack. She told the Guardian: \"I was not scared because he was not drunk, he was not on drugs. He was normal. I could speak to him and he wanted to speak and that's what we did.\" Basil Baradaran spotted his mum's act of bravery on yesterday's evening news. He tweeted a photo of her standing face-to-face with one of the men, while a nervous crowd waits at the far end of the road: Of all the things today 'I didn't expect a suspected terror attack in my town and my mum, of all people, to talk to the attackers #Woolwich \u2013 Basil Baradaran (@SiibillamLaw) May 22, 2013 My mum is a motherfucking badass twitter.com/SiibillamLaw/s\u2026 \u2013 Basil Baradaran (@SiibillamLaw) May 22, 2013 He was soon inundated with requests from journalists. Then, early this morning, Lauren Laverne spotted his tweet and realised it had the potential to be something more: I do feel like we all might contribute to @siibillamlaw's hashtag. #MyMumisaMotherfuckingBadass \u2013 Lauren Laverne (@laurenlaverne) May 23, 2013 I'll start: She went from Penywell Estate to Greenham Common, via a short career as a casino dancer. #MyMumisaMotherfuckingBadass \u2013 Lauren Laverne (@laurenlaverne) May 23, 2013 People were quick to leap on board.
