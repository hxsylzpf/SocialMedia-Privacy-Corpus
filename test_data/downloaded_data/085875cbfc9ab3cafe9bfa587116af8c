Sir Christopher admitted the PCC was not perfect, but said \"it's the least efficient system, until you compare it to all the others\". He added that if the culture select committee today recommended a privacy law, such a measure would be \"unworkable and expensive\". Sir Christopher, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, also confirmed he had taken legal advice about complaining to the parliamentary standards commissioner about the way the select committee's investigation has been conducted. But he said he would wait to see the committee's findings and would prefer to have a constructive dialogue with the group, which is chaired by veteran Labour MP Gerald Kaufman. \"I'm not resigned to a privacy law. If the committee do recommend a privacy law, my response would be, as it has been, that it is unworkable and expensive,\" Sir Christopher said. \"People have always had the right to go to law if their privacy is invaded. It costs them a lot of money and it's extremely slow and the outcome is uncertain,\" he added. \"This does not detract from the increasingly popular service we provide, which is free, extremely fast and effective.\" Sir Christopher also complained that the privacy issue was a \"distorting mirror\", when it came to judging the overall effectiveness of the PCC. \"[Privacy complaints] account for between about 15% and 18% of the total this year. Most of them are about good old accuracy. We are able to reconcile complainants and editors in between 90% and 95% of these cases,\" he said. Sir Christopher criticised the select committee for being unwilling to listen to the PCC's arguments for continuing self-regulation. \"Trying to convince them [tougher media regulation is unnecessary] is like trying to convince the flat earth society that that world is round. [The PCC] is the least efficient system, until you compare it to all the others,\" he said. \"It's better than a privacy law or statutory controls.\" He said he had taken legal advice about the possibility of complaining to the parliamentary ombudsman about the way the select committee had conducted its inquiry. \"I've had some legal advice to that effect. It lies on my desk, but I haven't had time to read it properly, to be frank,\" Sir Christopher added. \"Let's not get ahead of the game. Let's wait for the select committee report.\" \u00b7 To give MediaGuardian a story email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857",
