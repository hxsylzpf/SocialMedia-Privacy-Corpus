  "content": "Writer and artist Vanessa Place set out to create controversy by tweeting Gone With the Wind in its entirety. Now, four years into the project, and with three chapters left to go, she has achieved notoriety \u2013 at a price. Rather than drawing attention to the book, she is facing accusations that she is herself racist. But is she, or is it just the novel? African American protest groups say she is: any repetition of the racist stereotyping in Margaret Mitchell's famous civil war romance renews their sense of injustice. But Place says that tweeting the book is an act of artistic provocation designed to expose what she considers to be Mitchell's \"profoundly racist text\" and the money still being made by the author's estate. Place began the project in 2011, tweeting it line by line, alongside an image of the \"Mammy\" character from the film. But as protest over enduring racist language and symbolism mounts, with the New York Post's film critic writing that the movie adaptation should be banned from cinemas, Place's performance is gaining traction. Meanwhile, a series of arts, academic and literary institutions have cancelled scheduled engagements with Place rather than risk getting sucked into the echo-chambers of offence, accusation or protest. Two weeks ago, the Whitney museum in New York cancelled Last Words, a panel discussion focusing on the topic \"What does it mean to speak of one's own death?\" Place was scheduled to read from a Botched Execution, a poem comprising official statements and witness accounts of the 43-minute execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma in 2014. Interlaced with bad jokes about lawyers, the piece is part of a broader death penalty project in which Place, who works as a legal-aid criminal defence lawyer for sex offenders in Los Angeles, reproduces the last statements of inmates executed in Texas since 1982. Ron Clark, visiting faculty member of the Whitney's independent study program and organiser of the talk, told the Guardian the decision to cancel was not a matter of institutional discomfort with Place's work, rather that two other scheduled speakers, New York University professor of humanities Avital Ronell and Kyoo Lee, philosopher and professor at John Jay college of criminal justice, pulled out. \"It was just not possible to proceed,\" Clark said. However, Place claims the Whitney may have chosen to cancel after receiving pressure from individuals or groups opposed to her Gone With the Wind project. She says museum officials told her it could not \"guarantee her security\" \u2013 a response, she says, that fits a recent pattern. Earlier this year, Place was dropped from the Berkeley poetry conference celebrating the 50th year of the free speech movement on campus. She was disinvited from the annual Association of Writers and Writing Programs conference after it received a petition accusing Place's project of re-inscribing the racism \"in the flesh of every descendant of slaves\" and of furthering \"her career on the backs of Black ancestors \u2013 the hands that filled the master's pockets now fill hers\". In New York last week after the readings were cancelled, Place said she had been shunned by institutions representing the literary, academic and now art worlds. \"It's a trifecta. Each are entities where discourse is supposed to freely take place yet each has failed to support it.\" Such institutions, she continued, \"only stand up for free speech in theory. They're all for it \u2013 so long as they don't get hurt or lose any money.\" Svetlana Mintcheva of the National Coalition Against Censorship says the cancellations fit a pattern of \"disturbing unpreparedness on the part of cultural institutions to manage controversy and dissenting positions \u2013 especially when the controversy comes from within the echo-chamber of the liberal left that we all reside in and is supported by active social media action, which can give the appearance of a mass action even when it is not, in fact, such.\" So was the Whitney pressured? Clark says no. The Mongrel Coalition, an anonymous pressure group which has in the past taken a position against Place's appropriation of Gone With the Wind, says it didn't protest to the Whitney. But its objections remain: \"Practitioners of conceptual poetry have, time and again, leveraged their privilege to pass lazy and instigative racial language off as 'art', intellectualising its method to protect and insulate themselves from black criticism,\" the group said in a statement. Place's project, it continues, \"is about historical, systematic anti\u00ad-black representations being replicated and valorised as art \u2013 and to repeat the refrain of Ferguson protesters \u2013 we're sick of it\". Place rejects the accusation. \"The Mitchell estate \u2013 the book, the movie rights, the sequels \u2013 continues to make millions every year. So let's look at our historical legacy. Let's not indulge the fantasy of integrity that we're just a nation of immigrants.\" Place maintains she began her Gone With the Wind project with the purpose of goading the owners of the copyright into a dispute. The Mitchell estate hasn't taken the bait, but it's certainly keeping an eye on her tweets in case she steps beyond the legal standards of commentary and fair use. \"Margaret Mitchell created an educational fund at Moorhouse College and was very much concerned with African Americans,\" says estate lawyer Rick Kurnit. \"But the book is what it is. It stands on its own as a literary work for when it was written. It's hard to see how anyone would care to read it in the form of tweets.\" Since Place began the project \u2013 she has three chapters left to tweet \u2013 its purpose has evolved, she explains. It's her position that society, partly through social media, has become inured to any genuine sense of outrage and has instead become organised around \"likes\" and \"preferences\" that are often insincere, inauthentic and used primarily to organise society into orderly, unthreatening consumer groups. \"It's not like the political correctness of the 90s,\" she says. \"It's not about what you say or think, it just matters what it looks like you might be saying or thinking.\" With her Gone With the Wind project, Place claims, \"people saw the picture, thought 'that's racist', and signed the petition. \"So you end up with a culture that can literally only react to an image, doesn't have critical capacity and doesn't care to have it.\" Her work, she says, can be deliberately cruel, insincere and inauthentic. In the past, she has performed rape jokes from the point of view of the rapist. \"It's in the spirit of punk, dada, the Situationists, the avant garde. The only question is, how far can you go?\" She expresses admiration for Hitler's favourite film-maker Leni Riefenstahl. \"I think she was one of the great artists of the 20th century because she put politics into art. But nobody wants to talk about her because of the political ramifications.\" It is these kinds of attitudes, Place believes, that have made her persona non grata in American cultural institutions. \"I see art that's sanitised, art that's precious, art that's playing safe, art for the market. People say they want transgression, that they're looking for the radical edge, but I'm not so sure. There's a certain amount of cruelty in what I do. There has to be. You have to touch nerves, otherwise it's just entertainment.\"",
