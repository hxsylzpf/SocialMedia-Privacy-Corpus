  "content": "The vice-president of Facebook in Europe \u2013 one of the online industry's most powerful executives \u2013 has revealed her frustration at being portrayed in the media as a mother-of-four who \"wanted it all\". Nicola Mendelsohn, speaking at a conference in London, said there needed to be an overhaul of the language used to talk about women and girls. \"When I got my post at Facebook it was all about how I was a mother-of-four who had 'won' the position, alongside pictures of my wedding,\" she said, noting that the male executive hired at the same time came under no such scrutiny. Reports also said she insisted on working part-time, when in fact she was working a typical five-day week. Manchester-born Mendelsohn \u2013 who did work a four-day week for 16 years as the chief executive of advertising agency Karmarama before starting at the social media company \u2013 also called for more companies to offer flexible hours. \"I was never defined by my working hours, I was defined by what I produced. That is what we need and we need to be respectful of the best way people work. I think businesses have to think about the best way to retain talent.\" She told an audience at Fortune's World Most Powerful Women summit that deep-rooted cultural barriers were preventing girls and young women moving into key positions in business and politics. \"There are cultural issues holding us back, and it goes back to a very early age\", she said, citing fellow Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg, who published Lean In, an influential handbook for ambitious women, last year. \"Like Sheryl has said \u2013 little girls are called bossy but boys never are. Girls are told they can't do maths, they can't build things, boys are never told they can't do anything.\" Mendelsohn later said a lack of visible role models was holding girls back. \"Boys are told they can be whatever they want to be, and they see role models for that,\" she said. \"If you look at the role models girls see in the world today, they are not the same. On the whole they are not big business people because there aren't enough women at the top of companies.\" Asked about the value of the conference, which gathered women from business and politics, she said: \"I think it's a necessary conference \u2013 I wish there was a day when we didn't need it, but the numbers speak for themselves. At the point when we have equality in heads of business, heads of government around the world then we won't need it, but sadly I think that's a way off.\" Ruby McGregor-Smith, a key government adviser on women in business, chief executive of Mitie Group and the first Asian female chief executive of a FTSE 100 company, told the conference that a lack of affordable childcare and inflexible working patterns in the UK was a factor stopping women contributing to the economy. \"I'm particularly passionate about tax breaks for working women,\" she said. \"It's almost impossible to get back into the workplace without affordable childcare, we've got to have it affordable in the UK if we want to keep all that talent.\" McGregor-Smith, who also chairs the Women's Business Council, said the group was \"really concerned\" about the lack of implementation of some of the recommendations made in its 2012 report on women's contribution to economic growth. \"Some of them have been put in place, but the ones we are really, really concerned about are careers advice as schools \u2013 for all kids, not just girls,\" she said. \"Governments do what governments do, and it will take time. I would love it to be quicker, but in my view it should be very much a joint effort with business.\" The summit was given a reminder of the gender gap in many boardrooms during a session on \"boardroom effectiveness\" \u2013 attended by around 40 women, only two were on the boards of public companies. On the pay gap in Britain, which increased last year for the first time in five years to 15.7%, McGregor-Smith said: \"Inequality of pay is not right at any level. I genuinely cannot comprehend businesses that would [pay] differently. I think equal pay reviews across companies should happen naturally, because I don't think any organisation sets out today to want to do that.\"",
