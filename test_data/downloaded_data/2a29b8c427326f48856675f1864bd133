  "content": "Google is now working full-force to counteract the privacy backlash that has followed the release of Buzz. Over the weekend the company made even more tweaks to the social networking service. Google says it has turned off an \"auto-follow\" feature, so that users will now have to manually approve the people whose updates they follow. Previously, Google automatically assigned followers based in part on the people who Buzz users contacted the most through Gmail. That elicited fierce criticism from privacy advocates because private information was made public on users' Google profiles by default. The company now says \"We've heard your feedback loud and clear\" and \"We're very sorry for the concern we've caused.\" Google says \"millions\" are already using Buzz; it remains to be seen whether the changes will be enough to convince users that the service takes their privacy into account. Google's Buzz has come under attack for exposing information about users' Gmail contacts on the web. But while the company is taking steps to fix privacy loopholes, it is not going to separate Gmail from Buzz. A Google spokeswoman tells us, however, that the company may offer a standalone version of Buzz, in addition to the one built into Gmail. Alley Insider first reported earlier this week \"a huge privacy flaw\" which meant that by using Buzz, users often had a list of the people they emailed the most often on Gmail show up online; TechCrunch has also reported that private email addresses can be exposed via the service. In response, Google has made some changes, including making an existing option not to have the list of frequent email contacts made public. Despite the controversy, Google has said that more than 9m posts were made on the service during its first two days. That's in large part because it's so tightly linked to Gmail, which claims more than 100 million unique users \u2013 once again reinforcing why Google wouldn't want to separate the two.
