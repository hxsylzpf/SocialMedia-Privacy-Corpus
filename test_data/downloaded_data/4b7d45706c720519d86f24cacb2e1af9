  "content": "From Rupert Murdoch's longstanding lieutenant Peter Chernin to Saudi prince Alwaleed Bin Talal and the secretive Hollywood investor Suhail Rizvi, Twitter's early backers form a colourful cast of characters. Not surprisingly, many of the Silicon Valley insiders who made fortunes from Facebook were also early investors in Twitter, and stand to gain again when the microblogging site goes public. Twitter's stock was valued by the company at $26 a share before pre-IPO, and then opened with a huge pop at $45.10. Like all stocks, that will fluctuate wildly, but what's clear is that Twitter's biggest shareholders are suddenly very rich. Taking the opening price on the day of the IPO, how rich exactly? Suhail Rizvi and Rizvi Traverse Management, $3.84bn 85,171,093 shares Rizvi is the intensely private founder of New York private equity firm Rizvi Traverse, and is said to employ a person to remove information from Wikipedia and delete photographs of him from the internet. The son of a psychology professor, he moved to Iowa from India when he was five. While recent investments have been focused on technology \u2013 Facebook before it went public, Square and Flipboard \u2013 Rizvi was first attracted to Hollywood. He helped Hugh Hefner take Playboy Enterprises private, and bought and sold the studio behind the Twilight series. He also led the buyout of ICM, the talent agency whose clients include Robert Redford and Mel Gibson. Along with former Google executive Chris Sacca, he has attracted many of Twitter's high-profile investors, with Sacca unearthing shareholders wanting to cash out and Rizvi finding the buyers. Most notable among them are Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the long-time News Corp backer, who was brought into Twitter by Rizvi in 2012. Evan Williams, Twitter founder and director, $2.57bn 56,909,847 shares Twitter's first backer had a series of startups behind him before taking an interest in the microblogging platform. He founded and sold the Blogger text-based blogging service to Google in 2003, and used the cash to found the podcasting company Odeo, where Twitter's founders met. He was Twitter's chairman until replacing Jack Dorsey as chief executive in 2007, and later ceded that role to Dick Costolo. He still exerts a major influence on the board. The prospectus revealed he has an agreement with Dorsey to vote his shares, which expires when the company goes public in November. Spark Capital, $1.46bn 32,414,224 shares The venture capital company, founded in 2005 and now with $1.5bn under management, led Twitter's second round of investment and originally owned around 15% before selling down. Its portfolio also includes Tumblr, Foursquare and AdMeld. Peter Fenton, Twitter director, and Benchmark Capital, $1.42bn 31,568,740 shares Fenton is a general manager at venture capital firm Benchmark Capital Partners, which invested during Twitter's series C funding round. Fenton's family trust owns 1,688 shares and the rest of the holding is held via Benchmark. Union Square Ventures and affiliates, $1.26bn 27,838,992 shares The New York venture capital fund which led Twitter's first round of investment. Has also backed Foursquare, craft retailer Etsy, social messaging site Kik and the taxi app Hailo. DST Global and affiliates, $1.07bn 23,744,745 shares The Russian investment fund run by Yuri Milner made fortunes by taking early stakes in Facebook, Groupon and Zynga. DST reportedly took a $400m stake in Twitter in 2011 in a funding round which valued the company at $8bn. Jack Dorsey, Twitter founder and executive chairman, $1.06bn 23,411,350 shares By the age of 13 Dorsey was obsessed with dispatch logistics \u2013 the art of sending deliverymen or taxi drivers to multiple locations. Some of the programs he invented are still used by drivers today. He claims to have come up with the idea for Twitter while at New York University, and built the prototype with Biz Stone in two weeks while working at the podcasting firm Odeo. In 2009 he founded mobile payments application Square, with the ambition of replacing traditional cash and card tills. Jim Payne, MoPub chief executive, and other MoPub stockholders, $667m 14,791,464 shares The mobile advertising exchange was bought by Twitter in September in an all-shares deal. Dick Costolo, Twitter chief executive, $369m 7,589,608 shares plus 582,660 unvested stock options Costolo's first career, after graduating in computer science from the University of Michigan, was not as a programmer in Silicon Valley but as an improvisational comedian in Chicago. He worked at Andersen Consulting for eight years, and went on to found and sell a series of companies, one of which, FeedBurner, was sold to Google. He joined Twitter as chief operating officer in 2009, and stepped into the top job on a temporary basis when Evan Williams took paternity leave. The job became permanent in October 2010 when Williams decided not to return to a full-time role. He was paid $11.5m by Twitter last year in stock and cash. As of August this year, his $200,000 a year salary has been reduced to $14,000. Adam Bain, Twitter president of global revenue, $81m 1,785,818 shares Bain joined Twitter in 2010, having previously been in charge of generating advertising revenues for MySpace, IGN and other News Corporation digital properties. He earned $6.7m from Twitter last year, including a $200,000 salary. Mike Gupta, Twitter chief financial officer, $61m 1,350,000 shares Gupta became the chief financial officer of Twitter in December 2012, having previously worked at Zynga, the social gaming company, from May 2011. Gupta oversaw Zynga's December 2011 IPO, which failed to achieve sufficient \"pop\" to wow Wall Street. Christopher Fry, Twitter head of engineering, $51m 1,125,000 unvested stock options Fry joined in April 2012, and was previously senior vice-president of development at customer database software group Salesforce.com. He holds patents in distributed computing and was appointed a director of online payment platform Braintree (whose customers include Angry Birds and lettings site Airbnb) at the end of March, just before its $800m acquisition by eBay. Ali Rowghani, Twitter chief operating officer, $45m 990,354 shares Rowanghani was Twitter's CFO before Gupta, and is said to be \"the man who saved Twitter\", turning it from a heady startup into a smooth company ready to go public. Vijaya Gadde, Twitter head of legal, $41m 900,000 shares Gadde joined Twitter in 2011, and was promoted to the role of general counsel, the head of the company's legal department, in August 2013 after the departure of Alex Macgillivray. Her appointment marked a change in focus for the company: Gadde's specialism is in corporate and securities law, whereas MacGillivray had a focus on intellectual property. Peter Currie, Twitter director, $14m 300,000 shares The former Morgan Stanley banker once ran a mobile phone group bought by AT&amp;T and was finance head at Netscape Communications before it was listed and then sold to AOL. David Rosenblatt, Twitter director, $13m 291,666 shares Formerly chief executive of digital marketing group DoubleClick, which was bought by Google for $3.2bn in 2007, Rosenblatt was president of global display advertising at Google until 2009.

Unknown number of shares which have yet to vest A longstanding lieutenant of Rupert Murdoch's, Chernin worked as president and chief operating officer of News Corporation from 1996 to 2009. Despite the rightwing political leanings of his former boss, Chernin is a Democratic party donor and helped raise funds for Barack Obama. He now runs the Chernin Group, which invests in and operates media and technology businesses. His other directorships include American Express and the Pandora radio service. Chernin acquired another 200,000 shares \u2013 $9m \u2013 the day before the IPO. Biz Stone, Twitter founder, $? Twitter's co-founder and former creative director is not listed in the IPO prospectus and may already have sold his entire stake. Noah Glass, Twitter founder, $? The software developer known as Twitter's forgotten founder, Glass co-founded podcasting company Odeo with Evan Williams. Glass is not mentioned in the filing although he is reported to have reached a settlement with Twitter some months ago that gave him some cash.",
