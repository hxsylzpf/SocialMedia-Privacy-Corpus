The Bombay Bicycle Club drew the ire of patrons on Monday when a sign was placed by its front entrance venting frustration at penalty rates that the restaurant said entitled staff to almost three times their base rate on public holidays. The sign said the bar would have to pay its staff \"2.75 times the base rate for public holidays\". It multiplied by 2.75 the price of each item on the menu (including lobster sliders for $127.24 and a squid platter for $135) to show the effect of applying the same formula. The acting branch secretary for the South Australian branch of the United Voices union, David Gray, said the figure of 2.75 was not in the award that currently applied in the state. A new award that comes into force next year would increase casual workers' penalty rates for public holidays, but decrease casual loadings for regular days, he said. \"This means that Monday to Friday from January 2015, a casual employee's wage rate will decrease,\" he said in a statement. \"Can we expect the meal prices of the Bombay Bicycle Club to decrease on these days?\" Patrons of the colonial Indian-themed restaurant and bar took to the business's Facebook page to post negative reviews, claiming the sign disrespected workers. The business, which has recently undergone a multi-million dollar redevelopment, responded by posting a photo of the notice along with a long statement outlining its position. \"There has been no disrespect shown to our workers, only to the idiots who believe that rates of 2.75 times [over $50 an hour] are justified and are sustainable by any business,\" the post said. \"We have no respect for those that are never happy and always want more. Fortunately our respected and valued employees are not in this group.\" The message compared paying public holiday penalty rates to customers paying $50 for a movie ticket or $84 to go to the football. \"Our employees work here because they want to, not because they have to,\" the message said. The statement called its critics \"idiots\" and ended by saying, \"don't come back\". It is unclear who was responsible for the post and the business declined to comment. Many Facebook users expressed their disapproval. \"Well I won't be going to a business that complains about paying workers a fair wage,\" wrote user Jesse Nixon. As the reaction grew, the post was removed and a statement issued that read: \"\"Again, WOW. The sign has been removed. Have read all your comments. I will keep my opinions to myself in future.\" This only drew further criticism from users, and shortly after a third message appeared that read: \"The BBC ownership would like to apologise for our sign and Facebook post. We regret the wording. There was no intention to offend anyone.\" But by then users had copied the original post and photo across to other social media platforms. \"Judging by the comments on the other threads, the damage has been done. This apology is too little, too late,\" Facebook user Amy Marie Churchman wrote. \"I was pretty stunned by the venom in the response [from the restaurant],\" Gray told Guardian Australia. \"Besides not being funny, it was also completely false. \"It's pretty clear that the public supports extra rates on holidays.\" The Australian Hotels Association did not respond to a request for comment.",
