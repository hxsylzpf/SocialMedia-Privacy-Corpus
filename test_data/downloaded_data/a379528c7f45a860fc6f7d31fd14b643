  "content": "Hell hath no fury, it seems, like Justin Bieber fans and their parents on a school night. After showing up on stage at London's O2 arena nearly two hours after he was billed to appear on Monday night, the Canadian singer could be in line for a fine for breaking a noise curfew. But while such a fine would be small change for the star, the reaction from parents and fans to his late arrival was scathing, ranging from booing inside the venu, where doors had opened at 6.30pm, to a deluge of criticism on Twitter. \"Daughter and Nieces at O2 to see Justin Bieber \u2013 Still not on stage at 10.20 on a school night \u2013 That's just taking the piss!\" tweeted one apparently unhappy father. Wendi Peters, the former Coronation Street actor, also joined in, tweeting that Bieber had finally come on stage at the \"ridiculous time\" of 10.24 \u2013 nearly two hours after his advertised time of 8.30. \"I shall have an extremely moody daughter tomorrow .. Livid !!\" she added. Other Twitter users turned their fire on Bieber's own Twitter account, which has more than 35m followers. One warned him: \"@Justinbieber you underestimate the power of a room full of pissed off English women #wewantbieber #justinbieberattheo2\" Prices for tickets for the sold-out concerts started at \u00a357.65. The venue's own account eventually tweeted: \"Justin Bieber is now on stage and apologises for the lateness of his show.\"",
