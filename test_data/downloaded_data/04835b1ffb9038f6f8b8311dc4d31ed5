There was a lot of Ripper talk on Tuesday when MPs debated May's latest version of the snooper's charter. The case casts a shadow over her career too. Whoops! No. Correction. The menacing \"Ripper\" they kept mentioning was Labour's half-baked Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (\"often incomprehensible\", recalled Tory Euro-martyr Dominic Grieve), known in Whitehall as \"Ripa.\" And \"snooper's charter\"? Labour's Andy Burnham doesn't care for that label either. Lazy thinking, he said, and mean to hardworking spooks. The shadow home secretary and serial leadership candidate has sat on the fence over the investigatory powers (son of Ripa) bill for so long he's got rusty buttocks. Burnham is so determined to be fair to all sides \u2013 collective security and personal privacy are both important \u2013 that he kept saying he would \"not play politics with it\". Fat chance of that. Jeremy may fear the 250-page bill will be unfair to Mr Putin and President Assad, but he was locked in the coal shed on Tuesday without his mobile so that Labour moderates could cover their flank by decisively abstaining. They needn't have worried. The SNP and Nick Clegg also declared for abstention and demanded the bill's improvement, though Clegg said he is against a dragnet bill in principle. Only Russia has a similar one. On bulk data interception \u2013 Edward Snowden's scoop \u2013 the US is moving in the opposite direction. May herself was on good form as she cruises past Henry Matthews (1886-92). After \"unprecedented\" reviews and reports, she has made enough concessions to her critics to rebadge the snooper's charter as the Snowden Memorial Act, at least in the well-honed text she read very fast. It's just updating the tech and polishing the transparency, she said. The bad guys \"are exploiting the technological benefits of the modern age for their own twisted aims\", May warned MPs. But enough about Google and Amazon. The home secretary's targets included paedophiles, bank robbers and their fake alibis as well as terrorists. She came armed with reassuring phrases like \"double lock\" and \"judicial commissioner\", sprinkled with ISPs and ICRs which are \"internet connection records\". May says ICRs are like itemised phone bills; critics called them a detailed itinerary of all our online travels. The odd thing was that, apart from the teenage Tory toadies, grownup MPs supporting the bill's second reading \u2013 like Grieve and Ken Clarke \u2013 or abstaining (Burnham) were only slightly less sniffy about the all-crucial details (or lack of them) than troublemakers, David Davis or the SNP's Joanna Cherry. In addition to tripping up Grieve when he tried trashing the lawyers' letter to the Guardian (bonus point), Cherry accused ministers of cherry-picking. MPs were especially bothered about a solitary tech-clueless judge riding shotgun over the 2,500 intercept warrants a year May has to agree, some of them MPs' own communications. Ten warrants a day? Not much time, eh? I take as long as I need to reach the right decision, May loftily replied. Son of Ripa must get through both stroppy houses by Christmas so May hasn't finished making concessions. At one point an MP said: \"I hope the home secretary got my letter today.\" Clearly not. Old-school types at GCHQ are still steaming it open.",
