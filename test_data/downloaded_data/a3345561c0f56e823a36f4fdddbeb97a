But instead the newspaper, which was ordered to pay \u00a33,500 after publishing details about Ms Campbell's therapy at Narcotics Anonymous, emphasised that her decision to seek treatment should be emulated by others with similar problems. Desmond Browne QC was opening the appeal for the Daily Mirror against a high court judge's ruling in favour of Ms Campbell involving breach of confidentiality. The newspaper is contesting the damages award and the decision that it must pay Ms Campbell's legal costs. Mr Justice Morland ruled in March that Ms Campbell's confidentiality was breached when the paper went into details of the treatment. But he also described the model as \"lacking in frankness and veracity with the media\" and \"manipulative and selective in what she has chosen to reveal about herself\". The Streatham-born model had claimed that she felt \"shocked, angry, betrayed and violated\" by the February 2001 report, which included a photograph of her leaving the NA meeting in King's Road, Chelsea. Today Mr Browne told the Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips, and Lords Justice Chadwick and Keene that the appeal raised important questions about the laws relating to confidentiality. He said it should be up to the claimant to justify that any restriction on freedom of expression was strictly necessary, adding that personal information published about Ms Campbell had been \"trivial and anodyne\". The model was a drug addict who had previously denied in public that she was using narcotics and the newspaper had found out that this was dishonest, he said. Mr Browne said Ms Campbell was by her own account a role model to other young black women and Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, had ruled in a different case that public figures had to expect to be more closely scrutinised by the media than others. \"The newspaper treatment of the story was sympathetic,\" he said. Instead of branding her a hypocrite, it \"praised her for seeking treatment\". \"As far back as 1997, Ms Campbell made a practice of abusing illegal drugs. She accepted that this had caused her medical problems and affected her behaviour, which she accepted was notorious,\" said Mr Browne. \"Over the same period since 1997 she had painted a reputation for herself in a number of media interviews - which the learned trial judge found was a positive false case - that, unlike many models, she had managed to avoid the use of drugs,\" he added. Mr Browne said she had continued to \"maintain the lie\" at the original trial until she was exposed by the judge.",
