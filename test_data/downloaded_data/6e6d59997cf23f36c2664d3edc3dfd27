  "content": "Rupert Murdoch has apologised on Twitter after criticising the \"Jewish-owned press\" for their coverage of Israel. The News Corp chairman and chief executive said he had been \"sternly criticised\" for the post and offered his unreserved apologies. \"Why Is Jewish owned press so consistently anti- Israel in every crisis?\" tweeted Murdoch on 18 November, having earlier criticised Fox News rival CNN and the Associated Press for being biased \"to the point of embarrassment\". On Sunday, he returned to the topic. \"'Jewish owned press' have been sternly criticised, suggesting link to Jewish reporters. Don't see this, but apologise unreservedly.\" Possibly, possibly not, the most humble tweet of his life.",
