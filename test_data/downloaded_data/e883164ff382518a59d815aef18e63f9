  "content": "US senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a vocal privacy advocate, threatened to filibuster any attempt by his colleagues to legislate that US technology companies be able to break their own encryption. Speaking at RightsCon, a privacy-focused technology conference in San Francisco put on by AccessNow, Wyden warned the audience that he would \"use my power as a United States senator\" to block any bill \"that would threaten to weaken strong encryption\". Senators can block or delay legislation indefinitely through a filibuster unless 60 of their colleagues vote to overrule them. In an interview with the Guardian, Wyden elaborated that he was referring to a long-simmering effort by two of his Senate intelligence committee colleagues, Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, and Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, to craft legislation that would regulate what data tech firms must be able to provide to investigators, even if it is encrypted. The two senators, who are cosier with US three-letter agencies, have said since winter that they are close to releasing the bill and are waiting for feedback from the White House. In the interview, Wyden said he still had not seen any bill text. The senator is perhaps most famous for his question during a 2013 intelligence committee hearing with James Clapper, America's top spy. Wyden asked Clapper if US intelligence agencies collected data on millions of Americans. Clapper replied, \"No, sir. Not wittingly,\" which wasn't true. He also played a key role in batting down internet copyright legislation \u2013 known as Sopa and Pipa \u2013 with the help of technology companies in 2012. Wyden said he hoped to lead a similar charge with encryption, though he acknowledged that the tech community still had work to do with educating consumers on the topic. When Apple began to fight a February court order to help the US government weaken the security settings on the iPhone of Syed Farook, the San Bernardino gunman, Wyden said that consumers were asking: \"Are these for the privacy rights of the dead terrorist?\" \"I'm not setting up a dead terrorist caucus,\" he added. \"This is about more security versus less security.\"",
