With just a few clicks of the mouse, \"Where Does My Money Go?\" allows you to see data about major spending areas such as defence, education, health and social protection. Clicking on an individual buget area allows you to break down the data even further. For instance, click on the purple \"General public services\" bubble, and you'll see out of \u00a350bn in spending, \u00a331bn goes to pay for public debt transactions. You can see total spending across the UK, breakdowns for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireleand and even spending by region. A slider allows you to see the growth of spending beginning from 2003 until the present with a bubble graph. If bubbles aren't your style, the same data is available in line graphs. You can also see long-term spending trends back to 1987. The data can be shown in actual terms, inflation-adjusted pounds and also as a percentage of GDP. This is a great dashboard to quickly see trends in spending, not only in terms of the total budget but also in terms of individual areas. The Open Knowledge Foundation built the site with visual data anlysis firm iconomical. Jonathan Gray, of the Open Knowledge Foundation, said that they plan to release the project under an open-source licence. The data is from the Treasury, but they processed the data for consistency and clarity. They have released this cleaned up data as a spreadsheet, hosted on Google Docs. They have detailed what data they have used and how they have used it. Gray says that Where Does My Money Go? aims to be more than a website. It is a structure to make the data more easily understandable. \"It is a layer of visualisation on top of an eco-system of data,\" he said. The British and US governments as well as governments across Europe release a lot of data, but without the time to sift through all of this information, it can often be of little use to most people. \"The crucial thing is taking the step from transparency to accessibility,\" Gray said. Creating this visualisation helps people make sense of all of the figures, he said, adding that it means that government moves from \"being transparent in principle to accessible in practice\". The Open Knowledge Foundation also is working with government transparency and openness advocates in the US and across Europe to share expertise and make the case for open data in terms of its benefits to society. In the UK, the next steps are to add more information, increasing the detail especially at the local level, which should be easier with the new Smarter Government initiative, Gray said. ",
