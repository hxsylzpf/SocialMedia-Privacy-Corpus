The announcement that Sir Muir Russell will investigate allegations of wrongdoing on the behalf of the CRU came as Saudi Arabia's lead climate negotiator said the emails would have a \"huge impact\" on UN climate talks starting in Copenhagen next week. Announcing Russell's appointment, the university said the inquiry would look at four key allegations including examining whether the leaked exchanges between climate scientists demonstrated any manipulation or suppression of data. The review will also look at the CRU's approach to assembling and presenting research findings, assess whether the department complied with freedom of information requests and investigate the security of data held by the university. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research at LSE and one of the prominent voices who called for a review, welcomed the news. \"This appears to be a very good appointment and the terms of reference look right. One concern is that the results may not be published until the spring. This is probably necessary to allow a thorough investigation, but it does mean that those who are using 'climategate' as a propaganda tool for their own political ends might be able to enjoy many more weeks of mischief-making,\" Ward said. The University of East Anglia's vice-chancellor, Professor Edward Acton, said: \"The reputation and integrity of UEA is of the upmost importance to us all. We want these allegations about CRU to be examined fully and independently. That is why I am delighted that Sir Muir has agreed to lead the independent review and he will have my and the rest of the university's full support.\" Russell is a science graduate with a long history in the civil service, including roles in the home affairs secretariat of the Cabinet Office and the Scottish Executive. He is not a climate scientist and has no previous association with UEA. However, Ward warned that the review, which is to begin soon, was unlikely to silence campaigning by climate sceptics. \"The big question is whether so-called 'sceptics' will complain because the investigation will not be headed by one of their own, and whether they will suspend their campaigns of disinformation about this affair until the investigation is completed,\" he said. Separately today, Saudi Arabia's lead climate negotiator Mohammed al-Sabban told the BBC that the leaked emails would have a \"huge impact\" on the Copenhagen summit starting on Monday. He said the emails cast doubt upon man's influence on global warming and could deter countries from offering emissions cuts at the conference. Saudi Arabia, on of the world's biggest oil producers, has long taken a sceptical view of climate change. On Tuesday, the head of the CRU, Phil Jones, said he would be standing down while an inquiry was carried out. \"After a good deal of consideration I have decided that the best way to achieve this is by stepping aside from the director's role during the course of the independent review and am grateful to the university for agreeing to this. The review process will have my full support,\" Jones said. The emails were obtained by hacking a server at the university and critics claim they show evidence of collusion between climate scientists. A police investigation is also under way into the source of the theft.",
