  "content": "During the Boston Marathon bombings, social networks played a key role contributing to the unfolding live coverage. They broke the news. They also broke Austin Allred's website. Allred and his buddy Garret Thornburg had built GrassWire - a social media aggregator that pulled breaking news content from Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and more, and put it all in one place. After the bombings, GrassWire's traffic started growing - 6,000 one day, 10,000 the next, all people desperate to find out what was going on in Boston. As a result, GrassWire crashed spectacularly, its servers groaning under the weight of its popularity. But it also showed Allred and Thornburg just how powerful GrassWire could be \u2013 if they did it right. \"News organisations are trying really hard to do everything they can, but the internet is just too fast. The everyday person has outpaced them,\" Allred says. \"If you're a reporter, you're not only competing with other reporters, you're competing with everyone there who has a camera-phone and Twitter account.\" Social media aggregators are nothing new, but it's what GrassWire does with the content that is different. Users can highlight certain bits of content as important, and can then also perform a fact check, confirming or refuting it by providing links to a source \u2013 such as a Vine video, or an Instagram photo. If America goes to war with Syria, you'll be able to punch the word \"Syria\" into GrassWire and see every piece of social media content on one page \u2013 and then sort it by the ones with the most sources confirming them. \"Sometimes, some of the best content is from ordinary people and first-hand accounts,\" says Allred. \"We wanted a way to find those accounts and display them in a way that's beneficial to the everyday user. We wanted to make them easily discoverable.\" Allred is a former Mormon missionary from Utah; he and Thornburg met while working in Ukraine. Later, while Allred was in China, he became frustrated with how traditional news reporting worked. \"Everyday people need to have more direct access to information that helps them view the world, so we started figuring out how we do that,\" he says. GrassWire sprang from that. And after Boston, Allred moved out to Silicon Valley to hunt for funding, living out of his Honda Civic, finding spots in church parking lots to bed down for the night. \"I didn't have that much money in the bank, but I found a way of making it work,\" he says. At the moment, GrassWire is bootstrapped \u2013 the founders put in all the money themselves. Allred does say that the site has \"some investment offers on the table\" and hopes to have a newly-built version of the site up soon. \"The number one rule of building something like this is that you don't give a release date,\" Allred says, \"but we're confident we'll have something out in the next couple of months.\"",
