In this case billboard company Outdoor Plus, \"a leading light in the premium out-of-home sector\". Answer: Get Coldplay to do it for you. A rather blatant attempt at a \"conscious coupling\" \u2013 tweet Coldplay a pic of a billboard promoting new album Ghost Stories with slightly sycophantic comment \"looking fantastic on Euston Underpass\" \u2013 turned into a PR home run. With 12.4 million fans following @coldplay, the retweet that followed generated something of a Twitter storm. The PR company reckons the publicity avalanche \u2013 helped by another image of the same Outdoor Plus billboard ad tweeted by a fan got the same Coldplay treatment \u2013 resulted in nearly 1,000 retweets and 1,748 favourites. Outdoor advertising was never so sexy. While the plan may not have required a rocket Scientist, the agency will no doubt claim they can be counted on to Parachute into any PR crisis.",
