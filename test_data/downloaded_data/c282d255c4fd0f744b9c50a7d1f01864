  "content": "A celebrity magazine in Denmark has said it will publish the controversial topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge less than 24 hours after her lawyers won an injunction preventing a French publisher using or selling the pictures. The editor of Se og H\u00f8r (See and Hear), said on the magazine's website that it was \"incredibly proud that we have rights to the pictures of Britain's future queen\" which will feature in a 16-page supplement due to be published on Thursday. \"Our readers love to keep up with the famous and royal life and demand revealing news,\" said editor Kim Henningsen. \"It is in Se og H\u00f8r's DNA to entertain and satisfy our readers' curiosity. Therefore, it is always relevant for us when a duchess and the future queen of England is topless,\" Henningsen added. St James's Palace has been made aware of the magazine and says it is taking advice from lawyers about possible legal action. \"We will not be commenting on potential legal action concerning the alleged intended publication of the photos, save to say that all proportionate responses will be kept under review,\" said a palace spokeswoman. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge won the first round of their legal battle against Closer magazine in France, which published five pages of pictures of the couple sunbathing on a roof terrace at a private chateau in Provence. The Tribunal de Grande Instance in Nanterre, Paris, granted an injunction ordering the French title to hand over digital files of the pictures within 24 hours. The magistrates ruled that every photograph published in France by Closer publisher Mondadori, the media company owned by former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, in future would carry a fine of \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,000). But the ruling refers only to the 14 pictures that have already been published. Closer's editor Laurence Pieau has said she has other, more intimate, pictures. The French police raided the premises of the Paris-based magazine on Wednesday as they launched their hunt for the photographer responsible for taking the pictures. Under French criminal law, a breach of privacy carries a fine of up to \u20ac45,000 and a jail sentence of up to 12 months. St James's Palace is still considering its options in relation to the publication of the pictures in Ireland and in Italy, where Mondadori-owned magazine Chi rushed out a special edition on Monday with a 26-page spread. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
