  "content": "\u2022 Here's an interesting new development from the BBC, which is launching a \u00a31m political website, called Democracy Live, which allows you to search and dissect videos from parliament - inspired, apparently, by the likes of They Work for You. \u2022 The legal mess surrounding Skype is nearing a conclusion, reports GigaOm, with the possibility of an agreement over the peer-to-peer technology that eBay didn't buy. \u2022 A couple of very interesting pieces on TechCrunch about the manipulation of social networking sites that certainly leave a bad taste in the mouth: including accusations of unethical business tactics among a number of social gaming advertising companies, and this piece from a Facebook advertising specialist who used to run spam operations.
