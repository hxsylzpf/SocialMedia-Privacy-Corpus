  "content": "At TechCrunch, a video recorded by Adrian Pike of Tatango \"shows the full Google search experience with a very Digg-like interface. Users vote search results up or down -- a down vote makes it disappear with a 'poof,' an up vote moves the result to the first page.\" Sound familiar? Last November, I posted a short about Google Experimental: Google Experimental works like Digg. This is an ongoing development, and is likely to be ongoing for some time. It's not particularly original. Sproose is aimed at creating User Improved Results, and it's an element of the Wikia search engines. So-called \"social search\" sites such as Wink and Mahalo have been taking a similar approach for a few years, but Google's monopoly market share of search could bring \"voting\" to a much wider audience (one almost indistinguishable from everyone). However, this would also make it a prime target for the vast number of people who would love to be able to manipulate Google's results, and not in a nice way.",
