  "content": "The government is to look into the concerns of north-west English MPs that their identities have been borrowed by a website tweeting in their names. Janet Anderson, the MP for Rossendale and Darwen, told Harriet Harman, the leader of the house, in business questions today that an independent website had started sending out Twitter messages in the names of all the MPs in the north west, and in some cases engaging with their constituents. Anderson told the Guardian that the MPs had been told they could assume control of the Twitter feed only by emailing the website from their parliamentary address. Jack Straw, the justice secretary, is also an MP for a north-western seat and is said to be making separate inquiries. In response to Anderson's question, Harman revealed that she too had had her Twitter account hacked in to last week and that the hacker had sent out a \"bogus\" tweet, or short message. One of the people who received her rogue tweet and replied to it was Alan Duncan, the shadow prisons minister. Today Harman informed him the tweet had been fake. The stakes for MPs should they have their Twitter identities stolen are rather high, with observers responding with incredulity last week when the Labour MP David Wright said that he had not authored a tweet sent out in his name calling the Tories \"scum-sucking pigs\". Commiserating with Anderson, Harman said she would tell ministers to look into it. \"I think there's a real issue here and we've got to sort this out,\" she said. The website \"The year of collaboration\" has sent out tweets in the names of all the MPs from north-west England and links through to their pages on the website They Work for You. The website no longer appears to be live but describes itself as a group of \"techies in the north west who build things on the internet\". Twitter is a website that allows people to send public messages of 140 characters or fewer to a group of contacts.",
