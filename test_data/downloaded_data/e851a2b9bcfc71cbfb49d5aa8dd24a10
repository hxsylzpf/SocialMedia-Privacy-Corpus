  "content": "We've reached a moment in American history where debates can be judged by who buys the most clever keyword on Twitter and how quickly (and how many) Tumblrs are launched while they are still happening. As the series of debates this month ended, I felt a pang of guilt and jealousy for every journo-tweet that scrolled across my screen with the simple message: \"Read my take here.\" We're doing \"takes\" now \u2013 though I think of them not as quick sketches of opinion, but in the movie-production sense: a series of line-readings varied in intonation but not content. It would be heresy to say anything besides what's already been decided (by whom? I can't always tell), and the tide of identical opinion overwhelms subtle distinctions about individual arguments. So, when it comes to the presidential contests: Obama lost the first debate; Romney lost the second debate; foreign policy lost the third. The insistence on declaring a \"winner\" in presidential debates has always irritated me. In arguments over philosophy, ideology or morality, what counts as \"winning\"? Back in high school forensics, we walked into speech-and-debate tournaments ready to argue either side, fully aware that the judges evaluated logical consistency, command of the material, originality of arguments, and presentation \u2013 not who was right. To \"win on points\" was a meaningful phrase, because someone was keeping score. Today's presidential debates don't even have a consistent standard for accuracy, and \"winning on points\" just means you came out ahead in a very high-level battle of the dozens. Very well, never mind: it's exactly like high school except then we trusted the judges, because \"zingers\" and moments of special fluency, and not truth, are what seems to sway voters. Voters are not, for instance, undecided on the question of whether across-the-board tax cuts are a good idea. (In fact, they seem set against them when you ask directly.) Voters take in a discussion of tax rates as a form of instructional moral theater, a passion play in which the roles of good and evil haven't been definitively cast but will be determined by who makes the argument that sounds the most righteous. How else do you explain the consistent approval of Romney's tax spiel among undecided voters? The Twitter feed of the professors who supervised CNN's \"dial test\" shows, again and again, undecided voters reacting positively to policies that are demonstrably unpopular with most Americans, including independents, by margins of 20-30%. (Only 36% all voters say the best way to promote economic growth is \"lower taxes and cut spending\"; 34% of independents say the same.) Judging the debates on salesmanship makes it easier to see past complaints from Democrats that the Romney who showed up for the debates was a different one than we saw on the stump: you can't really say Romney misrepresented himself, just his policies. Indeed, we saw both candidates' true nature, if not always the truth, throughout the series. They are both thin-skinned nerds, whose confidence about their command of facts is more certain than the facts themselves. Obama's sleepy nonchalance in the first debate and narrow-eyed near-sadism in the second spoke, in their way, to his arrogance; whereas Romney's casual, inappropriate references to all things he wants to subdue as things he \"likes\" (Big Bird, teachers, green energy) did the same. Romney showed himself to be awkwardly distant from the norms of American life (what struggling family doesn't look forward to tax-free capital gains!?) and speech (binders!). Obama demonstrated a Gen-X sense of humor, bordering on contemptuous (\"the 80s called\"). Romney's persnickety fixation with the debates' guidelines underscored a preoccupation with compliance that I felt belied the Obama camp's worst insinuations about him: whatever his tax returns or time at Bain might reveal, the guy is not a rule-breaker, much less a felon. Romney is as obsessed with following the letter of the law as Obama is with fudging literal fulfillment of regulations he believes objectionable \u2013 or, at least, politically inconvenient. However well-intentioned he might be, this is an apt description of the administration's position on immigration law and the Defense of Marriage Act: intentional avoidance of enforcement. This casual attitude toward regulations one doesn't care for makes Obama more like George Bush than many Democrats would like to admit (see also: drone strikes, kill lists). Such self-assured capriciousness when it comes to governance is not a moral position I'm particularly comfortable with \u2013 and I'm not sure it's superior to Romney's programmatic intellectual alchemy (\"You say I'm inconsistent? Here is why I'm not! See? I fixed it!\"). Even more to the point, Romney abides by the rules \u2013 but wants to rewrite them so that they benefit him and people like him. And he sees nothing wrong with that. Yet, for a long time, I've thought that Romney's ingrained devotion to rules would make him a relatively unobjectionable president. As my dad put it once: \"At least he won't get us into illegal wars.\" But, of course, the debates showed that Romney's most unwavering trait is changeability. He might not get us into any \"illegal wars\" \u2013 but only because Dan Senor will convince him that there's a law they're following somewhere. Romney is somehow more adaptive to his environment than even our first biracial president. And in that way, he's following a path to victory much like the one we followed as high school rhetoricians: say anything.",
