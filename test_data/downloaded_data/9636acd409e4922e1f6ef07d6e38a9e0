  "content": "Snapchat has poached Emily White, the executive responsible for bringing adverts to Instagram, from the Facebook-owned social network. She will become the company's chief operating officer (COO). White, 35, only moved to Instagram as director of business operations in April, and the company's first ever advert, for a Michael Kors watch, appeared five months later in November. Prior to Instagram, she had worked for Facebook on mobile partnerships, and was at Google before that. \"It happened really quickly, but to have an actual COO role in one of many companies that is disrupting the communications arena is one I could not pass up,\" she told Kara Swisher of tech site AllThingsD. \"I have always been captivated by the creativity that has gone into the product \u2026 and I think that Evan [Spiegel, Snapchat co-founder and chief executive] has been looking for someone who can help him grow and scale what is already something that has changed a lot of the way people think about the mobile experience.\" Kevin Systrom, Instagram's chief executive and co-founder, praised White for her \"contributions to Instagram\" and said that the company is \"in an even better place today because of her efforts and we thank her.\" Snapchat is one of the hottest American start-ups, having recently turned down a $3bn attempted acquisition from Facebook. But doubts have been raised over whether the company has a user base to match its aspirations. It has confirmed that its users receive 400m photo or video snaps a day, but not how many users there actually are, nor, crucially, how many messages the average user sends each day. If users of Snapchat are roughly as active as users of WhatsApp, then the company could have as few as 8 million active users.",
