  "content": "A judgment against Mirror Group Newspapers in the Naomi Campbell privacy case would lead to a situation where \"newspapers would look like the old Rhodesian Herald - pages and pages of blank paper\", the Mirror's barrister said this afternoon. Mr Desmond Browne QC said finding in favour of Campbell would be \"utterly nonsensical\" and have huge implications for all the press. Arguments in the week-long case ended today, although the judge, Mr Justice Morland, reserved judgment until later in the year. The model is suing Mirror Group Newspapers for breach of confidence, invasion of privacy and breach of the Data Protection Act after the paper published an article, headlined: \"Naomi: I am a Drug Addict\", revealing she was attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings for drug addiction. Earlier in the day, Campbell's barrister, Mr Andrew Caldecott QC, had accused the Daily Mirror editor, Piers Morgan, of being \"disingenuous\" and \"evasive\" in his evidence. And he criticised the paper's use of the term \"chocolate soldier\" to describe Campbell, saying the origins of the terms were so obscure that his client took it to be a racist slur. \"It is not remotely surprising that Miss Campbell was upset,\" he said. Mr Caldecott added that when he brought the matter up with Morgan in court, the editor had replied with a \"dismissive tone and intellectual poverty\". The judge indicated his sympathy with Campbell's position on the wording when he said: \"I can say I have no idea of the phrase. I never came across those words. I think I'm entitled to take that into account.\" The judgment will be delivered within the next few months.",
