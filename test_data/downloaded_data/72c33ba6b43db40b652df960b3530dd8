Since MtGox, once the most prominent bitcoin exchange, prevented withdrawals in early February, popular sources of data on the currency such as RTBTC have become unreliable. The twins' project, \"Winkdex\", aims to solve the issue. \"We believe that we are establishing an accurate spot price that reflects the true value of a bitcoin and resolves the price confusion that exists due to the various exchanges,\" said Cameron Winklevoss, who is the CEO of the company behind Winkdex. His brother, Tyler, is the president of the firm. \"The creation of an index that better reflects accurate pricing is the next step in wider acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class,\" Cameron added. The index takes an amalgamation of bitcoin prices over six exchanges, including Japan's MtGox, Britain's Bitstamp and Bulgaria's BTC-E. The prices averaged together using a \"proprietary, patent pending Winkdex formula\" which takes into account volume and timing of transactions, giving more weight to those which have had more trades in the last two hours. Winkdex will be used internally by the Winklevoss brothers to price their bitcoin holdings, which have never been publicly disclosed. In April 2013, the pair said their holdings amounted to around 1% of all bitcoins in existence; if so, that would equate to an investment of $11m in April's prices. With the Winkdex showing a price of bitcoin at $592, that means they have more than doubled their money in the interim. In 2004, the twins sued Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg for $140m, accusing him of stealing their idea for the social network. The case was settled in 2008 for $65m.",
