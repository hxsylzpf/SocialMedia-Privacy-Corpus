In a world of increasingly footloose capital, governments are finding it harder to track down where their wealthiest citizens are stashing their money. While the authorities have been introducing ever-more sophisticated surveillance and monitoring regimes, dozens of off-shore financial centres have sprung up catering to needs of those with the cash. The genteel prosperity of St Helier, capital of Jersey is a testimony to rewards foreign money has brought to some of the world's smallest economies. Forty years ago, Jersey depended on its famous cows. Today it milks the world's rich. Jersey and other tax havens provide a home for some $6 trillion of footloose capital, belonging to corporations and wealthy individuals. Oxfam has estimated that around a third of the world's GDP passes through an offshore centre at some stage. Finding an off-shore centre no longer requires specialised advice from a private banker. Dozens of internet sites offer advice on how to shelter assets and earnings from the attentions of the taxman. Already 2 million Americans pay their bills using credit cards issued by offshore banks. Defenders say the havens offer \"asset protection\" and that it is up to individual taxpayers to disclose to the authorities all their income. Meanwhile over-stretched tax officials lack the time and the resources to follow the money trail. According to a Guardian investigation, undeclared tax in the UK totalled \u00a325bn last year. The Inland Revenue's compliance unit managed to track down just \u00a34.5bn of it. Only 56 people were convicted as a result of its investigations. This is a game of financial privacy played only by the rich because the rest of us don't have any spare cash to hide from the taxman. The goal is to minimise payments of three main taxes which hit wealth - inheritance, capital gains and stamp duty. Players get a free roll of the dice from the government to begin with - there is a raft of perfectly legitimate ways they can minimise their tax bills, ranging from rollover relief on capital gains tax, to the British film industry, which increasingly appears to be one giant tax-avoidance scheme. Then there is Britain's notoriously lax non-domicile rule which allows foreign born residents to claim that they intend returning home someday, thereby escaping tax on assets and income kept abroad. For really determined players, tax havens offer the opportunity for straight tax evasion. Shifting assets offshore to avoid taxes is an offence under UK law. But if the tax haven is discreet, the chances are the Revenue will never find out. Although havens often claim they do not help foreigners hide wealth, their finance industries specialise in offering complicated ownership structures and trusts which make it hard to trace where the money has gone. Property is the easiest to hide from the taxman. Its ownership can be disguised through a trust whose ultimate beneficiary is hard to discover. Ships and aircraft also have their fans. Ownership of UK companies is a trickier proposition because company law requires shareholders names to be listed. Setting up offshore is surprisingly simple, as a quick visit to the websites of major accountancy firms demonstrates. Advice from the big four can be obtained in some of the world's most exotic and least taxed locations and without even having to go there. To quote KPMG's Vanuatu website, the islands - a tiny archipelgo in the south west Pacific - offer \"complete confidentiality and no disclosure... [of] this information to a third party.\" To set up an offshore company with its own bank account on Vanuatu costs $2,000 and takes just 24 hours, although KMPG offers a special one-hour service, available for those in a real hurry. No tax is payable there and no returns or annual accounts need to be filed. With a credit card issued by a friendly bank, the money is available anywhere in the world. Understandably, the authorities in the major economies are less than keen on seeing their revenues leaking into secret offshore accounts. Two years ago the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - representing the 29 richest economies - began targeting particularly egregious jurisdictions whose laws were designed to attract the evaders, demanding that they open up their records to tax authorities abroad. The offshore centres reacted with some indignation, pointing out that some of the strictest financial privacy laws are found among the OECD's own members, notably Switzerland and Luxemburg. The new Republican administration in Washington threatened to scupper the initiative entirely, arguing that competition from low tax regimes was healthy for overtaxed European economies. September 11 changed the Bush administration's view of the OECD's crackdown. The secrecy which allowed Al-Qaida to move money around the world under the noses of the authorities was no longer a point of principle. To avoid being blacklisted by the OECD, offshore centres have to promise to exchange information with tax authorities abroad. Some have chosen to cooperate, notably Jersey, Guernsey and the Cayman Islands. UK specialists in offshore company formation now offer several levels of discretion depending on the jurisdiction chosen. \"Levels of disclosure and personal accountability vary depending on your structural requirements,\" boasts one, pointing out that if the goal is setting up a company others will want to do business with, Jersey and the Isle of Man may be a better choice than the British Virgin Islands. \u00b7 Charlotte Denny is The Guardian's economics correspondent.",
