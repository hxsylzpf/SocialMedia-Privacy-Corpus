  "content": "A committee of MPs has called for a ban on alcohol advertising before 9pm on television, on billboards or posters near schools and on social networking websites. The report, by the House of Commons health select committee, argues that restrictions on alcohol advertising are not tough enough and that the \"problem is more the quantity of advertising than the promotion\". The committee criticised the lack of public health advertising messages and floated the idea that 20% of TV ads by alcohol advertisers be dedicated to health messages. The report called for alcohol advertising to be banned in films under an 18 rating and said that billboards and posters promoting alcohol should not be allowed within 100m of any school. A similar rule used to apply to tobacco advertising. It recommended that no medium should be used to advertise alcoholic drinks if more than 10% of its readership or audience is under 18; current rules stipulate a 25% threshold. The 10% rule would also apply to the sponsorship of events, an area that the report says has not been adequately regulated. The report identified digital media as an area in which alcohol companies have focused their marketing. Alcohol promotion should be banned on social networking websites, it said. The report called for a major upheaval in the regulation of alchohol marketing, which is currently shared by the Advertising Standards Authority and the industry-funded Portman Group. \"The regulation of alcohol promotion should be completely independent of the alcohol and advertising industries,\" it said. \"This would match the best practice in other fields such as financial services and professional conduct.\" The advertising and drinks industry was, predictably, scathing about the recommendations. \"The committee's call for severe new alcohol marketing restrictions will be damaging and ineffective and we believe the system of advertising regulation is robust,\" said Rae Burdon, the chief operating officer of the Advertising Association. \"The evidence is that these severe restrictions will not deliver the health benefits or the protection of young people the committee seeks. Their only effect will be to severely damage media, brand-owner businesses and sporting events.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
