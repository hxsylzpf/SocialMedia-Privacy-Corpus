  "content": "Manchester United have made their Twitter debut, becoming the last Premier League club to join the micro-blogging site. The club launched its official Twitter account at 8.30am on Wednesday. Its first tweet read \"New era, same spirit. The season starts here. Let's do this.\" Man Utd's Twitter account had accumulated almost 200,000 followers by lunchtime. The club also launched on Sina Weibo, the China-based micro-blogging site, which will offer fans of the Red Devils exclusive content to their news feeds. The Twitter account will initially launch in English, with foreign-language version to follow. Manchester United has hitherto resisted launching an official Twitter account despite having a considerable presence on Facebook, where it has 34 million \"likes\". One reason for now launching on Twitter is that the club is thought to be close to appointing a social media campaign manager. Its presence on Twitter will offer Manchester United the chance to work on commercial opportunities with its partners, such as promoted tweets. One expert suggested it could take less than a week for Manchester United to attract 1 million followers and that it would eventually take over Chelsea with 2.39 million followers and Arsenal with 2.50 million followers. Real Madrid, with 8.1 million followers, and FC Barcelona, with 9.4 million followers, are the world's leading football clubs on Twitter. All of the Premier League teams now run official Twitter accounts. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
