After all, the pretty yellow plant that seems to spring up overnight in fields and hedgerows, is classed as one of Britain's most injurious, with a reputation for killing horses and grazing animals who eat it. It has its own act of parliament and code, and costs local councils and government agencies millions of pounds a year to spray it with herbicides. \"I hate ragwort. It may not be the issue of the moment but I am on the warpath for those who let this vile weed spread. Chief target at the moment is the Highways Agency,\" wrote a confident Benyon on the wall of his Facebook page. But the cheers did not ring out. Instead, the minister with responsibility for biodiversity found himself in a fierce spat with some of Britain's leading ecologists. Within hours of the post about the \"vile weed\", more than 30 people had complained that he was ecologically illiterate, plain wrong or perpetuating myths put out about the plant by herbicide companies. \"Minister of the natural environment!!!! You don't even seem to know Defra's [the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] guidance - get your facts straight - livestock are generally only harmed if they eat the dried plants in hay!\", wrote Dusty Gedge, a leading urban ecologist and designer of green roofs. They attacked his science: \"There is very very clear science on meta-population dynamics that shows that habitat loss with in a patchwork of habitats has a very severe effect. There is a chapter on ragwort in one of the standard textbooks,\" wrote another. And they attacked his ecological knowledge: \"At least 30 insect and 14 fungi species are entirely reliant on ragwort, and about a third of the insects are scarce or rare. Ragwort is also a critically important nectar source for hundreds of species of butterflies, bees, moths, flies and other invertebrates, helping to maintain what remains of their much declined populations in the UK countryside,\" said Matt Shardlow, director of invertebrate society group Buglife. But Newbury MP Benyon, whose family's estates earn around \u00a3200,000 a year in EU farm subsidies, was not backing down. Like his colleague Tory MP Nicholas Soames, who in 2009 called the \"scourge\" of ragwort a national \"shame\", Benyon struck back, saying his critics were being \"unnecessarily aggressive\", and that he wasn't advocating ethnic cleansing of ragwort but that he wanted to deal with \"a severe infestation of a poisonous plant\". That only infuriated people more. \"There is a campaign against ragwort. We are told that it kills hundreds or thousands of animals a year. We are told it is dangerous to touch it or it can give you cancer if you do. We are told it is a danger to dogs. None of this is true\", said one. \"Actually there is not a severe infestation of ragwort at the moment. There is a great deal of increase in the hysteria but the last government countryside survey actually shows a decrease. Ask your civil servants to check it for you.\" It was all too much for Benyon, who retired from the debate and, shortly afterwards, deleted the thread on his Facebook wall. Richard Benyon said: \"I'm very well aware of ragwort's great importance to biodiversity, but what many people don't realise it that its presence can be extremely dangerous to livestock, especially horses. People should be made aware of the dangers as well as the benefits and take action to protect their animals if they're at risk.\" The Highways Agency said it was baffled as to why Benyon had picked on them. \"We take ragwort seriously. Where we judge it a risk we control it. This comes out of the blue,\" said a spokesman.",
