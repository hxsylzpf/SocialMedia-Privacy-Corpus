  "content": "Business networking website LinkedIn launched in 41 new languages yesterday to offer more support to the estimated 40% of its audience based outside English-speaking countries. The LinkedIn European managing director, Kevin Eyres, said the new versions - in languages including Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Russian and Croatian - were created in response to user demand. LinkedIn members with business contacts in both France and the UK can now present a French profile to France assosiates and an English profile to those in the UK. A job title posted in one language on a user's profile will automatically appear translated on other versions, though users can also edit details themselves. Eyres said 50% of LinkedIn's 31 million members are based outside the US. There are nearly 2 million members in the UK and more than 1 million in India, where English is the most common language. LinkedIn claims that one new member joins the site every second. \"Now more than ever, as we're seeing, the economy is really global and what happens in one country directly affects what happens in another,\" Eyres added. \"English is great as an international language, but makes it more difficult for users in Germany who want to communicate with other contacts in Germany. And we also want to allow members to show off their language skills,\" he said. \"This has been in the works for a very long time. We have completely re-architected the site and have many more new features coming out that will make the site more responsive from a user standpoint. But we are moving into Europe; this is a global network we are setting up and we have our European base in London.\" Eyres said the new language versions were the next stage in LinkedIn's expansion plan, adding to a conferences and events recommendation feature and the introduction of business applications from third-party companies including collaborative software startup Huddle. A new set of features and products will be released before Christmas, he added. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
