  "content": "It was dubbed the \"trial of the century\", which also meant it was potentially the story of the century for the hundreds of journalists, from countries ranging from Iran to Australia, who were sent to cover it. In the months leading up to the trial of Josef Fritzl, the race was on to secure a post-trial interview with him, or better still his daughter Elisabeth. The British tabloids led the pack and it was the Sun that published the first grainy picture of Elisabeth - her face pixelated - following her move to a new home. The paper tracked her down in February to a supposedly secret location in Austria where she and her six children had made a new life with a new identity. Then, on 11 March, the Daily Mail published the name of the village where Elisabeth lives. If you put the name of the village and \"Fritzl\" into Google it comes up with nearly 100 matches from news sources around the world. Just days before Fritzl walked into courtroom 119 in the city of St P\u00f6lten, the assembled reporters were abuzz with the news that representatives of News Corp-owned television, newspapers and publishers had made a joint approach to Elisabeth, offering her \u00a35m to divulge everything about her dungeon ordeal. She turned them down. Her legal advisers - she has two lawyers representing her interests but no publicist - had told her not to adopt the \"Natascha Kampusch strategy\". Kampusch, who was kept in a cellar in a Viennese suburb for more than eight years, went on the PR offensive following her release, granting an interview to the Austrian state broadcaster ORF which projected her face around the world. Later, when she applied for a court injunction to prevent a newspaper from publishing pictures of her in a disco, the judge declared that she had no right to privacy as she was now a public figure. She also sued a British paper for publicising details of her life without permission. Christoph Herbst, a lawyer acting for Elisabeth, told the Guardian that he was considering legal action for invasion of privacy. Perhaps surprisingly, Elisabeth has not brought any privacy proceedings against a newspaper, either in Austria or overseas, unlike her mother, Josef Fritzl's wife, Rosemarie. However, under English law, she has six years to bring proceedings, starting from the date of the publication of the material. Arguably, the Austrian press has hoovered up much of the British tabloid coverage, at the same time as expressing outrage at the behaviour of what the tabloid \u00f6sterreich has repeatedly referred to throughout the trial as Britain's \"Satan reporters\". Last week \u00f6sterreich reported how the Sun may have breached victim protection laws by publishing an interview with Fritzl's wife, Rosemarie, although the Austrian paper then proceeded to divulge the contents of the interview. Austria's justice minister, Claudia Bandion-Ortner, says the Fritzl case has prompted a review of the laws that have allowed Elisabeth to be identified while her father has a form of state protection. \"I'm planning to reform the media laws in order to give victims more protection,\" she told the Vienna newspaper Falter last week. \"Prompted by the case of 'Herr F.', it's time to ensure that victims, particularly those of sexual abuse, are not victimised a second time round by the media coverage.\" But it may be too late for Elisabeth. The intrusions forced her to move her family back into the psychiatric clinic where they were treated in the months following their release, for the duration of the trial. It must have felt like a retrograde step, but a necessary one if they were going to have any chance of being protected from the media glare. Several photographers were duly dispatched to the clinic to snap her there. The authorities could have protected Elisabeth from the start by taking the same action as authorities in Sheffield who, last November, issued a gagging order over the identity of the 56-year-old man who impregnated his two daughters 19 times. Instead, the justice ministry only banned the Austrian media from referring to her name in full, after her identity had already been exposed. Although some media have thereafter spoken only of the \"F case\", absurdly she has been referred to in most newspapers as \"Elisabeth F., the daughter of Josef Fritzl\". Many of those involved in the case since Fritzl's arrest in April 2008 have let numerous juicy morsels - everything from the initial police questioning of Fritzl to the psychiatrist's report and diary entries written in the cellar by Elisabeth - filter into the media, in an unrelenting drip-drip feed. The trial and its coverage have also highlighted the way the web has allowed information to spread quickly around the world, leaving national authorities apparently powerless to stop it. \"This trial has shown the fruits of a culture of bureaucracy that confuses transparency with theatre,\" says Florian Klenk of Falter. \"It attracts the self-publicists and the braggadocios and it's the victims who suffer.\" In this case Elisabeth. \"Their new existence has been destroyed thanks to the British reporters who divulged the name of her village,\" Klenk adds. Nobody is claiming that this was not a huge story, not least because of its unprecedented nature and the length of time the abuse went on, under the noses of neighbours, family and the authorities. All the papers recognise this fact, including the Guardian, which sent me to cover the 10-day trial. Hhighlighting the media's role can conveniently switch the focus away from any failings within the relevant authorities. The question now is whether Elisabeth can maintain any semblance of privacy. So far only a few journalists have camped on her doorstep. Security experts were dispatched by the authorities some weeks ago to install a sophisticated alarm system at her home. But her lawyers are already asking how long she will be able to keep the larger media pack at bay. Her father may have been sent to prison for life, but her media ordeal is far from over.",
