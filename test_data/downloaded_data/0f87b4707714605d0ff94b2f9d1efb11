  "content": "The Dorset Echo has been censured by the press watchdog for running a story about a man with cystic fibrosis against his wishes. A man from Weymouth complained to the Press Complaints Commission that a Dorset Echo story article headlined \"Mum's plea over organ donations\" from January 17 breached the accuracy and privacy clauses of the code of practice. The PCC upheld the complaint. The article quoted the man's mother stating that her son needed a new heart and lungs, which she later denied ever having said. His mother also said this was factually incorrect. In its defence, the Dorset Echo produced the reporter's notebook where the quote was recorded. The man did not give consent for his details and refused to pose for a photograph. The paper obtained one from a friend. Based on information from the complainant's mother, the newspaper said that the story was published in good faith. \"The information in the article \u2013 that the complainant had cystic fibrosis, and the claim that he needed a heart and lung transplant \u2013 was obviously highly personal,\" the PCC said. \"The newspaper did not obtain permission from the complainant himself to publish the information,\" the regulator added. \"Given the circumstances of the story, the newspaper could have waited to ensure that the complainant \u2013 who was an adult and able to speak for himself - was willing for his health details to be publicised in his local newspaper.\" The PCC also criticised the paper for not running a correction when the man told them parts of the story were inaccurate. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
