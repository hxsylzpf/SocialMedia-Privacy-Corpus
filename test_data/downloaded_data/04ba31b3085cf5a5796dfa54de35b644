  "content": "The BBC has apologised after a memory stick containing personal data about more than 250 children who had applied to participate in one of its programmes was stolen. Personal information including the names, addresses, birthdates, phone numbers and holiday plans of children who had applied to take part in a new BBC1 series, Gastronauts, was contained on the memory stick, which was stolen from independent production company Objective several weeks ago. The BBC children's controller, Richard Deverell, has written to the children's parents to inform them of the theft. \"I offer you my sincere apologies and my assurances that we are taking all action possible to mitigate the consequences of this regrettable incidence,\" he wrote. Deverell informed parents they could call a free helpline if they had concerns about the data theft. CBBC, which commissioned the programme aimed at eight- to 12-year-olds, suspended new commissions and reviewed procedures after learning of the theft. \"There's absolutely no evidence this data has been misused and the measures we took were entirely precautionary,\" a BBC spokesman said. \"Whilst the independent company was responsible for this issue, we took it seriously. \"CBBC suspended new commissions and work on new programming until a full review of objectives practices took place. \"Work only recommenced when we were satisfied that procedures were as strong as possible.\" Objective's other production credits include Peep Show, Star Stories, Derren Brown's TV shows and new Channel 4 late night satirical show Tonightly. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
