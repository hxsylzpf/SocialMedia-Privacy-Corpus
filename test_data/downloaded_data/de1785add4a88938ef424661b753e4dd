  "content": "I just came across some handy instructions for people who want to disrupt and destroy presentations of ideas they disagree with: \u2013 Artificially Inflate Your Numbers: \"Spread out in the hall and try to be in the front half. The objective is to put the [enemy] on the defensive with your questions and follow-up. The [enemy] should be made to feel that a majority, and if not, a significant portion of at least the audience, opposes the ... agenda. \u2013 Be Disruptive Early And Often: \"You need to rock-the-boat early in the enemy's presentation, Watch for an opportunity to yell out and challenge the [enemy]'s statements early.\" \u2013 Try To \"Rattle Him,\" Not Have An Intelligent Debate: \"The goal is to rattle him, get him off his prepared script and agenda. If he says something outrageous, stand up and shout out and sit right back down. Look for these opportunities before he even takes questions.\" These are in fact instructions to Republican operatives trying to disrupt meetings to promote health care reform in the US this summer. If you follow the link, you'll see that the enemy is actually the local Democratic Representative. But the tactics proposed do bear a quite astonishing resemblance to the behaviour of some gangs here. It won't be tolerated. We know from plenty of threads on Cif belief that it is possible to have civilised and interesting discussions on subjects where people disagree very strongly. These discussions don't happen by themselves. They need self-discipline, and where that fails, external discipline. That's not about censorship of ideas, but of manners. There's a contract implied on this site. If the writers take time to read and respond in threads, they are doing so on the basis that there is genuine good faith and willingness to engage on the part of the posters, too. I can't make writers respond in threads but they are much more likely to do so if it looks as if people are really trying to respond.",
