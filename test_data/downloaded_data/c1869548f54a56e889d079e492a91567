  "content": "Donald Trump's announcement that he would ban Muslims from entering America if he becomes president has provoked reactions on the internet ranging from outrage and anger to bafflement and utter disbelief. Many Twitter users - including politicians, novelists and celebrities from around the world - were deeply concerned by the tenor of Trump's comments, and the manner in which they were wholeheartedly embraced by his supporters. Others pointed out some flaws in his logic. While some turned to humour. But many tweets conveyed a real sense of disquiet and dismay. Trump's sentiments reminded some on Twitter of political figures from days gone by. They also prompted the Huffington Post to move its coverage of Trump from the website's entertainment section to politics. But, of course, not everyone was offended by his proposals. Among the most poignant responses were those that paid tribute to Muslims who have died fighting under the American flag. Others argued that it might not be time to move to Canada... just yet. A small chink of light emerged for those who fear a Trump presidency. A rare poll has put him behind Ted Cruz in the key state of Iowa.",
