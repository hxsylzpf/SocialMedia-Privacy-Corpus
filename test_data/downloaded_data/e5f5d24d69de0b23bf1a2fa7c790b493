  "content": "Arguably America's foremost portrait photographer, Annie Leibovitz's new exhibition, Women: New Portraits, which opened in San Francisco on Tuesday, is dedicated to pictures of women who are currently in the news \u2013 and the photographer's mind. It includes images of Amy Schumer and her sister Kim Caramele, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook executive and author of Lean In, and a previously unpublished image of Caitlyn Jenner from the shoot Leibowitz did for Vanity Fair, which caused a sensation last year. It also includes an image of Malala Yousafzai, spokesperson for the right of girls to an education and winner of the Nobel Peace prize. Leibovitz said: \"I feel unbelievably blessed that I have had the opportunity to photograph Malala in her classroom in Birmingham. She was shot by the Taliban, and almost didn't survive. She was taken to Birmingham, where they saved her life, and she ended up going to school there. She was a very important person for me to add to the show. I was so moved because Malala is smiling.\" Women: New Portraits is at The Presidio's Crissy Field, San Francisco. Details here",
