  "content": "It is Saturday morning and I have been sent to the fish shop. We are having people to stay for the weekend, and more people to dinner. The woman behind the counter is trying not to smile as she reads out the total. \"It's not actually that bad,\" she says, biting her lip. \"Well, it's not as bad as I'd feared,\" I say. This is a lie. My phone dings twice in my pocket, but when I pull it out and look at it, I can't figure out what it wants from me. \"How was the fish shop?\" my wife asks when I get home. \"I didn't let them see me cry,\" I say. \"Don't say how much,\" she says. \"I just hope I bought enough,\" I say. \"I was trying to up the recipe from six people to eight in my head, but my phone kept...\" \"Actually, we've got 10 coming.\" \"Ten? We're incapable of having 10 people to supper. We haven't even got 10 forks.\" \"It'll be fine.\" \"That's easy for you to say, because you don't have to...\" My phone dings in my pocket. \"Why do you keep doing this to me?\" I shout. \"What are you talking about?\" \"It's my phone,\" I say. \"It's been dinging for three days, but when I look at it there's nothing.\" \"Relax,\" she says. I take my phone to my office and try to figure out what it's trying to tell me. I have no new messages, no texts, no missed calls, no emails. The battery isn't running low. And yet it continues to ding, at random intervals, for no reason. Only hours later, while cooking, am I struck by a thought: \"Facebook!\" I say. \"What about it?\" my wife says. I check my phone, which I discover is logged on to the middle one's Facebook account. Could it be that I'm receiving a notification whenever somebody in Year 9 breaks up with someone? I call the middle one into the kitchen. \"Yeah?\" he says. I hand him my phone. \"Please sign out of your Facebook account on this,\" I say. \"Are you crazy?\" says my wife, who has been unfriended by the middle one for posting arch comments on his wall. \"I understand the importance of spying on our children,\" I say, \"but I need to stop this dinging.\" He hands back the phone. \"Done.\" \"How's your girlfriend?\" my wife says. \"I don't have a girlfriend,\" he says. The next day, with the dinner party safely behind us, we are having a late lunch. Only one of our house guests, Anna, is present. All of the children apart from the oldest have left the table. \"So when do you write your column?\" Anna asks. \"First thing in the morning,\" I say. \"And what's it going to be about, this one?\" she says. \"No idea,\" I say. \"Nothing's happened to me.\" \"You don't seem very panicked about it,\" Anna says. \"He's panicking on the inside,\" my wife says. \"A little, but over the years I've learned to manage the stress that comes with...\" My phone dings in my pocket. \"Christ!\" I scream, rising from my chair. \"Can you not leave me alone for one second? If it's not Facebook, then what the hell is it?\" \"Who's he talking to?\" Anna asks. \"While you're up,\" the oldest one says, \"pour me some apple juice.\" That night I wake up at 4am with a brilliant idea for a column. I've already composed the first paragraph by the time I realise that the anecdote about sharing a taxi with a horse was only a dream. In the terrible silence that follows, I hear my phone ding twice from the pocket of the trousers draped over a chair in the bathroom.",
