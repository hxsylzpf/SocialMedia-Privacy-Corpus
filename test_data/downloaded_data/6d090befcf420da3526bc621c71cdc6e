  "content": "The row over government failures to protect personal information escalated last night when the data protection minister, Michael Wills, was forced to admit he had been unaware that discs containing personal details of 25 million people had been lost by Revenue &amp; Customs until he heard Alistair Darling's statement to MPs in the Commons. Asked whether he had been aware in advance of other leaks of confidential personal information revealed by the media in the last few days, he told MPs and peers on the joint committee on human rights that he had first known of them from the media reports. The Conservative peer Lord Onslow asked whether Wills had known of warnings from a Cambridge University professor that leaks were inevitable with such large, widely accessible databases. Wills said: \"I wasn't aware of it till I saw him on TV making the same point.\" He said he was responsible for the legislative framework for data protection, not for ensuring that other departments, which had operational independence, complied with the requirements. He thought it \"perfectly acceptable\" not to have been told in advance about the loss of the Revenue and Customs discs because the first thing that had to be done was to discover the extent of the problem and try to put it right. Wills said a review of data protection legislation had been announced \"before any of this happened\" and the government would act in the light of the review. The information commissioner, Richard Thomas, has called for greater powers to enforce the Data Protection Act, including spot checks on government departments and other bodies processing data, and a new criminal offence of committing serious security breaches. Wills said he had been to visit the commissioner this month and was waiting for detailed proposals. He admitted that ID cards would have to be looked at again. \"I think we are obviously going to have a look at the national identity register again in the light of this.\"",
