Andrew Caldecott QC, representing the model, said there was no necessity for the tabloid to publish the picture other than to appeal to readers. \"The reason why the photographs were taken was its obvious appeal to readers on a candid camera basis,\" Mr Caldecott said. \"That's the appeal of it journalistically. It's value evidentially is very slight,\" he added. Ms Campbell's lawyer argued that the Mirror did not need to publish the photograph to back up its story that the model was receiving treatment for drug addiction because the photographer who took the picture had already seen her leaving the Narcotics Anonymous meeting on the Kings Road in Chelsea. The Press Complaints Commission's code of practice bans the use of long lens photography in places where the subject has a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\". Mr Caldecott said this expectation of privacy should apply at the end of a private event such as a funeral, a visit to a doctor's surgery or, in Ms Campbell's case, her treatment for drug addiction. \"To get to any private activity normally involves a public journey. We would suggest the closing moments of a private activity may well take on the expectation of privacy,\" he said. The caption and text accompanying photographs in newspapers can make the difference between a passer-by glimpsing a celebrity in a street and a reader being given details of why they were in that place at that time, Mr Caldecott said. \"There's a difference between an uninformed passer-by in the street and the reader who's invited to share the private context of the public appearance.\" One of the problems with covert photography, Mr Caldecott said, was that the subject is given no opportunity to reduce the potential invasion of his or her privacy. If she had been consulted on the taking of the photograph, her lawyer said Ms Campbell may have asked \"please don't photograph me right outside my place of therapy, and not with other people. If you must photograph me I'll go 50 yards down the road and you can photograph me there.\" He admitted: \"It's important in a democracy that the media are free to investigate public interest issues.\" However, Mr Caldecott argued that personal information should be protected when the material is \"essentially private in nature in that a reasonable person would so regard it\" and \"likely to cause real offence to a person in the claimant's position\". It was \"relevant\" that the Mirror article of February 2001, revealing Ms Campbell's treatment for drug addiction, stated that she was at \"a fragile stage in her recovery\", he said. Ms Campbell is appealing to the House of Lords after the court of appeal overturned a judgment in her favour made by Mr Justice Morland in March 2002. Mr Justice Morland ruled that while the Mirror was justified in reporting that Ms Campbell had taken drugs and was receiving treatment for drug addiction, the newspaper was in breach of confidence for publishing photographs and details of that treatment. But the court of appeal took a different view, stripping her of her \u00a33,500 damages award and ordering her to pay the Mirror's \u00a3350,000 legal costs. In a two-day hearing Lords Nicholls, Hoffmann, Hope and Carswell and Lady Hale must decide whether the publication of details of Ms Campbell's non-medical treatment and photographs of her leaving a treatment session constitute a breach of confidence and/or an invasion of privacy. They are not expected to reveal their decision for another six to eight weeks. The model made an unexpected appearance in the House of Lords today, wearing a pale turquoise suit, to hear her appeal. Mr Caldecott added that the Mirror article was likely to deter Ms Campbell from going to Narcotics Anonymous and to make her feel \"inhibited\". \"If one puts oneself into Ms Campbell's position, going to a Narcotics Anonymous meeting when the world has been told where she goes, there's going to be discomfort going to a building with no obvious connection to her work,\" he said. He pointed to a distinctive cafe sign in one of the photographs that he said would alert people to the exact location and further discourage Ms Campbell from attending sessions. Mr Caldecott said there was also an issue about how the article and photographs would affect the model's relationship with other attendants of the Narcotics Anonymous meeting. \"If fellow attendants take the view that her celebrity may endanger their anonymity or even lead to their photographs being published, that's going to make them less willing to attend with her.\" Mr Caldecott said that a reference in the article to Ms Campbell being called \"plain Naomi\" in the sessions was \"very intrusive\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
