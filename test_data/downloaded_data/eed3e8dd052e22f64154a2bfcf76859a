  "content": "\u2022 After accusations that some social network application developers are acting unethically - making money by tricking people into paying for services they don't want - MySpace boss Owen Van Natta has said that such deceptive practices will be banned on the site. \u2022 It wouldn't be surprising if you haven't heard of ACTA - the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement that is currently under negotiation - after all, a number of governments have been fighting to keep the details secret. But according to Canadian law professor and campaigner Michael Geist, leaked details of the talks suggest that a global three strikes policy could be on the way and the dissolution of \"safe harbour\" or \"mere conduit\" rules for internet service providers. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has more detail. \u2022 Hallowe'en might be over for this year (though in my house, it's never over for personal reasons - it's my birthday) but that doesn't mean you can't marvel at the great costumes people made. This big-head wireframe by Eric Testroete has had a lot of admirers, while this this baby Katamari costume is great. More in the comments, please!
