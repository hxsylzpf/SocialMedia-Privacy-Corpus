The briefing provides newly clarified rules on the tax liabilities for both individuals and businesses handling cryptocurrencies including, but not limited to, bitcoin. \"This briefing gives much-needed clarity to digital currency businesses, many of whom had been looking to move offshore,\" says Tom Robinson, the founder of bitcoin trader Elliptic and director of the newly formed UK digital currency association (UKDCA), which aims to represent the British cryptocurrency community. \"The UKDCA looks forward to working with financial regulators to further clarify the legal status of digital currencies and ensure that the UK takes the lead in developing this highly innovative technology,\" Robinson added. The briefing steers clear of explicitly declaring bitcoin a currency, but the rules laid out are \"almost identical\" to how conventional currencies are treated, according to the UKDCA. Crucially, not only is the purchase of the currency no longer subject to VAT, neither are the margins miners make if they sell their newly produced coins. However, HMRC insists that profits made by bitcoin traders and miners are still liable for corporation tax, income tax, and capital gains tax. GoxBux HMRC's decision comes amid the continued fallout of the collapse of MtGox, once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange. A group of concerned former customers, led by tech entrepreneur Josh Weinstein, have banded together to \"gather information, compare notes, and explore legal options and remedies\". Calling themselves GoxBux, the 23 members claim to have lost a combined total of $79,150 and 2763.302 BTC, worth more than \u00a31.5m or \u00a370,000 per person. The losses have led some US legislators to call for a total ban on the currency. Senator Joe Manchin said, in an open letter to Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen, that he was concerned that \"as bitcoin is inevitably banned in other countries, Americans will be left holding the bag on a valueless currency.\" On Friday, Yellen declared that the US Fed does not have the authority to regulate bitcoin, at least while it continues to be largely separate from the mainstream banking system. \u2022 US prosecutors investigate businesses dealing in bitcoins \u2022 Updated 18:01 with the newly released briefing.",
