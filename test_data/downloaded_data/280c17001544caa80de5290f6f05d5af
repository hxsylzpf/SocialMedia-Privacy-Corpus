  "content": "A Republican member of the US House of Representatives is facing a storm of sarcasm from the Twitterati today after he compared the violence and political unrest in Iran to his battle with Democrats over an energy bill. As congressman Pete Hoekstra of Michigan read the Tweets from the chaos in Iran, he sent this message to his beloved followers: \"Iranian twitter activity similar to what we did in House last year when Republicans were shut down in the House.\" Twitterers quickly began mocking the Republican for the analogy and a blog called Pete Hoekstra Is A Meme was born. Here's a sampling from the blog: @petehoekstra Dove into a pool, swam to the other side, got out using the stairs. Now I know what it was like to storm the beach on D-Day. @petehoekstra I stepped in a puddle today and got my shoe wet. It was like being on Flight 1549 landing in the Hudson River @petehoekstra Had to move all my stuff to a new office w/o a corner view. Now i know what the Trail of Tears was like. #GOPfail @petehoekstra jumped on a trampoline this morning, reminded me of the moon landing What is your @ reply to Pete?",
