  "content": "It didn't take long for Facebook to dismiss what it says is an incorrect story about its growth stalling in a few key markets, based on questionable data. Inside Facebook claimed the site has seen significantly less growth for the US and Canada for two months. Data is gathered by Inside Facebook's own metrics tool, with which they acknowledge 'bugs' that can reflect seasonal quirks, and that is in turn based on Facebook's own advertising metrics tool. At their most dramatic, this data shows a drop of 6m users in the US between the beginning and end of May 2011, dropping to 149.4m. \"From time to time, we see stories about Facebook losing users in some regions,\" said Facebook in a statement, also referring to a similar post a year ago and another two years ago. \"Some of these reports use data extracted from our advertising tool, which provides broad estimates on the reach of Facebook ads and isn't designed to be a source for tracking the overall growth of Facebook. \"We are very pleased with our growth and with the way people are engaged with Facebook. More than 50% of our active users log on to Facebook in any given day.\" More interestingly, the latest biannual collage of ramshackle data by Italian blogger Vincenzo Cosenza has produced some delightful Risk-esque maps of the world's biggest social networking trends. Consenza's first-past-the-post system doesn't even give Twitter a look in on its colour-coded maps, but the most interesting trend is the consolidation of sites in a relatively short space of time. In June 2009 he mapped 17 social networks dominating their local markets - in just two years that had dropped to 9 as Facebook became more and more popular. This data is based on combined Alexa and Google Trends for Websites data, which makes Facebook as the most popular social network in 119 of 134 countries.",
