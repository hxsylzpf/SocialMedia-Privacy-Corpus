The newspaper will challenge all aspects of Mr Justice Morland's decision, which was handed down in March. Ms Campbell was awarded \u00a33,500 damages in March after the Mirror published details of her treatment at Narcotics Anonymous. \"We believe that the judge's ruling was fundamentally flawed and should be overturned. We will also be contesting his decision to award Miss Campbell her legal costs,\" said a statement from Trinity Mirror. The editor of the Daily Mirror, Piers Morgan, said in May when the paper won the right to appeal that he was keen to contest the ruling as there were \"important issues at stake\". \"We were very surprised a judge could say someone had lied on oath and still make us pay their costs, especially when everyone knew she had lied,\" Morgan said. Ms Campbell claimed she felt \"shocked, angry, betrayed and violated\" by an article in February 2001 that was accompanied by photos of her leaving an NA meeting in King's Road in London. The compensation included \u00a32,500 for breach of confidentiality and breach of duty under the data protection act 1998 because the paper claimed that she was seeking treatment at a specialist clinic. Ms Campbell won an additional \u00a31,000 in aggravated damages over a subsequent column by Sue Carroll that compared the 31-year-old to a \"chocolate soldier\". The model, born in Streatham, south London, did not pursue her claim for infringement of privacy after a court decided she had been \"misleading the public by her denials of drug addiction\" and the Mirror \"was fully entitled to put the record straight\".",
