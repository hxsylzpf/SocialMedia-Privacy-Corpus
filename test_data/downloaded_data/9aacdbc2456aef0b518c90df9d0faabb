Despite blurring her face, her car registration number and house were clearly recognisable in the photo, negating any attempts at anonymisation. The Quebec court ruled that the woman's privacy had been invaded and that she'd experienced a loss of personal dignity after facing a barrage of sexual harassment after the picture was published. Privacy is a difficult topic for science and technology policymakers to grapple with, both viciously complex and floatingly abstract. The generally accepted definition of privacy is the \"right to be let alone\". In contemporary policy circles, however, this definition bumps up against further issues around what constitutes public or private space; and a need to protect the integrity of the body. As the Google case indicates, data protection is not the sole issue that privacy policy has to deal with: privacy of behaviour and action; communication. \"Body characteristics\" (biometrics) also come into play. Technologies that collect, process, store and disseminate personal data are developing rapidly and becoming ubiquitous: think of the fitness tracker that knows rather a lot about where you go running; or the social network platform that can link together tagged pictures of your face with details of where you went to school. Technology moves quickly, but policy can take an agonisingly long time to come into being. In Europe and elsewhere, wonks have been hard-pushed to keep abreast with the changing potential risks around fundamental rights to privacy that arise from increasing surveillance. In January 2012, the European Commission proposed a reform of data protection, which was adopted by the European parliament just over a year later. Assuming that the Council and parliament agree on what they actually want to do, it will be adopted as law in 2015. As part of the discussions around them, the Committee on Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) have argued that any regulations need to strengthen citizens' rights, and restore trust around digital technologies. The reforms themselves, however, still tackle only one aspect of the challenges around data and privacy. Their focus is on mandatory impact assessment of the potential risks that new technologies might create \u2013 but the only risk that it assesses is data protection. The impact assessment therefore becomes a box ticking exercise, under which a company must state that it complies with data protection principles, but little else. Other risks that might come into play, for example, wider privacy and human rights concerns, such as the right to not be discriminated against, are ignored. To get to grips with the surveillance risks that emergent technologies carry, policymakers need to broaden their scope of what privacy is. Rather than solely focusing on data, impact assessments need to address the range of privacy issues that emerge when new technologies, products and services are developed \u2013 who might be affected by privacy or surveillance risks, and how they might be harmed. For example, emerging technologies such as drones bring up a host of privacy issues that extend beyond data collection to encompass data processing, the potential for private space to become public, to infringe on bodily privacy (eg an image captured in someone's garden while they're sunbathing). These interventions need to dive into the heart of the process of technological development: more than the basic tick-box compliance, but tools that can actually alter the pathway of the technologies being assessed. Privacy by Design is one example of a process which when implemented from the start of a project, at the design stage of a technology, can bring improvements in this area. Impact assessments need to be mandatory, with non-compliant organisations facing stringent penalties. In an era of increasingly complex and convoluted mass surveillance systems, some argue that \"privacy is dead\", impossible to protect in the face of rapid technological advancements. Yet the problems lie in the framing of policy frameworks, not in the technologies themselves. In order to protect citizens' privacy, policymakers need to look beyond a narrow focus on data protection to unpick what is really considered to be intrusive and a risk, and how people might be harmed. There are broader issues and fundamental rights at stake, and a good privacy impact assessment needs to address all types of privacy.",
