  "content": "I've been playing with PeerIndex, a new Twitter authority ranking tool that's the latest project of former Reuters innovation boss Azeem Azhar. As Robert wrote on paidContent:UK yesterday, PeerIndex seems the latest in a series of ideas concerned with ranking and contextualising comment in the social media space. In a freemium style, Azeem will hope that it will be widely used by the masses and paid-for, through a more detailed version, by brands and agencies looking to identify and target real 'influencers'. Plenty of work to be done though, not least filtering out the fakers; Sergey Brinn [sic] is ranked at 11/100, 'Steve Ballmer' ranks at 43 but Steve Jobs isn't listed at all. Apparently you're no-one without an active Twitter profile. These 'analytical' tools appeal to our egos and our professional competitiveness, but properly assessing someone's influence requires more than an algorithm. It's an area Azhar has been preoccupied with for a while and is not an easy nut to crack. But it does show that there is a role for human editors, after all.",
