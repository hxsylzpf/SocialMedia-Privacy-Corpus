  "content": "Britain is not a police state, but it is disturbing that what would once have been crushingly obvious needs spelling out today. A government too sure of its own benevolence has repeatedly given public authorities new powers over the private realm. Often well-intentioned, the cumulative effect of such moves - taken together with new technologies which make prying and spying easier - have created a climate in which former law lords, attorney generals and public prosecutors are all speaking out against the creep of surveillance. The cause of the anxiety is neatly encapsulated in one clause of a law presently before parliament. Clause 152 of the coroners and justice bill paves the way for ministries to pass personal data they hold between themselves, in the name of securing \"a relevant policy objective\". If the Pensions Service passed its address book to the culture department, for example, that might mean more old people would get help with switching to digital television. It is flagrantly unreasonable to object to this and other examples of \"relevant policy objectives\" which ministers highlight. The difficulty is that the thick fog of this vaguest of phrases could conceal all manner of sins. These columns have already warned of the dangers of data sharing being extended to medical records, and as the Guardian reports this morning a new paper by the former GCHQ chief Sir David Omand gives new reasons to be fearful. Sir David strikes a thoughtful tone, admitting that digging into \"people's secrets is going to involve breaking everyday moral rules\", but insisting that with terror suspects such breaches of decency are a lesser evil than the alternative of riding roughshod over their fundamental rights. That has to be right, but he also admits that the intelligence services are likely to be delving into the phone records, airline bookings and bank transactions \"of the innocent as well as the suspect\" using modern \"data mining\" techniques. Sir David acknowledges the need for safeguards, writing with an admirable frankness that would not be an option for a serving security mandarin. His concern is national security as a whole, rather than data sharing, but if the tentacles of surveillance could act in concert right across Whitehall then privacy could be throttled. As things stand, Clause 152 is drafted in such sweeping terms that it is unclear even whether the public would know which organisations are swapping information about them. Yesterday it was no libertarian but the former home secretary David Blunkett who called for the wording of the law to be looked at again. If ministers do not amend it now, the public will be right to assume the worst.",
