  "content": "It depends. If you open enough of it up, then certainly. However, mystery surrounds the claim made on a ZDNet blog that a Mac mini that is online (see http://tinyurl.com/mcdcd) and offering user logins to all and sundry was taken over by a hacker called \"gwerdna\", who said the machine was \"easy pickings\" and that becoming the superuser (or \"root\") had taken about 30 minutes, using \"unpublished exploits - of which there are a lot for Mac OSX\" (http://tinyurl.com/qmefr). Except ... the box's owner hasn't confirmed it happened. And the situation is unusual, because not many people wander around asking everyone to hack into their computer. As one Slashdot poster noted, it's the computing equivalent of locking someone in your basement to see if they can get access to your house. In OS X, it's known you can. However, Dave Schroeder, a systems administrator at Wisconsin University, set up a challenge at http://test.doit.wisc.edu/ - also running on a Mac mini. But he isn't giving away user accounts. The challenge (to alter the page) ends tomorrow; at the time of writing, the page was unedited. This test is more like most hacking attacks coming via a network - the equivalent of challenging a burglar to break into a house. But just as we saw, a few weeks ago, a rash of malware for Mac OS X (http://tinyurl.com/pkldh), so this week has brought three tales of OS X security challenges. The third is the most interesting: according to a Security Focus News article from last month (http://tinyurl.com/q9vu8), a security researcher at the ShmooCon hacker conference in January found his Powerbook running OS X had had its firewall disabled and a file server set up - on a machine that had been \"hardened\" against hacking . The researcher suggested that an as-yet undocumented weakness in OS X was used - yet confusingly told Security Focus News that \"this was not a subtle hack\". Perhaps that's because the hacker boasted about the hack to a researcher's friends, using data from the computer. It's also possible the exploit was fixed in Apple's latest security update, issued on March 1, which closed a number of holes (http://tinyurl.com/p3vot). But we'll probably never know. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com",
