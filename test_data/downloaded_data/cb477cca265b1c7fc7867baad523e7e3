Akkaradet Eiamsuwan, 24, was found guilty of violating Thailand's lese majeste law, which punishes anyone who defames, insults or threatens the monarchy. The judge said Akkaradet had used an alias to post the message about the king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, on Facebook in March. The original sentence of five years was reduced because Akkaradet confessed to the offence. He has been in jail since his arrested in Bangkok in June. Source: AFP/AP via Deutsche Welle",
