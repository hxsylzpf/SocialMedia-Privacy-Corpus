  "content": "Why do you take pictures? My question isn't do you take pictures, because it's 2014 and you're a person on the internet, so I know your phone is full of all sorts of images \u2013 your new shoes, the clouds outside your last flight, your kids, your cat, the foam in your coffee. It's all there \u2013 even if the the only difference between Sunday's coffee and Monday's latte is the glaring barista in the background. And who sees those pictures? If you're like me, it depends on where you post them: on Facebook, my dad's sister sees my new haircut; on Twitter, 4,000 people get a passing glimpse of the drink I had at the end of a long day. But sometimes there's a photograph that really matters \u2013 often because it's one I'm really proud of taking, or one that I want to elevate above the ephemeral stream that I'll forget about by the end of the day. Those photos go on Flickr. They have since back in 2005, when I joined the original online photo-sharing service because, hey, I needed somewhere to host my LiveJournal pics. My photos that matter kept going on Flickr, even when it seemed like everyone else had left me alone in a big old empty house as Instagram came along. Flickr was \u2013 and occasionally still is \u2013 my home base on the internet. But the beloved and occasionally beleaguered photo site made news recently when its parent company, Yahoo, announced a scheme to start selling framed copies of photos taken by some users \u2013 and keep the profits for itself. The internet outrage machine kicked in ... even though Yahoo was doing absolutely nothing wrong. After all, the photos the company is selling had been explicitly licensed for sale by the people who took them. But Yahoo hasn't always taken good care of Flickr, and because of that, cries of \"Hey, don't rip me off!\" quickly escalated beyond grumblings to the pages of the Wall Street Journal, where a retired English teacher said she was \"ticked off\". Flickr users are a passionate and nostalgic bunch, and we have spent the better part of a decade on edge talking about the good old days. We're on a bit of a hair trigger. \"I think it really came down to the fact that it was Yahoo behind this, and Yahoo has been shorthand for 'undermining the Flickr community' basically since they purchased the site\" in 2004, said Parker Higgins, a copyright specialist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Higgins was among the leading voices on Twitter this month telling outraged Flickr users to take a step back and calm down. \"I guess it really just comes down to feelings, though. If somebody that wasn't Yahoo started selling prints, I don't think it would be perceived as a 'rip-off' or anything like that.\" A few years ago, I stopped using Flickr almost entirely, because it seemed like Flickr had stopped loving its users back. And I wasn't alone. When Marissa Mayer took over Yahoo in 2012, we greeted her with a campaign outright begging her to make Flickr great again. And she did! The next year saw a fantastically useful redesign of Flickr.com, followed by an app that more than earned its spot on my phone's home screen. It's obvious now there are people at Flickr \u2013 and Yahoo \u2013 who care about photography. Zack Sheppard was a community manager at Flickr during the years it was the center of my life. He moderated the user help forums, which included \"helping massage the rules, deciding what happens when someone breaks the rules\". We talked the other day about what makes the Flickr community so special. \"That first fave,\" he said, describing what got him \u2013 and me \u2013 hooked on Flickr. Facebook has likes, Instagram has hearts, Twitter has faves, but Flickr had them first \u2013 someone out there telling you: That thing you put out there in the world? That meant something to someone. Flickr made a lot of us better photographers. The site's coming of age paralleled the rise of digital photography, and as we tinkered with our fancy new cameras, we sought out people who could help. We found Flickr and its groups, filled in equal measure with people who were just starting out and people who were once beginners, too, and were more than willing to help us learn. Those groups are the one thing a site like Instagram will never have: not just people out there putting a heart on your latest coffee foam (which is still a little overkill), but an actual place where you can go and ask to look at your work and help you make it better. Interested in, say, learning how to take better street photographs \u2013 or debating the ethics of shooting strangers? Meet the dozens of Flickr groups that exist for that very purpose. The Flickr guidelines, which gave advice on what to post and how to deal with abuse, are a work of art for their simplicity and straight-forwardness. On Twitter or Facebook, we'd be spared so much agony if a moderator was there to swat down offenders \u00e0 la Flickr: \"Don't Be Creepy: You know the guy. Don't be that guy.\" My entire online existence these days is largely characterized by attempting to avoid \"that guy\" \u2013 and it's been far more difficult than those days when the bulk of my online social interactions took place on Flickr. I attended my first Flickr meetup back in 2008, at a bar in Washington DC. The connections I made there swiftly transcended photography, evolving from online to real-life friendships \u2013 the kinds people make on Twitter these days, even if Twitter is \"ruining\" that, too. Since then, we've attended each others' weddings, gone on vacations together, celebrated life's milestones together. When I think of my years in DC, I can't think of a single friendship that didn't at least originate from someone I met at a Flickr meetup. \"I have a lot of old web nostalgia but Flickr may be the most intense,\" EFF's Higgins told me. Writing this story, I've spent more time on Flickr in the last few days than I have in months, and I feel the same way. But the thing about that nostalgia is that, even with 10 years of Yahoo missteps, Flickr is still out there. And that still means something.",
