  "content": "Republican governor Scott Walker's campaign may not quite be ready for the 2016 presidential election, but it is in great shape for when the 2112 campaign rolls around. In a tweet sent out from the Wisconsin governor's Twitter account on Wednesday afternoon, Walker's campaign wrote: \"It's hard to believe that it has been 505 years since the first settlers arrived at Jamestown.\" Jamestown, Virginia, was actually settled in 1607, which was only 408 years ago. The 505th anniversary of the first permanent English settlement in North America will in fact be held in 2112. James Horn, the president of Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation, told the Guardian: \"It's always gratifying to hear our politicians referencing the early history of our country and, in this case, the founding of Jamestown.\" He added: \"I am sure that on reflection Governor Walker will recall that Jamestown was founded in 1607 which is 408 years ago.\" The Walker campaign made clear that the tweet came from \"Team Walker\" but did not respond to further request for comment on how the erroneous tweet was posted Wednesday afternoon. They did acknowledge the error in a later tweet. The nascent presidential campaign of the Wisconsin governor, who has not yet declared he is running for president, has been plagued by gaffes so far. Walker has compared Isis to pro-union protesters in his home state, and dodged a question on evolution by saying: \"I'm going to punt on that one.\" The mathematical mistake does at least raise awareness of the often-neglected colony at Jamestown. While Thanksgiving commemorates the Pilgrims' settlement of Plymouth 13 years later, Jamestown occupies a far less central place in American historical memory. The colony was plagued by famine and Indian attacks throughout much of its early history and was salvaged only by the introduction of tobacco as a cash crop.",
