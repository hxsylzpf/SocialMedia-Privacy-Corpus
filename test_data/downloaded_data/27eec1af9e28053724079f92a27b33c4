FarmVille, a \"social game\" available on Facebook, is dividing opinion across the web as users and pundits flock to criticise its somewhat cynical nature and praise its unprecedented success. Since its release in June, nearly 60 million people have downloaded the application \u2013 a similar figure to the number of Wiis sold to date across the world. The object of the game is simple \u2013 to plant crops, and harvest them. Many users on the game's Facebook page claim to find the process both satisfying and addictive. The secret of its success is that to accessorise your farm, or expand it in size, you must persuade other friends to join the community \u2013 and pay actual money if you want to receive the most exciting farm upgrades. Michael Arrington, founder of the Techcrunch blog, has led the charge of the critics, condemning the game's developer, Zynga, for supposedly underhanded attempts to extract real money from users. For about \u00a330, you can purchase 70,000 \"farm coins\" or 240 notes of \"farm cash\". While the coins are relatively easy to accumulate, you receive farm cash only when you level up \u2013 which can take a couple of days' clicking. There's a strong temptation for hardcore users to skip the hard work and hand over credit card details. If you do choose to take this shortcut, a 2D sprite of a manor or pagoda building can grace your farm for the equivalent of about \u00a35. The worry is, of course, that children or vulnerable users may get hooked, and splurge on beautifying their farm while, in material terms, they will be paying for nothing. This sort of virtual transaction has been around for years in the online gaming community. FarmVille is simply the first game to present so many people beyond the world of MMORPGs (massive multiplayer online role-playing games) and Second Life with such an opportunity. Zynga's claim that a third of its revenue comes from such transactions suggests that regular folk are far more likely to be willing to pay for these sort of virtual commodities than anyone previously realised. While the appeal of what amounts to little more than an online chore may be lost on many of us, it indicates a huge area of untapped potential for online leisure time and spending. FarmVille isn't something you can invest an evening in, but as devotees of the likes of Solitaire and Minesweeper will tell you, it's often the games you can dip into for five minutes at a time (often while at work) that prove the most popular. In fact, FarmVille isn't really a game at all. It's an online hobby, and has far more in common with knitting or gardening than a first-person shooter. But if someone took the social side of FarmVille, and coupled it with something as challenging and rewarding as Sim City or Civilisation (an incarnation of which is due to appear on Facebook next year) we could well find a new era of games played and enjoyed by almost everybody. Who knows, one day we may well look back on FarmVille as a pioneer.",
