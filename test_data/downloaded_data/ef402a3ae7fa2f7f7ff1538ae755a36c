  "content": "\"Social justice groups everywhere are using new technologies to fundamentally change society,\" says Africa blogger Minna Salami. Salami, better known online as MsAfropolitan, points to the success of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign in raising global awareness about the kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls, which forced the Nigerian government to take action. \"Women are challenging the status quo, shaping the narrative, connecting to one another and ignoring those who condemn their rising voices,\" she says. Others, though, are not so sure: real change takes place on the streets and in the corridors of power, they argue. Anything else is just \"slacktivism\". At this weekend's Africa Utopia festival on London's Southbank \u2013 and as part of our A week in Africa series \u2013 we'll be discussing these issues in a special Guardian debate featuring Salami, Soas academic Emma Dabiri (aka @TheDiasporaDiva) and Ugandan gay rights campaigner Melissa Kiguwa, chaired by the Guardian's assistant comment editor Joseph Harker. We'll be looking at the possibilities and limits of digital activism and asking: \"Can the hashtag transform Africa?\" The debate takes place on Friday 11 September at 1.45pm. More details here",
