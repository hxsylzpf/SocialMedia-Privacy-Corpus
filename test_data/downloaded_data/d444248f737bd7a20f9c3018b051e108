  "content": "A meeting of Snapchat evangelists held in the heart of London's hipster Silicon Roundabout district could have been ripe for mockery. And there was a lot of social media buzzwordery, with popular Snapchatters, brands and ad agencies talking about how the social app is evolving. Most of the Snapchat users at SnapHappen \u2013 an independent event not organised by Snapchat itself \u2013 describe themselves as \"storytellers\" and \"great artists\", even those whose stories are bro-tastic vlogs or top-five listicle videos, and whose art is often promotional content for brands. The first mention of \"thinking out of the box\" came after 10am, but it wasn't the last unfortunate quote. \"I'm what you call a predator: producer, director, editor,\" said social star Julius Deinwith an admirably straight face. \"There isn't a single person on this planet that doesn't live their lives fully on Facebook,\" said social media consultant Chris Kubbernus, perhaps forgetting that more than five billion people don't use the social network. Sceptics write off Snapchat as a morass of empty self-publicists whose content is driven by their desire for ultimately meaningless social signals. It's a generational shift, Kubbernus said. \"Our parents lived in the generation of the cold war, a generation of surveillance, and communism was lurking. They were wary of being bugged,\" he added. \"Our generation is 'bugged' when we're NOT surveilled \u2013 when we don't get the likes, when we don't get people looking at us. And that's a total generational shift.\" \"If Laurel and Hardy were 16 years old right now, would they not have started their art, their talent, their creativity on Snapchat, or Vine?\" said Ben White of NMCN, a company that matches brands with social influencers. \"We would never refer to them as an 'influencer' or a 'creator'. We talk about them as writers, actors, directors. Comedy geniuses.\" He added that for illustrators, comics, magicians and many others, Snapchat is just a platform for talent. Yusuf Omar, mobile editor for the Hindustan Times, urged the audience to \"look beyond the gimmicks... look beyond the doggy tongue [filter] and see how you can tell the sexual abuse story.\" An eyebrow-raising quote, but he said Snapchat can be used to distribute serious journalism. Omar used Snapchat to interview survivors of sexual abuse in India, using the app's comic lenses \u2013 digital masks superimposed on the face of the person being filmed \u2013 used to conceal their identities. His team also distribute pieces made on Snapchat to other social media platforms. \"Pieces produced entirely on a phone get four times more views than pieces produced on DLSRs and other equipment,\" he said. \"The storytellers on mobile phones are thinking about how that [mobile] audience wants to digest that content. When you produce content on a mobile, you start thinking about that.\" Social media encourages more positive stories, Omar said. \"Good news is driving traffic infinitely more. People want stories of hope and aspiration.\" SnapHappen showcased some persuasive arguments for the significance of this social app with its 150 million-plus active users. Some have created quirky digital art using the app's limited set of tools, embellishing photos using Snapchat's doodle tool, or creating stop-motion animation where viewers tap through each frame themselves. \"Snapchat doesn't make it easy for its creators. It's full of limitations and obstacles that we have to overcome, like 10-second video limits and viewers tapping through your stories,\" said Snapchatter Tristan \"TristanTales\" De Burgh. Norwegian artist Geir \"Geeohsnap\" Pedersen's Random People project augments photos of strangers in public with his own characters and digital props, making sure to obscure their faces to preserve their privacy. Like other artists, he is finding an audience on Snapchat as well as on other social apps such as Instagram. He's less a \"Snapchatter\" than a talented illustrator who happens to have found his path to prominence on an un-traditional medium. \"Snapchat is for curious people. When you go into Snapchat for the first time, you have to explore the app a lot. It's not very user-friendly,\" he said. \"My content really fits for a Snapchat channel because people are curious about how I'm doing this.\" Other Snapchatters are making money by partnering with brands. Each speaker had a long list of partners to mention: Disney, Nintendo, 20th-Century Fox, Coca-Cola, Red Bull, AT&amp;T, General Electric, Gucci, Microsoft, Hyundai and Starbucks. Brands offer creators the surest way of making money from the app, but there have been some clumsy examples of brand partnerships on YouTube, Instagram and other social services. \"I've said no to some brands because they want to promote, promote, promote, promote... I would probably lose most of my fans,\" said Pedersen. \"You have to do it in a creative, storytelling way.\" \"Creators are people, not billboards,\" White said. \"When you come as an advertiser, you can't just go in and say 'you've got to put this on your Snapchat and push this message. If you do, once that campaign's over, you're left with a loss of fans.\". Two things seem to be holding back any deluge of marketing dollars for Snapchatters: the infamous lack of metrics on Snapchat, including how many followers a star has, and how many times their stories have been viewed. \"You can work with that if it's an experimental budget. It'll be fine, nobody cares!\" said Thomas Hansen, CEO of Snaplytics, one of the startups trying to plug the gap in Snapchat public analytics. \"But once you move in to real content and a real budget, you have to show the CMO [chief marketing officer] what you spent the time doing. After the month is up, did the video do good? Snapchat is not really a scalable channel as it is.\" \"The beauty of Snapchat is the rawness of the content,\" said Ben Anderson, who advises brands and musicians on using Snapchat. \"If you look at Instagram, it's a polished, artistic platform, but Snapchat works for brands or people who want to do stuff that is creative and throwaway.\" That rawness may be the is another thing holding brands back from spending big money on Snapchatters. \"Some brands quickly went to Instagram stories because it was comfortable. It wasn't dick pics,\" Kubbernus said. \"There's this big stigma in the industry that Snapchat is rogue.\" he continued. \"This is why brands are dying in this age, because they're playing it safe. They think they can remove all the risk and get all the upside.\" Snapchat is working hard to convince the media and advertising industries that it is a safe place to shift their marketing budgets to. But some creators feel that Snapchat sees them as more annoyance than asset, reflected in issues like the lack of analytics and poor features for promoting their accounts. \"I don't know what Snapchat's plans are. They don't work very well with brands, and they don't work very well with influencers, so who knows where it's going,\" said Shonduras. Does Snapchat risk losing the support of its most dedicated users if they don't feel valued by the app? \"Hop on Snapchat now and ride it as well as you can, but don't have that be your entire business plan,\" said Shonduras. \"I pretty much hate everything about Snapchat. It's so hard to grow, they don't feature people, I don't have a profile picture, my content disappears\u2026 but the challenges of Snapchat, that's what makes it fun,\" he said. Yusuf Omar did has best not to drink the Kool-Aid. \"The more 'social media experts' I meet, the more I realise we're just making it up\".",
