No, you've got places to be, people to frag. So we've set up a dedicated Twitter account just for games coverage: @gdngames. It'll tell you when there's something new added on the Guardian's games page - vast globe-spanning thing that it is. So if you want to know when the latest reviews or columns or blogposts are up, it's the one to follow. Enjoy. OK, back to the fragging.",
