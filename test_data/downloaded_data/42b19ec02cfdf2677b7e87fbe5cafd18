  "content": "Police chief Brian Paddick, who pioneered the softly-softly approach to cannabis use in south London, has won \"substantial damages\" and an apology from the Mail on Sunday after it breached his privacy with two \"kiss and tell\" articles. Mr Paddick, who used to work in Lambeth, took the newspaper to court after it published private and confidential information provided by his former lover and ex-fiancee and falsely claimed he took drugs. The settlement has been hailed by Mr Paddick's solictor as a \"nail in the coffin for chequebook journalism\". The two former partners were paid \u00a3100,000 and \u00a36,000 respectively by the paper for their stories. James Renolleau alleged that Mr Paddick allowed him to smoke dope in the couple's flat, and that he had smoked the drug himself. As a result mr Paddick was moved from his job as commander of the London borough but has since been promoted to acting deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police. The allegation was investigated by the police but it was concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute or discipline. Mr Paddick denies ever smoking cannabis and the Mail on Sunday has accepted the allegations were totally false. Mr Paddick will receive \"substantial\" damages from the paper as well as an apology, an undertaking not to repeat the allegations and his legal costs from the Associated Newspapers title. \"I am relieved that the Mail on Sunday have at last seen sense and agreed to apologise,\" said Mr Paddick. \"They now accept that much of the information they printed about my private life should never have been published and that the main allegation against me was false. \"Whilst the press have a right to publish information that is genuinely in the public interest, I have been concerned by the increasing number of articles that unjustifiably include confidential information about people's private lives. \"There has to be a limit to press intrusion and this case helps to draw that line,\" he added. His solicitor, Tamsin Allen of Bindman &amp; Partners, said: \"This was a real privacy case. Mr Paddick is a senior public servant who is entitled to a private life. \"It is highly significant that the Mail on Sunday was not prepared to defend its decision to publish intimate details of his relationship with a previous partner. Their decision represents another nail in the coffin of chequebook journalism.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
