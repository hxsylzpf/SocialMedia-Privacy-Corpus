  "content": "Take an ordinary judge in an English court: say David Eady, master of privacy law. Then take a 47-year-old politician who neither holds office nor is formally seeking it; she's just giving speeches, doing TV, putting bread on the table. But here comes a book declaring she had a one-night stand with a basketball player, snorted coke, and slept with her hubby's business partner two decades ago. Well, judge? It's an open and shut case on the Strand: reach for the superinjunction. But because Sarah Palin is over there, not over here, it doesn't happen \u2013 and she's plastered on front pages around the world. Fair? Unfair? Discuss. But don't forget globalisation is just one click away across any border.",
