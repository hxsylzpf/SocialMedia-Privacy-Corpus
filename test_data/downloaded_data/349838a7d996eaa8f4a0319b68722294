In its submission to a panel of MPs considering privacy and media intrusion, the society said the press complaints commission had replaced a system that was failing both the press and the public because it \"had the respect of neither\". And it said the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport's inquiry would demonstrate that the PCC's code of conduct was effective. \"We welcome the select committee's inquiry because we believe it will show how the current system of self-regulation of newspapers and magazines through the editors' code and the press complaints commission is effective, efficient and accessible to ordinary people,\" said the society in its submission to the investigation. \"Since it was created it has improved the conduct of the press in both the national and regional press. \"It replaced a system that was failing both the press and the public because it had the respect of neither. The code of practice was a fundamentally important initiative because, for the first time it set out principles and practical guidelines to which editors and journalists could work.\" The PCC was set up in 1991 - replacing the press council - to provide a speedy, accessible and economic route for members of the public to complain about their representation in newspapers While the society - whose 400 plus members are drawn from the ranks of editors and senior executives on regional and national newspapers - recognises that some legal restrictions on the press are necessary, for example in court reporting, it thinks that imposing new laws would be a retrograde step. \"The code and the PCC system helps editors to deal with complaints that inevitably arise from time to time. It is especially helpful because it enables prompt response without the need to resort to expensive legal advice. Other regulatory systems are expensive, sometimes prohibitively so,\" argued the society in its submission. Other regulatory systems, such as those governing the broadcasting industry, can be \"long-winded\", the society added, in an implied reference to the suggestion that the new super-media watchdog Ofcom might be given a greater role in monitoring the newspaper industry. In contrast the PCC's ability to hand out \"informal\" advice and publish decisions and commentaries regularly make it more \"dynamic\", the society said. More than 90% of complaints to the PCC come from \"ordinary\" people, while only a handful are from celebrities, a factor of particular interest to the inquiry, which is focusing on those \"who are not usually in the limelight\". \"The evidence is that those so-called ordinary people seem satisfied with the system,\" said the society. \"That said, it is the high-profile cases, including those involving politicians, that cause the biggest fuss and lead to questions about the complaints system.\" The Commons select committee will look at issues surrounding privacy in both the press and broadcasting, and decide whether to bring in new legislation or to appoint a press ombudsman. In its submission, the society argued that \"journalistic and commercial competitiveness ensures that the system is neither cosy nor self-serving\" and presents the alternatives to the PCC in a less than favourable light. \"A state funded press ombudsman would be seen as a first step to government censorship, while a privacy law would only be enforceable by the rich and privileged,\" it said. \"A statutory system would struggle to achieve such a balance and would not be acceptable because the motives behind it would continually be subjected to question and criticism by both the press and the public.\"",
