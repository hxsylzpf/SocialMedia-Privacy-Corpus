  "content": "There are many good reasons for not having your boss as a Facebook friend, and Sydney call centre worker Kyle Doyle has just discovered the most convincing of them all. An email exchange between the 21-year-old and his boss has become a viral sensation in the past couple of days, readers wincing in sympathy as Doyle's insistence he missed a day of work through genuine illness is demolished when the manager points out an incriminating Facebook entry. The brief status update, dated for the day he called in ill, is simple and to the point: Kyle Doyle is not going to work, fuck it I'm still trashed. SICKIE WOO! The emails begin with a manager at Doyle's workplace, phone company AAPT, asking the supposedly sick employee for a doctor's certificate. Doyle refuses, saying he is \"on leave for medical reasons\". \"My leave was due to medical reasons, so you cannot deny leave based on a line manager's discretion, with no proof,\" he argues in a second message. The manager's reply is brief: \"I believe the proof that you are after is below\". Pasted underneath is the incriminating Facebook update. The email exchange was soon doing the rounds of Sydney's office buildings and has now been passed on worldwide. A spokesman for AAPT told Sydney's Daily Telegraph that the company was looking into the matter: It's unfortunate because it was in the public domain. It involves one of our employees and we're doing an internal investigation, but I can't comment any further because of the nature of what it's about. Are you a company manager with a Facebook account? Don't be offended if you suddenly lose a lot of workplace friends in the coming weeks.",
