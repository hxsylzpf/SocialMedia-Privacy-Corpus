  "content": "It's been a busy time for Simon Amstell. He has performed at a comedy festival in Australia, the second series of Grandma's House has just arrived on our TV screens, and Numb, his tour of the UK, is about to begin. I thought it might be a good time for Simon to get some feedback from his long-time co-writer Dan Swimer and his psychotherapist/author friend Philippa Perry. Luckily, they both happened to be at one of his final warm-up gigs, and were happy to give a brief analysis of the performance. I asked Dan if he had been following Simon's progress on Twitter, to which the response was not entirely positive. It turns out that he unfollowed him, by accident. I tried to get him to follow me there and then, and he assured me that he would, later. Philippa is a natural tweeter: honest, entertaining, confiding, informative \u2013 all the things that I hoped Simon's Twitter timeline would turn out to be. Having said that, he is now up to 55 tweets. I didn't think he'd make it. In the next instalment, Project Amstell begins to tie up its loose ends. I am hoping that some of my Simon-inspired artwork may feature.
