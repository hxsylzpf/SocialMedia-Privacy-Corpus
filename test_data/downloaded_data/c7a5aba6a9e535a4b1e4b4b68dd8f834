  "content": "The tune Facebook chose to play at the end of Mark Zuckerberg's speech today said it all: Coldplay's 'When I Rule the World'. While Coldplay doesn't have much of a chance ruling anything, Facebook might be onto something. The annual F8 developer conference has become the event when the founder and chief executive takes to the stage and (generally) delights developers by revealing the most major and strategic improvements to the site. He also talks about the 'social graph' a lot. Much of today's announcements were leaked before the event, but there was something interesting kept under wraps; Facebook Presence. This was presented as a bit of a gimmick to the developers and journalists at F8, giving each of them a Facebook RFID tag that they could use to 'check-in' at points around the conference venue. Those check-ins would give them access to a certain Facebook page or a photobooth. Sound familiar? It may be an extended version of a toy at Facebook HQ, as TechCrunch explained, but it is also Facebook starting to mark out its turf in location services. No-one's suggesting that Facebook is about to issue its 400 million users with a check-in dogtag, but still. It's the conspicuous missing piece in the Facebook offering so far, and why many were surprised there wasn't something more formal announced today. Foursquare should make hay while the sun is still shining a little... or maybe try and sort that Yahoo acquisition before it's too late? Photo by _M-j-H_ on Flickr. Some rights reserved",
