  "content": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, has defended police attempts to force the Guardian and Observer newspapers to hand over any emails or notes they may have relating to the former MI5 officer, David Shayler. He also says the courts must balance journalistic freedom with other interests recognised by the European human rights convention. However, he makes no mention of the special importance attached to freedom of expression in the data protection and human rights acts. It is unusual for a home secretary to comment on a case while it is before the courts. Mr Straw has done so in a letter to Richard Burden, Labour MP for Birmingham Northfield, who raised the case in response to concern expressed by a constituent, a member of the National Union of Journalists. Mr Burden drew the home secretary's attention to a Commons motion signed by over 40 MPs of all parties expressing concern at \"the assault on independent journalism represented by the attempt to intimidate the Guardian, the Observer, and the reporter Martin Bright, by obtaining orders under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to force them to surrender information relating to contacts with David Shayler, which was either in the public domain or has been supplied to ministers by Mr Shayler himself\". The two newspapers have been given leave by the high court to challenge an order by an Old Bailey judge forcing them to hand over any emails or notes they may have relating to Mr Shayler. Mr Straw says in his letter that he cannot comment on particulars surrounding the case. However, he goes on to describe powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act which enable the courts to issue production orders. \"Failure to comply with a production order will leave it open for the judge to punish the person concerned for contempt,\" adds Mr Straw. He refers to article 10 of the European convention covering freedom of expression but stresses that this principle can be subject to restrictions \"necessary in a democratic society\". Concern that these restrictions could be interpreted too broadly by English judges led the government to agree to amendments in the Human Rights Act - which comes into force on October 2 - and the new Data Protection Act. The first states that courts \"must have particular regard to the importance of the convention right to freedom of expression\" as well as to \"journalistic material\". The second refers to \"the special importance of the public interest in freedom of expression\". The Commons motion calls on ministers to \"restrain proceedings against journalists and ensure that the orders against the Guardian, the Observer and Mr Bright are withdrawn and that no charges are laid against them ... under the official secrets act.\" Signatories to the motion, drafted by the Labour MP Austin Mitchell, include the Tory MP Nicholas Winterton, the Liberal Democrat MPs Malcolm Bruce and Mike Hancock, the Plaid Cymru leader Dafydd Wigley, and the Labour chairman of the Commons public administration committee, Tony Wright. The motion also refers to Julie Ann Davies, a student at Kingston university, west London, arrested under the secrets act and now on police bail. All these actions, it says, were taken to \"suppress legitimate inquiries in the public interest\". The Guardian and Observer argue that the police have no need to see any material the newspapers may have, not least because Mr Shayler has himself repeatedly and openly admitted disclosing information about the activities of MI5 and MI6.",
