  "content": "Lawyers representing the woman at the centre of the allegations about David Blunkett's private life have asked the Press Complaints Commission to step in to prevent newspapers harassing her and her family. Her solicitor Jonathan Coad, of the Simkins Partnership, has written to the Press Complaints Commission to express concern about possible \"physical harassment\" of the woman after she was identified in newspapers yesterday. The woman and her family are said to have been \"besieged\" by journalists since her identity was revealed in yesterday's Sun. The allegations about the home secretary's private life first appeared in the Sun's sister paper, the News of the World, on Sunday. Mr Coad said today he was \"working with the Press Complaints Commission to prevent the physical harassment of her and her family\". In a statement released yesterday, Mr Coad said the woman had \"no comment to make on the recent speculation in the media about her private life\". \"She asks the media to respect the privacy of herself, her immediate family and her extended family, and will not hesitate to take action in respect of intrusive media coverage of her private life,\" it continued. A PCC spokesman said the watchdog had \"received notice of concerns and passed them on [to newspaper editors]\". \"No formal complaint has been lodged. We have received letters from her solicitors and are acting on them. We are dealing with the matter in the way we normally do... We try to help sort out any possible problems in advance,\" he said. Clause four of the PCC's code of practice states that journalists \"must not engage in intimidation, harassment or persistent pursuit\". It adds: \"Editors must ensure these principles are observed by those working for them and take care not to use non-compliant material from other sources.\" Exceptions to the code are allowed when it can be \"shown to be in the public interest\". These include \"detecting or exposing crime or serious impropriety; protecting public health and safety; preventing the public from being misled by an action or statement of an individual or an organisation\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
