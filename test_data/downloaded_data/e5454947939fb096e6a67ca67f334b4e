This time around, neither the BBC's rolling news channel nor Sky News has broken through in the same way. That's possibly because the 2015 campaign has itself been so very dull \u2013 but it's also a vivid reminder of the news channels' struggle for attention in a world of Twitter, Buzzfeed and Periscope. As a result, journalists on both TV news channels are dogged by disruptive digital-driven reorganisations. Their management teams, bewitched by iPad apps, speak of \"all platforms being equal\", and of the danger in treating news channels as \"some separate legacy product, like Windows 95\". What that means on the ground at Sky is that all executive producers and the entire planning team \u2013 around 30 editorial staff in total \u2013 have been forced to reapply for a smaller number of jobs. One of them is the executive producer Nick Phipps who, ironically, is in charge of Sky's crucial election night coverage. One Sky journalist says \"it's a huge reorganisation, low morale, bad HR management \u2013 but good strategically\", and that many Sky stories get more views on Facebook than on the TV channel. Sky management, by the way, firmly denies rumours that Sky News' budget or headcount is being cut overall \u2013 whether to pay for Stuart Murphy's well-funded Sky entertainment channels, or the breathtakingly costly new Premier League deal. It's a different story at the BBC, where digital ambition is most definitely tempered by cuts. Numerous production jobs will soon go as part of the \"Delivering Quality First\" cuts programme, as well as four on-screen presenter roles. The channel's rolling-news hours are diminishing fast, eaten up by Victoria Derbyshire's unpopular new mid-morning show, dreary repeats of The Travel Show and Click on Sundays, and \u2013 as from June \u2013 even a simulcast of BBC World News's Outside Source in the plum 9pm slot. \"Not so much BBC News 24,\" says one corporation wag, \"as BBC News 11am-to-6pm-on-weekdays\". It is the march of BBC World News \u2013 the corporation's commercially funded English-language TV news station, which airs on cable and satellite around the world outside the UK \u2013 that domestic News channel staffers perhaps fear the most. So far, the \"Bob Crow factor\" has saved the UK channel from merger with its international counterpart (the trade unionist's death was a huge story in Britain, not so much in Bangkok), but insiders fear that it is only a matter of time. And, while the internationalisation of the BBC News channel or the digital fragmentation of Sky News might be inevitable, they could potentially leave big gaps in British TV's capacity to report rolling news \u2013 not least during election campaigns. Privately, a BBC management source insists there is a \"strong commitment\" to the domestic News channel, speaking of a digital \"world of 'and'\", in which the News channel's output complements (and is reused by) the BBC's online services. Yet even when pressed, that source will not predict an independent future for the BBC News channel by 2020. By the time of that next general election, the breakout stardom of not only Kuenssberg but the entire BBC News channel could be gone. \"I just don't think we'll be here,\" says one of the channel's journalists. \"I don't think we'll be here at all.\"",
