  "content": "There have been some tough headlines for the social networking sites this week - not least for Facebook, which was forced into an embarrassing u-turn after attempting rolling in some questionably rights-grabbing terms of use. The site will be more keen to flag up the new anti- bullying initiative signed today with MySpace, Google and the European Union, which is designed to protect the teenagers who make up up sizable chunk of the estimated 42 million monthly European users of social networking sites. Safety can be fun, kids. Photograph: kevindooley/Flickr/Some rights reserved The sites, as part of 17 across Europe, have agreed to some fairly straightforward steps, including introducing a 'report misuse' button where they don't already, and another to alert local authorities of 'inappropriate contact from or conduct by' another user. By default, profiles will have security turned up to 11 for younger users (those under 16, that is) and will be excluded from search engine indexing. All these steps echoes recommendations made by Tanya Byron in her review last year of child safety and online behaviour. These is a voluntary code for sites, and will be rolled out along with an educational campaign for parents and children. EU media commissioner Viviana Reding pointed to research that showed a steady rise in cyber-bullying across Europe, saying that \"social networking has enormous potential to flourish... as long as children and teenagers have the trust and the right tools to remain safe when making new friends and sharing personal details online\". Facebook, MySpace and Bebo all say they have already implemented many safeguards to try and discourage cyber-bullying, which is a far bigger problem that young people being groomed by adults. But in such a sensitive area - and one that presses so many media panic buttons - sites will be falling over themselves to prove they are doing everything they can to make their sites as safe as possible. And that's no small feat when being balanced with a space that teenagers and children want to feel they own, away from prying adult eyes.",
