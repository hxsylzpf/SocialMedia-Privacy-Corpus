  "content": "Another day, another hysterical Twitter story. The Queen is Twittering! Now, I know what you're thinking - that Stephen Fry is already on Twitter and doing very nicely, thank you. But this is about that other Queen, the one with all the palaces and stuff. In what will trigger a new batch of bandwavey news stories on 'that Twitter thing' - as well as giving the Daily Express that Twitter news peg it has been waiting for - the Telegraph proclaimed today that Her Majesty the Queen has \"taken a bold technological step by becoming the first member of the royal family to twitter\". The only problem is that she hasn't. Officials at Westminster Abbey will be twittering during the 60th anniversary Commonwealth Observance on Monday, but they are not representatives of the Queen or the palace. Nice try though, Mandrake. I spoke to the palace press team who said that although they are looking at how Twitter could be used for the royal family's communications, it would probably be members of the press team who posted updates rather than any member of the royal family. \"It would be correct to say we're looking into it, perhaps for another event like the opening of Parliament or horseguards,\" said a spokesman. A trip to twitter.com/thequeen will confirm just 48 followers and no updates, so far. Could I dare to suggest that Twitter might be better suited to the hectic party schedule of the younger members of the Royal family rather than for blow-by-blow updates on regal ceremonies?",
