In the strongest denunciation of the conduct of online advertisers, Meglena Kuneva, the European commissioner for consumer affairs, argued that personal data has become \"the oil of the internet and the new currency of the digital world\". She warned that surfers' privacy rights were being abused by the amassing of personal information and its supply to advertisers who targeted individuals who were often unaware of what was happening. \"From the point of view of commercial communications the world wide web is turning out to be the world wild west. This could be very damaging,\" Kuneva told a meeting of industry professionals and analysts in Brussels. \"Consumer rights must adapt to technology, not be crushed by it. The current situation with regard to privacy, profiling, and targeting is not satisfactory.\" The commissioner outlined European laws regulating the protection of privacy, commercial contracts, and countering discrimination, and indicated that the regulations were failing to keep up with the pace of developments on the internet. She called on the online advertising industry to come up with a voluntary code of conduct to protect consumer and privacy rights, but clearly signalled that the EU authorities would probably have to legislate to prevent abuses. The volume of personal data collected on the internet was growing exponentially and was increasingly being used for commercial purposes by tracking surfers' browsing habits, using cookies, and making the information available for individual profiling and targeting of consumers, she said. Since the personalised advertising was tailored to the individual's interests and online shopping habits, \"tools must now be developed that balance the interests of business with [those] of the consumers,\" Kuneva said. The Bulgarian commissioner added that she had ordered research into internet use and found that the under-25s \u2013 those most comfortable with the internet \u2013 were also the most suspicious of it, comparing their internet use to the drinking of water they knew to be a bit toxic. \"We would not allow such a situation to exist in the market for water, or cosmetics, or toys,\" she said. Around 80% of young internet users believed their personal data was being shared with third parties and used without their knowledge. \"They are right,\" Kuneva said. \"The new reality is that consumers are paying for services with their personal data and their exposure to ads.\" She demanded the kind of \"fairness and transparency\" common to commercial contracts. Children and young people were especially vulnerable to the marketing strategies of the online advertisers, who could also exploit their privileged information on individuals for purposes of discrimination. \"Our current legislation forbids ads that ask children to pester their parents, but we say nothing of the ones that ask them to pester their friends,\" Kuneva said. \"Does receiving a sponsored message that your best friend got a doll amount to pressure selling if you are seven years old?\"",
