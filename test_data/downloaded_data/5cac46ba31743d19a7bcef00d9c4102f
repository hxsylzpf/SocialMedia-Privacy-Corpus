  "content": "Things move fast on Twitter. This morning we woke up to find that it had changed the way it dealt with \"replies\" in its feed. Some - well, quite a few - people moaned. Biz Stone heard. Heads were banged together. And now the response on the Twitter blog: The problem with the setting was that it didn't scale and even if we rebuilt it, the feature was blunt. It was confusing and caused a sense of inconsistency. We felt we could do much better. So here's what we're planning to do. First, we're making a change such that any updates beginning with @username (that are not explicitly created by clicking on the reply icon) will be seen by everyone following that account. This will bring back some serendipity and discovery and we can do this very soon. To which one's objection is: \"any updates beginning with @username that are not explicitly created by clicking on the reply\"? You mean \"replies that aren't replies but which are replies\"? Perhaps that means \"replies created via the API\", except I think those are. So in other words, to take advantage of the very slight rollback, you have to reply by not replying. That is, rather than clicking the arrow that says \"reply\" beside the tweet you want to reply to - which then fills in the user name (which is often different from the screen name you see), you have to type it in. Misspelling hilarity will surely ensue. This is a fix? A temporary one. Second, we've started designing a new feature which will give folks far more control over what they see from the accounts they follow. This will be a per-user setting and it will take a bit longer to put together but not too long and we're already working on it. Thanks for all the great feedback and thanks for helping us discover what's important! You have to love \"a bit longer but not too long\". That's the sort of deadline we all like to work against. Again, there's a wider point to this: features which get changed without pre-announcement in connected services. There's been a similar change to the TV planner of the Sky+ HD service: rather than a straightforward listing, it now has a split-screen layout. This has proved unpopular (and confusing) to some. (Here's the old, here's the new.) The lesson may be that what is needed with such services is plenty of warning about how and why things are going to change. Certainly there ought to have been a few explanations ahead of time. And just to prove you can't please everyone, Chris Applegate commented on Twitter: \"Fucking great. Twitter has decided to #fixreplies by doing the exact opposite. So the 98% of us who don't want irrelevant @s now get them\". Yes, it's an episode of the grumpiness of the crowds. Who'd be the developer of a popular worldwide online service?",
