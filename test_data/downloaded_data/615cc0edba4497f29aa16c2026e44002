Christopher Graham, who heads the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), told a meeting on information governance in London on Thursday that it was better to act quickly to ensure that the data collected by Google was destroyed. However, prosecutors in Hamburg have opened a criminal investigation into Google's activities over the way that it collected private data from wireless networks while its Street View photo mapping car was driving around European countries \u2013 including the UK and Germany. Google has insisted that it was trying to map the existence of the networks, which use the Wi-Fi standard, but that it accidentally left in computer code which collected actual data from unsecured networks. German prosecutors have requested access to one of the hard drives used in the data gathering \u2013 though Google has so far refused. German data protection officials have given the company until 26 May to hand over the system. \"We are absolutely at an early stage,\" Wilhelm Mollers, a spokesman for the Hamburg prosecutor's office, told the New York Times. \"This isn't something that will be wrapped up in two or three weeks. We have to analyse whether there is reason to file criminal charges.\" In German law, a conviction for illegal data-gathering carries a two-year prison sentence or a fine. Johannes Caspar, the Hamburg data protection supervisor who made the original request to Google to inspect one of the hard drives, said he met Google executives on Wednesday to discuss Street View and the improperly obtained data. Google admitted on Friday that it collected 600GB of data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks around the world while collecting photos to Street View. The company has offered to destroy the data \u2013 an offer that has been accepted by the UK and Irish regulators. Meanwhile Spain, France and Italy are also investigating whether Google broke national privacy laws in the collection of data. The Spanish agency \"will call on Google to explain whether it has captured data without the consent of citizens in Spain,\" it said in a statement on Wednesday, and sent a formal request urging Google \"to block the data associated with wireless networks gathered in Spanish territory.\" Yet although data protection laws are broadly similar throughout the EU \u2013 because they implement the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive \u2013 the UK's ICO has decided not to investigate the company, and remains satisfied with its decision to destroy the data relating to UK networks which it collected. \"Google contacted the ICO, and it was better to act quickly to ensure the data was destroyed than declare war,\" Graham said. \"It was proportionate and in the public interest.\" Google co-founder Sergey Brin said this week that the company \"screwed up\" by collecting and storing information from Wi-Fi networks while gathering data for its Street View mapping service, while the chief executive Eric Schmidt said that privacy is \"paramount\" but dismissed concerns about the data collection, saying that \"what really matters is actual harm\". Google is coming under increasing pressure from European government agencies over the question of privacy and data protection. On 11 May officials from 30 European countries adopted a common approach under which they want Google to improve blurring techniques used to disguise images in Street View and to make faces and car numberplates harder to recognise. \"The [Street View] product as such is not in breach, but more measures have to be taken to improve how images are gathered and used,\" Gerard Lommel, a Luxembourg member of the so-called Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, said at the time. The group is made up of the European Union's 27 nations, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Switzerland's data-protection agency sued Google in November for allegedly failing to comply with proposals to make it harder to identify people and cars on Street View. That case is pending. The German investigation, which will determine whether prosecutors bring criminal charges against Google employees, came in response to a complaint filed on Monday by Jens Ferner, a law student from Alsdorf, Germany. Ferner said he wanted to clarify German law regarding the collection of data from unsecured wireless networks.",
