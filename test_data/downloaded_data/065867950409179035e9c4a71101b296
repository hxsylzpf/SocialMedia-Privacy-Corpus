Graham Foulkes, whose son David was killed in the attack at Edgware Road tube station, was contacted on Monday by officers from Operation Weeting who told him his phone messages may have been intercepted by Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator employed by the News of the World, part of Murdoch's media empire, in the days following the bombings. Scotland Yard is contacting other bereaved family members to warn them that they too may have had their phones hacked. Foulkes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It fills me with horror. We were in a very dark place [after the bombings]. You think it's as dark as it can get and then you realise there's someone out there who can make it darker.\" Asked if he had a direct message for Murdoch, he said: \"I'd really like to meet him and have a very in-depth conversation with him about responsibility and the power that he has and how it should be used appropriately. I would very much like to meet him and have that conversation.\" Foulkes said the police told him they were contacting him because there would be stories in the media on Wednesday morning. He said they did not tell him when they found out that his phone may have been hacked but Foulkes said: \"It seems the police have known about this for quite some time.\" Simon Greenberg, director of corporate affairs at News International, told the Today programme that a meeting between Foulkes and Murdoch was \"certainly something we would consider\". Greenberg said News International had only found out last night about the allegations that relatives of victims of the 2005 bombings had had their phones hacked but that it would inform those affected of any relevant findings in the organisation's records. Describing what he was doing in the aftermath of the 2005 bombings, Foulkes said: \"Nobody from the authorities was contacting us or any of the families for days so we were in a very dark place so we were using the phone, frantically trying to get information about David \u2026 the thought these guys may have been listening to that is horrendous.\" Foulkes was told by police that his mobile phone and his landline, which was ex-directory, may have been hacked. His landline number was known only to \"a very small number of people\", he said.",
