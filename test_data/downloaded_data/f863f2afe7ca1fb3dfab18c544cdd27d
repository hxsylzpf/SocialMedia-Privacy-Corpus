Officials for the information commissioner, Richard Thomas, have barred the Lib Dems from using the technique again. The commissioner's office said it had received complaints from some of the recipients of the calls, which were made to voters in 50 marginal constituencies after Clegg's keynote speech to the Lib Dem conference last Wednesday. Lord Rennard, the party's chief executive, had insisted the calls were purely for market research, since voters were only asked policy questions and were not pressed to support the Lib Dems. But the commissioner's office has now ruled they were marketing, or promotional calls, which meant the Lib Dems would have needed the prior approval of everyone to avoid being in breach of the privacy and electronic communication regulations. Rennard admitted to theguardian.com on Wednesday the party had not done so. If the party breaches the regulations again, it will now face criminal prosecution and an unlimited fine. The Lib Dems were accused of \"utter hypocrisy\" by the Scottish National party and Tories last week, since the party had complained about a very similar cold-calling campaign by the SNP in 2005 and demanded stricter legal controls on automated calls. The Lib Dems said they accepted the decision, and would not contest it. \"The Liberal Democrats will abide by the ruling from the information commissioner's office. We will not be appealing against the decision,\" a spokesman said. Last week, Clegg had denied the calls would anger people trying to put children to bed or watch evening television. \"I rather hope it won't disturb. People don't have to pick up the phone if they don't like the time at which the call is made,\" he said last week. \"It's a great way, it seems to me, to first say publicly what we believe in and then get immediate feedback.\" However, the ICO said 26 members of the public complained about the calls. David Smith, the deputy information commissioner, said his office \"has consistently made clear that the promotion of a political party counts as marketing. We have previously issued detailed guidance to all major political parties on this subject. \"Many people find unsolicited automated calls particularly intrusive and annoying so it is important that any organisation making such calls ensures that individuals have given their consent before they are targeted.\" The SNP's MSP for Central Fife, Tricia Marwick, welcomed the commissioner's ruling but said his officials should have blocked the cold-calling campaign before it took place. The SNP's chief executive, Peter Murrell, wrote to Thomas's office to complain 12 hours before the calls were made. Thomas's officials had confirmed they contacted the Lib Dems on Wednesday morning about the proposed calls. \"It is disappointing that the commissioner did not act to stop the calls being made and the law being broken in the first place,\" she said. \"What point is there to an enforcement notice when the calls have already been made? I will be raising questions with the commissioner over this delay in acting.\" Marwick added: \"It has been clear since 2005 that this type of automated calling is prohibited. The hypocrisy of the Lib Dems in making these calls knows no bounds. \"Having reported other parties for making similar calls and having run a campaign against unwanted telesales calls themselves the Lib Dems were well aware of their actions.\"",
