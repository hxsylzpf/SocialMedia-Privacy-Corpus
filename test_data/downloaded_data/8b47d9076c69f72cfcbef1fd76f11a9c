  "content": "Is the Sun now embarrassed by the ranting of columnist Katie Hopkins in the wake of deeply upsetting pictures of a child's body washed ashore while trying to escape Syria? Monkey only asks after a tweet from @TheSun promoting her infamous column urging the use of \"gunships to stop migrants\" disappeared overnight. No one at the paper, which joined many others in drawing attention to the plight of refugees fleeing war on Thursday morning, seems to know why the tweet vanished from its main account. The promotional tweet, which featured a smiling Hopkins and a quote from her 17 April column: \"Show me bodies floating in water, play violins and show me skinny people looking sad. I still don't care.\" was still up on Wednesday night. Yet by the time the print edition exhorting the prime minister to help prevent further refugee deaths hit the newsstands on Thursday morning, the post had been deleted. To be fair, though in no way explaining the mystery, identical tweets from the same day remain on the Sun's account, suggesting that whoever who removed one tweet did not realise quite how many times it had been trumpeted. So where did this one go and why? In short, no one knows. Its spokesman says that the \"entire social media team\" has been asked and none can provide an answer. \"Nor does our social media system show the tweet was deleted\". He says: \"If we were trying to cover something up, we would have deleted all the tweets with the Hopkins preview in, not just the one. Also, the original Hopkins column is well known and it simply doesn't make sense we would censor it for Twitter.\" \"The Sun is a strong believer in freedom of expression and will often publish controversial opinions even if these do not match the views of the newspaper. The Sun speaks through its leader columns, as it has today when we have published a very arresting front page and leader that seeks to strike the balance between getting a grip on immigration but also offering refuge to genuine refugees.\" No confusion there then.",
