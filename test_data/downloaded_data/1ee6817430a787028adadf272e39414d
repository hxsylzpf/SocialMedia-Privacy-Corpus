  "content": "Here's an old idea: even in the face of categorical truth, people find their own subjective reality. We all know this, what with our daily newspapers and TV news channels. But with social media, designed to make us share \u2013 and keep sharing \u2013 \"truth\" takes on a tricksy form. What the always informative Digital Human (Radio 4) wanted to explore was that in a world where everyone can have their own truth, are we entering into an unprecedented age of misinformation? The first test case for presenter Aleks Krotoski was the London riots of 2011, in which talk of loose zoo animals roaming the streets of north London ran wild. She spoke to Professor Nicholas DiFonzo, who studies rumours and their social and psychological functions at Rochester Institute of Technology. Basically, rumour is inherently human. \"Groups use rumours to figure things out,\" he said. \"What is the meaning of the event, for us?\" Reassuringly, questioning rumours is also inherently human. But how do we counter strong viral rumours? We need a loud enough voice, came the answer, and Dr Kalina Bontcheva \u2013 lead researcher on the Pheme internet veracity project \u2013 is working to build a \"lie detector test for social media\". Good luck with that, Dr B. \"We love to solve puzzles; often we'll just do it if we have any spare energy or time,\" said DiFonzo. We don't need the internet for this, but it sure helps. This human trait was explored from China circa AD15 through to rumours of Paul McCartney's death in the 1960s \u2013 and then again after the Boston marathon bombs in 2013. The search for \"truthiness\" threw up a lot of false positives, all in the pursuit of glory. Journalist Alexis Madrigal was watching the internet closely in the aftermath of the bombing. \"It felt dangerous,\" he said. Reddit, whose users falsely accused student Sunil Tripathi of being responsible, was forced to apologise to his family. Due diligence is key. \"In order to be wise, one should exercise one's brain \u2013 and that's hard work,\" said DiFonzo. He left things on an X-Files note: \"The truth is out there, but it takes a lot of hard work to find it.\" The internet, eh? Not worth the bother.",
