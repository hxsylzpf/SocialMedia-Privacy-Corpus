  "content": "In 2014, social media changed the way that charities fundraise. In March, the #nomakeupselfie campaign emerged and raised \u00a38m for Cancer Research UK in six days. In August, the #icebucketchallenge \u2013 where, you guessed it, people threw buckets of ice and water over themselves all in the name of charity \u2013 raised \u00a37m for MNDAssociation. Charities of all sizes have tried to harness social media to fundraise \u2013 some more successfully than others. But what is coming next? What will be the next social media phenomenon? Our experts share their predictions; tweet us your ideas @GdnVoluntary, or post them in the comments below. 1. #Growvember by Naomi Marek, chief executive at Sky Badger For me, Movember is a bit out of date. So, how about us girlies getting hairy? #Growvember could be a competitive leg hair growing month. A winter month, obviously, to allow opaque tights for first dates and black tie shindigs. 2. Vlogging for good by Kirsty Marrins, content and community manager at JustGiving I predict that 2015 will be the year of successful charity and celebrity vlogger collaborations. Back in 2012, Refuge and make-up vlogger Lauren Luke collaborated on Don't Cover It to highlight domestic abuse and this year Zoe Suggs (aka Zoella), has announced that she's an ambassador for Mind. If charities want to reach out to new and younger audiences, then working with vloggers will be essential. 3.#Mycommunity by Zoe Amar, director at Zoe Amar Communications #Nomakeupselfie and #icebucketchallenge were big campaigns with a global reach, dominated by large charities. But, there are huge opportunities for charities in hyperlocal social media. I'd like to see smaller charities run local viral campaigns. As local authority budgets are cut, communities will need to support each other and rely more on charities. I'd love to see a #mycommunity campaign that raises funds for local charities. 4. #Bellfie by Matt Collins, managing director at Platypus Digital The big craze for 2015 will be the #bellfie. The concept will really chime with the public, who will take selfies of themselves next to any kind of bell, be it doorbells, hand-held bells or even bluebells. This will signify 'ringing the changes' in their chosen campaign. The craze will kick off in London on New Year's Eve with a record number of selfies taken with Big Ben (the #belfryselfie). 5. #ImSpartacus by Alex Swallow, social entrepreneur An awareness-raising campaign, \"I'm Spartacus\" is where people rally around on social media to support an individual. If someone experiences an injustice, other people who feel their pain/have experienced a similar situation show their solidarity by using the hashtag #ImSpartacus and linking to the website of a relevant charity that supports that issue.
