  "content": "Judges face a furious backlash from MPs who have demanded a parliamentary debate over the widespread use of superinjunctions. One Tory MP has described the judiciary as an \"ass\" for its behaviour in recent months. Growing discontent at the ease with which celebrities have attained injunctions has previously led to members of the House of Commons and the Lords naming those protected by court orders, including the former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Sir Fred Goodwin. Frustration in parliament reached new heights on Friday when the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, took the unprecedented step of criticising MPs for \"flouting court orders\" in the Commons. Judge also urged ways to be found to curtail the \"misuse of technology\" after the identity of a professional footballer hiding behind an injunction was widely leaked on Twitter. The footballer has since launched a high court action to force the social media site to reveal the identity of those behind the leaks, but users of the social media site responded by swamping the site with posts, repeatedly naming one player at a rate of up to 16 times a minute. Former Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said it was \"highly likely\" there would be a debate in the House of Commons on the issue of superinjunctions, adding that it was \"plain as a pike staff\" that parliament needed to reassert itself and he hoped it would do so in a month's time after the recess. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said he was confident the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, would ensure there was a debate. He said: \"I think the problem is that the judiciary is making itself look a bit of an ass. There is something poetic about both the bill of rights and Twitter pointing towards the supremacy of the people. \"The speaker totally gets this and I think we can trust him to ensure that there will be a debate.\" John Hemming, a Liberal Democrat backbencher, who has previously mentioned several cases covered by superinjunctions in the Commons, has also promised to continue to bring up cases. \"Judges are not supposed to question the practices of parliament. It is not up to the courts to guide parliament as to what is said in parliament. This issue is creating a sort of constitutional mess.\" However, Labour MP Chuka Umunna said he thought it was unwise for MPs to continue to flout court orders. In a posting on Twitter, he wrote: \"If MPs and peers use parliamentary privilege to flout court injunctions, that is a serious breach of the separation of powers in my view.\" Meanwhile, a Twitter spokesman said it was unable to comment on the case against it. The order against the US-based micro-blogging website requires Twitter to disclose the requested information within seven days \u2013 or within the appropriate time required by the law in California, where it has its headquarters. However, experts claim that lawyers at Schillings, who represent the professional footballer at the centre of the row, would need to file their case in California to have any success and this would require them to publicly reveal the name of their client. Lawyer Mark Stephens, who does not represent anybody involved in the case, said: \"If you want to sue Twitter, you have to go to San Francisco.Any attempt to enforce English privacy or libel law will not be accepted in the US.\" Twitter has been seeking to find a European base in London. It is not known if the recent row has made the company change its plans.",
