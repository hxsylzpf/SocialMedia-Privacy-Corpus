  "content": "Update 5pm: I know I wrote that Lord McAlpine was right to sue the tweeters who defamed him over the Newsnight scandal. But that was because he was said to be demanding only nominal sums to be donated to charity. I cannot see any justification for his seeking to take \u00a350,000 in libel damages from silly Sally Bercow due to that Twitter post of hers that linked him with allegations of child sex abuse. The noble lord should surely be magnanimous. Nothing is to be gained by this case ending up in the high court. His reputation is now untarnished. His legal remedial actions should be proportionate to the stupidity of the feeding frenzy, now long since passed. To pursue the Speaker's wife through the courts could well turn her into a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre (perish the thought). If her action was foolish, then so is his response. After all, she did try to make amends by tweeting an apology, though I concede that it was yet another example of her embarrassing obsession with public self-promotion. Baron McAlpine of West Green should think again and step back from the legal brink. Update: I see on The Lawyer website that Bercow has hired the legal firm, Carter-Ruck. Her lawyers will be aware that she \"has consistently maintained that she merely commented on McAlpine 'trending' on the social media site and did not make any allegations against the peer.\" She referred to her tweet as \"mischievious but not libellous.\" McAlpine is asking Twitter users with under 500 followers who tweeted his name to apologise and make a donation to the BBC's Children in Need appeal. Bercow, who currently has nearly 63,000 followers, was reported as having 56,000 in early November. And costs lawyer Jim Diamond also estimates that the global legal costs for McAlpine's legal action could well reach \u00a31m.",
