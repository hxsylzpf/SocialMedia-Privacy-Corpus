  "content": "One Sunday in July, the images began to wink out on the popular micro-blogging service Twitter. The photo-sharing site SmugMug flashed up \"Service unavailable\". Jungle Disk, which advertises \"Reliable online storage\", stopped working. The reason: Amazon's Simple Storage Service, known as S3, went offline for up to eight hours. It was the second significant outage this year, following a similar but shorter incident in February. Amazon S3 is a celebrated example of cloud computing, meant to be the wave of the future. \"Using Amazon's S3 has about the same cost and complexity as hosting the images ourselves, but we had thought that the reliability of Amazon would be significantly higher. But that now seems wrong,\" said Lukas Biewald, who runs an image assessment service called FaceStat (bit.ly/cloudy2). Failures like this have a domino effect, and the more cloud computing catches on, the bigger the impact. Amazon does offer a service level agreement, but reimbursed fees are small compensation for loss of business. So what is cloud computing? \"There's a lot of confusion because everyone is tagging what they do with the word 'cloud'. It's the buzzword of the moment,\" says Tony Lucas, chief executive of XCalibre, a UK ISP which has created an on-demand computing service called FlexiScale (flexiscale.com). Somewhere, nowhere For some people, cloud computing simply means that their stuff is out there on the internet instead of being on a laptop or office server. A classic example is Google Mail - along with the word processing, spreadsheet and calendar applications called Google Apps - which can be used from any web browser. If your computer is stolen, the data remains safe on the net. Research shows that, at least in North America, 69% of web users make some use of such applications (bit.ly/cloudy3). Google's Chrome browser and its mobile phone operating system, called Android, are developed specifically to enable cloud computing. Features in Chrome include desktop shortcuts to websites, a fast scripting engines and a set of extensions called Gears which allow web applications, when suitably coded, to continue working even when offline (see panel). But cloud computing is not just about web applications. The idea behind businesses like FlexiScale is that instead of setting up their own computing infrastructure, businesses purchase it in the same way that they buy electricity and gas. The implications are far-reaching, and the industry giants are jostling for position. On August 1, IBM announced a $360m (\u00a3194m) data centre in North Carolina \"to enable IBM to deliver Cloud Computing capabilities to clients\". A few days earlier, HP, Intel and Yahoo had announced a joint test bed for cloud computing research and education. Dell has nabbed the URL cloudcomputing.com for its Data Center Solutions and tried (unsuccessfully) to register \"Cloud Computing\" as a trademark. Amazon, already a web retailing giant, is also a cloud computing pioneer. S3, launched in March 2006, behaves like an infinitely expandable hard drive. Developers can store and retrieve data without needing to worry about where it is physically located. \"S3 now has 14bn objects and 30,000 transactions a second,\" Jeff Barr of Amazon told a conference in London earlier this year. Later in 2006, S3 was joined by the Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2, which lets users create virtual computers on the fly. \"You build a structure called an AMI, an Amazon Machine Image, and on that AMI you put your operating system, your applications and any data that you would like,\" Barr says. \"You take that whole AMI, copy it to S3, then we can launch one, 10, 50, however many you like.\" Amazon bills customers for virtual computers by the hour, and also charges for data storage and internet data transfer (amazon.com/aws). According to Lucas, cloud computing is not only about saving money on servers. \"If you compare the cost of running a server on Flexiscale with a dedicated server of the same specification, you will save money but not a dramatic amount. It's more the flexibility. You can set up servers up straight away rather than having to wait for servers to be bought, delivered and installed and you've got the benefit of not having to have your own backup hardware.\" Cost-effective, scalable, green: cloud computing has a lot going for it. Unfortunately it can also be a single point of failure, as the S3 outage proves. There are other snags. Lock-in is a concern, particularly with offerings like Salesforce.com, specialists in customer relationship managemen (CRM), which has a capable but proprietary on-demand platform. Another problem is security, auditing and compliance. The location of personal and confidential data has legal implications, which does not fit well with services like S3 where customers are not meant to care where the data is actually stored. Virtually there Lucas agrees that reliability is a concern. \"I don't believe any business should take the risk that it couldn't happen,\" he says, adding that occasional large outages are actually more likely than minor ones. \"You'll find that no small failures occur, because that's what the redundancy is built in for, but what you will get very occasionally is a major failure.\" This happened to FlexiScale at the end of August, when human error took the entire platform offline for two days. Does that make cloud computing hopeless? Lucas says the key is to develop interoperability between clouds. \"We've got a customer who has half of what they run with us, and half of what they run with Amazon, and can switch between the two,\" he says. It is not easy to do this at present, but it could become so if standards were agreed between cloud providers. Lucas is optimistic. \"I see the interoperability problem being fixed, because it needs to be for this market to grow.\" Virtualisation, where several virtual computers run on a single physical computer, is increasingly popular within enterprises as well as up in the cloud. If all these systems were compatible, then businesses could move virtual servers between their premises and one or more cloud providers at will. \"Internal resources inside enterprises will be a cloud-type structure,\" Lucas says. \"You'll ask for the resources you need and they'll be automatically allocated, and you can outsource it to an external cloud instead of using your internal one.\" Virtualisation specialist VMware has just announced what it calls vCloud (bit.ly/cloudy4). This allows customers to run virtual data centres on the internet, and to move applications on demand between their on-premise servers and those on the internet. The cloud may yet be ready for business. The Google view \"I hate 'cloud computing',\" says Sam Schillace, Google's \"cloud advocate\" and founder of Writely, which became Google Docs. He thinks it's a horrible term, perhaps because it doesn't suggest any of the social aspects that make it useful. He says: \"We care about the social artefacts, not the technology. We care because the things we do online are about connecting with other people: email, instant messaging, blogging and so on.\" He says that 20 years ago, having an internet connection was unusual, but today, no one would want a computer that could not get online. Of course, not everybody can be connected all the time, so Google is trying to deal with the problems of being offline. One example is Google Gears, which, he says, \"is essentially a very rich browser cache, in some ways. And it reduces latency\" - the delays that come from communicating with a remote server. Gears gives web apps another gear. Schillace's job is to develop Google's cloud computing applications. \"There has to be a real trust relationship with users, built around privacy and security and change,\" he says. If people don't trust Google, they won't use its apps. So \"this company really does want to do the right thing\". Jack Schofield",
