And that's where Justin Bieber is going. According to Sir Richard Branson, the singer has signed up for one of his Virgin Galactic commercial space flights. Bieber and his manager Scooter Braun were revealed to have enrolled with the entrepreneur's programme via the medium of Twitter. \"'Great to hear @justinbieber &amp; @scooterbraun are latest @virgingalactic future astronauts. Congrats, see you up there!\" tweeted Branson. Bieber replied: \"Let's shoot a music video in SPACE!!\" Although the programme demands a $250,000 deposit, a number of celebrities \u2013 including Ashton Kutcher, Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Leonardo DiCaprio have reportedly paid the fee to be among the first civilians in space when the trips actually begin. During last month's Cannes film festival, one guest at a charity auction paid $1.2m to sit next to DiCaprio when he journeys into space. Virgin Galactic has been testing SpaceShipTwo, which carries six passengers, ahead of its scheduled first trip later this year, when Branson and his family are due to travel into space. The craft will fly to 68 miles above Earth, where passengers will be able to experience zero gravity. Bieber may be wishing to escape a troubled week back on the planet. He has been accused of involvement in two incidents with photographers in Miami on Wednesday. In the first, he ordered his security guards to take a snapper's camera \u2013 an incident that was recorded, showing the photographer begging for his equipment back. Though the camera was returned, its SIM card wasn't. In the second, his guards allegedly assaulted a photographer. Prosecutors are looking into the case. Those seeking further insight into Bieber's life are advised to seek out Selena Gomez's new album, Stars Dance. Earlier in the week the Disney-star-turned-singer said the record was about her now-ended relationship with Bieber.",
