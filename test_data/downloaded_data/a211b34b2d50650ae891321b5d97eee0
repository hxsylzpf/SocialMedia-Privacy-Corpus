  "content": "Silicon Valley has been 'Coming' to Oxford for eight years now. It's a simple premise and a relatively small crowd, but with a powerful combination of ambitious and talented MBAs and entrepreneurs and a slice of experienced, high-profile Silicon Valleyers. First topic on the agenda this year? The economic crisis. \u2022 How long will the economy stay tough for entrepreneurs? The panel between 18 months and ten years, but the consensus was 2 years. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone echoed that. He said the team had \"sensed something looming\" and managed to secure a large amount of funding just before the markets started to dive. \"When lots of startups are retreating and thinking smaller, we are able to hire and grow aggressively in the next six months, both our service and our team. Now that we've got control of our reliability and performance issues we can look at our sustainability as a company. There's a lot of talent coming to us.\" \u2022 Pat House, co-founder of Siebel Systems, said this period will mean companies can't become bloated by profitless services. \"There is nothing more focusing than a lack of money,\" she said. \"There couldn't be a better time - you cannot build irrelevant businesses in this climate. Keep your eyes on the prize - you won't be able to afford to do anything else.\" Her survival strategy? Align yourself with the smartest people you know. \u2022 Index Ventures partner and staple of the European startup Saul Klein emphasised that isn't isn't all about finding funding. \"The best place to get money is from customers,\" he said. \"If you're building a product that customers want, they will pay you money, And if you're not, you have to ask yourself why not. If they are using it in abundance, but you haven't figured out the business model yet, then that's fine too.\" He pointed to Twitter - they are building something that is becoming \"essential to poeple's lives\". Klein also said that developing an international focus will be a huge advantage once we \"emerge from the other end of the tunnel\". \"I genuinely believe it is not in the current DNA of US entrepreneurs to believe that the web is entirely global,\" he said. \"When we emerge... the world will look even more global than it does today. Markets we think are not monetisable today - Latin America and Asia - will be monetisable at other side of the tunnel. There's a massive opportunity to unseat the incumbents,\" he said, saying the best known web firms tends to be very US-centric.",
