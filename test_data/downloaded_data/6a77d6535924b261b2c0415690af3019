  "content": "The information age has generated a paradox: we do not trust government with details of our private lives, but we have let the commercial world intrude all over our personal space. As our poll today reveals, a huge majority of voters do not have confidence in the government to protect privacy. This has not prevented today's politicians from stretching \"unduly the powers of society over the individual\", as John Stuart Mill put it. Civil liberties are being chipped away - with the authorities gathering more powers to map our lives in secret. This is happening at a time when the public has in some cases opted to swap, and in other instances been coerced into trading, privacy for convenience. The result is that a detailed picture of almost every adult in Britain is being compiled. Ask for a loan at a bank, and in exchange for the request your details will added to databases which chart where 40 million individuals in Britain live, whom they bank with and how good their credit record is. The supermarket loyalty card keeps shopping habits - data which is aggressively used to target customers. The scale of the information now gathered - enough to provide a formidable reference book on every individual in the developed world - should trouble the public. If the state were to try to pry on such a scale, there would be an outcry. But, in smaller ways, such as selling the telephone directory or the electoral roll, our public goods are being retailed. The volume of information has mostly been collected because people have to tick a box not to give up personal details rather than to tick one which says such information can be collected and used. Here is a single simple change which government should promote - a change giving people control over the decision to open up their lives. No one should pretend, especially when transparency has become a hallmark of modernity, that people no longer care about privacy. Reality television shows are not an endorsement of a new surveillance culture but an example of people exchanging anonymity for celebrity. New technologies often cause people to lose their privacy unwittingly. Mobile-phone companies hold data on an individual's calls and movements. Anyone logged on the web can easily be monitored. The security of electronic communication, as our poll shows, rightly bothers people - especially younger adults, likely to be big users of new technology. Freedoms should not be eroded silently. Opposition is needed to government proposals to give local authorities access to the records of every telephone and internet user in the country. The right to be left alone, provided harm is not done to others in doing so, is one that is well worth defending. Compelling reasons are needed for it to be abrogated. Although people will give up a portion of their privacy to aid the fight against terrorism this ought not be bent to restrict unnecessarily the people's freedom. The public should be made aware of how long information is stored for, who has access to it and what it is used for. No one wants arrangements that will allow suspicious partners or nosy neighbours to track where a person has been. But the growth in snooping agencies and private investigators implies that to some extent this is already happening. Accuracy is also an issue. The veracity of data held on commercial databases such as credit records, and on public ones such as the police national computer, are often questioned. While there are many who feel they have nothing to hide, it is far easier to defend privacy while you possess it, than to reclaim it once it has been lost.",
