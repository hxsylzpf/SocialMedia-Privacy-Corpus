McCarthy, who is defending her Bristol East seat, could face six months in prison or a \u00a35,000 fine after posting the results of some 300 votes to her 5,700 followers. The Labour MP said she was \"kicking herself\" over the post, which has now been deleted. Her tweet said: \"First PVs opened in east Bristol, our sample: UKIP **; TUSC**; BNP ** Lib Dem **; Tory **; Labour **. \u00a3gameON!\" An Avon and Somerset police spokeswoman confirmed the matter was being investigated. She said: \"Bristol city council have contacted Avon and Somerset police this evening about a possible alleged breach of electoral law. The matter is currently being looked in to.\" It is illegal to reveal the votes cast before the end of polling day as this may influence the outcome of the election. An Electoral Commission spokeswoman said candidates who see the front of a ballot paper \"must maintain the secrecy of voting\". Publishing the details of a count can lead to a fine or a prison sentence of up to six months, according to section 66A of the Representation of the People Act. Bristol city council said the incident was an alleged breach of the act and was a \"criminal matter\". McCarthy said: \"I was pretty silly to do it; it was just thoughtless, I was being over-exuberant.\" She said it was \"ironic\" because \"only yesterday I was thinking about how everyone said that Twitter would be where the gaffes would be and I kept saying there was more chance of it happening on the road. Yesterday was a classic example of that.\" The prime minister's encounter with Gillian Duffy in Rochdale, after which he was caught describing the Labour supporter as a bigot, had been \"pretty awful\", she said. In a statement released by Labour, McCarthy added: \"It was a thoughtless thing to do, and I very quickly realised that it was not appropriate to put such information in the public domain. \"Because this was not official information, and no votes had been counted, I thought of it as being akin to canvass returns, ie telling people how well we were doing with Labour promises on the doorstep, but I appreciate now it was wrong to do so.\" She added that the returning officer at Bristol city council had advised that it would not be lawful for anyone else to publish the information, for example, by re-posting her tweet.",
