  "content": "Already up on the site is Phorm fires ISP privacy row (previously at Phorm fires ISP privacy row), which provides an introduction to the topic we first aired last Friday but also speaks to people at BT and Phorm - including an ex-Phormer, who must remain nameless. Among the interesting points made by the latter was that Phorm has spoken at great length to the Home Office to make sure that its scheme doesn't break RIPA (the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act), and that it takes the privacy issue very seriously. Also there is some of Phorm's past incarnation as 121Media, which distributed an adware - though F-Secure called it spyware - application called PeopleOnPage. (121Media became Phorm last May.) One last intriguing point: the ex-Phormer notes that \"The [Phorm] platform clearly has some edge-of-network technologies involved. It would be entirely feasible for an ISP to allow customers to opt out - and subsequently throttle their service.\" Now that really would be scary. Over to you. Who else here has worked for Phorm? Or been pitched by them? Update: you'll note comments from a shareholder and from the \"Tech team\" at Phorm (thanks to both for pitching in). The company now has a (rapidly-assembled, we suspect) blog whose first and so far only post is from the chief executive Kent Ertugrul. Here's his company CV; here's what Google knows about him. Tell us what you find different, and what you think of his blog post.",
