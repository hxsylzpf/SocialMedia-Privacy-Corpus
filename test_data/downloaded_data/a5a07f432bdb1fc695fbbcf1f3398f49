  "content": "\u2022 Got lists? Twitter lists have begun spread among its users: from a comparatively tiny number (ahem) a few days ago it has now widened them to around 5% (estimated) of the user base. Nobody can quite agree on the value of Twitter lists, or their purpose: are they to get more people going to its web page (where it might, say, serve ads) or find out who users think are important? Or both? Whatever, you can have the Guardiantech recommended list (more welcome). And here's Fake Sarah Palin's list of People I Hate. Verrry exclusive. One interesting point made by Ben Rose: if you create a list with someone in, you can see their tweets in that list. And then you can unfollow them - at which point they remain in your list. So you can effectively follow people without following them. Sneaky. \u2022 Saul Hansell at the New York Times (who seems to have become its go-to man on mobile phones) profiles what's going on at Motorola. It seems that the company is pinning its hopes on... Windows Mobile! No, it isn't. It's going full steam for Google's Android. Or, in the words of Sanjay Jha, the co-chief executive (?) there, \" Burn the ships and focus on Android\". And we'd just like to point out what a bit of pushiness can get you: As luck would have it, one of those engineers, Rick Osterloh, grabbed Mr. Jha just as he stepped off the stage at that first town meeting in August 2008. Mr. Jha had mentioned Google's Android operating system for smartphones. Mr. Osterloh rushed the stage to tell him he was working on an Android phone in Motorola's Silicon Valley outpost that would bring together text messages, e-mail and social-network updates. By the end of that week, Mr. Osterloh was sitting on the corporate jet, flying with Mr. Jha back to California and explaining the Android concept in detail. I'm still wondering why none of these companies are leaping to adopt Windows Mobile. Anyone? \u2022 We're still seeing loads of direct message spams on Twitter, and hearing about huge botnets sending tons of Facebook phishing messages. If you get hit, make sure you change your password - and if you use the same password (which you shouldn't) then change it. Reminder: Google can tell you how to make a strong password. \u2022 one last thing on Google: you can now export all your Google Docs out of Google as a zip file. More explanation at the Data Liberation Front's blog. Wondering who they are? See our interview with its chief, Brian Fitzpatrick. Yes, this life of Brian involves Google.
