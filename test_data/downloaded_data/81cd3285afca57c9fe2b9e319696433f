  "content": "Home Depot said Tuesday that it is investigating \"unusual activity\" after a security expert reported the home improvement giant may have become the latest victim of credit card hackers. The company was responding to a report from Krebs on Security, the security blog that broke the news of Target's massive credit card hack. Brian Krebs, the site's founder, said \"multiple banks\" were reporting that Home Depot may be the source of a \"massive new batch of stolen credit and debit cards that went on sale this morning in the cybercrime underground\". In a statement Home Depot said it was working with investigators assess the situation. \"Protecting our customers' information is something we take extremely seriously, and we are aggressively gathering facts at this point while working to protect customers.\" \"If we confirm that a breach has a occurred, we will make sure customers are notified immediately. Right now, for security reasons, it would be inappropriate for us to speculate further \u2013 but we will provide further information as soon as possible.\" Home Depot is the US's largest home improvement chain with over 2,248 locations and revenues of over $78.8bn. The revelation of another major hack comes in the wake of the release of intimate pictures of mainly female celebrities including Jennifer Lawrence and Rihanna by an anonymous hacker, and follows a wave of breaches at banks and retailers in recent months. Krebs said the attack on Home Depot may have come from the same group of Russian and Ukrainian hackers responsible for the data breaches at Target, cosmetic supplies company Sally Beauty, restaurant group PF Chang's, and others. In December last year Krebs was first to report that Target was investigating a breach in which 40 million people had their credit and debit cards stolen by hackers. Subsequent investigations found that breach \u2013 believed to be the largest ever to have compromised credit details \u2013 affected the details of 70 million people, about 29% of the US population. That news also led to a massive share price crash at Target. Home Depot's shares fell 2% on news of the breach.",
