Favourites Personalisation functionality where users tell the iPlayer what shows they like and an \"inbox\" style view will keep shows that are ready to watch updated. Social media is being introduced initially through partnerships with Twitter and Facebook that will allow users to share and recommend content. However so the social interaction can build a \"complete social ecosystem\" within iPlayer users will have to have a BBC ID, a log-in that more than 1 million users of the corporation's websites already have to allow the posting of comments. A deal with Microsoft will allow users of its chat service to log in via the iPlayer, forward links to others and comment while watching shows. The BBC has promised that other chat services, such as those run by Facebook and Google, are likely to follow. TV and radio content, which was integrated into a singe iPlayer experience in July 2008, have been separated to make browsing easier. \u2022 A new version of the iPlayer for mobile phones is set to launch in a few weeks. \u2022 Expect the iPlayer to appear on the iPad, which launches in the UK on Friday, with Rose rather slightly cryptically stating that it would be \"premature to write about the iPlayer not being on the iPad\". \u2022 Some rivals, who worry that the ability of the iPlayer to allow some series in their entirety beyond the limitations of the usual seven-day catchup window, will not be happy with a new desktop download upgrade to the iPlayer. This will make it easier to download favourite shows in advance. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
