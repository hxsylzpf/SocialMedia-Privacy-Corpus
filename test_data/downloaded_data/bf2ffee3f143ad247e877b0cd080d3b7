  "content": "As Leo Blair's grandfather, I find it utterly unbelievable, actually unforgivable, that the Sun newspaper would endanger the personal safety of my five-year-old grandson by not only publishing details of the alleged kidnap plot, but also splashing this little boy's photograph across its front pages. There can be no excuse for this action. I recall, at the end of last year, the discretion exercised by that same newspaper over the contretemps between its editor, Rebekah Wade, and her partner, Ross Kemp. Then the only issue was of the personal dignity of a pair of adults, not the personal security of an innocent child. Shame on you Wade and your unthinking cohorts. Tony Booth Blacklion, Ireland",
