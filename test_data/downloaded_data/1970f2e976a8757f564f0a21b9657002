The feature is used to identify television programmes and music tracks, mirroring the functionality of apps like Shazam or Soundhound, but does so automatically while users are writing a status update in Facebook's Android or iPhone app. \"The microphone doesn't turn itself on, it will ask for permission,\" said Gregg Stefancik, Facebook's head of security infrastructure talking to journalists in Australia. \"It's not always listening... so it's very limited in what it is sampling.\" The recognition feature is only available for users in the US and was announced at the end of May. 'The raw audio never leaves the phone' Stefancik stressed that it is an opt-in feature and that it will not listen for audio automatically unless the feature is enabled in the Facebook app's settings. The Facebook app creates an \"audio fingerprint\" of the background sounds as a user types a status update, which is then compared with Facebook's database of music and television shows. If a match is made Facebook notifies the user and gives them the option of adding the matched song or programme to their status post. \"The user is in complete control and the audio fingerprint that we've received is disposed of immediately,\" stressed Stefancik. \"The raw audio never leaves the phone and the data about the match is only stored if you choose to post it.\" The fact that a match has been made is logged, but no information about the user or the audio recorded is kept. The app states that \"we can't identify background noise and conversation\" before the feature is enabled and that \"sounds are only used to find a match and are never stored.\" \"I wouldn't want this in my pocket either if it was recording everything going on around me,\" said Stefancik. 'Working aggressively to encrypt all data' Facebook is also attempting to protect user privacy from government and third-party surveillance by making all of its communications secure and encrypted. \"We've prioritised encrypting the traffic that is most sensitive at Facebook, and we're working aggressively to get to the point where we can tell you we'll have it all encrypted between datacentres,\" Stefancik said. Stefancik said that the NSA revelations by Edward Snowden \"validated a lot of the things we knew we needed to protect against\" and said that the company had been working on encrypting data and its transit across the internet before Snowden's leaks but that it was hard to make work in all situations where Facebook is used. \"It's not like we wake up one morning and flip a switch. It has performance implications, there's still compatibility issues between devices,\" he said. Stefancik stressed that Facebook would resist attempts to release encrypted user data to authorities, which the Australian government has proposed that Facebook and other social networks should be legally required to do. \"Handing over encryption keys is something that we would fight,\" he said. \u2022 Amazon and Snapchat rank low for protecting user data from government, but Facebook 'has your back' according to the EFF \u2022 Facebook relents and beefs up default privacy settings for new users \u2022 This article was amended on 4/06/2014 to clarify that matches are logged.",
