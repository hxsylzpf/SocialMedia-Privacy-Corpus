  "content": "Naomi Campbell won her landmark privacy case against the Mirror because the information about her Narcotics Anonymous counselling session had been obtained \"surreptitiously\", the judge ruled. Mr Justice Michael Morland backed the claims of the 31-year-old model, who had accused the Mirror of breaches of confidence, privacy and the Data Protection Act. Awarding damages, the judge said : \"The information clearly bore the badge of confidentiality and when received by the defendants they, Mr Morgan (Mirror editor) and the Mirror journalists. were clothed in conscience with the duty of confidentiality.\" The judge said one of the articles at the centre of the case \"trashed\" Ms Campbell \"in a highly offensive and hurtful manner\". And turning to references in one of the Mirror articles, in which the phrase \"chocolate soldier\" was used to refer to Ms Campbell, the judge said: \"I can well understand that Miss Campbell found the phrase hurtful and considered it racist.\" But the key areas of his judgment centre on the question of Ms Campbell's right to attend drugs counselling in the confidence that the sessions would remain private. Mr Justice Morland said even though the model had lied in court and even though she had been \"lacking in frankness and veracity with the media\" and had courted press attending, she was still entitled to a modicum of privacy. \"In my judgement it matters not whether therapy is obtained either by means of professional medical input or by alternative means such as group counselling or, as here, organised meetings for discussions between sufferers,\" he said. \"They were obtained surreptitously, assisted by covert photography when Miss Campbell was engaged deliberately \"low key\" and 'drably dressed' in a private activity of therapy to advance her recovery from drug addiction.\" He said the Mirror had a right to reveal she was a drug addict and the fact she was receiving therapy. \"It is not disputed that the Mirror was entitled to reveal and to reveal in strong terms that Miss Naomi Campbell was a drug addict despite her previous denials and was receiving therapy. But, he continued: \"The essential question is whether even if a public figure, which includes an international celebrity such as Miss Naomi Campbell, courts and expects media exposure, she is left with a residual area of privacy which the court should protect if its revelation would amount to a breach of confidentiality.\" Answering his own question in his initial ruling handed out in the high court at 10am today, Mr Justice Morland said Ms Campbell's right to confidentiality had been impinged. \"In my judgement the details of Miss Naomi Campbell's attendance at Narcotics Anonymous do have the necessary quality of confidence about them. They bear the badge or mark of confidentiality. \"In my judgement the information giving details of her regular attendance at Narcotics Anonuymous meetings for therapy must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. \"The undisclosed source, whether a fellow sufferer of drug addiction attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings or a member of Miss Naomi Campbell's staff or entourage, owed her an obligation of confidence in relation to the information, whether or not that information was supplemented by a Mirror reporter attending a NA meeting or by covert photography, the information clearly bore the badge of confidentiality.\"",
