  "content": "Many people often turn to the virtual world of social media when a momentous occasion occurs in the real world. They share their grief and their sorrow \u2013 and they also celebrate their achievements. The death of arguably one of the greatest statesman of our time, on 5 December, triggered a similar reaction and this is clear from data collected by a social data research company. 5W Consulting found that seven million tweets were sent about Nelson Mandela between 3 and 8 December and they analysed them to find out what people were saying. Here's the data: The revelation is quite stunning: amongst a great number of commemorative tweets about his death, at least 8% of all tweets (560,000) involved users ridiculing others for confusing his picture with that of famous actors. This came after a number of users confused Nelson Mandela and Morgan Freeman, likely due to Freeman's appearance in Invictus, a film that focussed on how Mandela united a post-apartheid South Africa behind the Springboks' triumphant run at the 1995 Rugby World Cup. But the majority of tweets \u2013 over 50% \u2013 paid respect to Mandela in one form or another, whether it was through sharing an inspiring story or quote, talking about the lessons the world should learn or even a brief \"RIP\" tweet. The headline of this story was corrected on 16/12/2013 to reflect the fact that 8% of tweets discussed misinformation rather than producing it \u2022 Guardian readers share their memories and tributes to Nelson Mandela.",
