A brief word on this story and why it's important: although the peers may not have broken the law, the investigation captures a certain entrenched venality that is very disturbing when you consider the way the government hurries bills through parliament and does so much to obstruct proper scrutiny of proposed new laws. Among the four exposed are two former ministers and a Labour whip, men who know their way about Westminster and how to drop the right word in the ear of a minister, civil servant or committee member. Instead of concerning themselves with the interests of the public, these second-raters appear happy to accept offers of cash from lobbyists. This may be seen as further evidence of the degradation of the business of legislation under Labour. The lack of a police investigation into the activities of the four provides a striking contrast to the treatment of Damian Green, who was actually trying to carry out his duties of scrutiny and holding the government to account when he was arrested and his offices searched. Anyway, to the judging: I wondered if any of the entrants would consult the A-Z of legislation assembled for liberty central. It is the most complete record yet and will become an invaluable, useful resource for all students of the erosion of rights and liberties in Britain. Entrants may have looked, but few admitted the scope of the government's programme, which seemed to me essential if you are making an argument in favour of it. The other critical elements were to prove the benevolence of the government and all future governments, which will inherit this armoury of authoritarian laws and surveillance systems, as well as demonstrating government competence. Nothing on the thread met those undisclosed criteria but the offerings and debate were spirited. I particularly liked eagleeyed's idea that contributions from one ill-mannered individual who tried to dominate the proceedings were the product of a piece \"of software designed to completely ignore or distort people's points\". I also liked bill40's: WE ARE UNDER IMMENSE THREAT!!! MILLIONS OF EXTREMIST TERRORISTS WILL EAT YOUR CHILDREN WITHIN 45 MINUTES, UNLESS YOU LESS YOU HELP US TO HELP YOU SAVE THEM!! THINK OF THE CHILDREN, WILL SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN!! ARE YOUR PETTY OBJECTIONS TO THE DATA BASE WORTH A SINGLE CHILDS LIFE? Wish I had some green ink to type that for extra effect. There was plenty of sharp irony and also clear and good writing. Several went down the apocalyptic route (for example, BeatonTheDonis and JayReilly) evoking a picture of social chaos in which government is forced to take repressive actions in order to cope with diminishing oil supplies and the economic crisis. dodoze wrote: A collapsing economy and collapsing currency mean the UK faces a period of instability the consequences of which cannot be foreseen. We will no longer be able to finance the benefits which have been of the sixty year legacy of Beveridge. We may be in for a rough time but I was not convinced, and I also think talk of social breakdown, though cunningly rendered here, contains exactly the sort of helplessness which brought the fascists into power during the last century. The whole point about a society where freedom is deeply ingrained is that the public takes responsibility in times of crisis and works to find solutions. Whether people agree with this notion \u2013 the deepest political conviction that I have \u2013 depends on whether they are optimistic or pessimistic about human nature. freespeechoneeach produced a familiar argument with this: Most of what is called the database state already exists. The question is not whether or not citizens should provide data to officialdom- because we already do.But there is much duplication of data. By amalgamating all personal records, (from identity documents to tax records to benefits entitlements, to health information,) we will all reap rewards from administration economies and a smoother-running, more efficient suite of services. Full marks to Worktimesurfer who turned John Stewart Mill on his head and used this quote to argue for ID cards: \"The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others.\" It was interesting how much of the debate focused on ID cards, even though it is only a fraction of the project to manage our identity and the related merger of government databases under the transformational government project. blazzers pursued the Marxist line that there is in effect no difference between the state and the people. \"The purpose of this scheme (ID cards) is to put the state in the driving seat \u2013 there are no more rights which you receive by virtue of being human, only 'entitlements' which you can receive upon production of a card.\" Against all the evidence today many contributors have a touching faith in the state, which is why I admired the paragraph from roomwithaview. \"Maybe if they could get the self assessment tax online to work it would be a good trial. It doesn't and they got my NI linked to some stranger's name and I've tried at morning, noon and night since Tuesday 20th to get hold of someone in their technical section.\" For the same disruptive spirit I commend unusedusername who imagined the United Kingdom being turned into a vast Wikipedia: ... listing every resident, and of course every little detail about them. And of course there'd be no restrictions on who had access, everybody would. We'd all be policemen. The three contributions I most admired were from piecework, rosieh2 and peitha. The prize goes to rosieh2, though peitha suggested a second prize of a ticket to the Convention on Modern Liberty on February 28, which I am happy to award her/him for all his/her amusing contributions to the thread. liberty central will be in touch with you both to arrange for the prizes to be delivered.",
