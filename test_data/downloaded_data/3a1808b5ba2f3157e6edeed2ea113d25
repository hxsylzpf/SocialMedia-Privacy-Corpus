  "content": "It has been a few months since the BBC announced there would be no more series of Apprentice spin-off, Young Apprentice, which never gained the traction of its older sibling show. But it still rankles with Lord Sugar, who was asked about the show on Twitter on Thursday night. So much so that he broke out the caps lock. \"NO BBC HAVE DECIDED TO STOP IT\" he replied.
