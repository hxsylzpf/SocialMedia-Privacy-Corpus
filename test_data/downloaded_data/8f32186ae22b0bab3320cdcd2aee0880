  "content": "\u2022 Plenty more news on Google and its relations with China, most notably (of course) our interview with co-founder Sergey Brin - who called for the US government to start putting internet censorship at the top of its list of priorities. And kicked out at Microsoft. And talked about the past four years of censorship. Anyway, on top of that, we also take an inside look at how China censors; plus there's an interview with chief legal officer David Drummond in the Atlantic, and a note from the company itself on using Google apps in China. \u2022 Remember recently when Twitter started cracking down on spam last year? And then when it started scanning links to block dubious links? Turns out it actually had an effect: according to new figures from the Twitter team, spam has been cut massively. Good news? Can't be bad. \u2022 It's been ages since we shared any Whole Robot Fun. No longer! Go and watch this video of a little Japanese robot making coffee, and I'll guarantee that it makes you break out into a smile. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, @gdngames or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed..",
