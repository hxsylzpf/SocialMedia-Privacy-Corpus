  "content": "London has overtaken Toronto to become the biggest network on Facebook, the social networking site. Members listed in London now number 790,615, an almost twofold increase from May this year. Facebook's user base is growing at a rate of 3% overall each week, but by 6% a week in London. \"London did just take the top spot in regional networks in the past week,\" said Facebook spokesman Matt Hicks. \"We aren't able to pinpoint a specific reason for the rapid growth in one regional network over another, other than the fact it matches our overall pattern of growing exponentially.\" By country, the UK is the third largest user group after the US and Canada, with 2.1 million unique users each month. Facebook is seeking to exploit its rapid UK growth by opening a UK sales office this autumn. Of its UK users, 14,303 are listed under the BBC network. Much of the popularity of Facebook is built around its communication tools. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Facebook's email system is replacing web-based email services such as Hotmail and Gmail, but as Facebook alerts users to messages by emailing a notification it may actually be driving up email use. Data produced by web measurement firm ComScore shows that the balance of time spent on email services and social networking sites is changing. The average number of minutes spent on Yahoo and AOL email services dropped by 14% and 20% respectively from June 2006 to June 2007. Hotmail remained the same, while Google's Gmail increased by 28%. On Bebo, meanwhile, engagement increased from an average 140.1 minutes per user per month a year ago, to 333 minutes during June. Facebook increased from 124 to 191 minutes, and MySpace from 120 to 143 minutes. Hotmail is still the most popular email service in the UK, with an estimated 19.8 million unique users during June 2007. ComScore measures home and work traffic but not educational organisations or public web services. Google's Gmail service saw the biggest year-on-year increase in traffic, rising 50% to 1.98 million unique users last month. Hotmail's traffic rose by 21%, Yahoo Mail's by 3%, while AOL web email lost 40% of its audience, down to 3.19 million uniques. The three major social networking sites all saw huge growth over the past 12 months. MySpace recorded the biggest audience of 10.76 million unique users during June, an increase of 149% from June 2006. Bebo's traffic increased 182% in the UK, up to 10.07 million unique users in June last year. Facebook's UK traffic rose from a low base of 268,000 unique users last June to 6.01 million last month - an increase of 2,143%. Separately, Facebook yesterday announced its first acquisition, paying an undisclosed sum for Parakey, a Silicon Valley start-up company run by the two developers who founded the Firefox web browser. Parakey is developing a web platform that facilitates easier sharing and publishing of information between a user's desktop and the web. The acquisition has fuelled speculation that Facebook will work on an offline version and develop the site as a web platform in itself. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
