  "content": "During EA's pre-E3 press briefing on Monday, the company announced a new social networking feature for its forthcoming shooter, Battlefield 3. Named \"Battlelog\", the service will allow players to set up and manage friends lists and other community features, much like the Call of Duty Elite service announced last week by Activision. But there's one key difference: while many of Elite's features are open to paying subscribers only, EA chief John Riccitiello took great delight in pointing out that Battlelog will be free. \"The service is a hub of powerful social tools, where gamers can connect, communicate and play with friends,\" said Karl Magnus Troedsson, the general manager of the game's developer, EA Dice. \"You can launch a game, manage friends lists, squad up, create platoons, check out your stats in real time \u2013 and all 100% free.\" The Battlelog name is, of course, a reference to \"Autolog\", the innovative social gaming feature added to last year's racer Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit. Autolog allows players to track and compete against the best times and performances of their friends, enlivening the single-player and creating a new form of asynchronous multiplayer activity. Battlelog will no doubt endeavour to fulfil a similar function. EA is clearly making social gaming a key element of its business. The company also announced the EA Sports Club, which allows players to seamlessly track matches played by friends as well as challenging other gamers to online matches. EA is set to run an open beta of the Battlelog service in September, and the full experience will be launched alongside the Battlefield 3 game on 25 October.",
