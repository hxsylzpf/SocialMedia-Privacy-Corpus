  "content": "Radio 1's presenters will go silent on Friday as the station's entire daytime line-up switch off the microphone and talk to the nation via Twitter. For a whole 12 hours tomorrow, between the opening of Nick Grimshaw's breakfast show to Annie Mac at 7pm, it will be music, music, music. Plus a bit of Newsbeat, obviously, which makes way for no one, not even the culmination of Radio 1's \"even more music month\". You'll still be able to find your favourite presenter, but they will be tweeting from the station's official Twitter feed, @BBCR1, instead. What better way for the nation's former favourite station, keen on attracting a rather younger audience than the 30-plus somethings who used to listen to Chris Moyles, to get down with the kids? No word on whether the experiment will be repeated on other BBC stations. Would make for interesting tweeting on Radio 4.",
