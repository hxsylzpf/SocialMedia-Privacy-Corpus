  "content": "The Apps Blog made its debut in February 2011 with the aim of covering the apps space, from innovative new applications for smartphones and tablets to the startups and developers that were making them. It has been a frenetic year for app development. Even confining our daily Apps Rush post to just notable releases saw it regularly sail past the 20-app mark. The year also saw spirited debates about freemium versus paid, HTML5 versus native, iOS versus Android and more. As 2011 draws to a close, we have rounded up what we hope are some of the more thought-provoking interviews from the year. Well, the vast majority are interviews: a few (CNN, Disney, BSkyB, Rovio, EMI and Scott Snibbe) are reports from presentations or interviews at conferences. We hope you enjoy the recap. TELEVISION BBC iPlayer \u2013 Daniel Danker (December) \"Our audiences no longer expect to watch our programmes to a specific schedule in a specific location. There is an independence that comes with this mobile TV. Whether you are curled up in bed with the tablet, or tuning in to live news when on the road, it's about that choice.\" MTV \u2013 Gary Ellis (November) \"Our ideal scenario is to have someone watching the show on their TV, while also having their computer open or their smartphone or tablet to hand interacting around the show, the host and other viewers.\" Zeebox \u2013 Anthony Rose (November) \"When Stephen Fry tweets about a programme, thousands of people might flip to that show. Celebrities can become the TV schedulers of the future by saying 'I'm watching this' and that going out to the Twitter audience.\" CNN \u2013 Richard Quest (October) \"It doesn't matter if it was in Cairo or Bahrain, Syria or Yemen, this small device has managed to bring home the reality of what's happening in the world, and in doing so has changed the way people like me do our business.\" Disney \u2013 Anne Sweeney (October) \"Digital didn't weaken the power of television. It unleashed it. We're giving people more quality and options than ever before, and they're responding: tuning in, logging on, downloading, streaming, buying, renting - devouring our content any way they can get it.\" Shazam \u2013 David Jones (June) \"While some show creators and networks are building dedicated apps for each show, they're finding that it's pretty difficult to drive installs and regular usage for those apps. Consumers don't necessarily want a separate app on their phone for every show that they watch.\" Somethin' Else \u2013 Paul Bennun (June) \"Eurovision plus Twitter is the best piece of television you will ever have: the action is on two screens. Just as radio didn't replace newspapers, and TV didn't replace radio, the internet isn't replacing television. It's this new thing that's there, which changes the way you use the old medium.\" BSkyB \u2013 David Gibbs (March) \"The beauty of this is you can experiment with different models, and afford to change things around. We have an existing subscription for our customers, so how do we extend that subscription and add value to it in our tablet products, and how do we create new customers?\" MAGAZINES / NEWSPAPERS New York Times \u2013 Fiona Spruill (December) \"We were trying to create the best possible experience for people on their phone, and it takes people to do that. What we were trying to provide was not something that could be delivered to an algorithm, even though there are many smart algorithms out there.\" Dennis Publishing \u2013 Felix Dennis (September) \"If you want to make a fortune, produce a thing like the iPad, make it very light, and preload it with stuff that people over 65 and 70 years old want to see: web addresses, apps, anything you want. Make the buttons absolutely huge and only have a few of them, and put that on the market at 100 quid for people to buy their grandmothers. You would sell millions!\" Financial Times \u2013 Rob Grimshaw (August) \"When you look at the rates of adoption, it's very clear that mobile is going to be the major channel for news consumption within a relatively short time. We think that within three years, we will have more than half of our digital access through mobile devices.\" TigerSpike \u2013 Nic Newman (April) \"People don't want to turn their magazine into the web or a newspaper \u2013 that is fundamentally wrong - but what if people could choose to follow a story in the magazine throughout the week after it was first published?\" BOOK-APPS Touch Press \u2013 Max Whitby (December) \"We want to use the medium to illuminate the subject. If we don't do that, we have failed. I'm not interested in producing beautiful stained-glass windows. I want to produce things that really inspire people, and get to the heart of the topic.\" Callaway Digital Arts \u2013 Rex Ishibashi (November) \"For 10 years I've been saying that the best digital should feel like the ultimate analogue. That's what we finally have with iPhone, iPad and Android devices, and we're anticipating a lot with the Kindle Fire as well. These devices are physically connected, human intuitive and easy to develop for as well.\" Ideal Binary \u2013 Barry O'Neill (November) \"We've heard stories about people spending upwards of \u00a3250,000 developing very sophisticated book-apps as one-off showcases, which got great reviews but ultimately did very mediocre sales numbers.\" Nosy Crow \u2013 Kate Wilson (September) \"We felt there was room to bring real publishing knowledge, contacts and ways of thinking into this technology space. A lot of people who are creating apps are approaching it very much as technology companies, but we felt there was real scope to mix the two different ways of being.\" Dorling Kindersley \u2013 Justin Moodie (September) \"We have always been designing things for tablets, you could say, it's just that until now the tablets were made of paper! We design books for reluctant readers: anyone should be able to open any DK book at any page and be absorbed immediately, and it's the same with a tablet app.\" Faber \u2013 Henry Volans (August) \"We're at the real start of how digital books will become different to print books. Historically, for example, a natural history guidebook looks quite similar to a novel, which is an accident of printing. Very soon those things will absolutely diverge massively. It's important to keep innovating, and as publishers we need to have a role in that.\" David Starkey (June) \"It's a case of the technology catching up with what I wanted to do. Television is a performance, but apps actually reflect thought processes.\" Push Pop Press \u2013 Kimon Tsinteris (May) \"We think that the app is probably one of the richest, most interactive forms of storytelling that exist. One of our founding premises is to re-imagine the book.\" HarperCollins \u2013 Robin Harvie (April) \"We have to make really sophisticated digital products that compete ultimately with Angry Birds. Think of someone like Jonathan Franzen, whose competition used to be Philip Roth and John Updike. Now it's The Wire and Angry Birds, because we are competing for people's attention.\" GAMES Red Robot Labs \u2013 Pete Hawley (December) \"It's hard to raise money in London. If you've got a small team of brilliant people who've just come out of a console studio, it's hard to say 'I need a million bucks in a year to do something amazing'. There's no culture of investors and amazing VCs ready to invest in gaming and take it seriously.\" OnLive \u2013 Steve Perlman (December) \"LA Noire is a detective story. My parents would be very interested in a game with that type of subject! But they're never going to pick up a controller or buy the class of PC required to run it. I think a game like LA Noire has the potential to be a big hit among people who would never have a console.\" Booyah \u2013 Jason Willig (November) \"What works on Facebook doesn't necessarily work on mobile. You also have to interpret these experiences in a native way for mobile players, who have different needs to Facebook players.\" Rovio Mobile \u2013 Peter Vesterbacka (October) \"When Mario drives a car, it becomes Mario Kart. When he goes to space, it becomes Super Mario Galaxy... Our birds will do things and go places, and they will go to unexpected places. And some of those places will turn out to be games.\" ustwo \u2013 Mills (October) \"We need to get to the people in the pub. Game Of The Week is fantastic: it tells us we've made something special. But my wife, mum, dad or sisters don't really look at the App Store in that way. They find out about new apps when somebody tells them.\" Sibblingz \u2013 Ben Savage (October) \"Paid apps cannot compete with free apps. You get 17 times as many downloads of a free app as of a 99-cent app, and by giving people the opportunity to pay what they want to pay as many times as they want, you get three times as much money out of those paying users.\" Zynga \u2013 David Ko (September) \"It's one thing many people miss: 'look at this cool function, let's just incorporate it'. They don't ask themselves the key question about whether it's fun. There are things we could use on the device but chose not to, because we don't think it's fun and neither do our players.\" NaturalMotion \u2013 Torstein Reil (September) \"There has been a belief in the industry that casual games are 2D and hardcore games are 3D, but that doesn't make any sense. The reason has been that there was no platform to deploy high-end content to casual users. Flash can't do it. But now smartphones and tablets can.\" Astro Ape Studios \u2013 Chieh Huang (May) \"The devices we're working with are inherently viral, but nobody has found that trick to leverage these features. That includes the companies with billions of dollars of revenue who haven't figured it out yet. Someone's going to unlock these channels one day though.\" Electronic Arts \u2013 Barry Cottle (May) \"The publishing relationship is going to get more and more important as this world continues to fragment and get chaotic. There is real value in publishing not just from a marketing and distribution perspective, but also scale and speed to market.\" MUSIC EMI \u2013 Joshua Saunders (November) \"We're still in an experimental period with pricing for music apps. Maybe somebody will crack the 'iAlbum' concept, but at the moment the consumer appetite doesn't seem to be there for a musical app over five quid.\" Bjork collaborator Scott Snibbe (October) \"An app can demand all of your senses and attention at once. That's something exciting for musicians. A lot of them lament the demise of the album experience due to digital distribution. But one thing about the app-album is it reclaims people's attention for an entire album.\" 955 Dreams \u2013 Kiran Bellubbi (September) \"The definition of a product is if somebody wants to pay for it. If we want to be the next great direct-to-consumer company, the next great product company, we have to charge for our product.\" 8linQ \u2013 Chris Lee (July) \"The music business needs to capture a new audience. Rather than make a game then license the music, this is much more of a partnership. We think there is a great opportunity to leverage the mobile platform to build something that reaches a wider audience, and monetises music.\" SOCIAL Mindings \u2013 Stuart Arnott (December) \"I can go into a shop to buy a burglar alarm, a baby monitor or a blood pressure meter, but where can I buy equipment to help me communicate and look after my family? This is what Mindings can be.\" Facebook \u2013 Bret Taylor (October) \"There is so much innovation in the browser space both on mobile and desktop. HTML5 and the other technologies it represents really exist now because of that competition. Apple, Microsoft, Google and a whole bunch of other companies are investing so much in the browser, and it's so good for the web. Most of our developers are hoping the mobile web becomes a viable platform for their applications.\" Instagram \u2013 Kevin Systrom (September) \"The network really democratises attention: everyone from celebrities to a random guy in Japan taking pictures of his dog every day can get many thousands of followers. Taking images is the great equaliser.\" Taptu \u2013 Mitch Lazar (April) \"If you talk to Android users and look at the Android community, they're so passionate about it. If you serve up something high quality and be loyal to this audience, they'll reward you.\" Socialcam \u2013 Michael Seibel (April) \"YouTube could never control the ingestion point: they always had to use your phone or digital camera or Flip video or webcam. But on smartphones, we suddenly get to leapfrog all those other devices and control the ingestion point, with the potential to reach many more people than Sony or Flip or Panasonic with their dedicated video creation devices.\" APPS FOR KIDS Fingerprint Digital \u2013 Nancy MacIntyre (December) \"A child can send a message to mom, mom can send one back, and suddenly the parent is engaged in the learning. Kids have gotten really excited about that. We want to bring parents into the apps in a way that we think is interesting and clever.\" Mindshapes \u2013 Jinhee Ahn Kim (September) \"These days, teachers have to make learning appealing to the kids who have lots of screen-time at home, whether that's TV, video games or using mobile devices. There's a lot of innovation going on, and it's raising the bar.\" Toca Boca \u2013 Bjorn Jeffery (June) \"There is a time and a place for the pacifier idea, but it's quite a limiting way of looking at the segment. We think you can make these apps as fun for parents as for children, and when the two can play together, it can be a very powerful thing.\" Outfit7 \u2013 Andrej Nabergoj (March) \"When you think about it, Disney was created around a simple idea \u2013 Mickey Mouse \u2013 then went on to TV with a cartoon series that created a franchise. That's something we can do, starting on the mobile platform.\"",
