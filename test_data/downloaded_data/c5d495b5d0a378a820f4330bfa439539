But it's chief executive and co-founder, Ciaran Bollard, wants to be turning over \u00a3100m in revenue before the company reaches 10 years old. The self-described world's first \"only music video social network\" is growing every month, Bollard says, and is confidently tapping into an appetite of advertising against professional online video content and video consumption. \u2022 What's your pitch? \"Muzu.tv is a social network dedicated to music videos, where users can follow all of their favourite bands to get their latest news and watch over 80,000 videos for free. Users can register with Muzu for free to receive personal video recommendations, discover other artists they may like and follow other members with similar tastes. \"They can also stay in touch with the latest music news through a personal activity feed featuring the biggest players and personalities such as Scott Mills, Popbitch and NME. Members can also create and share music video playlists. The Muzu catalogue includes the Official Top 40, live concerts, back-stage footage, documentaries, tutorials, music news and interviews.\" \u2022 How do you make money? \"Muzu works around a premium ad supported model where we share revenue with all content contributors to the site. Bands and artists are making \u00a33 to \u00a34 for every thousand videos watched on Muzu, compared with other video services who generate just 50p. \"We have innovated with formats like in-skin that wrap around the video frame and we don't interrupt the viewing experience for our members whilst generating income for the bands.\" \u2022 How are you surviving the downturn? \"What downturn? On a serious note, we are managing to grow the site by 20% month-on-month and revenues are increasing, which is partly due to the advertiser appetite against professional video content on the web. In addition, TV advertisers are shifting their spend to video as they can track results on their campaign ROI much more effectively.\" \u2022 What's your background? \"Twelve years in sales and marketing in corporate and online companies.\" \u2022 What makes your business unique? \"Muzu has the largest legal music video catalogue on the web and we're the only music video social network. Through our partnerships we're powering music video on some of the biggest sites in the world.\" \u2022 Who in the tech business inspires you? \"Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon. I love his quotes and he revolutionised online shopping and in the early days e-commerce. He also seems to also genuinely support entrepreneurial spirit.\" \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? \"Matching scale with revenues and having adequate resources to support that growth.\" \u2022 What's the most important web tool that you use each day? \"Sounds obvious but I use search engines the most every day, but I do go through fads with different tools and gadgets. Facebook Places is a pretty nifty new feature that I'm using a lot since its launch.\" \u2022 Name your closest competitors \"YouTube, MTV and Vevo.\" \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? \"In five years I hope our strongest selling point will be the portability of the Muzu experience across IPTV, gaming, mobile and as many emerging platforms and devices as possible. We'll own the market in Europe first and after that, world domination! We want Muzu to be a household name and turning over \u00a3100m in revenue.\" \u2022 Sell to Google, or be bigger than Google? \"Maybe not Google but certainly the internet majors could help get us to market domination more quickly!\"",
