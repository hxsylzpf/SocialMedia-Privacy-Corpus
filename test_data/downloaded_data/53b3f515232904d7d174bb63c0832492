  "content": "Until a couple of days ago, I thought Spock was just a Vulcan with pointy ears. Then a colleague invited me to join Spock.com, an intriguing mix of search engine and networking site. Spock (\"single point of contact by keyword\") works on the basis that around a third of internet searches are for information on people, and that those doing the searching are often linked in some way to the person they are looking up. Searching for someone on a standard search engine can throw up literally millions of pages. Sifting through such results in search of the right info can be a thankless task. Spock is a search engine purely for people: the beauty of its algorithms is that searching for, say, Tom Grey offers a list of all the Tom Greys it has indexed and each profile comes with its own tag cloud. You can quickly work out which Tom Grey is the one you want; clicking on their profile shows you a list of links to all the relevant websites connected to them. Spock is still in beta, but has already indexed more than 100 million people who are on the internet. Its stated aim is to index everyone. Big Brotherish? Not really. If you already have a website or are mentioned on one, then you're already logged in many places, including most search engines and the Wayback Machine. All Spock does is gather that data in one place. I was stunned to find that Spock had already indexed more than a dozen websites linked to me. Registering on Spock enabled me to \"claim\" my profile. I can now add my own tags about myself and website URLs that are of relevance. Having that control reassured me in a way that other search engines never could. In this era of ID theft, though, I stopped short of adding my photo, date of birth and other personal info when invited. Spock offers huge possibilities for anyone whose profession means they use contacts as everyday currency. Searching Spock's tags is faster and far more efficient than trawling Google. And, as with networking sites such as LinkedIn or Facebook, you can connect to people on Spock through people you know. You can vote on the relevance of their tags and websites - each vote enhances the relevance of future searches by adjusting rankings. The more people that use it and add information, the easier it will become to find whoever you are looking for. People-hunting on the net has finally become logical. Pros: Self-tagging, good degree of control once you claim your profile Cons: Be wary of adding too much personal information",
