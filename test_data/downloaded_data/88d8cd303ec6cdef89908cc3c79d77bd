  "content": "Phoebe Prince moved with her family from Fanore, Ireland to Massachusetts in September 2009. She died only months later after killing herself. Prince was 15. Her death occurred after a relentless campaign of bullying by a group of students from her school, South Hadley high school. The bullying she endured was both face-to-face during school hours as well as online on her Facebook page. After her death, the hounding did not end and malicious messages were posted on the Phoebe Prince Facebook memorial page. Although the bullying was witnessed by school staff, they did not intervene \u2013 even during school hours. I don't believe there is any reason why overt bullying should not be confronted, but the more insidious form of online abuse \u2013 or cyberbullying as it is known \u2013 is more covert and difficult to challenge. With the rapid growth of new forms of communication and social networking technology comes the potential growth of abuse perpetrated on such systems. Experts define cyberbullying as a young person being repeatedly tormented, threatened, harassed, humiliated, or otherwise targeted by another child or teenager using text messaging, email, instant messaging or any other type of digital technology. The practice is not limited to children but distinction in age groups is usually marked by a different choice of words: the adult experience of online abuse is usually referred to as cyberstalking or cyberharassment. The National Centre for Social Research undertook a study on cyberbullying in November 2009, involving 15,000 children. The study examined the characteristics of bullying victims in secondary schools in England between the ages of 14 and 16, and found that cyberbullying was the most common form of abuse endured by children along with name-calling. In other words, online abuse happens more often than being threatened with violence face to face, being socially excluded and being subjected to actual violence. The complete results of the study, due to be published in May, also found that vulnerable pupils and girls were more likely to be bullied, and that parental awareness helped to reduce bullying. This week, Professor Tanya Byron has published a review on her 2008 report Safer Children in a Digital World. Key successes that were highlighted in the progress report include the creation of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, a coalition of government, charities and industry working in collaboration for the good of children and families. Likewise, the Zip it, block it, flag it campaign, a public awareness campaign for parents which also unveiled a ground-breaking internet safety strategy, is also a step in the right direction, but much work still needs to be undertaken. New recommendations include ensuring that industries expedite work on a self-regulated code of practice without delay in order to keep pace with the changes in new technologies, such as Wi-Fi access on mobile phones: if young people use wireless technology to surf the internet on their phones, parental controls can easily be bypassed. Children are usually far more erudite than their parents, and can find ways to disable any restrictions. Byron maintains that the UK is the world leader in child internet safety, but also stated that the government and industry need to make faster progress in delivery of policy and actions because the issues may have profound consequences for young people. Raising young peoples' awareness about social skills, group mechanisms, motives for bullying, being effective bystanders and how they may be drawn into the bullying process is crucial, and I believe the causal factors of cyberbullying should be included as part of a whole-school response to bullying. In the US, Prince's death has received national attention and instigated the legislature to act. On 11 March, the Senate approved an anti-bullying bill requiring an anti-bullying curriculum and authorisation for school principals to report bullies to the police. In Prince's case, the school authorities knew she was enduring brutal bullying yet they did nothing to intervene. What a sad waste of a young life.",
