  "content": "Depression is common, disabling and increasing in prevalence. Many people suffer in silence, don't get much empathy or sympathy and, if and when they do ask for help, they may find medication more frequently offered than psychological therapy. This may be changing, but not fast enough. I have just recently started responding to people's questions about depression online. While I am a doctor, I am an unusual one in that I am more interested in health than sickness and very interested in positive conceptions of mental health and human flourishing. So what I do may not even be medicine in the traditional sense; it's very much more a coaching, guiding approach. I am not an expert on medication, and won't be commenting about specific medications. My role, as I see it, is to empathise (an almost universal good, but harder to do online than face to face), share information in a non-judgmental way, share options, and encourage feelings of autonomy, optimism and competence. Hope is something many people with depression lack, along with motivation \u2013 but both of these things can be increased over time via skilful conversation. Online chat, discussion and support provides many other benefits to depressed people \u2013 feelings of connectedness, not being judged, reassurance that things can and do get better over time, or that the painful or empty feelings of depression can be tolerated. Social networks have emerged as an accessible platform on which people are able to connect with like-minded individuals. Black Dog Tribe, the social site co-founded by Ruby Wax who has spoken publicly about her life-long battle with depression, uses this social space to encourage people to talk, share experiences and, most importantly, recognise that they are not alone in their depression. Being part of a community provides access to information, advice and a supportive network of people who can understand and empathise with what is still, unfortunately, a largely misunderstood illness in mainstream society. For those with an illness that exacerbates feelings of isolation, this is vital. While it is important that those with depression have a safe haven in which to share their issues with a trusted community, making use of the more mainstream sites of Facebook and Twitter may amplify previously hidden anguish. It brings conversations about depression out into the public sphere where information then has the potential to trickle down to people who have little understanding of the illness and also those who may not realise that they too are suffering. But these open platforms have seen high profile people such as the former footballer Stan Collymore and the political aide Alastair Campbell bringing attention to the illness through moving personal testimonies. It all helps to raise awareness, tackle the stigma associated with depression and promote the message that people need not suffer in silence. There is so much bullshit out there about mental health and mental illness, I suspect people are ready for an accessible and helpful resource where they can share experiences, concerns and feelings, learn about new things and explore issues without feeling judged or told what to do. Psychiatry hasn't had the impact it thinks it has and we really do need to find a better way to heal troubled souls. Dr Tim Anstiss is a medical doctor focusing on health and wellbeing improvement. He will be offering advice on Ruby Wax's mental health social media site Black Dog Tribe at 4pm each day during Depression Awareness Week. This article is published by Guardian Professional.
