  "content": "A 27-year-old man from Elgin in Morayshire will appear in court on Monday after a computer hacking inquiry by British and US authorities. The man was detained after raids yesterday morning at two addresses in the north-east of Scotland. The investigation involved alleged \"denial of service\" attacks, which attempt to disrupt a computer network by flooding it with useless traffic. Police said the arrest had come amid an investigation into an alleged attempt to extort a \"significant quantity of money\" from companies around the world. Computer equipment was removed from the scene of yesterday's raids. Agents from the US secret service are to question the 27-year-old as part of the joint inquiry, known as Operation Caspar, along with their Scottish counterparts. The probe was spearheaded in Scotland by the hi-tech crime unit of the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency, which deals with serious crime. Detective Chief Superinten dent Stephen Ward, of the SDEA, said: \"Operation Casper has involved the SDEA working closely with the US secret service and is an excellent example of how law enforcement agencies, working together, can impact on internet-related crime. The man is expected to appear at Elgin sheriff court on Monday.",
