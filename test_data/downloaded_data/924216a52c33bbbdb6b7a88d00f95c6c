But who would have guessed that the trailblazer of modern living - Facebook - would be so slow? Users can specify their status as single, married, engaged or \"in a relationship\". In fact, Facebook will even let you say you are \"in an open relationship\" or simply acknowledge that \"it's complicated\". But civil partnerships are not on the menu, despite the fact that nearly 13,000 people have joined the site's campaigning group to get this changed. Even the health minister Ben Bradshaw, himself in a civil partnership, has joined the campaign. It is, says Bradshaw, \"very disappointing that Facebook still doesn't include civil partnerships\". Indeed, many users are so frustrated that they have closed their accounts in protest. \"I had emails back and forth with them about this issue. I cancelled my account for a while because I was so wound up with their refusal to engage in a proper discussion,\" says 43-year-old Toni Lebusque, who entered into a civil partnership last March. \"The option of 'married' does not cover the situation. If it did, I'd be married, not civil partnered.\" So is Facebook prepared to move with the times and recognise this legal distinction? \"Our current relationship status options allow anyone, regardless of gender, to choose whether they are single, in a relationship, engaged or married,\" says a spokesperson in Silicon Valley. \"We do, however, understand that many people may want to define their personal relationship(s) beyond a drop-down option, so we also provide additional ways within a user's profile that allows them to express and describe their life situations, including their relationship status.\" The answer appears to be no, then. You may be able to clarify your situation, but you're still forced to tick the wrong box in the first place.",
