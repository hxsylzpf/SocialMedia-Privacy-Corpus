  "content": "A reconstituted Press Complaints Commission should be subject to oversight by the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom if the press cannot agree a credible package of reforms, a special cross-party committee of MPs and peers set up by the prime minister will recommend in the next few days. The recommendation \u2013 a brush with statutory regulation for the first time in over 300 years \u2013 is understood to be one of the recommendations agreed on Monday at a stormy final session of parliament's privacy and injunctions committee, a joint Commons and Lords body created by David Cameron just over a year ago. Lord Hunt and the newspaper industry will be left to devise their own reform proposals, but if the committee's recommendation were to be taken up by Lord Justice Leveson and the government, the idea would be that statutory regulator Ofcom could be brought with powers to force the new-look PCC to report to it annually. Committee members had first considered proposing that Ofcom have automatic oversight of the successor to the PCC, in the belief that the body's failture to expose the phone-hacking scandal and other examples of press intrustion meant that self-regulation was no longer tenable. That idea was voted down, but a majority of members did not want simply to endorse self-regulation again because it would amount to parliament saying that the press was \"in the last chance saloon\" all over again. Towards the end of the three-and-a-half hour meeting, it was agreed that Hunt should told that Ofcom could be brought in if his work was not deemed to be credible. Chaired by John Whittingdale, the body has yet to agree a date when its inquiry will be published. Its recommendations are not binding, but they will impact on the debate on press standards as the Leveson inquiry continues. Lord Justice Leveson, who has also been encouraging Lord Hunt, will make his own recommendations on the subject towards the end of the year. So far, Lord Hunt has proposed a modest package of reforms for the successor to the PCC, with a standards arm to undertake general investigations in addition to the mediation service backed up by a contractual system through which the new body could potentially levy fines. However, few believe that the Hunt proposals are, as yet, enough to command widespread support given the catalogue of complaints the Leveson inquiry has heard from the subjects of press intrusion, including Chris Jefferies, wrongly tagged as the murderer of Joanna Yeates in Bristol, or the Dowler family, whose murdered daughter Milly was targeted by News of the World phone hacking. Many Fleet Street titles, of all types, have long been hostile to statutory regulation, of the kind that applies to broadcasting, because it would imply unwarranted state intervention into free speech. But most have submitted to some voluntary self regulation \u2013 but that approach has been undermined, not just by the phone hacking controversy but also by the refusal of Richard Desmond to sign up to the PCC. Newspapers have not been subject to any direct statutory regulation since licensing was abolished in 1695. By contrast, Ofcom has considerable regulatory powers, monitoring taste and decency on television and radio \u2013 as well as assessing if a particular company or individual is a \"fit and proper\" person to hold a TV licence. The regulator is already examining whether News Corp is a fit and proper shareholder in BSkyB in the light of the phone-hacking revelations. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
