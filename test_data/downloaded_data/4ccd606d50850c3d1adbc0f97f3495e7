  "content": "When I started a Twitter account for the food bank I volunteer for it felt like a small, but bold move. Every week we were spending much needed funding on basic items \u2013 like UHT milk, tea bags and sugar \u2013 that weren't being donated. By setting up a Twitter account, I thought we would be able to let our local community know what we were short of, in real time. We could tell people what we needed and they'd know where they could make the most difference with their donations. We had nothing to lose \u2013 so I started to tweet. Our first tentative tweet in January was for custard. The tweet went out, our Facebook feed shared it, and we waited. We had nine followers but that tweet was retweeted seven times, and in Twitter analytics terms, received 431 impressions. Our small town in the High Peak has 10,000 people, and we're a very small foodbank; so to us it felt significant. Just 10 tins would be enough to tide us over and stop us having to dip into much needed funds. A week later, not much had changed, custard was still in short supply and I thought the Twitter account was a stupid idea, a failure. However, it seemed there was a timelag between tweeting stock shortages and tins arriving. The next week I was able to tweet with genuine gratitude (and relief) as custard started to arrive. A couple of months later, in April, we appealed via Twitter and Facebook for tinned potatoes and the local Co-op shelf was emptied and an entire box had been put in the food bank donation bin. Since we started tweeting requests, the difference in spending has been palpable. We've hardly had to shop this year, when previously we had been spending \u00a340 a week filling in the gaps. Our funds come from gifts and grants, and we want to ensure they are used responsibly and in the best way for our beneficiaries. Management of our stocks is one way we can make money work harder. We keep our followers updated with what we lack, we let them know when things are going well, and despite saying thank you with nearly every tweet, it still doesn't feel like we've said it enough. Six months on, I know to have patience and confidence, our small town always steps up when there's a need. I learned that Twitter is not about the number of followers, it's about the number of tins. The reaction to our appeals is overwhelming. It makes me feel that I \u2013 and the food bank \u2013 am held safely in the embrace of a true community, where together we make sure that the most basic of human needs, to eat, is met. Local businesses contact us via our social media accounts to drop off food donations their staff have made, or to offer us surplus tins, and almost every time I swallow the lump in my throat from the kindness I witness. I love this town. The day I made a difference is the Guardian Voluntary Sector Network's series that showcases the work of people involved with charities.
