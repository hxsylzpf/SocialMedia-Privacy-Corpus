  "content": "Local authorities in the Austrian town of Amstetten, tiring of the antics of British photographers trying to get pictures of the Fritzl family, are threatening to make a formal complaint to the UK's press regulator. More than 20 photographers have been caught trying to sneak into Amstetten-Mauer psychiatric clinic, where Elisabeth Fritzl and her family are receiving treatment, in a bid to get the first exclusive picture, according to local police and hospital officials. The story of Elisabeth Fritzl, who was locked in a secret cellar dungeon and repeatedly raped by her father, Josef, over 24 years, having seven children by him during that period, has resulted in hundreds of media organisations sending staff to Amstetten. Heinz Lenze, a senior Amstetten local authority official, said he had now instructed police to take down the personal details of all photographers caught trying to get into the clinic and where possible to make a complaint to the relevant press regulation bodies. Lenze said British photographers were being singled out because they were the main perpetrators, although journalists from other countries have also been stopped from trying to gain entry to the clinic. He added that he was looking into making a formal complaint about the activities of UK photo-journalists to the Press Complaints Commmission. \"We have been in touch with the Press Complaints Commission who have said they can accept complaints about British journalists operating abroad, and that sneaking into hospital dressed as cleaners or policemen would definitely fit in their remit,\" Lenze said. \"From now on, names will be passed on as soon as we have them,\" he added. The director of the Amstetten-Mauer psychiatric clinic has made appeals for the family's right to privacy to be respected - but so far with little success as photographers are still being caught trying to gain access to the hospital. Until now, police or private security guards have not been taking the names of the photographers escorted from the grounds of the clinic. They include one who had dug a hole in the ground, stocked it with provisions and covered himself with a bird watcher's hide. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
