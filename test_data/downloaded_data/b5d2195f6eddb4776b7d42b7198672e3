  "content": "Just in case you wondered why your newsfeed on Facebook is suddenly full of celebrities: It's Doppelganger Week on Facebook. The unofficial trend is obviously going viral, since users all over the world have started swapping their profile picture for portraits of famous people they think they look like. Since the beginning of the week the following Facebook status update showed up on in more and more friends newsfeeds. \"It's Doppelg\u00e4nger week on Facebook; change your profile picture to someone famous (actor, musician, athlete, etc.) you have been told you look like. After you update your profile with your twin or switched at birth photo then cut/paste this to your status.\" Meanwhile, more and more users all over the world have swapped their profile picture for an image of a celebrity double. For those with no clue who their lookalikes are, MyHeritage jumped on the bandwagon and created a page that helps finding your Doppelganger celeb. Otherwise you can ask the Doppelganger Week Fanpage for twin suggestions, and there is Doppelganger of the week, too. As it befits a viral movement, its origin is unknown. The interview on the Huffington Post with a game designer who is claiming responsibility for CDW - \"It all started when the guys at work started teasing me that I look like Tom Selleck,\" - is without any proof or cross-checking. However, it is a coincidence that Facebook recently published an interview with the psychologist Sam Gosling saying: \"Facebook profiles correlate pretty strongly with our measure of what that person is really like, and that measure consists of both how the profile owner sees him or herself and how that profile owner's friends see the profile owner.\" Sam Gosling, by the way, hasen't changed his Facebook profile yet. Anyway, he doesn't need to as he looks like Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins, and already has a witty fanpage.",
