  "content": "Lawyers for Kate Middleton, Prince William's girlfriend, appear to have succeeded in persuading photographers to stop harassing her. Only two photographers were outside her flat today, according to radio reports, compared with 20 that appeared yesterday to photograph her on her 25th birthday. But a small crowd of reporters turned up outside her West London flat to monitor the number of photographers staking out her home. Today the Daily Star, owned by Express Newspapers, was the only newspaper to use a paparazzi picture, from the celebrity and paparazzi agency Solarpix. The Daily Mail, owned by Associated Newspapers, refused to publicly back News International's ban on publishing paparazzi photographs of Ms Middleton. In a statement today the Daily Mail said: \"The PCC has very strict guidelines in respect of privacy, harassment and photographing individuals. \"As always the Daily Mail will respect both the letter and spirit of those rules. It will do nothing likely to cause distress or upset to Miss Kate Middleton and will always act responsibly in respect of any photographs taken of her.\" But the Mail was at pains to point out that it did not publish any paparazzi photographs of Ms Middleton today, in a caption that stated that its photographs were \"taken yesterday by the Press Association, AP and the respected Getty Images\". Yesterday Express Newspapers said all its papers exercised \"caution and restraint on pictures of Kate Middleton\" whether taken by paparazzi, agency or staff photographers. \"We would want to make all our decisions on what pictures to use in a spirit of respect for Kate Middleton, the royal family, and indeed many other individuals whom we show as part of our news coverage,\" a spokesman said. Today the Daily Express used pictures \"taken by the respected Press Association\". The Guardian used a photograph of paparazzi lined up outside her home taken by Getty Images and the Times used a Press Association photograph. The Sun and Daily Telegraph used a stock photograph of Kate Middleton taken at Prince William's passing out ceremony at Sandhurst. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
