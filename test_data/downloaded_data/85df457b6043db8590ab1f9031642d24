  "content": "Donald Trump is not the only politician who enjoys writing 140-character diatribes. For some time now, former Mexican president Vicente Fox has been using the platform to directly challenge, and troll, the new US president. As press secretary Sean Spicer insisted \"Mexico will pay\" for the border wall, Fox made his views clear: #FuckingWall then began trending worldwide. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, he repeated: \"I have said and I have told the Donald, that Mexico will never pay for that fucking wall. And now I have to repeat it to this guy Sean Spicer.\" Since Trump announced his plans for a wall between Mexico and the US during his campaign trail, Fox has been vocal in his opposition to the \"racist monument\". And he has been robust in the language he uses to do so, both on Twitter and in video interviews. Of course, Fox's expletive-laden criticism did not escape Trump's notice. He tweeted back in February 2016 that Fox \"must apologise\" for swearing while discussing the wall. Fox doubled down, repeating: \"I am not going to pay for that fucking wall\" on live television. Ever since, the former president of Mexico has used Trump's favourite means of communication to challenge and mock Trump and his wall: In an interview with BuzzFeed, Fox said of Trump: \"I understood Hitler, I understood Napoleon, I understand a lot of very violent ones. This one I don't understand.\" The current president of Mexico Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has also said his country will not pay for the wall \u2013 though he did not swear or start an internationally trending hashtag while doing so.",
