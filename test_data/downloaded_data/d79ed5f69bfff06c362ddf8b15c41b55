  "content": "Reid Hoffman, the former PayPal pioneer turned Web 2.0 investor, has taken back control of the business networking site LinkedIn, which he founded in 2002. He's kicked out CEO Dan Nye after less than two years to take back the job and brought in former Yahoo Jeff Weiner to help. What's the benefit? It's not entirely clear, but a back-rubbing profile from Business Week last month might give you an insight into what Weiner's job is likely to involve: To guide LinkedIn, Hoffman and the bard hired the veteran software executive Nye last year. Hoffman, who admits to a chaotic management style, stayed on as board chairman and director of product development. Part of his CEO job, Nye says, is 'wrestling to get the thinking out of Reid's head, package it, and get it to other people.\" Given the current economic climate \u2013 when so many people are looking for jobs, or at least looking to market themselves just in case \u2013 you'd imagine LinkedIn would do pretty well (that's certainly the way the company has been painting it). So what's going on here? Perhaps things haven't been going quite so well after all, or perhaps Hoffman fancies a bit of CEO glory. Whatever the case, we hope that Weiner does a better job of wrestling with Hoffman than Nye did. Perhaps they can take some lessons from cinema's greatest wrasslers, Olly Reed and Alan Bates?
