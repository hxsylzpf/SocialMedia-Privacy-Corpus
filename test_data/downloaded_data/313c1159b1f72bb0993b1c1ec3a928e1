  "content": "Julian Le Grand is a former adviser to Tony Blair, a London School of Economics academic and a contributor to that statist and authoritarian organ Prospect magazine. All of which may explain why he suggested in a lecture, this week, that people who have children out of wedlock, should be automatically married by the state to stop them splitting up. There are obvious difficulties in Le Grand's notion. What happens when a woman bears children fathered by different men, or doesn't know who the father is? What does the state do when the couple have fallen out badly and state wedlock might lead to violence? What happens when the woman wants the baby but not the man? How does the state decide who the father is? Enforced paternity tests? The word of the mother? Or does his plan slot into place after the legislation for a national DNA database containing all our genetic profiles? If people are going to be involuntarily married by the state, why would anyone bother to make the decision to marry themselves? Surely Le Grand's idea would deprive people of the responsibility of making this profoundly important commitment themselves, perhaps the most important commitment of their lives. And what would that say about the state's view of the individual? Clearly Le Grand's belief is that the individual is no more than an awkward unit of management who must be trained, chivvied, nudged, stroked and pressed into making things easier for the authorities, all of which is classic New Labour nannyism. Le Grand, who also advocates that smokers apply for a permit before they are allowed to purchase cigarettes, calls himself a libertarian paternalist, a foxy little contradiction in terms that I am sure he loves to tell you about over a glass of elderflower cordial. In fact he is a straightforward martinet, dedicated to the cause of making people sacrifice their own individuality, needs and wishes in the service of a smooth running state. State interference in the personal sphere has been around for long time \u2013 women became baby machines under the Nazis while anyone who could walk was doing physical training at the crack of dawn \u2013 but Le Grand's nannyism comes without any ideology, just the creepy conviction that he and his fellow New Labour thinkers know best how to run our lives. Let me suggest an alternative, which is to give people as much responsibility for their lives as possible. Education and family life should be dedicated to teaching children how to make up their own minds and how to live with their decisions. That is what liberty is about. Here is a quotation from Wolfgang Sofsky's Privacy: A Manifesto, which I will review when I return from holiday in a couple of weeks. A regime always ultimately seeks to restrict freedom, no matter what reason it gives for doing so. The total state wants to guide society and educate its citizens. New rules and regulations are constantly being imposed on everyday life\u2026 The politics of prohibition has long since invaded areas in which the potential damage is either a private matter or at most a matter of opinion.",
