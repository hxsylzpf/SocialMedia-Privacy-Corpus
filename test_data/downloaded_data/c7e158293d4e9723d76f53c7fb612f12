  "content": "Whose idea was it? The identity-card plan has a long history. Michael Howard was in favour in his days as home secretary in the 1990s and, when Labour came to power, Jack Straw floated that idea of a \"citizen's access card\". After the September 11 attacks in 2001, David Blunkett, the then-home secretary, began to promote it heavily, although it took him some time to persuade his cabinet colleagues. What are the cards supposed to achieve? Home secretaries such as Howard and Blunkett have been attracted to identity cards as a weapon in the fight against crime, and some police organisations are in favour on these grounds too. It has been argued that identity cards could help the authorities target terrorists, serious criminals using false identities, welfare fraudsters and illegal immigrants. But the government now puts far less emphasis on this argument, partly because the terrorists involved in 9/11 and 7/7 were not using false identities and partly because cards would only work as anti-crime devices if they were compulsory, which raises another problem altogether (see below). Increasingly ministers now argue that identity cards will serve as a consumer facility for people who need to prove their identity when opening bank accounts, etc. What powers does the government have? The main enabling legislation, the Identity Cards Act, went through parliament two years ago and is now law. But it gave ministers considerable discretion as to how they implement the scheme. Gordon Brown has also said that parliament will vote before the introduction of a compulsory scheme. What does the scheme involve? More than just having a bit of plastic. The identity card itself would be linked to a national identity database which would contain dozens of pieces of information, such as photographs, national insurance numbers, dates of birth and addresses. It would also include biometric information \u2013 fingerprints. When will they come in? Foreigners from outside the EU will need to register their biometric details from later this year. From 2009 the scheme will be extended to people working in high-risk areas, such as airports. From 2010 they will be offered to students. And from 2011 they will be offered to people renewing their passports. Why students? The government believes that they will be attracted by the idea of having identity cards because, as they open bank accounts and rent property, they have a particular need to be able to prove their identity. Will the cards be compulsory? They will be for non-EU migrants and for workers in high-risk areas. For British citizens they will not exactly be compulsory, but it will be impossible to get a passport without putting your details on the database, so, in practice, for anyone wanting to travel abroad, they will be. Will the database be safe? That depends who you believe. The government says that the information will only be accessible to \"highly security-cleared individuals\". But the recent security lapses with data have highlighted how easy it is for things to go wrong and today's revelations about the problems with fingerprints for those over the age of 75 have illustrated another potential problem.",
