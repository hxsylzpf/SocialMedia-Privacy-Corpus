  "content": "It has been a distressing and troubling period for those of us who struggle to maintain a meaningful relationship with social media and internet technology. The revelation that Facebook had undertaken a grotesque experiment in mind-bending and emotional manipulation by altering the news feeds of around 700,000 of its users in 2012 has been greeted with some outrage. Then we discovered that prominent people are beginning to deploy some arcane European privacy legislation to force Google to \"forget\" about their historical misdemeanours. Thus references to an American financier Stan O'Neal who helped drive his bank to ruination in 2007 were \"deleted\". (In truth, they are not deleted; instead Google hides specific articles for specific searches; and you can get round it by using google.com). The behaviour of Facebook is particularly sinister, yet is not in the least surprising. It is simply the conduct of a vast empire and its operatives who have become so detached from reality that they view its users in the same way that we view battery hens. It resembles the horrific secret that slowly reveals itself in the course of Michel Faber's modern masterpiece, Under the Skin. Only the fact that governments and their corporate partners have been manipulating our behaviour and kidnapping our senses for decades prevents me from being truly appalled by Facebook's behaviour. I was finally persuaded to sign up to Facebook a few months ago, seduced by the way that it allows families and friends to reach out to each other through decades and over continents. Thus far, it has been a benign and friendly diversion, but I fear that our relationship is beginning to fray and that it is bringing out the curmudgeonly worst in me. At first, the desire of many decent and informed people to post pictures of their cats and dogs (but especially their cats) was simply a small curiosity to me. Now I'm beginning to wonder if we are all becoming mesmerised by these sly, furry finks and if they are mounting a bid for world supremacy. I only just resisted the temptation the other day to reply to yet another picture of a cat posted by a friend that we owe a debt to canals for keeping the feline population down. Another chap, not someone I would have associated with excessive emotional outpourings, has been proclaiming undying love for the woman in his life in the sort of prose that makes me think he too has been abducted by aliens. And then there's the health and fitness brigade and the pictures they post endlessly of their adventures. It seems that Scotland has been taken over by shaven-headed chaps whose goal in life is finally to turn themselves into a human version of the Swan Vestas match. The women meanwhile are running up mountains and swimming to Greenland and back in a day. I know they'll all be running half-marathons in their 70s and teaching their grandchildren how to hang-glide in the Andes while I'm being fed soup in a day hall and singing the Harry Hood song in my demented slumbers. But at least I won't be posting pictures of it. My dark and cynical side, though, is beginning to materialise and I don't like it at all. Thus recently I've been scouring friends' timelines looking to add unwelcome sarcasm and scorn to all the gaiety, enthusiasm and affection. And I realise with mounting horror that this is how real people with normal lives interact with each other and that it is I who am out of step once more. So I fear I may soon have to conclude my Facebook experiment before I alienate that dwindling band of those who still regard me with some fondness. The dawning realisation that people are seeking to exfoliate their personal narratives by forcing Google and other internet search engines to extinguish references to past crimes and misdemeanours is also puzzling. This development along with Leveson has made it inevitable that, within a generation, our political leaders will be protected from all scrutiny of their wrongdoings. Yet surely the best way for a celebrity or politician to deter interest in those places they'd rather conceal is simply to make a virtue of it. A better way to avoid scrutiny of the darker passages of our life's narrative would be to confess all and also add in a few juicy inventions. By doing this, they could sue the arses off anyone who repeated them as fact. My own life has not always been a bowl of cherries and there have been times where I have behaved in a shameful and irresponsible manner. I've never really sought to conceal the mortal sins I've committed but here's a few others that ought to be taken into consideration before the firing squad is assembled. Sometimes when the notion takes me I decide to send texts to myself that say \"C'mon the al quaeda\". I do this in the childish hope that they may occupy some Pentagon intelligence goons for a few minutes, which means they have less time to be sending drones to slaughter Iraqi wedding receptions. In fact, come to think of it, wouldn't it be interesting if several thousand of us did it all at the same time? How jolly that could be. Many years ago, when I was a student and down to the last few joints, I would take to crashing expensive-looking funerals gleaned from the death notices of the old Glasgow Herald. This was really, really easy to do because funerals are where strangers are always welcome as they add lustre to the deceased's memory in the minds of his loved ones. There was always a good feed to be had and the probability of free booze. And, yes, there was also the possibility of meeting a well-to-do divorced lady of a certain age who might be willing to ease the fiscal tensions of the final term. During this time, too, it was relatively simple to claim housing benefit while subletting my student flat over the summer for nothing to the mendicant men who drank under the bridge in exchange for some of their Giro Party cargo (a dozen cans of Tennent's Super each Tuesday). I am not proud of these sins and crave forgiveness and absolution.",
