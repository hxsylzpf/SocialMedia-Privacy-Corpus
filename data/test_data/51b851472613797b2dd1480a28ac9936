  "content": "\u2022 It's been a little while since we last wrote about Wikipedia, but here's something big: a whole slew of changes are coming for the site, including a new look, new layout and new features. The idea is to make it easier to read pages, edit pages and encourage users - any thoughts on whether it will work? \u2022 It's three years since one of the biggest credit card heists in US history, which saw the owner of TK Maxx lose the credit card details for 46m customers. Now one of the hackers responsible has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for his part in the scam. That's not all, though - he's due to be sentenced for two more counts relating to the same spree. \u2022 And time to sign off and let you dash towards the weekend with some amazing Photoshop skillz. This video of the upcoming content-aware fill - a tool that understands what's around it and fills in the gaps appropriately. Skip to about halfway through the video to see it really get going. I feel a bit dizzy from watching it, to be honest. Au revoir. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, @gdngames or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
