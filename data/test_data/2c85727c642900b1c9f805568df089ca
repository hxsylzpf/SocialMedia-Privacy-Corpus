  "content": "Professor Green announced this week that he had \"had his fill of Twitter\" \u2013 and then erased his timeline. Once applauded by the Observer and Lauren Laverne as one of the top people to follow on Twitter, the rapper confessed he had become bored by his own tweets, which publish details of his sleeping patterns and hygiene habits. His profile went black and silent as he erased all of his previous tweets and unfollowed the 1,600 people who 'clutter up [his] timeline' \u2013 and yet it seems he's finding it hard to let go completely, and as of last night seemed to be braced for a full-blown return. The rapper has stated that it is not Twitter that is at fault, but the people who use it incorrectly. Perhaps he needs some inspiration? Who would you nominate as the best tweeters in the music world? Can you provide Professor Green with some inspiration? Share the best tweets and tweeters you follow in the comments below."
