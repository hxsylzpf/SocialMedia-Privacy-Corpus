  "content": "Day 7, Sunday 5 December Guardian \u2022 The US is worried that China could be planning internet warfare via private companies that are known to have recruited top hackers. \u2022 China's \"newly pugnacious\" foreign policy is \"losing friends worldwide\", the US ambassador to Beijing argued in a cable. \u2022 Hillary Clinton, talking to Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, referred to China as \"your banker\", illustrating America's deep anxiety over China's growing economic power and hold on US finances. \u2022 Rolls-Royce lost a lucrative contract to supply helicopter engines to the Spanish military because of a personal intervention by Spain's prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Zapatero, following vigorous lobbying from US diplomats, according to a secret cable from the US embassy in Madrid. Der Spiegel \u2022 US diplomats in Vienna expressed \"frustration\", disappointment and concern about Austria's politicians. \u2022 There is an unexpected culture of consensus within China's all-powerful, 24-strong Communist party politburo, according to US diplomats in Beijing. \u2022 The American embassy in Beijing has been compiling information on Xi Jinping, the man expected to become China's next president. \u2022 Cables from the US embassy in Baghdad paint a picture of bewildered diplomats outmanoeuvred by the Iranians. Le Monde \u2022 US diplomats in Iraq were briefed about the last moments of Saddam Hussein after his execution in December 2006. \u2022 Brazil and the US are divided as to how to deal with Venezuela's president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez."
