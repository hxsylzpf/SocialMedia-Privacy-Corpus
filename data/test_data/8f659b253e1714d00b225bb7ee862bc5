  "content": "On Friday morning the world woke up to reports of an earthquake in Kent \u2013 and their Twitter feeds stuffed full of the same jokes endlessly retweeted. There have been no reports of injuries or structural damage, so the 4.2-magnitude quake in the garden of England is ripe for ridicule. And as with any other underwhelming natural event, everyone on Twitter is making the same joke involving garden furniture or upturned wheelie bins: Note that the above wheelie bin is actually a Cardiff council wheelie bin. Which is not in Kent, in case you didn't know. Then there were the jokes about the joke. It's clearly a beloved part of British Twitter by now, given similar pictures crop up every time there is an underwhelming natural event. Long to the short, Twitter is a bit like Inception right now. With less dramatic music. And more wheelie bins. As you were."
