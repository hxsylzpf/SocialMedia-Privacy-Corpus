  "content": "It's a simple fact of the internet that whenever anything happens online, social media gurus will find a way to make it worse. Maybe one day science will build a drill powerful enough to explore the subterranean dirt kingdom from which they emerge, but until then we can only speculate. \"Social media expert\" is such a nebulous term that we must know them by their works, sort of like Satan. And what more perfect format to examine those works than the Twitter biography? If you use your real name online, your Twitter bio is one of the first things someone Googling you will come across (unless you're really unlucky and they find your ancient LiveJournal instead). I've seen it likened to a resume, but its pithy format makes it closer to a 21st century business card. Traditionally, business cards were designed and produced according to the directions of one's employer. A business card identifies someone as belonging to an organisation, and confers a formalised professional status based on that membership. Oh, right, John Smith, the director of industry down at Business Corporation. Those guys produce some great products and/or services! The Twitter bio, by contrast, is supposed to be a reflection of your personal brand, the Trademarked You; rather than each of us being able to rely on the cachet of professional affiliation, we are each required to be our own public relations department. Recognising this transfer of labour from organisations to individuals is crucial to understanding the true humour to be found in the Twitter bio. All the funniest examples of the genre conform to a standard format, which you can see generated ad infinitum on this generator site: What The Fuck Is My Twitter Bio? For example: \"Zynga warlock, virtual reality troll, gaming guru. Aspiring stand up comic.\" \"Digital media editrix, digital strat executive, Facebook hacktivist. You must be the change you wish to see in the world.\" \"Quora pundit, Chrome thought leader, creative captain. Freegan.\" And so on. Short phrases separated by commas, intending to convey a sense of value and distinction, but which actually make the person sound like they used a Twitter bio generator. Bonus points if it contains a dull, misattributed quote: \"App addict, medium engineer, CMS princess. 'A journey of one million miles begins with a single step' - Cicero.\" This is where the social media gurus come in. Most people can no longer rely on their company's media department and business card division to promote themselves, but nor are they particularly adept at running their own PR game, which is harder than it looks. Social media experts have slid in to fill this gap, writing endless articles about Seven Reasons Your Twitter Is Killing Your Personal Brand, Five Ways to Take Your Twitter Bio To The Next Level, and Leveraging The Hair You Pull Off Your Hairbrush: It's As Simple As Going Online. Webinars, books both paper and electronic, conferences: the personal branding business is enormous. And it tends to churn out Twitter bios that look like they've all been written by the same person. Social media gurus themselves were pioneers in the art of the boring Twitter bio. One of my favourites read simply, \"Comms. Marketing. Content. Digital. Consulting.\" The negative space invites the reader to assume the guy was just too in demand to fill up the whole 160 characters. He's probably floating in a pool somewhere with a constellation of interns orbiting him on inflatable dolphins, each with a separate digital device that they swap out every 20 minutes when his Pomodoro alarm goes off. This state of affairs can seem paradoxical, if you take the social media guru's self-description at face value. Why would you employ someone's services, or take their advice, on composing a unique Twitter bio if it's going to end up sounding like ... well, like a business card? But this is the point: as the modern business card, a Twitter biography must conform to a particular set of parameters in order to function. Setting your bio as something creative or absurd doesn't give people any information about you, and most people wouldn't do it for the same reason they wouldn't give out a business card embossed with a single image of themselves juggling bananas. Social media of all kinds demands that its users negotiate this tension between self-expression and self-promotion, if they're hoping to use online space for both personal and professional reasons. Writing a Twitter bio is a kind of work, and it requires a skillset that many of us don't have. Social media gurus are absurd and depressing, but we may as well complain about the wind: new demands placed on knowledge and service workers created a low pressure system into which something had to be pulled. \"The standardised Twitter bio is social media professionals' greatest achievement.\" - Queen Victoria"
