  "content": "Facebook and work don't mix, right? The phrase \"social media\" says it all. It's for spare time \u2026 Work is often part of the social mix, and 75% of internet users in full-time employment have used Facebook according to market research company Mintel. Users share knowledge, ideas, successes, experiences, funnies, inspirational quotes and video clips with friends at work, home and abroad. \"It allows you to build relationships with people more easily than you ever have before. With busy lives it is difficult to keep up to date with everyone you want to,\" says Paul Sutton from thesocialweb.co.uk But the lingo between lifelong friends and work colleagues is often different. An off-the-cuff comment could cause embarrassment in the office at the very least \u2026 Hover your mouse over \"lists\" on the left hand of your main page, click on \"more\" and create groups; for example, clients, work, family and close friends. Messages for particular groups can be sent via the news feed by clicking on the drop-down menu next to \"post\". If you get cold feet about what you've posted, just click delete. However, as Sutton advises: \"If you are ever concerned about posting something, don't post it.\" That's fine for what's in my control \u2013 but what about university photos posted by other people that could hinder my promotion prospects? Delete any picture or comment you want from your profile by clicking on the subject and removing it. You can also preview pictures and prevent them from appearing on your profile by going to privacy settings, \"how tags work\" and editing the settings. While you can't stop friends adding pictures on their profile, you can take the tag off the photo so it doesn't mention your name. Want to delete it completely? Ask your friend to take it down or, if you feel your chances would be improved coming from someone else, ask a mutual friend to do so on your behalf. It's impossible to make my profile look interesting enough for mates, but sensible enough for my boss. Timeline \u2013 Facebook's much anticipated revamp of profile pages \u2013 is out soon, and promises to make this issue easier to manage. \"It is very customisable, allowing you to differentiate your profile from others, with pictures becoming an integral part,\" says Sutton. Timeline will also let you change content according to the group that sees it. \"For example, you can post photos of your family and friends for them to see, while your colleagues see a picture of the department celebrating the 'sales team of the year' award.\" What about arranging a surprise 40th party for a colleague on the work list I created? On the news feed, type your message, choose the group you are sending it to and click \"custom\" and exclude the person from the message. One workmate posts something when she's going for a chicken wrap \u2013 can I cut out the dull ones? Hover over their name on a message and then \"subscribed\" and change the level of updates; the least \"liked\" or commented on will not appear. There are some clients I wouldn't want \"friending\" me. Can I stop them finding me in the searches? According to Mintel, 58% of social network users are concerned about privacy. Others Facebook viewers will always be able to see your name, gender, profile picture and networks. Edit your privacy settings to determine what additional information people can see."
