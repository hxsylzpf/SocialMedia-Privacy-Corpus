  "content": "A judge signalled today that he is likely to dismiss a claim that one of the founders of the social networking website, Facebook, stole the idea from fellow students. But the Boston district court judge, Douglas Woodlock, delayed a ruling, saying he needed more information. The case is being brought by a rival social networking website, ConnectU, the owners of which allege that Mark Zuckerberg, 23, who helped set up Facebook, pinched the idea, technology, design and business plan. They were all students at Harvard University at the time. The ConnectU owners want Facebook, which is worth at least $1 bn (\u00a3500m), closed down and its assets transferred to them, with damages. Facebook is seeking to have parts of the claim, lodged three years ago, dismissed. The website was launched in February 2004, a few months before ConnectU, and is now one of the most popular websites in the world, with an estimated 30 million members. ConnectU, which launched three months later and which has only 70,000 members, sued in September 2004, claiming that Mr Zuckerberg, who had been working with them at Harvard, had breached an agreement to complete the ConnectU website. The judge gave the ConnectU founders, brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, until August 8 to come up with more information to substantiate their claims. He repeatedly asked their lawyers to provide details of the contract they say they had with Mr Zuckerberg while at Harvard. \"Dorm room chit-chat does not make a contract,\" the judge said. Judge Woodlock said: \"There have been too many preliminary skirmishes in this case by too much posturing. The purpose of litigation is not to resolve the suit, but rather to gain leverage for settlement.\" At a hearing earlier this year, another judge dismissed the case on a technicality but ConnectU refiled within hours."
