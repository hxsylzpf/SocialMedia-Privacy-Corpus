  "content": "LIKE MANY people in his business, the technology publisher Tim O'Reilly is a heavy user of the Twitter microblogging service. He also has a Facebook account. To save effort, he has arranged things so that his Twitter posts are automatically forwarded to Facebook where they are transformed into \"status updates\". So far, so good; many of us do the same. But O'Reilly is a proper techie, which means many of his tweets are links to web pages containing interesting or useful information he has come upon in his daily browsing. One day recently, a friend of his noticed that something strange was happening to those links: when they left Twitter they were clickable links, but when they arrived in Facebook they were just plain text. In other words, they were no longer clickable. To follow them one had to copy and paste them into a browser window. This led to a brief outbreak of conspiracy theorising. Was the de-linking a deliberate tactic by Facebook to make it more difficult for its subscribers to venture into the bad, bad web? To suspect such a conspiracy was not irrational: Facebook has laboured to create a socially-inclusive, all-encompassing corner of cyberspace. The ultimate goal seemed to be to build a social networking site providing everything its subscribers needed: a walled garden, in fact. It seems that the de-linking of Twitter posts was the product of a bug rather than of a sinister design. But suspicions remain, because common sense, not to mention bitter experience, tells us that the company that voluntarily turns its back on the prospect of monopolistic power has yet to be incorporated. There was a delicious irony in the fact that it was the de-linking of the O'Reilly Twitterstream that alerted the world to the Facebook bug because he has been banging on for years about the threats posed by large, powerful internet operations. Like, er \u2026 Facebook. He sees two possible models for the evolution of the network. The first is the scenario of \"one ring to rule them all\", the winner-takes-all model we had when Microsoft ruled the world, a world that \"promises simplicity and ease of use, but ends up diminishing user and developer choice\". The second model is a network of \"small pieces loosely joined \u2026 admittedly less polished, less controlled, but one that is profoundly generative of new innovations because anyone can bring new ideas to the market without having to ask permission of anyone\". With the rise of the network and the decline of Microsoft's power, we thought we had escaped the first nightmare. But O'Reilly now thinks we may be blundering into something even worse \u2013 a networked world dominated by the \"natural monopolies\" created by Web 2.0 network effects, the phenomenon whereby the value of a network increases rapidly as the number of its users grows. His argument is that since Web 2.0 services get better the more people use them, so they have a natural tendency towards monopolistic specialisation. So he thinks we're headed for \"a world with one dominant search engine, one dominant online encyclopedia, one dominant online retailer, one dominant auction site, one dominant online classified site, and we've been readying ourselves for one dominant social network\". It's difficult to argue with this analysis. And each of the network's local monopolies is doing everything it can to keep us inside its walled garden. Google executives, for example, constantly blather on about how they value the \"open\" internet, freedom of choice etc, while at the same time frantically constructing an online environment which provides a cornucopia of services sufficiently rich to ensure that subscribers need never leave the Google embrace. The same is true of Amazon, Facebook and eBay. But there is a salutary message for would-be monopolists: the story of AOL, which also thought it could build a megabusiness by keeping its subscribers inside a wall. At the height of its hubris, it \"merged\" with Time Warner, then went into freefall. In about a month, it will be cut loose from the media giant and is engaging in savage job cuts to give it a chance of surviving. CEO Tim Armstrong is even forgoing his $1.5m bonus for 2009. Amid the wreckage of AOL's internet strategy, he might recall the inscription on Tolkien's Ring: \"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\"",
