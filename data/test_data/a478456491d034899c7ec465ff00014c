  "content": "Venture firm Accel Partners has announced \u00a32.02m funding in watAgame, a Danish tech firm that plans to launch its fashion-themed social network in the UK. WatAgame's goSupermodel targets teenage girls aged 10-16, and is already running local versions in Denmark, Norway, Germany the Netherlands and the US. Users can create their own model character and attend fashion events in a virtual world, including photo shoots, dance competitions and designing their own clothes. WatAgame claims to have made \"unprecedented advances\" in online security through a combination of human moderation and security software. The site claims to have an audience of devoted users in Denmark, where it says its user base accounts for 40% of all 10- to 16-year-olds. Heikki Makijarvi of Accel Partners said the site is a successful example of a niche social networking site that has demonstrated solid revenue. \"We know that teens now spend more time online than with any other media and also that there is a large variety of web communities out there battling for the interest and loyalty of users,\" said Mr Makijarvi. \"The key differentiator with goSupermodel is that they have targeted a niche demographic of younger teenage girls and focused strongly entirely on allowing them to express themselves.\" GoSupermodel reaches more than 1 million unique users each month globally, and the new funding will be used to fund international expansion with a focus on the UK and US. WatAgame launched in 2003 publishing mobile games, but has refocused to concentrate on goSupermodel as its main product. In the same social networking niche, technology venture firm Index Partners invested the equivalent of \u00a32m in Stardoll in early 2006 and was also part of a second funding round of \u00a33m in June last year. Stardoll is an online community for girls that invites users to create and makeover their own doll characters. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
