  "content": "News International could be facing more than 500 civil claims for damages from alleged victims of News of the World phone hacking, the high court has heard. At a case management conference at the high court in London on Friday, Mr Justice Vos also ordered News International to \"preserve\" the company iPhones of two senior executives and their email contents. It is understood the request for access to the iPhone emails is related to allegations of concealment over phone hacking and would not point to evidence of hacking beyond the time when private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was jailed. \"This could be very significant,\" said a source. The case management conference was called to discuss budgets for the second tranche of civil claims against News International and heard that the company believes it could face up to 520 claims in total. There are currently 49 individuals who are suing the company including Cherie Blair, David Beckham's father Ted and footballer Wayne Rooney. Three new names have been added to the list since the last case management conference at the end of April. Professor John Tulloch, who was just three feet from Mohammad Sidique Khan when he detonated his rucksack explosives at Edgware Road tube station in the 7/7 bombings, submitted his claim two weeks ago, as did Hannah Pawlby, aide to former home secretary Charles Clarke. A third new claim was submitted last week by Lewis Sproston, the boyfriend of murdered model Sally Anne Bowman. Friday's order made by Vos adds a fresh layer of intrigue to the phone-hacking saga as iPhones were not available in the UK until November 2007, nine months after News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was jailed for phone hacking. \"There is evidence suggesting that senior executives at News International which have company iPhones which were heavily used during the period. Our primary concern is the preservation of these iPhones and the email accounts that relate to them,\" David Sherborne, counsel for phone-hacking victims, told a case management conference on Friday. News International, which had already agreed to preserve the Apple smartphones for examination, said it did not know yet what was on the iPhones belonging to the two senior executives, who were not named in court. \"It has not been established yet what these materials are, whether they exist, whether they are relevant. This in the investigations stage,\" said Michael Silverleaf, QC for News International. Vos again issued strong advice to alleged phone-hacking victims to go to one of the 12 to 15 law firms that have now accumulated experience of the litigation to keep costs down for all sides. He heard there were currently 69 law firms with potential claimants with 12 with victims who have issued claims. Vos has repeatedly said that victims have the right to legal representation but they are not entitled to go to a solicitor who has no experience of phone-hacking litigation and charge News International for time spent on catching up. He agreed a \u00a37,000 fee per case but said that this would be reduced when common costs were taken into account. The court heard that it would be \"erroneous\" to multiply 520 cases by \u00a37,000 to come up with a total bill for legal fees because part of that amount would be divided by each law firm's number of clients. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
