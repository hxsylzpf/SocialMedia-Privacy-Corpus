  "content": "A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team. National Parks to get mobile signal boost &gt;&gt;&gt; Telegraph The aim of the deal is to help communities living in National Parks to benefit from consistent high quality mobile connectivity, while minimising any adverse environmental impacts. Nowhere will be safe from the gabble of phone calls. Former Google [X] director and head of Glass Babak Parviz joins Amazon &gt;&gt;&gt; 9to5Google There's no word on what he's going to be doing at Amazon, but he did lead some of Google's more 'futuristic' endeavours, an area that Amazon has yet to at least publicly make an entrance. He mentions doing work on a \"few other things,\" but it's unclear whether he means within Amazon or elsewhere. Is Amazon moving in on wearables? Possibly not, unless it can leverage its existing services. LinkedIn buys Newsle to show relevant news about people in your network &gt;&gt;&gt; Mashable \"LinkedIn and Newsle share a common goal: We both want to provide professional insights that make you better at what you do,\" Ryan Roslansky, head of content products at LinkedIn, wrote in a blog post announcing the deal. \"For example, knowing more about the people in your network - like when they're mentioned in the news - can surface relevant insights that help you hit your next meeting with them out of the park.\" As useful as LinkedIn can be in finding a job, do people really want to use it like Facebook? Competition vs. Community &gt;&gt;&gt; Jay Freeman (saurik) I always then feel like I have to ask people who see jailbreaking as an \"opportunity to better monetise what that saurik chump won't\": are you actually prepared to handle the situation where I get fed up and leave? Do you rely on my software? Are you relying indirectly on the people who in turn rely on me, or my friends? Things are not all happy and bliss in Apple jailbreaking land. Do people still feel the need to jailbreak after the recent iOS 7 and incoming iOS 8 updates? A Warhol with your Moose Head? Sotheby's teams with eBay &gt;&gt;&gt; NYTimes.com Starting this fall, most of Sotheby's New York auctions will be broadcast live on a new section of eBay's website. Eventually the auction house expects to extend the partnership, adding online-only sales and streamed auctions taking place anywhere from Hong Kong to Paris to London. The pairing would upend the rarefied world of art and antiques, giving eBay's 145 million customers instant bidding access to a vast array of what Sotheby's sells, from fine wines to watercolours by C\u00e9zanne. Do eBay users really want access to Sotheby's? I can't see their clientele overlapping considerably. Google brings Ingress location-based game to iPhone and iPad &gt;&gt;&gt; TechCrunch The game also features a rich storyline complemented by video and other media assets, just like any other large-scale MMO. But despite all of its success, it still manages to fly pretty much under the radar for the general user population, and a launch on iOS could help propel it to a more mainstream audience. I gave Ingress a chance on Android, but after wandering around for 45 minutes I got bored and jacked it in. Nothing in the recent updates and releases has tempted me to go back. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo: Apple's 5.5-inch 'iPhone 6' faces production issues, launch may be pushed to 2015 &gt;&gt;&gt; AppleInsider According to Kuo, Apple is already facing production bottlenecks on the 4.7-inch model related to the new technology for the device's in-cell touch panel, as well as colour unevenness on the redesigned \"iPhone 6\" metal casing. Those problems are said to be even worse with the larger 5.5-inch model. Sounds familiar. Perhaps producing all that sapphire for the screens is harder than anticipated. MakerBot 3D printers arrive at select Home Depot stores &gt;&gt;&gt; SlashGear The printers are available as of today, marking the start of a pilot program to see how sales fare. If you wander into one of the retail stores, you'll find them set up in a kiosk that will showcase the technology. Staff trained to use the printers will also be around to offer demonstrations. Putting 3D printers in the US equivalent of B&amp;Q is a master stroke towards mainstream adoption. Can I have a printer with that pack of screws?
