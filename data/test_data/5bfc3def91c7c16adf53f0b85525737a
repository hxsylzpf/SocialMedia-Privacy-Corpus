  "title": "Tumblr growing fast but teens are 'bored' with Facebook \u2013\u00a0Open thread",
  "content": "Tumblr is the fastest growing social media site according to new research from GlobalWebIndex, which notes that its active users grew by 120% in the last six months, while its registered user total grew by 45%. That put it ahead of Pinterest (with 111% and 57% growth respectively) and Instagram (64% and 36%), although more mature social networks are seeing slower growth. Twitter's active user total grew by 26% in the last six months, while Facebook's grew by just 2% according to the research. It's not all bad news for Facebook, though. Facebook Messenger and Instagram were the second and third fastest growing \"social and messaging apps\" in a separate chart published as part of the research, behind only Snapchat. Line, Pinterest, KakaoTalk, Vine, Kik Messenger, Google+ and Viber made up the top 10. Admittedly, there is some more bad news for Facebook: GWI claimed that 50% of American and British Facebook members used it \"less frequently than before\" \u2013 so they're still active users, just less active than they were. Why? 45% of them are simply less interested, 37% say they're \"bored with Facebook\", and 18% think it's not as cool as it used to be. \"Perhaps most significantly of all, teens under-index on saying that they're spending less time on social networks generally but then over-index on almost all of the specific anti-Facebook options.\" Does Facebook finally have the teen-flight problem that some experts have been predicting for years? Or is there a wider trend here that could become more of an all-ages problem for the social network? Or, for that matter, is the growth of Instagram and Facebook Messenger spelling out its future as a series of interconnecting-but-separate social apps, to combat these trends? The comments section is open for your thoughts. What else is bubbling today in the tech world? Here are some links to think about: US concerned about Google breakup calls Calls in the European parliament for Google to be broken up are causing concern in the US, as expressed by the US Mission to the European Union. \"It is important that the process of identifying competitive harms and potential remedies be based on objective and impartial findings and not be politicised...\" Sony working on e-paper smartwatch Well, that's what Bloomberg says. \"The watch's face and wrist band will be made from a patented material that allows the entire surface area to function as a display and change its appearance,\" according to its sources. The device could be released as soon as 2015. Microsoft may be buying email app Acompli The same week as Twitter's CFO almost lets slip an acquisition with a mis-tweeted direct message, Microsoft may have spilled the beans on its plans to buy email startup Acompli. How? With a blank blog post that popped up in people's RSS readers with a URL ending microsoft-acquires-acompli. Oops! Yogscast's Jingle Jam charity drive returns The large, passionate audiences for top YouTube channels are also willing to dig into their pockets for charity when asked by their favourite stars, as YouTubers from PewDiePie to Tyler Oakley have shown. And also gaming network Yogscast, which is bringing back its Jingle Jam charity drive in December to raise money for five charities. What do astronauts eat on Thanksgiving? Glad you asked! What other stories have piqued your interest this morning? The comments section is open for your recommendations, as well as your thoughts on the stories above.",
