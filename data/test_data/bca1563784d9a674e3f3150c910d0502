  "content": "Music app Shazam has always had a simple main selling point: it analyses songs and tells you what they are. This USP is simple and appealing enough to have generated more than 100m downloads in its history. As a company, Shazam has had some success adding features on top of that, notably by providing links to buy songs \"tagged\" by its users. Of the 3m songs tagged a day, on average about 300,000 will lead to purchases. This week, Shazam launched an update to its iPhone app, adding a social feature called Shazam Friends. Users can now link their Shazam profile to their Facebook account, and browse a real-time feed of the songs their friends tag within the app. It builds on the existing ability to post tags on Facebook and Twitter, so looks like a sensible if iterative upgrade. It might be more important than that. Making Shazam more social has the potential to turn it from being an app that people fire up specifically when they want to identify a song, to one that gets used more often. \"We do think it will change how people think of Shazam,\" says Alex Musil, executive vice-president of product marketing. \"They won't just tag songs because they don't know them. Tagging becomes a social activity.\" By which he means Shazam users may start tagging songs because they want friends to see them, even if they already know what's playing. Musil also says this is just the start of social features for Shazam. \"Once we're live with this, we want to go beyond what we have in the first version. We have a massive list of new things to build on top of version one, but we'll see how our users receive it.\" Not just music identification, but a social music community through which people keep friends posted on the songs that they're loving. Sound familiar? Apple is onto a similar thing with its Ping social network, although it has received distinctly mixed reviews since its debut last year \u2013 not least because it does not integrate with Facebook at all. Shazam has other fish to fry as it evolves as a service: for example its work in the US with TV broadcasters and advertisers to let users tag other kinds of content beyond music. The question is whether Shazam Friends will succeed in getting people to spend more time within the app itself, rather than just calling on it when they want to tag a song."
