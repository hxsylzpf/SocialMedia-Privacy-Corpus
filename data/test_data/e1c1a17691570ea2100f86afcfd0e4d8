  "content": "Prince Charles today threatened to sever official relations with the Sun after the paper apparently broke an agreement to leave Prince William in peace following an skiing photocall on Sunday. The front page of today's Sun carries a photograph of the prince with fellow student Kate Middleton at the Swiss ski resort of Klosters under the banner headline \"Finally... Wills gets a girl\". Over the next four pages billed as a \"world exclusive: the royal romance\", the prince is pictured again with a young woman the paper says is \"his first serious girlfriend\". Royal aides are angry at the apparent breach of a media agreement to leave William alone following an an official photocall on Sunday, when he posed with his father and joked with photographers about their skiing abilities. A spokeswoman for the prince said he was \"very disappointed\" by the apparent breach of the agreement, adding that the Sun would have to \"face the consequences\" of its actions - although there would be no formal complaint. \"They do understand that they have broken the agreement and they are aware they will have to face the consequences. It's not set in stone but that could include being excluded from photocalls,\" she said. The publication of the photographs is the first major problem encountered by the Prince of Wales's new communications secretary, Paddy Harverson, since he took up his post earlier this year. Mr Harverson said today he was \"unhappy\" about the use of the pictures, provided by the well known celebrity photographer Jason Fraser. \"I'm asking newspapers to continue to abide by the agreement,\" he added. There is also a wider agreement between the press and Buckingham Palace to ensure that the royal princes are allowed to continue their third-level education without their privacy being intruded. However, last year relations between the tabloids and the palace became strained with protests from the royal press corps over the lack of access to Prince William on his 21st birthday. Reporters and editors complained that the palace was reneging on its side of the entente, which involved giving regular official access to both princes at key milestones during their university schooling. The latest agreement was reached last September, following an admission by Prince Charles's private secretary, Sir Michael Peat, that St James's Palace had failed to give the press sufficient access to William during his time at university. In a letter to Les Hinton, the chairman of the newspaper editors' code of practice committee, Sir Michael promised to provide information about the student prince at least once a term in an effort to ease unrest among tabloid newspapers over the lack of access to the heir to the throne. In its editorial today the Sun said the pictures were published in the public interest and that William was a mature adult. \"One of William's girlfriends could become Queen one day. Her subjects will be entitled to know all about her.\" it said. The newspaper added there had been public interest in Charles' romantic interests before he married Princess Diana. At the official photocall at the weekend, William revealed what appeared to be a new-found confidence in front of the cameras. High up in the mountains at the start of his stay in the Alpine destination, he laughed throughout and joked with photographers. With his arm affectionately thrust around Prince Charles' shoulders, the prince took control of the photo-opportunity, spoke more than Charles and was at ease with the 50-strong media pack. Prince Charles is understood to be upset at the photographs after co-operating with the official photocall on Sunday, when he made it clear he hoped to be left in peace for the remainder of the holiday. Asked by the photographers to recommend good skiing routes in Klosters, Charles made plain his desire to get shot of the press. \"The route to Zurich is very nice,\" he quipped. A Sun spokeswoman said: \"Our story about Prince William and his girlfriend Kate Middleton is 100% true. Therefore, there is a strong public interest in publishing these delightful photographs.\" However, the Sun is irritated that its royal photographer, Arthur Edwards MBE, has been banned from royal events. \"We all know he takes the royal family's favourite photographs and we shall be launching an 'Our Arthur is innocent' campaign tomorrow.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
