  "content": "An urgent campaign has been launched in the UK for a \"freedom of expression\" law to protect confidential journalists', MPs' and lawyers' phone and communications records being secretly snooped on by police. Senior editors and lawyers condemned as \"wholly inadequate\" safeguards put forward in a code of practice by the home secretary, Theresa May, to meet concerns over the police use of surveillance powers linked to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (Ripa). Critics of May's safeguards fear that the police will still have sweeping powers allowing them to authorise themselves to access the phone and email records of professionals such as journalists, lawyers, doctors, MPs and priests who handle privileged, confidential information. More than 3,000 national and regional editors are being asked to sign a joint letter from the Society of Editors and Press Gazette, the industry's journal, condemning the Home Office joint code for failing to recognise \"the overarching importance of protecting journalists' sources\". The campaign comes as the prime minister, David Cameron, called for an extension of the laws that give snooping powers to security services with a plan to ban encrypted messages in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo Paris attacks. Bob Satchwell of the Society of Editors said: \"It is vitally important that everyone in the media makes it clear how important this issue has become. Journalism isn't a crime and should not be treated as such.\" May had offered to provide guidance over existing police powers after it emerged the Met police secretly accessed the phone records of Sun journalist Tom Newton Dunn to find people who had leaked him information in the Plebgate affair. But Dominic Ponsford of Press Gazette warned: \"The government's draft Ripa code is a licence for the state to spy on journalists' phone records at will. It allows police forces to approve their own requests for journalists' call records provided they make a note of their target's profession. It means that police forces will be able to continue to track down and punish lawful journalistic sources (as was the case with the Met Police and the Sun's Plebgate sources). The guidance makes no mention of the overriding public interest in protecting journalists' sources.\" Alistair MacDonald, QC, chairman of the Bar Council, said that the Charlie Hebdo attack should not allow such spying powers to go through unchallenged: \"The Paris murders, by extremist gunmen who were known to the security and police services, have already attracted considerable support for an extension of surveillance powers,\" said MacDonald.  \"That surveillance can save lives seems undeniable.  However, it is one of the objectives of extremists who are willing to commit barbaric crimes in support of purportedly religious or political ends, that the hard-won liberties of the civil population should be curtailed and that a wedge should be driven between those in society with different views about the degree to which personal freedoms should be sacrificed on the altar of public safety,\" he said. Despite the emerging objections, Home Office ministers look set to back changes next week that would let police carry on secretly snooping on confidential professional phone and web records at will. They appear to be set to reinforce Cameron's pledge on Monday \"not to allow any means of communications which it simply isn't possible [for the authorities] to read.\" That indicated that the Conservatives wanted to be able to break into encrypted communications. The senior journalists and lawyers say that at the very least an independent judge should have to consider the case to protect the identity of their sources before police can access journalists', lawyers and other professionals' phone records. The journalists concern is the unfettered use of Ripa powers will mean that public sector whistleblowers and other key sources will not come forward if the law enforcement agencies have the power to view journalists' phone records at will. They argue the practice amounts to state interference with press freedom. Press Gazette has since established police forces conducted more than 400 official investigations into leaks to the media. The campaign has some political support from elsewhere in the coalition. On Monday, deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, cited the use of the Ripa surveillance laws to obtain journalists' records as an example of measures introduced in the name of \"public safety\" that actually \"undermine the very freedoms we cherish\". But the Home Office consultation on proposed changes to the Ripa code of practice which closes next Tuesday has suggested doing little more than requiring the authorising officer to give \"additional consideration\" to the level of intrusion in cases involving professionally confidential or privileged information and record each time an application is made. If pushed, ministers have suggested they might also require the police to flag all applications to the interception of communications commissioner, who oversees the use of the surveillance powers. MacDonald, said: \"As a caring society, we cannot simply leave surveillance issues to senior officers of the police and the security services acting purportedly under mere codes of practice.  What is surely needed more than ever before is a rigorous statutory framework under which surveillance is authorised and conducted.\" A Home Office spokesperson said: \"A free press is fundamental to a free society and the government is determined that nothing is done that puts that at risk. Communications data is an absolutely critical tool used by police and other agencies to investigate crime, safeguard national security and protect the public. There are measures in place to ensure that police powers to access this data are not abused. We recently published a strengthened code of practice meaning that extra consideration should now be given to a communications data request involving those in sensitive professions, such as journalists. The revised code is currently undergoing public consultation.\""
