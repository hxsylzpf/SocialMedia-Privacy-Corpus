  "content": "As an author who has books for sale on Amazon, I'm used to seeing sales rankings change over time. So when I noticed, a few days ago, that the ranking for the US edition of my book Girl With a One Track Mind had disappeared, I figured it must just be a temporary fault. Yesterday, however, with the issue still evident, I thought I would investigate and decided to type \"Amazon\" into Twitter search \u2013 the most up-to-date, instant, subject search on the web \u2013 in the hope that I might learn of any current problems Amazon might be facing. To my shock I wasn't the only one looking for information on this subject: within minutes of my original search, dozens of tweets started appearing, all tagged with \"#amazonfail\" amid rumours of censorship and the de-ranking of certain books. Some further digging illuminated the situation: books with erotic content or which were deemed lesbian or gay had seemingly been stripped of their ranking, and had disappeared from the main search on the front page of the Amazon websites. Could it really be that Amazon were censoring certain books? According to one author, Amazon stated a few days ago that it was now its \"policy\" to exclude \"adult\" material from appearing in some searches and bestseller lists, but his book had no \"adult\" material in it. It seems that books written by lesbian or gay authors, or with lesbian or gay themes, were being classed as \"adult\", actively removed from searches, and de-ranked, alongside the books featuring erotic content. Authors are dependent on people being able to find their books. If a book is not readily available in bookshops, then many book buyers will seek it online, and Amazon is often their first port of call. If the ability to find that book via searching the landing page is removed, then that could have a huge impact on book sales, and authors may suffer the consequences of this for some time to come. The main issue here, though, is censorship and what appears to be outright homophobia, and people have been rightly enraged about this. Barely an hour after the amazonfail tag first appeared, it was being mentioned four times a second on Twitter search \u2013 thousands of people were talking about it; but none of the tweets were positive. Calls for Amazon to be \"googlebombed\" were acted upon and people were commenting on the politics of \"cyberactivism\" \u2013 contributing to lists of the books that had been affected \u2013 and calling for a boycott of the site. Amazon, it appeared, had started to dig its own grave. There hasn't, as yet, been an official statement from Amazon, bar its saying there had been a \"glitch\" that it was working on. In the meantime, the web is doing its own investigation: the Guardian has touched on the categorisation of books and how that might be a common factor of the affected books. Others have gone further and said that Amazon's category MetaData is being filtered, which has huge implications for both present and future books sold via the site. However Amazon justifies this \u2013 and I very much doubt it will come away unscathed \u2013 the lessons to be learned here are simple: don't piss off the web, or your reputation will be seriously damaged."
