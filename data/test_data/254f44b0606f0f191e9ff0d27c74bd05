  "content": "You would have thought that after being challenged by Pippa Middleton to play a game of table tennis, London mayor Boris Johnson would be focusing his sports training around the ping pong table. But Johnson couldn't resist hurling a basketball during a recent media event in the capital \u2013 with a surprising result. There are plenty of surprises of a different sort in our Hidden Man clip and a wonderful unexpected achievement for a seven-year-old cancer patient, Jack Hoffman, when he joined Nebraska's spring game. There are a couple of films coming up that are worth getting excited about. There will be plenty of nostalgia around the 20s when the Great Gatsby, which features new music by Beyonc\u00e9, Lana Del Rey, and Florence + The Machine, is released next month. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan, it is directed by Baz Luhrmann. For those who enjoy a little more action, Elysium, set on ravaged Earth and a luxurious space habitat named Elysium, is a science fiction film written and directed by Neill Blomkamp and starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. Finally, let's end with some fun and laughter. How Animals Eat Their Food is very, very silly but will make you chuckle and If Songs Were Real from RTE's Republic of Comedy is a bit rude, but it's bound to raise a smile!
