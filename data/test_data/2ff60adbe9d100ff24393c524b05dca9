  "content": "MC Hammer is opening fire on Jay-Z, attacking the biggest rapper in the world for a perceived insult in his new song. The U Can't Touch This hitmaker, famous for his squandered fortune, said he would answer \"hellboy\"'s slight with a new song on 31 October, Devil's Night. Jay-Z probably didn't even realise MC Hammer was listening. \"Hammer went broke so you know I'm all focused,\" he raps on So Appalled, Kanye West's newest free Good Friday track. \"I lost 30 mill so I spent another 30 / cos unlike Hammer / 30 million can't hurt me.\" This is typical Jay-Z, a run-of-the-mill boast, the bragging of a multi-millionaire who just sat down with Warren Buffett for Forbes magazine. But MC Hammer, who became a preacher after losing his rap fortune, wasn't tickled by the putdown. Although he's no longer a champ MC, he's still a star on Twitter \u2013 as an early adopter, he has almost eight times as many followers as Jay-Z, and more than even Kanye West. \"The answer to Jay comes on Oct 31,\" he explained. \"I saw him coming.\" He didn't stop there. \"You wanted my attention #HellBoy (Jigga), you got it,\" MC Hammer wrote on Saturday. \"Let me mess you up.\" As fans of Jay-Z began to pile on the aggrieved rapper, Hammer told them, essentially: you can't touch this. \"Laughing at these grown men coming on my timeline with they pom-poms waving for #HellBoy ... These lil demons and imps stopping by [my] timeline today \u2013 Yes, I dissed yo daddy.\" MC Hammer even posted a video of himself showing a punching bag what for, telling Jay-Z: \"Stans high up.\" Yet before Jay-Z had even found time to respond, Hammer was already backing off. \"No need for such nastiness,\" he wrote finally, while still promising a Halloween comeback. \"I'm going back to the baggy pants that keeps you off guard.\""
