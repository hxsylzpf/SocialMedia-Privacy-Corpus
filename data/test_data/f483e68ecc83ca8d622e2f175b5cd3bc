  "content": "Maya Angelou, the American poet and author, died at her home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina on Wednesday. She was 86. The writer's death was confirmed in a statement issued by Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, where she had served as a professor of American Studies since 1982. \"Dr Angelou was a national treasure whose life and teachings inspired millions around the world,\" the Wake Forest statement said. Angelou wrote seven autobiographies, and was a playwright, director, actor, singer, songwriter and novelist. Here we take a look at the tributes already pouring in across social media for one of literature's greats."
