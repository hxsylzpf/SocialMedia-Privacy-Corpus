  "content": "On both sides of the Atlantic, governments are making more data available in more useful formats for developers. In Britain, the government aims to open access to postcode data by spring of next year. This will most likely be the dataset that links postcodes to geographic location rather than the Postcode Address File (PAF) that links postcodes to addresses. This is part of the Smarter Government project that Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced recently to get most government services and data online. The postcode data is just one of many datasets we can hope to see from the government, and with Sir Tim Berners-Lee involved, the formats will use open standards with input from the World Wide Web Consortium. The prime minister said that 1,100 datasets have already been released, and he said: And there are many hundreds more that can be opened up - not only from central government but also from local councils, the NHS, police and education authorities. The government has also promised better access to data from local authorities. The US Open Government directive In the US, President Barack Obama's Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra and Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra described in a live webcast how they would make \"transparency, participation, and collaboration ... the cornerstone of an open government\". The key points: \u2022 Agencies should \"use modern technology to disseminate useful information, rather than waiting for specific requests under FOIA\", although agencies can claim that a release isn't practical or the information is restricted. \u2022 Within 45 days, each agency shall identify and publish online in an open format at least three high-value data sets and register those data sets via Data.gov.  \u2022 Within 60 days, each agency shall create an Open Government Webpage ... to serve as the gateway for agency activities related to the Open Government Directive. If you're interested, you can read the entire directive on the White House website. For open data and government advocates, the default position of openness is welcome, especially by critics of the Bush administration who saw its default position as one of secrecy. However, open data activists are waiting to see if the agencies walk the talk. Sean Moulton writing for the government openness and transparency group OMBWatch* says: However, the proof is in the pudding.  Implementation over the next few months will reveal how much new transparency we will actually receive from this process.  This first step, the instructions to the agencies, has gone well, now our work must focus on ensuring the next step, implementation by agencies, goes equally well and produces substantive change. Meredith Fuchs at the National Security Archive project says one failing is that the directive doesn't have any \"negative incentives\" for failing to open up data. Clay Johnson with the Sunlight Foundation explained what the data directive in the US will mean for developers. While he's broadly supportive of the plan, he said one thing missing is \"an inventory of data that government publishes online now but doesn't include in data.gov\". Drawing on the example of GPS which few people outside of the Pentagon knew about before its release, Johnson said: There has to be a way to judge the value of information on the inside not just by public demand, but by the value it can add to society. Apart from the politics and policy of it all, it's fascinating to see the US government go crazy with Web 2.0 tools. During the live webcast, one could join a discussion on Facebook. If you want to see a progress report of efforts to open the US government so far, you can read it on presentation-sharing site Slideshare. It's all very shiny, but as we can see, there are a lot of eyes on this project to see if the reality lives up to Obama administration's soaring rhetoric. * For those not steeped in the alphabet soup of US agencies, OMB is the Office of Management and Budget, one of the largest US agencies. From Wikipedia: \"OMB oversees and coordinates the Administration's procurement, financial management, information, and regulatory policies.\"",
