  "content": "Social networking websites such as MySpace and Windows Live Spaces are the most popular blog sites in the UK, according to research. Personal blogs are followed in popularity by those run by mainstream news websites and those dishing up political and celebrity gossip, with the BBC and the Guardian's blog sites the most favoured. Windows Live Spaces grabbed a 19.72% share of total blog visits in the UK in the week to August 19, according to research company Hitwise. MySpace blogs were second, with 16.46% of the market, while the BBC and the Guardian's blogs came 10th and 11th in the overall blogging and personal websites category. LiveJournal.com, Blogger and Technorati also rated highly in the overall category. Meanwhile, the most popular individual blog was Fugufish.org, attracting 13.28% of visits in the category after posting several viral videos, including one featuring the band OK Go and another of David Bowie in The Labyrinth. The second most popular blog in the UK is sex diary Girl With a One Track Mind written by Zoe Margolis under the pseudonym Abby Lee, according to HitWise's Top 10 category covering blogs created by an individual. Her raunchy blog, ranked at number two in the UK with a 12.61% share of web visits, surged in popularity in the last two weeks - registering an eightfold increase in visits - after Ms Margolis' identity was revealed in the press. \"Fugufish, Girl With a One Track Mind and LGF [Little Green Footballs] offer examples of blogs that have quickly gained a mass audience,\" said Heather Hopkins, the vice-president of Hitwise. \"While the mainstream media can be an important catalyst for growth, links from other blogs, email and social networking sites can also drive growth. \"This reflects the community around blogging and a maturing of the medium that now can create its own celebrities.\" Political sites fared well, with four in the top 10 individual blog category - the most popular being Guido Fawkes' blog, which is ranked third (a 12.12% share of visits). While Labour websites fail to make the top 10, the Conservatives did better with Conservativehome.com coming fourth (11.42%) and former Tory candidate Iain Dale's site at fifth (9.89%). The blog sites for Little Green Footballs (seventh) and EU Referendum (10th) have risen in popularity, according to Hitwise, based on the critical stance each took over the doctoring of photographs and media coverage in the Lebanon conflict. LGF achieved fame for revealing that a Reuters photograph of Beirut had been doctored. Celebrity gossip blogging site Thesuperficial.com is ranked sixth (9.22%) and football fan blogs for Arsenal (eighth) and Liverpool (ninth) complete the top 10. Hitwise monitors visits to blog websites and not blog readers such as RSS and Atom feeds. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
