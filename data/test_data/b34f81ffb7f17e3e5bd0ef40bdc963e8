  "content": "Fed up with being taken in by headlines such as \"Security Experts Advise Americans To Not Click Anything\"? Facebook may have the answer: the social network is testing a tag to flag up stories from sites such as the Onion, reports Mashable. A Facebook spokesman said: \"We are running a small test which shows the text \"[Satire]\" in front of links to satirical articles in the related articles unit in News Feed. This is because we received feedback that people wanted a clearer way to distinguish satirical articles from others in these units.\" A screengrab obtained by Ars Technica shows how the tags would look (in the sublinks to the main story): Monkey is sure the move would prevent gullible readers from being taken in \u2013 but can't help feeling it would spoil the fun of spotting the Onion headlines among the breaking news on Facebook."
