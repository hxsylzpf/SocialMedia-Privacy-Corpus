  "content": "The teenage girlfriend of England World Cup squad member Theo Walcott today asked the media to respect her privacy while she revises for forthcoming AS-level exams. Melanie Slade, 17, issued a joint statement with the Walcott family asking that they be left alone, just hours after she appeared at a charity publicity event. The statement said that she would not be considering any of the \"very kind requests for interviews or commercial offers\" until after the World Cup. Slade and Walcott, also 17, were thrust into the public eye on Monday when he was sensationally picked for the England squad for the tournament despite never having played in the Premiership. The sixth-form college student has been splashed across newspaper pages every day since the selection was announced. Today she joined wives and girlfriends of other footballers at Tottenham's White Hart Lane stadium to publicise Cancer Research UK's race for life. The statement said: \"Melanie wishes to thank the media for their interest in her since the selection of Theo Walcott to the England World Cup squad on Monday. \"However, she wishes to request that she now be granted privacy to allow her to focus properly on the exams which she is about to sit. Melanie hopes that, as she is still in full-time education, the media will comply with this request. \"To that end, Melanie will not be considering any of the very kind requests for interviews or commercial offers until after the conclusion of the World Cup finals in July. \"Similarly, the Walcott family has been flattered by the media interest in them and Theo since Monday's announcement and has endeavoured to be as cooperative as possible. However, they, too, wish to request that their privacy now be respected. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
