  "content": "One in four UK adults do it 23 times a month. And Britons do it more often than anyone else in world, except for Canadians. The obsession is with social networking, which according to a report published today is categorically no longer the preserve of teenagers and students, and has been adopted by a growing army of older surfers determined to link up with old acquaintances. Thanks to their growing obsession and the widespread availability of broadband, the UK leads Europe in using sites such as Facebook and MySpace, according to the study from the regulator Ofcom. Its analysis suggests more UK adults go on social networking sites than their European neighbours and they visit them more frequently and for longer - an average 5.3 hours a month. The regulator's report is designed to help shape future policies, provide information to media and telecoms companies and assess where the UK communications market stands in a global context. Other findings include: \u00b7 Europeans watch less TV than the Americans and Japanese. In the UK the average is 25.2 hours a week, or 3.5 hours a day. That is less than Italy and Spain but more than Germany and Ireland. \u00b7 People in the UK listen to more radio than in any of the other 11 countries surveyed. Radio is least popular in Japan. \u00b7 The UK has the highest revenue per head from internet advertising. Spending is twice as much as for France, Germany and Italy combined. Ofcom also researched how internet audiences around the world break down between male and female users, after it discovered this summer that in the UK women are overtaking men in some age groups. The only other place where more women are online is the US, where the divide is 52% female to 48% male. In the UK the split is 50-50, except in the 18-34 age group, where far more women are surfing the net. Ofcom sees a link between this UK pattern and the popularity of online networking sites. Ofcom's head of market intelligence, Justin Le Patourel, cites other factors that set the UK apart, including higher broadband takeup and \"a cultural approach to staying in touch with people\". The regulator's research put the UK ahead of the US for the first time for broadband takeup. But there was fresh evidence that many consumers are confused about how fast their connections actually are, and fewer surfers in the UK are satisfied with their connection speed than in most other countries. Ofcom says it is working with the Advertising Standards Authority as it looks at complaints from consumers about advertised speeds and actual speeds, which vary from one household to another, depending on various factors. \"We are concerned about whether consumers are being misinformed about which speeds they can get,\" says Ofcom's strategy and markets expert, Peter Philips. \"The question is whether there is more information that needs to be provided.\" Broadband is increasingly available in the UK, with well over half of households connected, but takeup still lags behind the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, Sweden and Spain. The availability of high speed connections is also helping to drive a surge in online advertising spending, according to Ofcom. \"Advertisers in the UK have seen great advantages in targeting campaigns online and in getting feedback,\" says Philips. \"They are taking a global lead on this.\" Advertising spending online has overtaken magazine advertising and is now more than outdoor, cinema and radio advertising combined. The UK also leads the way in digital TV takeup, at 76% of households, with Ofcom putting that down to the rapid growth of Freeview and a mature pay-TV market with both satellite and cable services. The watchdog also identified that the UK is far from alone in widespread mobile phone takeup, something that is being accompanied by the demise of fixed-line contracts. In several European countries, the number of mobile connections outnumbers the population. In the UK there are 115 connections per 100 people. \"One of the reasons for this is the UK ... is very much a pre-pay mobile market - over two-thirds of mobile connections are pre-paid versus contracts, whereas in markets like the US and Japan it's actually less easy to switch your mobile or get an additional mobile because you are more likely to be on a contract,\" says Ofcom's research director, James Thickett. \"One of the outcomes of the growth of mobile is that more and more households are becoming mobile-only.\" In the UK, one in eight households are now mobile-only."
