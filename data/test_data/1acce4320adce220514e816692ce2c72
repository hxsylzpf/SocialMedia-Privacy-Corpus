  "content": "The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) has stood down its chief economist as it investigates whether he posted slurs about people with disabilities, Muslims and refugees on his Facebook. In screenshots of the status updates sent to the Australian, Burchell Wilson is purported to have called Joe Hockey a \"fat little bastard\" above a childhood photo of the treasurer and said moderate Muslims provide a smokescreen for Muslims \"who are putting bombs on your buses and raping your children\". He is also said to have attacked rival business group Business Council of Australia (BCA). ACCI's CEO Kate Carnell directed Wilson to stand down from his position on Thursday, hours after she learned of the allegations regarding Facebook posts. ACCI is investigating the source of the posts. \"Today I have been made aware of a number of offensive, derogatory and completely unacceptable Facebook posts allegedly made by ACCI chief economist Burchell Wilson,\" she said in a statement. \"\u2026 This is a matter we are taking very seriously. ACCI also takes issues of natural justice seriously, and are providing Mr Wilson with an opportunity to respond to the allegations before any further action is taken.\" Carnell said she would not be making any further comment on the matter. Another screenshot of a Facebook post read: \"the c^nt sitting next to me at the bench is bitching to his deformed girlfriend about 'once you are recognised as a refugee\u2026'. Shut the f^ck up or I will make you one\", according to the Australian. Another post says a \"gay discount\" meant Tom Hanks's autograph on Philadelphia photos are cheaper than autographs on Forrest Gump ones, the Australian report says. Guardian Australia cannot confirm whether the posts are genuine. Wilson did not return calls from the Guardian, but told the Australian his privacy had been breached. He did not confirm or deny that he was the author of the posts."
