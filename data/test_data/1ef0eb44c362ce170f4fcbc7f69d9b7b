  "content": "Students staging a sit-in at University College London in protest at a rise in tuition fees could face eviction today after university lawyers sought a court order to eject them. The students, who began the occupation in the Wilkins building in central London last Tuesday, received a letter from the university which said the demonstration was \"disrupting significantly the day-to-day operation of UCL\" and it would commence legal proceedings. Lawyers for UCL attended the high court yesterday to request an injunction for \"unlawful activities\", which they hope will be granted today. The university called on up to 200 students to vacate the campus by 11am today, despite the Education Activist Network announcing today another day of action on 11 December, urging parents and teachers to join. The legal move comes as Twitter rejected as \"absurd\" claims that it suppressed or interfered with the accounts of students during recent protests, or co-operated with the police in monitoring tweets about demonstrations. Suspicions were roused when the @UCLOccupation feed suddenly stopped working, along with the personal account of one of the protest organisers. Shortly after it recovered, students found it had been hijacked by someone who sent out a series of facetious messages such as: \"With support waning, trespassers are boozing to double numbers.\" There have also been allegations \u2013 mainly on Twitter \u2013 that the failure of the #demo2010 Twitter tag to show at the top of popular trending lists indicated it had been suppressed. Social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook have played a key role in the organisation of the student marches and sit-ins around the country over recent weeks, hampering police efforts to keep a track of demonstrators' plans. One of the most popular such feeds, set up by students at University College London (UCL), has acquired almost 3,000 followers \u2013 and sent almost as many tweets. After a stream of allegations that the authorities were involved in manipulating tweets, Matt Graves, a spokesman for Twitter, said there was \"absolutely no truth\" in any of the claims. Those behind the taking over of UCL accounts are believed to be rival students with opposing views from UCL. \"Any suggestion that we have suspended or interfered with the Twitter accounts of protest groups or with hash-tags related to the protests is absurd,\" Graves said. He said that Twitter was \"committed to fostering the open exchange of information\". He added: \"We have seen people use Twitter to help each other during fuel shortages, check in during earthquakes, spread urgent news efficiently around the world, and \u2013 quite famously \u2013 to organise political protests around the world. We have not, and will not, do anything to stand in the way of people using Twitter for the open exchange of information. Period.\" During Tuesday's latest wave of marches the biggest demonstration, in London, split repeatedly and headed in different directions to avoid police \"kettling\" tactics. Although spontaneous, the tactic was also organised via Twitter."
