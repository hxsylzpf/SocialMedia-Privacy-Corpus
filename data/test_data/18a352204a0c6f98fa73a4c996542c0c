  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission has dismissed complaints from Liberal Democrat MP Chris Huhne and his partner Carina Trimingham levelled against five national newspapers over photographs of the pair at Leyhill prison. The photographs were taken while Huhne was serving a custodial sentence for perverting the course of justice when his ex-wife, Vicky Pryce, took the penalty for a speeding offence he committed a decade ago. They were published by the Daily Mail, Daily Mirror, Daily Telegraph, the Sun and the Sunday Mirror. Huhne and Trimingham lodged a complaint with the PCC, arguing that the photographs were taken in places where they felt they should have been granted a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\". They said the publication was not in the public interest and \"only served to embarass them\". But the pictures had been taken from public locations around the open grounds of the open prison. The newspapers said that \"at all times\" Huhne and Trimingham had been standing in places where they were \"visible to other prisoners or visitors to the prison\", arguing this meant there was no reasonable expectation of privacy. \"Deciding whether an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy in a particular place can be difficult,\" said Charlotte Dewar, director of complaints and pre-publication services at the PCC. \"The commission carefully considered the circumstances in which these photographs were taken \u2013 including the background to the story \u2013 and concluded that, in this instance, the area in and around the grounds of HMP Leyhill where the photographs were taken was not private\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
