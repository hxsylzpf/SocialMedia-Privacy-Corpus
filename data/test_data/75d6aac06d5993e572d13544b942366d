  "content": "Twitter is preparing a new advertising model that will serve adverts in peoples' feeds and try to supplant third-party services such as Tweetdeck, according to reports. A story at the Wall Street Journal's AllThingsD says that \"Ads will be tied to Twitter searches, in the same way that Google's original ads were. So a search for, say, \"laptop,\" may generate an ad for Dell. The ads will only show up in search results, which means users who don't search for something won't see them in their regular Twitterstreams. \"The ads will use the Twitter format \u2013 140 or fewer characters \u2013 and will be distributed via the third-party software and services that use Twitter's API. The services will have the option of displaying the ads, and Twitter will share revenue with those that do. \"Twitter will work with ad agencies and buyers to seed the program, but plans on moving to a self-serve model like Google's, down the road.\" That will be a dramatic change from the present advertising model, where small text adverts appear on the top right of Twitter users' home page. It is not known how much those garner in revenue - but given the low public profile of many of the advertisers there, it's unlikely to be as much as the search deals that Twitter signed on the same day last October with Google and Microsoft's Bing. It is not clear how soon the new service would launch, though AllThingsD suggests it could happen \"in the first half of the year\". Questions have been raised repeatedly about how Twitter, which is estimated to have around 75m users, can fund its long-term existence and move to profitability. As Twitter appears to have rejected charging for use either of the service or of its API, that seems only to leave advertising - though there is no clear information about the model behind it. A number of third-party applications which provide access to Twitter via its API already provide ads in the \"timeline\" of messages as an alternative means of paying for the cost of the product. Some of the excitement was driven by tweets by Alex Payne, one of Twitter's engineers. On Saturday he tweeted \"If you had some of the nifty site features that we Twitter employees have, you might not want to use a desktop client. (You will soon.)\" This was quickly picked up by the technology blog Techcrunch - leading Payne to begin refuting his tweet, and the Techcrunch post, in the same medium as before. \"I don't mean that developers won't be able to compete with the site. We still release most everything API-first, of course,\" he explained within the hour. And then, later: \"Uh, everything I like that's on the employees-only beta site is actually *built* on public API methods we've already given developers.\" And next, in exasperation: \"I just mean that our web client team is building cool stuff. It's going to inspire desktop app developers. Same data, new perspectives.\" And a puzzled complaint: \"I am still baffled as to why anyone pays that level of attention to what I have to say.\" But given the absence of hard information from Twitter about how it plans to make a profit from its service, it's likely that people will continue trying to mine every piece of information that escapes from the company - whether actually indicative or not - to try to figure it out."
