Did you know (same study) that Fox News is the \"most trusted\" news organisation (30%) and also the \"least trusted\" (26.2%)? Did you know (cue more research) that 17% of Twitter users have logged on from a public or private lavatory in the past 30 days, and that only 12% of Facebook, MySpace and sundry social media operators have done the same? Try explaining that in 140 characters."
