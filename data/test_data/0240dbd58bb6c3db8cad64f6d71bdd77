  "content": "No one knows where the line for unacceptable behavior on the part of a New York City politician is drawn, but apparently there is one \u2013 and Anthony Weiner managed to cross it. A majority of New York voters think Anthony Weiner should drop out of the mayoral race, according to a citywide poll released Monday afternoon. Fifty-three percent of respondents in the poll of likely voters said that Weiner should quit the race, versus 40% who said he should stay in, Quinnipiac found. While the news was bad for Weiner, the poll featured an unprecedented show of strength from public advocate Bill de Blasio, who ranked second behind city council speaker Christine Quinn. Twenty-seven percent of voters said Quinn would be their pick for mayor, versus 21% who selected de Blasio. Former city comptroller Bill Thompson notched 20% in the poll, versus 16% for Weiner. Support has deteriorated dramatically for Weiner in the week since the public learned that he continued to send strangers pictures of his genitals after resigning from Congress in June 2011 in disgrace over the behavior. His campaign manager quit abruptly on Sunday. In a snap overnight poll conducted by Marist immediately after the new pictures came to light, 47% of respondents thought Weiner should stay in the race, while 43% thought he should drop out. That was before Weiner endured days of tough questions about his behavior and public humiliation at the hands of the tabloid press. A Quinnipiac poll released just prior to the latest flare-up in the Weiner scandal found the former congressman in the lead over Quinn by 26-22. Consistently strong polling by Quinn, the frontrunner in most surveys, belies her potential vulnerability in a mayoral runoff, to be held if no one candidate gains 40% of the vote. Quinn's net favorability rating has lagged both De Blasio and Thompson, potential runoff opponents. A Quinnipiac poll last week of a hypothetical Democratic runoff between Quinn and Thompson found Thompson out front 51-42. Monday's poll has Quinn losing a hypothetical runoff against Thompson by 10 points, 50-40."
