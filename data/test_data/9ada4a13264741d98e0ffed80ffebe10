  "content": "This is a commentary by Lilian Edwards, Professor of Internet Law, University of Sheffield Long ago and far away (ie 1998) Larry Lessig - yes, that Larry Lessig, long before Creative Commons and remix culture occupied his days - got uptight about spam vigilantes. Lessig was unhappy that an increasingly popular approach to stopping spam - in 1998, a fast-growing but almost completely unregulated problem - was for groups of sysadmins to blacklist certain sites, on the say-so of other techie types who had evidence that those sites harboured spammers. Then and now, such blacklisting is one of the few effective ways to cut down spam. So why was Lessig against it? Part the reason was because of the potential for error - one lot of helpful techies had mistakenly blacklisted his own institution, Harvard, as a spammer, because it sent out millions of alumni begging emails. But Lessig's more serious reason for disliking the blacklist solution was this: \"This is policy-making by the \"invisible hand.\" It's not that policy is not being made, but that those making the policy are unaccountable. The self-righteous spam police may or may not be right about the solution to spam; that's not the point. The problem is that policy is being made by people who threaten that if you complain or challenge their boycotts through the legal system, then you will suffer their boycott all the more forcibly.\" Twelve years later we may be facing a less trivial vigilante war. As the Wikileaks conflict hots up, \"Anonymous\", the motley gang of pro-P2P anti-authoritarian hackers pursuing \"Operation Payback\", who previously took out ACS-Law, now threaten that they will \"extend their campaign to anyone with an 'anti-WikiLeaks agenda.'\" So are we living in a cyberverse where ordinary law and order has broken down and political and business decisions are being dictated by the threat of the mob? This week, Anonymous have already attacked Mastercard, Visa and PayPal for denying payment services to Wikileaks, and claim to have targeted the websites of the Swiss Post Office bank, the Swedish prosecutor's office pursuing Assange on rape allegations and the website of the lawyer representing two Swedish women in the case. Of course Anonymous can say, like a small boy caught fighting in the playground, that they didn't start it. \"Patriot\" hackers, who may or may not be organised by the US government or just not very keen on Wikileaks, have already subjected it and its various hosts to repeated DDOS batterings. One of the less spoken reasons Wikileaks went to Amazon as a temporary host, despite its US base, was not because the US needed a dose of free speech medicine, but because they are a big enough cloud host provider to have sophisticated anti-DDOS facilities, but still be cheap. EveryDNS, the domain name company who were pilloried for cutting access to wikileaks.org at the start of all this, may well have done so not because of US pressure but because their infrastructure wasn't up to the DDOS pasting they would receive, which would prejudice their their longer-standing clients. Interestingly, even EasyDNS, who were misquoted as the Wikileaks DNS provider in early reports, and suffered massively bad PR as a result, recognised that sometimes avoiding DDOS is the better part of valour: \"Having been there personally, I know how hard it is to face a DOS attack, and speaking for ourselves, any decisions made while a full-on shitstorm is being targeted at one's company and business are not political ones, they are ones of survival. I challenge anybody sitting in the comfort of their cozy little bubble existence at home, to sit on the receiving end of a full on DOS attack directed at themselves and then pontificate about 'cowardice' or anything else. Armchair quarterbacks.\" One reason why large scale cybervigilante war has never been taken very seriously is that the public still perceives DDOS attacks as limited to a small bunch of techno-literate sophisticated hackers. Nowadays this is very far from the truth. \"Patriot\" hackers are being advised to use \"Low Orbit Ion Cannon\" or LOIC, an open source free DDOS kit built for the perfectly legitimate task of stress testing networks but apparently also very good, according to one anonymous (ha!) reviewer for \"many interwebz warz, like operation titstorm and the cleaning out scientology.\" I could download it and DDOS Wikileaks (or Mastercard) tomorrow - so could you. The black net economy has toolkits of all kinds for DDOs plus on line tutorials and handbooks. At a skill level, this is the cybervigilante version of throwing a brick through a window, not requiring a Stieg Larsson heroine. So, it's all very entertaining, but I am the only person who is beginning to feel there are places I'd rather this conflict was sorted out than in the back bedrooms of a few thousand hippies, students and Tea Party members? Like my colleague Andres Guadamuz, I have been thinking about what Wikileaks means for internet regulatory theory. Not for me the cyberspace theories we both know and love, but the older stuff about the role of law itself ; about how developed societies solve disputes using the institutions of law, not by who has greater force - or makes the biggest threats. War, the ultimate extension of settling disputes by force, has unsurprisingly never been over-regulated, but recently the prospect of cyberwar, in which the innocent might suffer through DDOS attacks on hospitals, power stations, media, banks etc, has been exercising the minds of military and diplomats. Some have suggested that like chemical and biological weapons, we need to keep a cap on unlimited cyberwar, with its potential for extensive collateral damage. Treaties have been mooted, though the international politics have long way to go yet. But no one ever suggested we needed a treaty to combat unofficial, amateur, cyberwar, because we allegedly didn't need one. We had law instead. Nearly every western country has laws criminalising DDOS and the Cybercrime Convention requires its signatories to have such. The trouble is DDOS is near untrackable - whether it emanates from Russian masterminds or Hampstead hippies. We thus have a law enforcement vacuum, it seems, in which the opposing forces, like gangs from West Side Story will go on fighting their turf wars on, er, our turf. Because it is our turf. Issues like state secrecy, freedom of the press, corporate social responsibility, whistle-blowing rights, the public right to know, are all public concerns. We deserve to have these battles fought where they ought to be, in public, not settled by covert duress on everyone from payment services to DNS servers. To date, ethical debate has centred around the intermediaries who, for whatever reason, have engaged or been enrolled to take down Wikileaks: Amazon, EveryDNS, PayPal, Mastercard, the list goes on. They should have stood up and asserted their support for freedom of speech, many say. They are paying for their supposed spinelessness in DDOS attacks. But this is not their fight. As I said in an earlier post on my blog, it would have been amazingly foolish for Amazon not to have taken down Wikileaks, given the risk they would be personally running of breaking the US Espionage Act if they had not. Amazon is an e-commerce operator; not a journalist. Its chief executive and assets are within US jurisdiction. Its business is to protect its personnel and its shareholders from legal risk, not to bolster a free press which may or may not be too timid. This fight is really between the US government and Wikileaks, not between intermediaries and the Rest of the World. In an ideal universe, it would be settled by an open and transparent prosecution against Wikileaks, where a court could decide if laws had or had not been broken. If they had, the acts of intermediaries in blocking access or funds to Wikileaks would be completely justifiable and cold be enforced by court injunctions. Given however that this is unlikely to happen, if only because of extradition issues, there are other legal and democratic rather than vigilante actions that can help resolve this matter. The people currently anonymously attacking Mastercard and PayPal would do better to harass their MPs (or similar representatives) to get them to ask in public what the hell is going on. Shareholders in organisations like Mastercard could table questions at shareholder meetings. Citizens in the US and elsewhere could pursue the relevant authorities to demand security breach notification, and as relevant, punitive damages, from the government and military organisations whose security practices were clearly derelict. Likely, none of this will happen either. But I would rather see a cyber-truce and a legal war than what we're getting right now, which is the reverse. Lilian Edwards blogs at Pangloss",
