  "content": "Louise Mensch, Conservative MP for Corby and East Northamptonshire, has been using the social network Twitter to defend the appearance of Sally Bercow, wife of the speaker of the House of Commons, on Big Brother. Actually, Mensch has been using Twitter a lot, for weeks now, even considering it an appropriate medium for the questioning of former tabloid editor Piers Morgan over alleged telephone hacking in the Mirror Group. Which it isn't. Some people find Mensch's manic hyper-engagement engaging. I'm afraid I just wonder why she doesn't use her time more wisely, to become better informed about her surely onerous duties before she makes public comment on them. As for Mensch's admired approachability, her supposedly breath-of-fresh-air determination to \"do\" politics differently \u2026 well, her attendance at Parliamentary votes appears to be 76.4%, which seems rather paltry in comparison to her seemingly eternal presence on Twitter. Of those votes she took part in, there was only a single insignificant vote in defiance of the whips. One can only wonder why Mensch's grand embrace of individualistic speaking out does not ever cause any more than the tiniest possible outbreak of full and frank exchange with other members of her party."
