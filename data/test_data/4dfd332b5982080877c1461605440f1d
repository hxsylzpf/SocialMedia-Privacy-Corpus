  "content": "Turbulent times can make the best of us act out of character, Cheryl Cole (@cherylcole). So, due to the whole X-Factor-US-sacking hoopla, we can perhaps forgive the new blonde bob and reconciliation with ex-husband Ashley (albeit, simultaneously hoping you do a U-turn on both). However, the new habit that must stay is your recent embrace of Twitter. Despite always protesting that you would never tweet, you've had a change of heart and announced your arrival last week: \"It's me CC! WHERE MY SOLDIERS AT.......?!!! I can't believe what my fingers are doing but yes I'm tweeting :-s so here goes...X\" The first few weeks on Twitter can be full of perils but I'm always happy to help out. Follow these tips, Chezza. Let's make following you \"worth it\". Follow A basic rule of Twitter thumb is: \"Only a wang refuses to follow anyone back.\" People like the Dalai Lama (@dalailama), who follow nobody and tweet endlessly without ever stopping to read and respond, make few chums in this part of cyberspace. While it is wonderful that you are letting your \"soldiers\" know what really makes Cheryl Cole tick (\"Does anyone else HATE when they put flour on a bun (roll) its goes straight through me\") it's crucial that you follow some of them. Set the record straight As one of the most talked-about women in the UK there are so many questions that remain unanswered. Do you hate Simon Cowell? Have you been smacked on the head since getting back with Ashley? How do you get your hair so big and pouffy all the time? The people need to know. My tip is to look to George Michael (@georgemichael). After a rocky start, George is now bombing round the Twitter track with no stabilisers posting his truth on subjects as diverse as his split with Kenny Goss (\"Love is not always enough when the past isn't finished with us\") to phone hacking (\"What's essential now is that those who had the courage to challenge News International feel able to keep telling the truth as they see it WITHOUT FEAR OF FUTURE REPRISAL.\") Follow his lead, Cheryl, and it will mean the end of boohoohooing on the Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) show forever. Saturday nights on the sofa There are few greater pleasures in life than spending cold Saturday nights in front of the TV combining X Factor, a takeaway and Twitter. This is when tweeting comes to life, forming a virtual sofa of cyber pals gossiping about Louis Walsh's hair dye or whether anyone has managed to listen to a song by Tulisa's (@officialtulisa) band N-Dubz all the way through (no). I hear you've got Saturday nights free for the foreseeable. Join in with the funtimes! Lots of love @scouserachel"
