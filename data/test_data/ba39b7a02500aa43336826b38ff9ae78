  "content": "\"The death of Colonel Gaddafi has brought to a close a very unfortunate chapter in Libya's history,\" Hillary Clinton, told assembled media from a podium on Thursday evening, \"but it also marks the start of a new era for the Libyan people ...\" Hours earlier, on learning the news as she prepared for a television interview, the US secretary of state had been somewhat less composed. Handed a BlackBerry by an aide, Clinton was heard to exclaim: \"Wow. Huh. Unconfirmed. Yeah. Unconfirmed.\" She turned to the television crew. \"Unconfirmed reports about Gaddafi being captured. Unconfirmed.\" The illuminating clip zoomed around the world on social media sites and TV channels almost as rapidly as the emerging accounts of the dictator's death. It said a great deal about the way the news of Gaddafi's death was first received, by television audiences and the US government alike. Most notable, perhaps, was the fact that Clinton did not seek to conceal the contents of her startling message from others present \u2014 almost certainly because she was aware that even as she learned the news, the information was already publicly available. With every rumour or piece of breaking news now subject to instant electronic transmission to millions around the globe, the question of confirmation has become, if anything, more critical than ever before. It is notable that the first report of Gaddafi's arrest (as it then was) on Thursday came via an email from the information centre of the Misrata military council, around noon UK time. Less than 90 minutes later, a snatched image taken from mobile phone footage appearing to show Gaddafi's bloody corpse was playing on 24-hour news channels and being forwarded by email and social media. Whereas Libya's interim National Transitional Council, Nato and the US state department had not yet been able to confirm Gaddafi's death. The grisly images of his body unsettled many, but the ubiquity of their reproduction and the rate at which they were forwarded was about much more than a ghoulish bloodlust that some sought to blame. For many the first-hand images of the Libyan leader in the moments after his death were the first notification that he had even been discovered. The long-hunted Gaddafi was dead \u2014 here it was, rumoured, announced and apparently confirmed in one single image. It was not for some hours that further footage emerged appearing to show Gaddafi alive but badly injured after his capture, raising important and unsettling questions about the manner in which he died. Yet more footage, apparently taken on an iPhone, showed a bloodied Gaddafi seconds after having been dragged from the drain where he was hiding. He was bleeding heavily but able to walk. If television has made it difficult for governments and armies to control the news of political deaths, mobile phone cameras and social media have made it almost impossible. The US government may have refused to release images of the body of Osama bin Laden, citing national security, but al-Jazeera, Twitter and a cheap mobile phone handset made that decision irrelevant in Libya. As with Benito Mussolini, Pol Pot, Nicolae Ceaucescu and Saddam Hussein before him, Muammar Gaddafi is dead and the whole world knows it. On the question of how it happened, however, the footage is inconclusive and answers remain elusive. Some early reports said Gaddafi had been shot with a 9mm pistol in the stomach, others said he had been wounded in one leg, yet others in both. A doctor told the Associated Press he had died from bullet wounds to the head and chest. Libya's interim prime minister, Mahmoud Jibril, said on Friday that Gaddafi had been killed in crossfire."
