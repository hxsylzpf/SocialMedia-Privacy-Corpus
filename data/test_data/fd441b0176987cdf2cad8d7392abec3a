  "content": "Why Windows 7? Why is Microsoft calling it Windows 7? Shouldn't it be Windows 9? Chris Parkins Jack Schofield replies: There have been bucketloads of Windows releases including the old DOS-based versions (3.0, 95, 98SE etc), NT-based versions (XP, Vista) and server versions, so it all depends what you want to count. On the Windows Team Blog, Microsoft's Mike Nash claimed: \"Simply put, this is the seventh release of Windows, so therefore 'Windows 7' just makes sense.\" Later, he tried to justify that by counting all the 9x variants as version 4.0. No count makes sense but Microsoft confusingly called its first NT operating system \"Windows NT 3.1\" and so the next major release was NT4. Windows 2000 naturally became 5.0, and after XP was released as 5.1, Vista became version 6. The next one therefore had to be Windows 7. And it sounds nice. Of course, if you check Windows 7, it's actually numbered 6.1. There are lots of dumb programmers out there and \u2014 as with Windows XP \u2014 not incrementing the version number reduces the risk of software incompatibilities. CCleaner free? How do you get the CCleaner download gratis? Every way I try, it asks me for $29.95 to continue. Chris Whitfield JS: A few other readers also ran into problems, but anyone can download CCleaner for nothing from ccleaner.com/download \u2014 either directly or from FileHippo. If downloading a free program, follow the published link or a real search result. \"Sponsored links\" (ie adverts) may lead to soundalike programs, sites that charge for free software or even what are, in effect, malware sites. Facebook account hacked My niece's Facebook account has been taken over by someone who is putting up very bad things about her. Tina Bardwell JS: Facebook provides online help (facebook.com/help), and covers \"Security: account was hacked or 'phished'\". The section headed \"My account has been hacked\" has a link to a form you can fill in. AVG or MSE? I'm using AVG free with Windows XP. Should I change to Security Essentials? Andrew White JS: I generally take the view that \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\". Microsoft Security Essentials is being well received and is worth a go if you need to change your anti-virus software for some reason. However, if you're happy with AVG, Avira AntiVir, Avast or a similar free program, I'd stick with it for now. Missing drive space I've bought a new desktop running Vista Home Premium. After copying files from the old computer and installing and setting up the programs I need, which add up to about 120GB, I find almost 200GB of the 500GB hard drive has been used. David Menarry JS: The hard drive industry uses \"decimal bits\" (powers of 10) because that gives a bigger number than the \"real bits\" (powers of 2) used by software. Your 500GB hard drive is seen by software as around 466GB. The hardware manufacturer has probably taken a chunk for a \"restore partition\" so that you can easily reinstall the operating system. Microsoft has probably taken some for System Restore and a Shadow Copy. And programs always occupy more hard drive space than they need because each file must occupy at least one sector. Go to the Control Panel's Administrative Tools section and run the Disk Management program. A check that includes hidden files and folders, including operating system folders, should give you a better idea of whether any drive space is actually missing. Backchat \u2022 Saul Steve wanted to fix the keyboard on a laptop. Tony Schroder, Andrew Richards and Anne Barry, sensibly suggested plugging in a separate keyboard. Something like the PC Line PCL-SK1, \u00a36.99 from Currys or PC World, should be fine, and Maplin has a large collection. Check if you need a USB or PS2 connection."
