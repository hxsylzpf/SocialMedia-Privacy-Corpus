  "content": "The Sun and News of the World today agreed to pay \u00a3100,000 in damages to Wayne Rooney over allegations that he assaulted his fianc\u00e9e in a nightclub. Both papers are to publish \"prominent\" apologies for articles that appeared in April last year defaming the Manchester United and England footballer. They will also pay Rooney's legal costs. \"The defendant sincerely apologises for the distress and embarrassment caused by these defamatory articles which it fully accepts were false,\" said the papers' barrister, John Kelsey-Fry QC, in a statement at the high court in London. Rooney's solicitors, Schillings, said the damages amounted to \u00a3100,000, \"reflecting the gravity of libel\". The footballer intends to donate the money to charity, Schillings added. He sued over a Sun article headlined \"Crazed Rooney Thumps Coleen\", which alleged he had slapped his fianc\u00e9e, Coleen McLoughlin, across the face in a Cheshire nightclub. A News of the World story, headlined \"Rooney: The Truth\" further alleged he had punched her in the ribs and chest, told her to \"Fuck off home\" and had to be calmed down and restrained by teammates. Ronald Thwaites QC, representing Rooney, said the allegations were \"completely false and indefensible\". \"The defendant got it wrong. The claimant and his fianc\u00e9e Coleen McLoughlin were devastated by the publication of these false allegations which caused the claimant and his fiancee to suffer enormous embarrassment and distress,\" Mr Thwaites said. He added that the two papers had agreed to pay Rooney's legal costs on top of the damages. \"With only 58 days to the start of The World Cup The Sun and The News of The World are pleased to have reached a settlement with Wayne Rooney,\" the papers said in a statement. \"We can now put this case behind us and focus on a great tournament. We wish him and the England team every success in Germany and look forward to welcoming them back with the World Cup trophy.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
