  "content": "When Stefanie Gordon (@Stefmara) boarded her flight from New York to Florida to visit her parents she was just excited to have a whole row of seats to herself. \"Phone off. Not gonna pay for wifi Gonna try to sleep. See ya in Florida,\" she tweeted. Instead she caused an internet storm after capturing breathtaking pictures of the space shuttle Endeavour on her iPhone as it burst through the clouds near her plane, hurtling away from its launch pad at the Kennedy Space Centre. Her reward? \"Dad is finally ok with me being on twitter.\"",
