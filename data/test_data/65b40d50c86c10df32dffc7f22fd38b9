  "content": "The lines between child and adult are increasingly blurred. Young people make a significant financial contribution to the economy, they drink, smoke, take drugs, have sex, give birth. They have taken on adults' obsession with weight and appearance, they are stressed out, they take anti-depressants, and they also take their own lives. Meanwhile, we throw children into prison \u2013 even those as young as 10 years old. The number of children sentenced to custody in England and Wales more than tripled between 1991 and 2006 to a rate of about 4,000 a year \u2013 the highest rate of any in the western world. As the festive season fetishises good little boys and girls as angelic choristers and divides children into those for whom Santa will or will not come, the contrast is stark between the little angels at the door singing carols and those in the street huddling in groups against the December wind and wreathed by marijuana smoke. On these winter nights, and even on warmer days, the hooded top becomes the dividing line on a battleground, as frightening and alienating to some people as the hijab is to some others. Under the hood lies the repository of society's greatest fears \u2013 a snarling, spitting and swearing rejection of national values attached by a lead to a bull mastiff. In truth, western children today are proper little Christmas consumers, not just of toys and video games but of all the fears and foibles of adulthood. Yet even the briefest scan of December's headlines involving teenagers delivers the usual script about Britain's youth. In Glasgow, a 22-year-old man is in hospital following a confrontation with a gang of teenagers. In Edinburgh, two teenagers are being sought for a serious sexual assault on a 13-year-old girl. In Dorset, two 17-year-old boys have kicked a fawn to death in a barbaric attack. We read that more than 5,000 teenagers had an abortion last year that was at least their second termination. Most devastatingly of all, the December headlines reveal young people in the UK are now among the least educated in the developed world. Positive stories \u2013 usually involving reformed offenders \u2013 are negligible. Society's retort is not to listen and learn but to punish and criminalise with ever-cruder responses. Yet, while we punish teenagers as adults and expect them to accept adult responsibilities, we afford them few adult rights. Not only are they not allowed to vote, but we rarely even allow them an adult voice. The Teens' Speech, to be aired on Christmas Day on MySpace (just after the Queen at 3.10pm) has listened to the hopes, fears and dreams of hundreds of teenagers over the last 50 days up and down the country. From Christians to Muslims, young adults with Asperger's syndrome, a transgender teenager, rich kids to poor, these are Britain's teenagers shown for once in their diversity rather than as a homogenous, faceless mass. Here we see that teenagers are as afraid as anyone about the state of the world, awash in a sea of fears \u2013 of knife crime, violence, racism. A Muslim girl with a headscarf talks about how she wants to be an actress, but that she hasn't seen many actresses with headscarves \u2013 her wish is for greater tolerance in the world. Other teens share their worries about whether asbos work, whether there is any point to the age of consent, about the rise of the racist BNP and about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Their conclusions, however, are overwhelming positive: Britain, as one boy says, is worth \"sticking around for\". This Christmas, the voices of teenagers and young people are not just singing carols, but all around us \u2013 and they are full of ideas about how to make our world a better, safer place."
