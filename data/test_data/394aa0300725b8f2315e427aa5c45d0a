  "content": "The publishers of the Sun on Sunday have agreed in the high court to pay an undisclosed sum of damages and costs to a celebrity who fought to keep his name out of a tabloid \"kiss'n'tell\" following a three-way sexual encounter. The agreement ends months of litigation over attempts by the celebrity, known only as PJS, to block News Group Newspapers (NGN) from revealing his identity. The case ended up being heard by the highest court in the land. As part of the agreement, NGN has agreed to remove some articles and not to use, disclose or publish certain information, including details that might lead to the identification of PJS as the claimant in the case, including identifying his partner or three others. PJS is said to have had an extramarital affair with another couple four years ago. The couple approached the Sun on Sunday in January this year and told reporters about the relationship. The paper, which planned to publish the story, contacted PJS's lawyers, initiating the courtroom dispute. In January, NGN won the first round of litigation when a high court judge refused to impose an injunction. But appeal judges reversed this decision, and the case went to the supreme court. In May, the supreme court ruled that the Sun on Sunday should be barred from revealing PJS's identity. It said the information was private, there was no public interest in its disclosure and, while secrecy and confidentiality may have been compromised by publicity, a court was unlikely to find that PJS's right to privacy was defeated by that fact. Delivering the court's judgment by a four-to-one majority, Lord Mance said there was no public interest in naming PJS, and revealing details of the affair would breach the family's privacy. He said: \"Publication of the story would infringe privacy rights of PJS, his partner and their children \u2026 There is no public interest, however much it may be of interest to some members of the public, in publishing kiss'n'tell stories or criticisms of private sexual conduct, simply because the persons involved are well-known; and so there is no right to invade privacy by publishing them. \"It is different if the story has some bearing on the performance of a public office or the correction of a misleading public impression cultivated by the person involved. But \u2026 that does not apply here.\" Referring to the fact that many of the details had already been published online, Mance said: \"It is true the story has been accessible on the internet and social media but if the injunction were to be lifted, there would be intensive coverage of the story by the Sun on Sunday \u2013 and there is little doubt, by other newspapers \u2013 as well as unrestricted internet and social media coverage, all of which could constitute additional and potentially more enduring invasions of the privacy of PJS, his partner and their children.\" At the high court in London on Friday, Mr Justice Warby said PJS and NGN had agreed a final order in the action for breach of confidence and misuse of private information. The proceedings were stayed on the basis that NGN pay a specified sum in full and final settlement of PJS's claim for damages and costs. The judge said: \"I accept the undertakings offered by the defendant, which are clear and plainly given on advice. I see no reason not to make an order for payment of the agreed sum. There is no reason not to allow the parties to keep the figure confidential.\" Dr Evan Harris, of the campaign group Hacked Off, praised the agreement as a \"massive climbdown\" for the Sun on Sunday, adding: \"The real issue here, however, is what would happen to the everyday victims of press intrusion that Hacked Off works with \u2013 the vast majority of press victims, who do not have the deep pockets needed to take on the Murdoch press and other large newspaper groups who would trample over their rights.\" The privacy lawyer Amber Melville-Brown, of Withers, said: \"Sometimes an injunction is the only way to go. Once the privacy kitty cat is out of the bag, it's a tough job to stuff her back in again. Free speech? Yes; but not at all costs. Let's all be a bit sensible here, and accept that we are not entitled to know everything about everyone all the time. And nor should we want to.\" Kate Macmillan, a privacy lawyer at Collyer Bristow, said the law had changed over the past decade to protect serious journalism, adding: \"This is about something completely different. It's about the commercial underpinning of tabloid newspapers.\" The supreme court case, she said, had established that there was \"no public interest in celebrity sexual tittle-tattle\". But Bob Satchwell, the executive director of the Society of Editors, said the secrecy surrounding the case risked undermining public confidence in open justice. \"The circumstances surrounding this case must leave the public baffled,\" he said. \"That does the law and justice system no favours because it undermines public confidence. Open justice is a key principle of any mature democratic society. It should not be a plaything for individuals and expensive lawyers.\" The supreme court decision was criticised in May by the senior barrister Lord Lester, who wrote that press regulators, not the courts, should be responsible for upholding the privacy code of practice. He said: \"Using the courts to rule on freely available celebrity tittle-tattle abuses our hard-fought freedoms and leaves the judges and the law looking foolish and diminished.\" Timeline January A couple approach the Sun on Sunday with details of their relationship with a \"well-known\" married individual, subsequently referred to in a legal judgment by the initials PJS. The paper contacts PJS's lawyers, initiating a courtroom dispute as he seeks to prevent reporting about his alleged extramarital affair. 22 January In an anonymised judgment, the court of appeal rules that the Sun on Sunday cannot publish the story because PJS, who has an \"open relationship\", had an expectation that his sexual encounters would remain private. 11 April A Scottish newspaper prints the identities of the couple who took the injunction stating that it is doing so in order to champion free speech and freedom of the press. It followed details of the story being published in a US newspaper. 15 April The Guardian and other media organisations win the right to report on the appeal hearing, which raised the issue of whether injunctions restricting reporting can be enforced in the era of the internet. Judges delay their decision on whether to lift the injunction. 18 April News Group Newspapers, publishers of the Sun and its sister Sunday title, win an application to have the injunction lifted, after telling the court earlier that the celebrity had already been named so widely online and in publications in the US and Scotland that the injunction was effectively redundant and unenforceable. 19 April The injunction banning the media naming the celebrity involved in an extramarital affair is extended for another two days by the supreme court. Lawyers for PJS succeed in having their claim fast-tracked to the supreme court in Westminster, which decides the case is important enough to have a hearing later in the week. 19 May The supreme court rules that the interim injunction will not be lifted."
