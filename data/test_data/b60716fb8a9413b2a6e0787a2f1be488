  "content": "The Oscar winner-designed costumes are ready, the fake waterfalls and ruins are installed and the local planning objections are squelched: Silicon Valley's wedding of the year, estimated price $9m, is on track. Sean Parker, 33, who made billions with Napster, Facebook and other technology companies, is preparing to marry Alexandra Lenas this week at a lavish ceremony which has already sealed off a 40-acre beauty spot in Big Sur, California. The mogul, who was played by Justin Timberlake in the film The Social Network, has prevailed over Monterey County planning and state coastal commission officials who worried about possible violations of the building code, local media reported. Workers have continued transforming the grounds of the Ventana Inn &amp; Spa resort for an elaborate June 1 ceremony whose details remain closely guarded secrets, according to the Carmel Pine Cone. Parker has confirmed that Ngila Dickson, who won a costume design Oscar for Lord of the Rings, will dress guests in \"gorgeous, inspiring, and unique designs that are both modern and whimsical\". But he denied widely reported rumours that the wedding would have a Game of Thrones theme. \"This is not a 'theme' wedding, and there will be nothing medieval about it.\" Parker has reportedly hired landscapers to build fake ruins, waterfalls, bridges, ponds and a gated cottage in a $9m splurge, including $1m on plants and flowers. \"Sean is so excited about the wedding he doesn't care about the cost. He has invited around 300 people, all his friends and business contacts,\" an unnamed source told the New York Post. The tycoon has been engaged to Lenas, a singer-songwriter, for two years. They have a five-month-old daughter, Winter Victoria. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg recently married in a low-key ceremony in keeping with the non-flashy habits of many Silicon Valley billionaires. Parker's conspicuous consumption \u2013 he and Lenas have stayed at the New York Plaza hotel for two years while their townhouse is remodelled \u2013 harks back to the Gatsby-style excesses of the dotcom boom."
