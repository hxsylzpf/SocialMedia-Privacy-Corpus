  "content": "At Facebook's annual geek-con, F8, the internet giant announced some its most significant changes yet. Now intent on becoming a platform for your whole lifestyle, Facebook will try to turn the web on its head and rewire it from \"Search\" to \"Social\". But what will this mean for music? It's more than just \"Like\", now it's all about \"Listen\". Facebook is broadening its lexicon. Eighteen months ago Facebook launched the now ubiquitous \"Like\" button, which quickly took hold. Now, they're taking it a step further, \"Listen\" buttons will start to replace the familiar \"Like\" button where there's something to hear, along with \"Watch\" and \"Read\" (presumably that's just the start). The new buttons will work in a similar way to the old ones, but send a message out to your friends via your profile \"Ben Perreau just listened to Good Vibrations\", these buttons will be one of the ways of actively logging any song, artist or radio station you've been listening to and wear it on your profile like a badge of honour (until somebody cooler notices and you remove it). It's building a music community of 800 million people. Facebook wants you to be using Facebook all the time. One of the most exciting features is \"listen with your friends\". This means Facebook is inviting you to share your listening and join in with others. So if you have friends across the globe who are still lamenting the loss of REM, you can now howl uncontrollably over \"Everybody' Hurts\" en masse. More importantly, you'll be able to do it all in real-time, and have a discussion in the context of what you're listening to. Get ready to sound knowledgable: \"I 3&gt;'d their first album.\" This is a great idea for artists who want to create special events with discussions around their new music, gather feedback and, crucially, get friends to discuss the music and share it. It's also great for broadcast radio, where there's a virtual community of people listening at once. With Facebook the hits can ripple across the world as people share them with each other. Facebook will track your listening, automatically. Facebook is desperate to display a record of your life over time, and that includes your music habits. Unsurprisingly, they're calling this new profile a \"Timeline\". Facebook will publish all your listening habits to this Timeline (it's brilliant for late-night navelgazing). You'll simply have to authorise a music service once, to monitor your listening and send it all to your Timeline automatically. But watch out, if you've been listening to the same song on repeat, you'll soon get found out by your friends when they go snooping around your profile. You'll find this similar to Last.FM, which tracks your listening and presents it back to you in a visual way. Discovering new music is going to be great fun. If you logged into Facebook earlier this week you'll have noticed the ability to \"Subscribe\" to people you're interested in. So if you want to find some new music to listen to, you'll just need to know of somebody who has great taste (my profile is facebook.com/ben.perreau). You'll also find that friends who listen to similar artists are more visible to you on Facebook, thanks to their increasingly clever algorithm. It's not good news for download stores. It's even worse for CDs. But we knew that. Facebook's new features are going to help to establish what you \"listen to\" as the currency that record companies care about, not the MP3s gathering digital dust on your hard-drive. So accessing a broad range of music that gets logged by Facebook (and seen by all your friends) is probably going to be much easier with a service such as internet radio (because it's free), than a subscription music service such as Spotify (which costs), but it's going to be really tough for old download services such as iTunes where your listening habits are isolated from the Facebook experience. This is a masterful move for Facebook, who can persuade you to hang around for longer (showing you ads while you visit), while music services such as Spotify continue to pay royalty cheques. It looks as if Facebook is nudging deeper into our lives with every innovation. It has the potential to give internet radio listening a boost as demand will grow for free, connected listening experiences that people can discuss. Whereas Apple may be forced to make iTunes more open, possibly by introducing a scrobbler-type app that logs the music you listen to on, say, your iPod and sends this info to your Facebook page (RIP Last.FM?). Basically, you should get ready for your music tastes to be tracked and strewn across the web like a bad breakup \u2013 Facebook wants to collect a visual biography of your life, and it won't stop until it is tracking every bit."
