  "content": "Some said that within two weeks of revolution we would suddenly be like Japan or China, but look where we are after a hundred days. Now Egypt has huge economic problems, sectarian strife that could turn into a civil war, people are walking around armed, and everyone knows the security situation has got worse and something bad could happen at any time \u2026 this is the result of freedom, the result of 'revolution'. People are starting to wake up and realise the country is suffering, that this isn't a successful revolution or a revolution of the people. When a revolution succeeds anywhere in the world it succeeds 100% \u2013 not like this one. Facebook is not just for the revolutionaries; we're using it to gather people together, and our page \"Ana aasif ya rayyis\" has over 83,000 supporters. We're not against change. But it should be change with a better attitude, not chaos or division. President Mubarak fought in the [1973] October war and won us back the Sinai, we can't forget this. A lot of people love him and a lot of people want to defend him, yet because we try to honour him people call us counter-revolutionaries. So having a different opinion makes you a counter-revolutionary? I thought we were supposed to have freedom of opinion now, isn't that what the revolutionaries demanded? During the uprising Mubarak came out and said, Be patient, I'll be gone in six months, there will be no hereditary rule, and in the meantime we'll get to work and deal with all these new changes and developments. And then all of a sudden we hear the protesters chanting \"irhal\" (\"leave\") \u2013 and they meant \"leave now\", which is impossible. Not like this \u2013 give Mubarak a chance. But they wouldn't. No one knows why the police attacked protesters but it's inconceivable the president of the republic would have ordered them to open fire. Mubarak would never tell [former interior minister] Habib Al-Adly to do that \u2013 Al Adly gave the orders himself. People say the NDP is paying me, but not everyone who has a different opinion is paid. I don't want money and I haven't taken any money \u2013 I and many others just want to show Mubarak love from the Egyptian people. And yet [interim Prime Minister] Essam Sharaf tells us we have no place in this country. Thankfully when we're out at protests some people come up to me and say, \"God bless you, you are a true Egyptian\". The goals of reducing corruption and gaining freedom, that's something we support. But Mubarak always said there is a very thin line between democracy and chaos. In Egypt we took democracy and freedom and flipped it into chaos. Unfortunately we've followed people who have no relationship and connection with the Egyptian people like [Google executive and pro-change Facebook organiser] Wael Ghonim and [former UN nuclear weapons chief and prominent opposition leader] Mohamed ElBaradei. But our protests will continue \u2013 if Mubarak gets taken to prison, we will take to the streets again."
