  "content": "Marks &amp; Spencer is to kick off its glitzy Christmas advertising campaign, on the theme of \"Believe in Magic and Sparkle\", via social media for the first time. A teaser for the Alice in Wonderland-inspired ad, featuring Helena Bonham Carter and models David Gandy and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, will launch on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter on Wednesday before the full two-minute film goes live via the same channels next Monday. Television viewers won't get to see Huntington-Whiteley dashing through a snow-sprinkled forest and riding a magic carpet in her lingerie until next Wednesday, during the Coronation Street advert break. Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, director of marketing &amp; business development, said: \"It's all about interaction and a conversation with our customers. Digital is the fastest way to be in that conversation and you are going to see us doing more of that.\" As part of its interactive plan, M&amp;S will ask viewers to vote via Twitter and Facebook on the name of the Highland Terrier that stars in the advert \u2013 they can choose between Magic or Sparkle. Footage of the dog taking shoppers on an adventure will also be released online. Bousquet-Chavanne said the advert, directed by Johan Renck who has previously shot music videos for Madonna and worked with designer labels including Armani and Agent Provocateur, used universal tales including Alice in Wonderland and the Wizard of Oz, which would appeal in M&amp;S's international markets including China and the Middle East, where it would also be distributed online.",
