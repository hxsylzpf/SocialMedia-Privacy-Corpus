  "content": "Experimenting with its users, Twitter has started pulling some higher profile features and adding others for specific subsets of tweeters. Having only rolled out a month ago, Twitter has removed the feature allowing anyone to send a private direct message to anyone else, even if they are not following each other. According to Twitter, the move is part of the new experiments that the company is carrying out using user data. Twitter is using small groups from its 200m-strong user base to test certain features before deciding whether or not to roll them out to the wider audience. 'You may see some features that your friend doesn't see, or vice versa' Twitter said that it has accelerated its experimental side, rolling out new tests to users almost on a daily basis, leveraging a new, more robust \"experimental framework\" that the company has built into its existing products. \"So what does this mean for you? You may see some features that your friend doesn't see, or vice versa. This is all in service of making Twitter the best it can be. We appreciate your help in doing that, so thank you,\" said Alex Roetter, Twitter's vice president of engineering in a blogpost in September. A push into the personal messaging space? The direct messaging (DM) feature is one of the most high profile additions to fall under Twitter's experimental testing, and could indicate that the company is looking at moving on DMs as a push into the personal messaging space currently dominated by WhatsApp and other text message replacement services. The company also pushed out updates to its iOS and Android applications improving search and adding filters to help find newer tweets, and to screen for pictures and videos, as well as changes to its \"Discover\" tab to improve trend discovery for TV shows and other news."
