  "content": "Going up Droids, wookies and hair buns All things Star Wars are allowed this week. Glitter roots No, it's not dandruff. The party gods have spoken and sparkly roots are the result. Christopher Kane trainers The white ones with the neon strap are all we want for Christmas. Rachel McAdams' look in Spotlight Best bad fashion we've ever seen. Lam\u00e9 See that Topshop Unique dress and the butt of the best joke in the Zoolander 2 trailer. Roads Cool new fragrance line out of Dublin. Our favourite is Afropolis. Add to all fashionable Christmas stockings now. Chessboard hair As seen on Zayn Malik: half blond, half black, all man. Going down Harry Styles Is it just us, or is he morphing into Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen? Matching your hair to your dress Often looks more like there's been an accident with the dye bottle. See Lily Allen's navy blue bob and frock at the British Fashion Awards. Newborn photo shoots All the rage among Insta-parents, who seem to believe that it's never too early to help a child perfect their selfie face. The teeth emoji confusion Is it \"awkward\" or \"annoyed\"? Surely the biggest question of our time. Hump day Still not a thing. It's called Wednesday. Black cod Nobu classic usurped by prawn soliders at Sexy Fish. Mean Christmas jumpers Not funny and not in the spirit of things. Go hard or go home."
