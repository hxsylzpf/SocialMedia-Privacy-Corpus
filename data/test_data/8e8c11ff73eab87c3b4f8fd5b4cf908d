  "content": "The government's austerity programme has led to a growing switch-off of CCTV cameras that risks misleading the public about their safety, the surveillance watchdog has warned. In his annual report published on Wednesday, Tony Porter, the surveillance camera commissioner, points out that council budget constraints have led to \"severe cuts\" to town centre CCTV systems. The report also reveals how ministers tried to brush off Porter's concerns by urging him to take up the issue with councils rather than the government. In many areas, the monitoring of cameras has been reduced and in others, systems have been switched off altogether, the report said. Areas include Anglesey in north Wales and central London, where Conservative-led Westminster city council switched off its 75 cameras in an attempt to save \u00a31m. In Carmarthenshire, west Wales, 87 cameras will no longer be monitored. Porter wrote: \"I continue to see the impact of austerity bite at local authority level, impacting on the provision of surveillance cameras in principal local authorities and town and district councils as some authorities switch systems off or reduce monitoring.\" He added: \"There is a real danger that \u2026 systems will age and become decrepit, operators will become deskilled and the public will be deceived into believing that surveillance is contributing to their safety when in fact it is not.\" The report includes correspondence with the government, which reveals that the local government minister, Marcus Jones, refused to meet Porter to discuss his concerns. In a letter in August 2015, Porter said: \"Local authority CCTV systems have been the bedrock of crime prevention and detection and reducing the fear of crime over the last 20 or so years. During the current period of austerity, as this is not a statutory service, it is and has been the subject of severe cuts \u2026 I am concerned about the impact of austerity.\" Porter called for a meeting with Jones and urged him to show \"strategic leadership\" by promoting innovative examples of the ways some councils have continued to fund CCTV. Jones said he understood \"concerns about competing calls on local authority budgets\", but refused to meet Porter and urged him to take up the issue with councils rather than his department. \"I would suggest that you continue to reach out to local authorities, rather than through or with my department \u2026 I do not think a meeting is required.\" The report notes research showing a 46.4% decrease in council funding on maintenance and monitoring of CCTV. It also points to a number of local rows about who pays for CCTV. Porter writes: \"This argument is being played out across the country resulting, in some cases, in a standoff over funding between police and local authorities and, in some cases, threats to completely withdraw the service.\" Porter said in one English region, only one out of 12 local authorities had a dedicated manager to monitor the CCTV operation room. He added: \"I am seeing a reduction in hours where CCTV is monitored and ageing equipment whose value is becoming more and more questionable. I understand that much of the local authority CCTV system is still analogue and the necessity for updating with digital HD equipment is pressing if the advantages offered by modern technology are to be realised.\"",
