  "content": "Why did you start the #BringBackOurGirls Twitter campaign? I was disturbed by the acts of terror committed by Boko Haram which were becoming more cruel and gruesome, even before the abduction of the Chibok schoolgirls on 14 April. When the news of the abduction of over 200 Chibok school girls broke, I promised myself not to allow it go the way of other atrocities. I took to Twitter immediately to create awareness of what happened and to pressurise our government to rescue the girls and put an end to the acts of terror against hapless citizens, particularly schoolchildren. Initially my tweets were without any hashtag then later under hashtags like #ChibokGirls, which didn't gain much attention. Then on 23 April I saw the former Nigerian minister of education, Oby Ezekwesili, speak. She was among the few public figures that spoke out about the abduction of the schoolgirls. She asked people to demand that government bring back our daughters. I tweeted with the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, which she retweeted. The hashtag went viral within few days. Were you surprised when the campaign took off? What did you think when Michelle Obama tweeted #BringBackOurGirls? I was a bit surprised with the success of the campaign. Initially, my intention was to create local awareness of the abduction. Surpassing that expectation and becoming a global campaign was really gratifying. I was happy when I saw Michelle Obama and other international figures joining the campaign. The celebrity endorsements helped to spur our government into action. Before then, [Goodluck] Jonathan'\u200es government denied the abduction. And even when it did admit it, it did nothing until the celebrity endorsements. How can advocates such as yourself keep attention on the campaign? The campaign can be kept in the public eye by tweeting about it. Also, we need local and international media publicity and to march on the streets, as the #BringBackOurGirls campaign is here in Abuja. What five things need to happen to get the girls home? There is need for a strong and committed leadership; to equip our military with the most modern weaponry to fight Boko Haram; for collaboration and cooperation between the federal and state governments on one hand and between Nigeria and it's neighbours on the other; for technical assistance from the international community to our military; and finally to leave the door of negotiation with the insurgents open. What did you think when you heard supporters of Goodluck Jonathan had used the slogan #BringBackGoodluck? Seeing the billboards and banners of #BringBackJonathan2015 was both shocking and disgusting. It was a mockery of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. It was a callous and insensitive move by the supporters of Goodluck Jonathan. They only care about re-election, not about rescuing the abducted girls. Do you worry about the attention the campaign will get with Ebola, Isis and other humanitarian crises? Even before Ebola and Isis's intensified activities, most of the world that stood with #BringBackOurGirls had moved on. But we here in Nigeria and a few others outside haven't moved on. We have been persistent. We have been tweeting about it every day. We're doing a daily one-hour sit out in Abuja and weekly in Lagos. We have continued to pressurise Jonathan's government.
