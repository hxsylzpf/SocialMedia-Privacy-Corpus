  "content": "Photographic agency Rex Features has publicly apologised and agreed to pay damages to Kate Middleton, the girlfriend of Prince William, for invading her privacy. Middleton complained through her solicitors Harbottle &amp; Lewis after a photographer who did not work for Rex took pictures of Middleton on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day last year during a private holiday in Cornwall. No British publication published the pictures, but Rex syndicated the pictures overseas where some were published. The company has now apologised: \"Although at the time Rex Features did not know that an infringement of privacy had occurred, we now accept that this was the case and that by distributing the photographs we were a party to that invasion of privacy. Accordingly we have agreed to pay compensation to Ms Middleton and have undertaken not to syndicate any further private photographs of her. \"We apologise to Ms Middleton for what has taken place.\" One report has estimated that Middleton will receive \u00a310,000 in damages, plus substantial legal costs. The photographer was said to have followed Middleton and taken photos of her on tennis court on Duchy of Cornwall land from a footpath. Middleton was understood to have been concerned that the photographer might have taken photos of her family having Christmas dinner. The apology appears on the Rex Features website. Harbottle &amp; Lewis said that Middleton would be donating the damages to charity. UPDATE: I have now been in contact with Niraj Tanna, of Ikon Pictures, who took the photographs of Kate Middleton. He says, contrary to the statement from Rex Features, that he never \"followed\" Middleton. Rather, after receiving a tip off, he went to the footpath and took photographs of Middleton playing tennis. He denies that he ever took any photographs of Middleton inside the house that she was staying in. \"Under no circumstances did I harass her. She even wished me Merry Christmas on the day,\" Tanna said."
