  "content": "Media outlets that took at face value a BBC reporter's tweet about the Queen's hospitalisation and death, which were released accidentally during an internal \"obituary exercise\", are feeling a little sheepish right now. But it's far from the first time that news of someone's death has been greatly exaggerated \u2013 and believed. 1. Margaret Thatcher In 2009 messages swept across a black tie dinner for the Canadian Conservative party saying that Margaret Thatcher \u2013 idolised by many at the event \u2013 had died. The news reached Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper at the top table, and his aide, Dimitri Soudas began drafting a letter of condolence to the UK government. It was only after calls to Downing Street and Buckingham Palace that the concerned politicians found out Baroness Thatcher was perfectly well. The source of the rumour? The sad passing of another revered Thatcher, the much-loved cat belonging to transport minister John Baird, who had sent an inexpertly constructed text to a friend saying the animal, named after the Iron Lady, had passed away. 2. Ian Dury On only his second day as a DJ on Xfm in 1998, Bob Geldof was informed his friend Ian Dury had died via a phone message from a \"distressed\" listener. Taking the message as genuine, Geldof read out the news to listeners as the show was coming to a close and finished the slot with Dury's Reasons To Be Cheerful. On learning the report was false, Geldof headed back into the studio to make an on-air apology. The programme controller of Capital Radio Group, which then owned Xfm, described the false report as an \"unfortunate incident\", adding: \"The caller sounded genuinely distressed, but Bob has been reminded that it is normal practice to check whether a story is true before making any announcement.\" 3. Nelson Mandela Mandela was the subject of a string of inaccurate death reports in 2013. In April that year South African TV channel Universal broadcast a video obituary including clips titled \"Remembering Madiba 1918-2013\". The clips, held on file and were particularly worrying as Mandela was at the time undergoing hospital treatment. The following June a Twitter account pretending to be former Mirror editor Piers Morgan tweeted the \"breaking news\" that Mandela had died in his sleep. Then in September a statement from former president George W Bush released by his spokesman Jim McGrath mourned \"the passing of one of the greatest believers in freedom we have had the privilege to know\". Sadly, reports of Mandela's death the following December were true, and were greeted with outpourings of grief across the world. 4. Michael Heseltine One of Chris Morris's more legendary pranks \u2013 and one that got his The Chris Morris Music Show on Radio 1 suspended for two weeks by the BBC \u2013 was his prank involving reporting the death of Michael Heseltine. The show was filed with ambiguity that would have confused many Radio 1 listeners, including the line \"if there is any news of the death of Michael Heseltine in the next hour we'll let you know\" and reports that the former defence secretary had \"hit the ground screaming\". It even wove in interviews about the death with then Tory MP Jerry Hayes and Jam bassist Bruce Foxton, neither of whom was in on the joke. Morris performed a similar prank on the final episode of the show on Boxing Day, announcing the death of Jimmy Savile. 5. Barack Obama Internet hackers appear to have an unhealthy fascination with using the Twitter accounts of official news outlets to falsely announce the deaths of prominant politicians. Former Russian president Michael Gorbechov and Saudi foreign minister Saud al-Faisal are among those targeted by people breaking into accounts. The most audacious attack, however, was the use of the Fox News politics Twitter account to announce in a series of tweets that US president Barack Obama had been killed in a shooting in Idaho. It even went as far as wishing vice-president Joe Biden good luck before Fox managed to take back control. Another hacking attack two years later \u2013 this time on the Associated Press Twitter account \u2013 merely said Obama had been injured in an attack on the White House, but still managed to spark a flash crash that temporarily wiped billions of dollars off the stock market."
