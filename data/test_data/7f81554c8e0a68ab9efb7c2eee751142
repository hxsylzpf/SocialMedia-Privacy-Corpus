  "content": "Journalists covering Prince Edward's first public engagement since the row over his nephew Prince William were forced to leave after one asked the prince about his company's activities. Reporters attending the official engagement, at a school in Sutton Coldfield, were ejected after the BBC's royal correspondent, Jennie Bond, asked the prince whether he would be making any more royal documentaries. \"I asked him whether he planned to make any more royal programmes,\" Bond told MediaGuardian.co.uk, \"and he said, 'I've nothing more to say'. \"Then the press officer said we all had to leave. I was leaving anyway, but I could hear them saying, 'Everyone's got to go'.\" According to sources, palace aides handled the situation with an unusual degree of control. Bond, an established royal correspondent, was one of a so-called \"rota\" of journalists - a select, officially picked group. Insiders said it was unusual to request a group of journalists on a rota to leave. Prince Edward has been at odds with his brother Charles since a film crew from his company, Ardent Productions, was caught filming at St Andrews University where Prince William has just started a degree course. The prince came under a hail of criticism from the tabloid press, who claimed he had been \"arrogant\". But the tapes have since been handed over to Buckingham Palace, which said they did not contain images of Prince William. This is the second time Prince Edward has been at the centre of a tabloid row. Earlier this year his wife, founder of a PR agency, was strongly criticised when she hinted to a News of the World reporter posing as a sheikh that her royal connections could be exploited for the benefit of her clients. Prince Charles has made no attempt to hide his displeasure at Edward maintaining a career in the media at the same time as carrying out his royal duties.",
