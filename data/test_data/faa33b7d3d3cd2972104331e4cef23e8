  "content": "\"Heather vehemently denies the allegations in the News of the World printed on Sunday which are untrue and highly defamatory. \"She is able to commence legal proceedings in relation to these vicious slurs against her reputation which have previously been denied by her. They are only published by the newspaper at this sensitive time purely to sell copy. The sources of the article are unreliable and have been paid for their story. \"Heather is very distressed by this article. She continues to recover slowly from her revision amputation operation and has suffered weight loss, anxiety and sleeping problems as a result of the stress and anxiety of the break up of her marriage. The coverage of this in certain newspapers has caused further distress and illness to her. \"The interests of her daughter are of paramount concern. She will defer issue of legal proceedings until the arrangements in relation to the divorce are concluded but intends to sue at that stage all parties (including individuals) who are intent on damaging her reputation. \"Her present time and energies will be directed solely with regard to resolution of the matrimonial matters and not any newspaper or individual seeking to make money out of her misery.\""
