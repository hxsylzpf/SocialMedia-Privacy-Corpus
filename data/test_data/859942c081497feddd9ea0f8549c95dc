  "content": "Protecting one's privacy is a hot topic everywhere, not just in Britain. In the latest example, Australia's communications and media authority (ACMA) has just issued guidelines that restrict what TV news can and cannot film. It has not acted swiftly, given that its curtailing of invasive journalism was prompted by an incident in three years ago. In 2008, ACMA received \"multiple complaints\" about a Channel Ten news report of a boating accident in which a distressed man was shown sobbing after the death of his parents. Chris Chapman, ACMA's chairman, said the aim of the new \"principles-based\" guidelines was to \"assist broadcasters\" to understand their obligations. Source: The Australian",
