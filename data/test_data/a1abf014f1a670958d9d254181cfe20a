  "content": "John Bercow will be re-elected Commons Speaker tomorrow despite the opposition of a small group of Conservative diehards led by Nadine Dorries who are trying to depose him. Bercow will play a key role in trying to adapt parliament to the reality that the Liberal Democrats have joined the government, so leaving parliament with only one large formal opposition party. Under parliamentary procedure the Father of the House, Sir Peter Tapsell, will preside over the election. Bercow will be proposed by Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former foreign secretary and one of the most senior Tories in parliament. If enough MPs raise objections to Bercow's reappointment there will be a recorded vote in the division lobbies that Bercow is expected to win easily. Opposition to Bercow is led by backbencher Dorries who claims Bercow failed to uphold the Speaker's \"great tradition of authority, control and impartiality\". But Bercow has the support of both Nick Clegg and David Cameron, as well as the interim Labour leader, Harriet Harman. One source said that if 20 or 30 MPs did vote against Bercow, more than most people predict, the outcome \"will be cathartic, forcing a small parliamentary mujahideen to recognise finally that Bercow is legitimate figure\". Since becoming Speaker, Bercow has shown a willingness to reform parliament \u2013 including offering more frequent urgent questions, forcing government ministers to come to the Commons to be held to account on issues. He has privately supported the Wright committee reforms introducing elected select committee chairmen, and reducing the role of the whips in appointing other members of select committees. In common with the coalition government he is supporting the idea of an elected committee determining the bulk of non-government business. Unlike previous Speakers he has also been much more willing to make speeches on the role of parliament and its relations with the executive. He has established the Speaker's Advisory Council on Public Engagement to give advice on how to restore the trust between parliament and the public, introduced a monthly ballot for members who would like to stage charitable events in the Speaker's House, and has supported a parliamentary creche. He announced an experiment of a tracking system for MPs of written questions so that people can see which questions have and have not been answered by ministers. He is disliked by some Tory MPs for the way in which they believe he displays an anti-Tory partiality in slapping down some Tories while giving leeway to Labour MPs. Some Tory MPs object to the tweeting activities of his Labour supporting wife Sally. On the assumption that Bercow is re-elected, the three deputy speakers will be re-elected in a week."
