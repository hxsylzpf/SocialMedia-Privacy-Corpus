  "content": "People feel strongly about their genes. In particular, it seems that slightly more than half the population feels that information about their genes is private, and that if others know it, then they know too much. The overwhelming majority of people - 90%, according to the sample recently questioned by the Human Genetics Commission - feel that one should only have one's genetic information included on a database if one has given consent. And, rather significantly, only one in three people believes that insurance companies should have the right to see the results of genetic tests already taken. These figures, of course, are the result of only one survey. But they do underline the concern that many people feel over whether informa tion about their DNA is adequately protected against possible abuse. This concern is our business in the commission, and we are taking it very seriously. We intend to start a public debate in order to ensure that if people are worried about the broader implications of the genetic revolution - which they clearly are - then we can do something about it at this relatively early stage. When we sat down to produce our new consultation document, Whose Hand on your Genes? we were faced with an initial question which at first seemed very theoretical but which was eventually to show itself as relevant to a number of very immediate and practical issues. This was the question of whether there is anything particularly special about genetic information as opposed to other forms of per sonal information. As we looked more closely at this issue, it became clear that there were respects in which genetic information was different. It is, in some cases, of considerable predictive value, and so it can be considered to be information about the future rather than the present or the past. It is also information about the inmost physical essence of an individual. It is our human blueprint, and it is entirely understandable that people should feel that their blueprint is a personal matter. This conclusion has practical implications. For example, insurance companies may wish to know about your health before they extend life insurance cover. That seems reasonable enough, as insurance is a contract about risk, and if one party is going to hide information from the other, then that hardly makes for a fair bargain. We do not object to insurance companies seeing our health record or asking when and from what cause our parents died, but it appears that we are rather more sensitive about letting them see the results of a genetic test. Why should this be so, unless it is the case that we feel there is something special about DNA? I t is not only insurance companies who may be interested in finding out genetic information about individuals. The police may be interested in your DNA in order to assist with the detection of crime. There is currently a growing forensic database in the United Kingdom, and the government recently announced that it was allocating increased funds for the expansion of this database. This is, of course, a very useful tool in the detection of crime, but it requires that a lot of people have their DNA information lodged on the database. Those suspected of a crime may be asked to give a sample to allow identifying genetic information to be placed on the database. If they are convicted of a recordable offence, then they may stay on it. But how do they get off? Some countries, such as France, have rather stricter rules about this than we do, and this is an issue which we have raised in our document and which we shall be watching closely. Of course, the real benefit of genetic progress is going to come in the form of advances in the understanding and treatment of disease. This is going to require the setting up of large research databases, in which the DNA of individual volunteers is compared with their health records. This has to be done, but it will be necessary to reassure people that matters such as consent and confidentiality are very carefully addressed. Again this is an issue which we raise in our paper and which we shall be taking further. If, as our Mori poll suggests, there is a fair degree of public distrust about the security of genetic information, then we need to deal with this so that people can volunteer for this research in full confidence. The alterna tive - a situation where people were frightened to participate because they thought they would be in some way compromised or disadvantaged - is not an attractive option for the United Kingdom. We live in a world of few secrets and little privacy. What was previously quite tucked away - the inmost workings of one's very cells - is now accessible. We have to ensure that this information is controlled by the individual, and made accessible only in circumstances which he or she chooses. This is perhaps the last fence of privacy, but it is one which is worth defending. Professor Alexander McCall Smith is vice-chairman of the Human Genetics Commission. comment@theguardian.com",
