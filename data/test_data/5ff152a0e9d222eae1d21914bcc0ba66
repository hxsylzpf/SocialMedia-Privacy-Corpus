  "content": "The former legal manager at the News of the World, who ordered the surveillance of two solicitors engaged in litigation against the newspaper for phone hacking, has been cleared of professional misconduct after a disciplinary tribunal unanimously rejected all charges against him. Tom Crone, who was responsible for the tabloid's legal affairs at the height of the phone-hacking scandal, was accused of six charges of attempting to uncover an alleged affair between the solicitors to provide the paper with \"good leverage\" in legal proceedings. If proved, he could have been disbarred. After the disciplinary tribunal rejected all charges, Crone, who represented himself in the hearing, said: \"I'm very relieved. \"The way the evidence was presented against me \u2013 a very serious allegation of criminal conduct \u2013 was wholly unfair and utterly unwarranted by the evidence, which thankfully the tribunal acknowledges.\" The case brought by the Bar Standards Board was that Crone's purpose in organising surveillance of Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris in 2010 was to smear, embarrass and threaten them in order to gain an unfair advantage in legal proceedings. The surveillance found no evidence of any affair. On Monday, the judge, John Price, said that the five-person panel of the Bar Tribunals and Adjudication Service had been unanimous in their rejection of all charges against Crone. One of the key issues the panel considered in a tribunal where the standard of proof is the criminal standard of \"beyond reasonable doubt\" was Crone's intention in ordering surveillance of the lawyers. Price said: \"Our unanimous conclusion on counts one to four is we are not sure that Mr Crone's intention was to force Lewis and Harris to withdraw their claim or to settle more favourably.\" With regard to counts five and six, relating to the surveillance of the former wife and teenage daughter of Lewis, the question was whether by ordering the surveillance of Lewis, Crone had caused the surveillance of his family. Price said the panel was sure Crone had not authorised or caused the surveillance of Lewis's family. On that basis, the judge said: \"We reject charges five and six as well.\" In earlier panel hearings, Crone admitted requesting that the solicitors Lewis and Harris, then both at the Manchester firm George Davies, which is now part of Mills and Reeve, be placed under surveillance in order to uncover an alleged affair, but he denied the charge that his purpose in doing so was to pressurise them to withdraw or settle advantageously. Crone told the panel that if Lewis and Harris were having an affair it would have provided circumstantial evidence that they were passing confidential information between between each other. The intention, he said, was to gather evidence to report them to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, alleging they had breached professional standards. Crone, who no longer practises law, joined Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper division in 1985 acting for both NoW and the Sun. He resigned in July 2011, the month in which the NoW closed. He was arrested in August 2012 in connection with the Metropolitan police's investigation into hacking but in October 2014 the Crown Prosecution Service announced he would not face charges."
