  "content": "Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt, has defended his company's record on privacy in the wake of the discovery that its Street View camera cars had accidentally recorded data from unsecured domestic Wi-Fi networks, insisting that Google has the \"most consumer-centric privacy policy of any service online\". Speaking at Google's annual Zeitgeist Europe forum yesterday, Schmidt dismissed the description of the discovery as a \"crisis\" and would not say whether any member of staff had been dismissed over the issue. \"What really matters is actual harm,\" he said, repeating that the problem involved a small amount of fragmented data that was not used by the firm in any way. He was backed up by his co-founder Larry Page, who talked of concern over the much more comprehensive data on Google's logs \u2013 which include users' emails and search history. \"There is lots of interest in Google's logs, but no one can prove any harm [caused by that data], at least not that I'm aware of.\" Google has faced mounting pressure from regulatory authorities over the Street View Wi-Fi controversy, and has been ordered by the UK Information Commissioner's Office to destroy the data. Schmidt confirmed that \"changes have been made\" to Google's procedures to ensure privacy issues are discussed \"well ahead of time. It's an absolute mistake to think about this the week before a product comes out.\" Schmidt admitted Google has struggled with the question of consumer confidence in online privacy because of a much wider, generational shift in behaviour. \"We are not in any sort of denial or lack of understanding of how important this question is, and this is not just a European issue,\" he said. \"Society as a group has not decided what is appropriate and what is not appropriate in the privacy sphere, and each society and group will differ.\" Schmidt added that Google is continuing to talk to legal authorities to decide which information should be kept and what should not. \"It is clear life has changed \u2013 the internet has affected people's lives in many new ways and we don't know where this is headed,\" said Page. \"Social networking has created a ton of data that has been made public and semi-public that didn't use to be \u2026 this is a very important, very complex issue for society that is going to be debated for the next 50 years.\" Schmidt confirmed Google is discussing these \"shared issues\" around privacy with companies including Facebook \u2013 another example of what he described as \"a modern communication system that generates a fair amount of data\". He denied that Facebook presents a threat to Google, saying Microsoft \"was, is and continues to be our primary competitor\". \"People tend to think of the internet as a zero sum game, but the internet allows multiple winners who can win in different ways; Apple can win with a completely different model to Google. We think of Facebook as a growing new market of a lot of new information.\"",
