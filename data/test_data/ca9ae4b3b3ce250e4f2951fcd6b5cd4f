  "content": "At 10.30pm on 29 October 1969, Charley Kline managed to send two letters 'lo' to programmer Bill Duvall, before the system crashed. But an hour later he succeeded in sending the simple yet monumental command: 'login'. Forty-four years later it's estimated that around 2bn people use the internet with over 144bn emails and 500m 140 character messages tweeted every day.
