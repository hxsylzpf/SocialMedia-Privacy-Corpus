  "content": "Former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie has launched a social media platform to help disgruntled consumers tackle companies and organisations that mistreat them. The free aspokesmansaid.com relies on publicity to encourage firms to respond fairly and promptly \u2013 ideally within two days \u2013 to complaints. Aggrieved consumers must use their real identities via Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or by email. They are then asked to submit the name of the offending firm, insert a short headline and a summary of their complaint, also specifying their desired remedy \u2013 including refunds, compensation or apologies. Users are encouraged to upload supporting evidence in the form of pictures or YouTube video links. So far large companies like Sky, Vodafone, Opodo and Viagogo have signed up, which means they have pledged to quickly resolve issues. But consumers can complain about any company. Once approved, the case is posted on the website and publicised further via social media. A countdown clock records the company's response time and the outcome, with cases ultimately determining a \"Customer Powerscore\". But a quick check by Guardian Money found many complaints are still unanswered after two days. A spokesman said: \"We notify every firm who receives a complaint, either over email, Twitter, phone (the preferred method for smaller companies) or a combination to alert them, explain they are on the clock and to give them a fair window to respond. \"As time progresses their Powerscore continues to fall, reaching rock bottom after 30 days. Therefore, even complaints without response are of value as less responsive firms are highlighted by their low rating.\" The platform is funded personally by MacKenzie and a group of private backers, including Rupert Murdoch. MacKenzie said: \"As an editor I know the power of publicity to force companies and politicians to do the right thing. Now we are putting that power directly into the hands of the man or woman in the street. It's very simple and very effective.\"",
