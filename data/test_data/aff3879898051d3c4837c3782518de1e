  "content": "Johnston Press has reported a loss of \u00a3287m for last year, after a non-cash writedown on the value of its newspapers and printing presses, but at an operational level managed to boost profits for the first time in seven years. The regional newspaper publisher racked up the paper loss \u2013 in 2012 its pre-tax loss narrowed to just \u00a36.8m \u2013 due to factors including cutting the carrying value of its titles by \u00a3202m and its printing facilities by over \u00a360m. Stripping out these non-cash writedowns and other factors such as titles that were closed or changed from daily to weekly, Johnston Press says that it made an operating profit of \u00a354.3m \u2013 a 2.5% year on-year rise,. At a top-line level, total revenues plunged 15.6% year on year from \u00a3358.7m to \u00a3302.8m. However, Ashley Highfield, the chief executive of Johnston Press, said stripping out the impact of factors such as the closure or format changes of titles meant that at an underlying level revenue was down just 5.4% to \u00a3291.9m. Johnston Press, which has struggled to cope with the constant drain of advertising spend from newspapers to other media, reported promising progress last year. Total ad revenue fell 10% \u2013 an improvement on 2012's 12.7% \u2013 with the second half of last year narrowing to 6.2%. Print ad revenues fell 13.3% within this. Amid the declines, the company's digital strategy, practically nonexistent just a couple of years ago, is starting to pay real dividends, with 19.4% growth from \u00a320.6m to \u00a324.6m year on year. While still small, at just 7% of total revenues, Highfield pointed to the explosive growth in the digital display advertising business, which grew 30% last year and 44% in the second half. \"This business is no longer on the glide path to oblivion,\" said Highfield. \"The story is getting better and better, we are well on the way to reaching the tipping point where growth in digital revenues will outweigh the decline in print revenues.\" Highfield believes that over the next year to 18 months, the decline in print revenues can be reduced to a \"manageable level\" and that the digital revenue growth tipping point will be reached. He said that in the \"odd month\", Johnston Press's operations in the Midlands and the south have already achieved that. Highfield said digital audience growth was 50% last year, averaging 15 million monthly unique users across its titles, with a high so far of 16.8 million in January, as readers sought local information on the weather. \"There is clearly an appetite for local news and local newspaper groups can, and are, fulfilling it,\" he said. \"I'm not worried about local TV [stealing audience and ad revenue] and at the other end I'm not worried about Twitter [replacing local papers for news]. Social media is not a threat to us, it is one of our biggest traffic referrals.\" Staff numbers fell 17%, or 680 full-time equivalent positions, from 3,961 to 3,281 last year. The company cost base fell \u00a333.8m last year, from \u00a3271m to \u00a3237m, and Highfield said there was no intention of implementing a major cost-cutting plan this year. The heavily indebted publisher managed to cut \u00a319.3m from its burden, taking it to \u00a3302m, as the business continues to pave the way for refinancing talks with its banks by the end of the year. The company is also considering a potential equity fundraising. Johnston Press said that in the first two months of this year, profits were up 8%, ad revenues down 6%, and digital revenues up 23%. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
