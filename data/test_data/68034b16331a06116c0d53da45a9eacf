  "content": "As Twitter trolling continues to evolve, or devolve, there is a compelling argument for more sophisticated disciplinary measures than the good old \"block and report\". I propose something like a temporary verified tick, perhaps an icon depicting a sad face, or a nappy, which would stay on any problematic user's profile until they learned to behave. Naturally, this social media naughty step will require an omniscient Twitter supernanny to keep an eye on things and, this week, Zayn Malik's mum Tricia made an impressive application for this opening. You will remember that Zayn himself quit Twitter last year following a string of cheery bons mots dwelling on his ethnicity and religion, and accusing him of being, among other things, a terrorist. His account later reappeared and so did the abuse. One fan (or \"fan\", since she was suggesting One Direction would be better off without Malik's celebrated dance moves), so enraged Tricia Malik that she signed in to sort it out. \"Hope you're happy now Zayn noticed your tweet!\" exclaimed Tricia. \"You can't even imagine how it made him upset, you psycho. x\" She later added a classic mum putdown \u2013 \"You should be ashamed of yourself\" \u2013 before again observing that the fan in question was a psycho, then adding another kiss, a signoff that suggests that, despite her relatively short time on Twitter, Tricia is already well versed in its passive-aggressive strategy. Whether or not you are in a boyband, the moment your parents sign up to a social network is the moment you start a countdown to the inevitable point when something extremely embarrassing happens. Still, Tricia's rebukes take a slightly less hot-headed approach than those of Zayn's sister Doniya (\"Get a life sad f***! He don't even know you exist!\") and it must be impossible for any parent to sit by while their son or daughter receives public abuse. When US celebrity Chaz Bono received abuse for his appearance on Dancing with the Stars, his mum stormed in too, but with 1.5 million followers she had a stronger Twitter online following than most parents, due to being ACTUAL CHER. With the arbitrary punctuational flourishes that make Cher such an engaging social media force, she explained her actions, noting: \"Mothers don't stop Getting angry with stupid bigots who fk with their children!\" Closer to home, when someone signed up to Twitter last year under the breezy username @hateforamelia, it didn't take long for fledgling popstar Amelia Lily's no-nonsense dad Barry to wade in. The plumber gave the troll until midnight that day \"to remove the words what you have said to my daughter or three numbers with a blue light\". Naturally, the threat of a visit from the coastguard was enough to sort out this particular problem. It is pleasing to see that sometimes the roles can be reversed. Last month, Michelle Collins's daughter Maia hijacked the Coronation Street star's Twitter account to point out that comments relating to Collins's own remarks about an EastEnders actress's voluminous lips were \"actually making her quite upset\", admirably throwing herself into the path of further abuse by requesting that future tweets were directed at her own account. \"Feel free to send anything thing you want,\" she challenged. \"The ruder the more entertaining.\" Parental interactions with fans need not always be this dramatic. Consider Ed Sheeran's mum Imogen, for instance, who sells jewellery. Far be it from me to suggest Imogen is trading on her son's success \u2013 as you can see for yourself at her website, edsheeranjewellery.com, which features her own range as well as the cleverly titled \"Ed Sheeran range\", which \"reflects Ed's happy, outgoing character and love of colour and fun. Quirky designs inspired by his favourite sweets and treats are balanced by more thoughtful jewellery inspired by heartfelt, personal and often poignant lyrics which hold special meaning for many fans.\" Trinkets in the Ed Sheeran range include a \"beans on toast\" pendant, Marmite jar earrings, a Coca-Cola-inspired bracelet and numerous other bracelets styled on liquorice allsorts, which you will be pleased to hear now come on strengthened wire following some intervention from Suffolk county council public protection directorate and trading standards. One final example of the struggle facing celebrities' parents as they see their offspring libelled and abused online comes from last year and Eminem, whose publicists reacted quickly when Em's daughter Hailie appeared to post a negative tweet about Taylor Swift and Harry Styles. Their rather effective defence was that the \"Hailie\" in question was not Hailie at all, but a completely different teenage girl who, it emerged, had previously been duped into a close Twitter friendship with Paris Jackson. When she discovered that Paris was in fact an impostor, she decided that the best way of dealing with this disappointment was to invent her own fake Paris Jackson account. The ruse went south when Paris Jackson herself joined Twitter. Undeterred, this Wile E Coyote of the fake Twitter world then decided she would be Eminem's daughter, and when she ran out of genuine photos of Hailie to post through her account, she befriended someone who simply looked like Eminem's daughter and posted her Facebook pictures instead, prompting the lookalike to delete her own profile. With singleminded characters such as that at work \u2013 or more accurately, maybe, not at work \u2013 the fight against online madness may never be won, but a Twitter naughty-step system would definitely be a move in the right direction. Let's launch it with Zayn's mum and Cher. We can bring in Barry the plumber if emergency services are ever required."
