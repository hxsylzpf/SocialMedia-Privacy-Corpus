  "content": "Are you up for a Crapp? Please, I'm not being vulgar, it's the Crapps \u2013 the gongs that celebrate the extra \"special relationship\" between hacks and PRs. The shortlists for the awards' six categories were announced today, with 10 journalists up for each prize, from the writer \"most likely to tell you to sling your hook\" to the \"least twattish Twitterer \u2013 the must-follow journo\". Special mention \u2013 and not just because he sits next to me \u2013 goes to the Guardian's technology editor Charles Arthur, who is nominated in both categories. So feel free to tweet him. Just don't necessarily expect him to tweet you back if you're a PR. Other prizes up for grabs the \"journalist that makes you feel warm and furry on the inside\", the \"best blogger\" PR award, the \"journalist you would most like to bring to the dark side\" (employ as a PR) gong and \"most approachable daily national newspaper\". Nominees include Times columnist Caitlin Moran and Guardian's Ben Goldacre (for least twattish Twitterer), the Daily Mail's Sean Poulter (sling your hook!) and the Guardian's Charlie Brooker and Jemima Kiss, in the \"most like to employ as a PR\" gong. But who decides who wins? You do. You can cast your vote here, and follow the awards here, with the results due to be announced on 15 December. The brainchild of PR agency 10 Yetis, its account director Rich Leigh said: \"Since launching the awards two weeks ago, we've been overwhelmed by the response. We counted just shy of 1,000 separate Twitter mentions on the first day, and have seen a steady flow of traffic and nominations since from some very prominent media names.   \"The media calendar is already full of awards, but the difference here is recognising the often-difficult relationship between journalists and PRs whilst having a bit of fun at the same time.\" Who gets your vote?
