  "content": "It's not exactly 'new' news that the way we find, consume and collate our daily intake of the latest events around the world is changing, but in a move to make online news curation easier than ever, Pinterest has aimed to create a unique home for sharing and saving content via the introduction of 'article pins'. \"For many people, saving and reading articles is a passion,\" says Sarah Bush, the newly appointed UK country manager \u2013 Pinterest's first UK-focused hiring as the site's plans for growth outside the US develop. \"There's something for everyone on Pinterest, whatever they may be interested in - from science and travel to parenting, health, fashion, cooking, and more.\" Article pins, allowing members to create their own virtual reading room, provide additional information such as the headline, author, story description and link to the visual pin. The new function has already been embraced by a number of high-profile 'pinners' including Huffington Post co-founder, Arianna Huffington and Queen Latifah's (whose reading list we are informed includes \"articles about philanthropy, business and entertainment\".) Bush is keen to stress that Pinterest is more than just a tool to collect and share pretty pictures; \"Pins are more than just images \u2013 they're a gateway to more consumable information,\" she explains. \"We're seeing now that more and more people are using Pinterest to discover and collect great articles \u2013 currently, more than 5m articles are pinned every day and this number is continuing to grow.\" The latest feature has seen the company collaborate with a range of notable news organisations, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Le Monde, the Guardian and the Telegraph, to add a 'pin it' button on their sites so readers can instantly add content to their reading boards. Members are also able to pin articles from a range of other popular publications, such as Mashable, BuzzFeed, Wired, Esquire, GQ, Rolling Stone and Vogue Paris, which Bush insists feeds to the vast range of interests their users have. \"Currently, with other online services, news shared is valuable but legacy content goes nowhere,\" explains Bush. The 'Pin now, read later' concept is seen as a way for \"great content to stay alive, and older content to be continually rediscovered\". \"Additionally, from a media site's perspective, Pinterest is a great way for writers and publications to reach new and existing audiences,\" says Bush, speaking ahead of an event on Wednesday to officially introduce herself as the new country manager for the UK. Pinterest's hope is that the rolling out of article pins will give stories a longevity and \"visual component\" not yet seen on other social platforms."
