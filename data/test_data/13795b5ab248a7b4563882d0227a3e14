  "content": "As soon as Manchester United's official Twitter account confirmed David Moyes was sacked, Twitter was awash with reactions from fans and pundits alike. #MoyesSacked almost immediately began trending worldwide on the social network as users tweeted their 140-character reactions to Tuesday morning's news. Most were wholly unsurprised by the news given Moyes' track record since he took over the club. Ex-Manchester United player Michael Owen was among the footballers who weighed in on Moyes' departure: Robbie Savage, once a trainee at United, was short and succinct: Elsewhere in the sporting world, reactions were mixed. Some, like ex-England cricket captain Michael Vaughan, felt Moyes had been treated poorly: Everton player Shane Duffy tweeted his condolences: While others felt the manager should not shoulder all of the blame for Manchester United's poor performance of late: Of course, there were some who felt Monday's decision was justified. Non-sporting celebrities and commentators also had plenty to tweet on the matter. Fans from all over the world also took to Twitter to react to Moyes' departure, from India: To Malaysia: But spare a thought for Sarah Moyes from Scotland, otherwise known as @moyesy, who is regularly mixed up for the now ex-Manchester United manager on Twitter."
