  "content": "In hindsight, it does seem unlikely that the famously private \u2013 some would say curmudgeonly \u2013 Van Morrison would have chosen to bugle the news that he had joined Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney and Rod Stewart in becoming a father again in late middle age. Or that he would have cooed online that the child was \"the spitting image of his daddy\". Or, come to think of it, that Van the Man would have bestowed upon the helpless infant the name George Ivan Morrison III. So it was not altogether surprising to discover this afternoon that, despite a slew of features and discussions on the reproductive habits of 60-something rockers over the last few days, the reports were, as Morrison himself put it, \"completely and utterly without foundation\". The Belfast-born singer interrupted what a family friend termed a \"lovely quiet family Christmas\" to release a statement today rubbishing the widely picked-up story. No, said Morrison, he had not become a father for the fourth time; no, he had never heard of the supposed mother, Gigi Lee \u2013 whom original reports described as both his wife and US producer \u2013 and no, he had not posted any baby chat on his website. He said the hoax was the result of some mischievous hacking into the site, the second breach in three months. \"Once these claims were brought to our attention, they were taken down from the site but not before news organisations repeated these falsehoods,\" said the 64-year-old musician. \"The comments which appeared on my website did not come from me.\" He added: \"For the avoidance of all doubt and in the interests of clarity, I am very happily married to Michelle Morrison with whom I have two wonderful children.\" His friend John Saunders, a Dublin-based public relations executive, told RTE Radio that Morrison had been dismayed by the claims. \"He's never heard the name at any stage in the past. He doesn't know who this person is,\" Saunders said, adding that breaking off from the carols and mince pies to quash the reports was proof of how they had irritated the intensely private musician. \"Van is a mystery man in many ways. Of all the things that Van does do with a great deal of genius, the one thing he probably would admit himself is that he doesn't do particularly well at public relations.\""
