  "content": "Heather Mills McCartney told today of how she felt like a \"trapped animal\" when cornered by photographers in a subway. Paul McCartney's estranged wife was giving evidence in the trial of a freelance photographer, Jay Kaycappa, who is charged with assaulting her. Brighton magistrates court was told by prosecutor Dale Sullivan that Ms Mills McCartney was assaulted in a seafront subway on July 5 last year. Mr Kaycappa, 32, of Fareham, Hampshire, is alleged to have grabbed her right shoulder and turned her round in order to photograph her. Under cross-examination, Ms Mills McCartney said she wheeled her bike into the subway to escape the paparazzi, and panicked when she spotted a photographer at the tunnel's exit. \"I panicked and thought I'll go back the other way and that's when I turned round and saw Mr Kaycappa,\" she told the court. \"I felt concerned ... because I had one there, and one there, and I felt like a trapped animal - so I turned into the wall to get on my phone.\" Mr Sullivan said photographers had followed and staked out Ms Mills McCartney's home since she divorced the former Beatle. \"The Crown say one particular photographer has been particularly persistent in following her around,\" he said. Ms Mills McCartney avoided photographers by entering the court via a side entrance this morning. She wore a blue summer dress and black boots. When giving her name to the court, she said: \"My name is Heather Anne Mills McCartney, soon to be just Mills.\""
