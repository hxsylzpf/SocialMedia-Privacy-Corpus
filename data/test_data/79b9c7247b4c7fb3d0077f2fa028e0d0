  "content": "The family and friends of Aaron Swartz remain critical of MIT's role in the internet activist's prosecution following the release of a university report claiming the school maintained a neutral position during court proceedings. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Tuesday released its first public response to Swartz's prosecution. Swartz, 26, was facing 13 felony charges for hacking into the university's computer network and downloading more than 4m academic articles from the JSTOR database when he killed himself in January. The charges carried up to $1m in fines and 35 years in jail. Since Swartz's death, his family and friends have criticized the school for not intervening in what they believe to be overly aggressive prosecution by the US government and the report failed to assuage these criticisms. Swartz's partner Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman called the report a \"whitewash\" on her blog. She also disputed the report's claim that MIT took a neutral position because she said prosecutors were given total access to witnesses and evidence but Swartz's lawyers were not. \"We have an institution to contrast MIT with \u2013 JSTOR, who came out immediately and publicly against the prosecution,\" Stinebrickner-Kauffman said. \"Aaron would be alive today if MIT had acted as JSTOR did. MIT had a moral imperative to do so.\" She also criticized the school for objecting to a Freedom of Information Act request for the secret service files on Swartz's case. The school took the unusual step of intervening in the request for government documents after a judge ordered the documents to be released in July. \"If MIT is at all serious about implementing any reforms to stop this kind of tragedy from happening again, it must stop objecting to the release of information about the case.\" Robert Swartz, Swartz's father and a consultant to the MIT lab, had asked MIT to aid efforts to have the charges dropped or to get a plea deal that would not have jail time during legal proceedings and is mentioned multiple times in the report. \"The report makes clear that MIT was not neutral,\" Robert Swartz told Wired. \"But they should not have been neutral. They should have advocated of Aaron's behalf, because the law under which he was charged was wrong.\" The report concedes that the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act under which Swartz was charged is \"a poorly drafted and questionable criminal law\". \"They co-operated with prosecutors in endless ways, and they were fundamentally opaque to us,\" Robert Swartz said. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor and friend and mentor to Aaron Swartz, wrote on his blog that MIT cannot claim neutrality: \"Neutrality\" is one of those empty words that somehow has achieved sacred and context-free acceptance \u2013 like \"transparency\" \u2026 But there are obviously plenty of contexts in which to be \"neutral\" is simply to be wrong. \u2026 For example, this context: the point the report makes in criticizing the prosecutors is that they were at a minimum negligent in not recognizing that under MIT's open access policies, Aaron's access was likely not \"unauthorized.\" \"MIT knew something here that at a minimum could have cut short a prosecution, and which, it turns out, could also have saved someone's life,\" Lessig said. \"'Neutrality' does not justify failing to pick up the phone, and telling the prosecutor: 'Hey, in fact, his access was authorized.'\" Quinn Norton, who dated Swartz for three years, said on Twitter: \"I will never work with MIT, I will never attend events at MIT, I will never support MIT's work, and I hope dearly that my MIT friends leave.\" The MIT report was produced by computer science professor Hal Abelson, who was asked by school president L Rafael Reif to lead a review of the school's involvement in Swartz's prosecution. Abelson led a group that reviewed 10,000 documents and conducted interviews with 50 people to assess the school's involvement in the case. \"Only Swartz knows why he committed suicide,\" the report said. \"However, for the final 24 months of his life, he was the subject of a vigorous investigation and prosecution by the US Department of Justice, with an indictment and then a superseding indictment that could have resulted in years in prison.\""
