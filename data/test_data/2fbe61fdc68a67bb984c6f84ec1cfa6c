  "content": "Prince Charles will \"definitely not\" appear on television to refute lurid allegations being made about him, and never had any intention to, according to his aides. The prince, who flew back yesterday from Oman, is facing one of his biggest crises for years, and is today meeting advisers to consider his next step. He is also considering taking legal action - although experts say this would be a high risk strategy because it could involve a punishing and unprecedented appearance in court. But this morning a spokeswoman for Prince Charles emphatically ruled out the move, saying: \"He is not going to give any TV interviews. We don't know where this idea came from, it was not our intention for him to do a TV interview. It's definitely not happening.\" She added that the prince would not be going beyond the statement issued by Clarence House last Thursday night, in which the allegations being made by a former royal servant were denounced as \"totally untrue\" and \"risible\". \"The statement we gave on Thursday is how it stands at the moment,\" said the spokeswoman. The statement by Prince Charles's private secretary, Sir Michael Peat, is viewed by many as a disastrous public relations move, having added fuel to the fire instead of damping it down. It was approved by Prince Charles but effectively meant he had \"outed\" himself as the member of the royal family at the centre of the rumours. In a particularly gauche move, the statement also managed to wipe the Soham murder trial of Ian Huntley off the top of the evening news bulletins. And despite the vehement dismissals, the story continues to escalate - a Scottish and Irish newspaper reported details of the rumours over the weekend - and today the \"royal crisis\" remains on the front page of every tabloid and three of the four broadsheets. Mark Bolland, the prince's former PR adviser, has criticised the palace's handling of the crisis as \"bizarre\" and said that during his eight-year tenure the palace had faced down a constrant stream of outlandish rumours but chose to laugh them off. Mr Bolland said the rumours were \"rubbish\" and should have been treated as such by Clarence House. \"But instead of laughing them off - which is what I always did with this story, and countless others an an even more exotic variety, when I worked for the prince - the palace reacted in a bizarre way that made them headline news all over the world.\" He described the move as \"an unrivalled public relations disaster\". However, Clarence House has hinted that Mr Bolland may have breached his confidentiality contract after he revealed that Sir Michael asked him whether Prince Charles was bisexual, which he replied was \"emphatically not the case\". But Mr Bolland denied adding to the speculation surrounding the allegations, telling the Guardian: \"The palace started that when they put the prince's name into the public domain. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857",
