  "content": "Entertainment was decidedly drab when Hello! magazine appeared on newsstands 25 years ago this week. All we had was Lovejoy on Sunday night, just four TV channels and This Is Your Life as our only peek behind the celebrity curtain. Step forward this glossy magazine, which this week proudly crowed that it \"created the brand new celebrity sector of weekly publishing \u2026 \" It's true, in the sense its launch was followed by more than 10 similar launches, spawning a multimillion-pound industry. But this wave of titles also ushered in the era of celebrity culture, absorbing our attention and transforming our values. It's a double-edged legacy. Hello!'s arrival could hardly have been better timed. Generation X were entering the workforce of a booming economy. A magazine promising an intimate look at famous lives was seductive when we aspired to wealthier, more self-centric Thatcher-era lives. It's no coincidence that traditional women's magazines, focused on family and home, began to lose readers at this time. Even as teens we were being primed to care more about celebrities. We were the first MTV generation, where image overtook content and for stars such as Michael Jackson every video release was a global event. We were also getting increasingly comfortable discussing anything from divorce to abuse to depression. When celebrities confessed, it gave us a way to discuss issues without exposing ourselves. They were becoming our filter on life experience. Celebrities were compelled to share as much as they dared \u2013 and the most narcissistic among them revelled in that \u2013 look no further than 1991's In Bed with Madonna documentary. Stars worked with magazines to create packaged \"angles\" that boosted their fan base. And there was no gloss like celebrity gloss. The 1993 launch of OK! even gave mainstream respectability to Richard Desmond, distancing him from his pornography empire. He threw millions at the magazine. And when Victoria and David Beckham spent their 1999 wedding night with Desmond at their side, selecting images for OK!'s special wedding edition, it sent a clear message: image first, love later. By 1997, Now soon overtook Hello!, followed by Heat in 1999, then Closer in 2002. Each magazine was bigger than the last. But more magazines meant they needed more celebrities. Within a year came Big Brother, reality TV delivering a high volume of instant stars. I was working on Cosmopolitan magazine at the time, fielding daily calls from ex-reality contestants swearing they'd do anything to be in the magazine. There was no shame in pursuing fame now, talent was not required. The lid was off the box. I soon joined the celebrity weeklies \u2013 by the noughties they were the only sector with climbing circulations. Thousands of pounds changed hands for a set of pap pictures \u2013 often created in collusion with a celebrity \u2013 to create breaking news for readers. The same went for body battles. Whenever someone gained or lost weight on a magazine cover, sales would soar. Katie Price/Jordan became the ultimate embodiment of reality TV's famous people without a product, with no qualms about selling every twist of her life. Was the public addicted? Absolutely. When I edited Now, she was guaranteed to deliver sales \u2013 and she savvily built her fortune by making the most of that. Once she dominated the market, even the previously classy Hello! signed her up exclusively. But what started with celebrity magazines has been overtaken by social media. After Twitter's launch in 2006, stars began to take back the extraordinary control these weeklies once held \u2013 in just 140 characters. While initially we may have believed only Ashton Kutcher could drum up more than a million followers (which took him weeks), now we think nothing of Justin Bieber having more than 30 million. Followers now have a sense of direct connection to those who entertain them. But often it's still a facade, a team effort to tweet to fans all day long, just like it used to be a team effort to style OK! stars for their photo shoots. The appetite for celebrity-filtered news shows no sign of dropping off \u2013 as even this week's staggering coverage of Angelina Jolie's double mastectomy proves. Calling for that to change would be like calling for the end of the internet. But it's in our interest to remember there's a difference between entertainment and our internal lives, especially for the most impressionable among us. When I see 12-year-olds with iPhones, clinging to every tweet from their favourite stars, I want them to know that style over content is still a superficial focus. It can be entertaining and there'll always be room for that in life. But a healthy emotional state has to be about more than the facade, more than how many followers we have or \"likes\" we generate. Had the celebrity era not coincided with the fastest information age we've ever lived in, then maybe there'd be nothing to worry about. But the signs are already there that today's teens are heavily influenced by the characteristics those early Hello! cover stars had in spades: the need for external validation, from people they may not even know. The double-edged situation that began with Hello! will only keep morphing. But while we can recognise our celebrity obsession now drives the stories we read and the issues we care about, we also need to flag up to the most impressionable in our society that caring about who they are on the inside matters too."
