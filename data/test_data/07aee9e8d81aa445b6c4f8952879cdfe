  "content": "James Harding, the BBC's director of news and current affairs, is to give the keynote speech at the Association for Journalism Education's summer conference later this month. He will address the AJE delegates at Greenwich university on the afternoon of Thursday 25 June during a conference that will explore the future of journalism education against the background of continuing changes to the newspaper industry. Among the other speakers that day will be Mick Temple - on the repercussions for journalism educators of a dying British local press - Jackie Gregory, Sarah Jones, Butler Cain, Jude Nwakpoke Ogbodo and Sharon Maxwell Magnus The following day, the speakers include Michael Bromley of City University London, Francois Pierre Nel, Ruth Callaghan, Eamon O'Neill and Tor Clark. I forecast some controversy over the talk by Liz Hannaford of Manchester Metropolitan university. It's entitled: \"Should journalism students ditch shorthand and learn to code instead?\" To register for the conference, go here to Eventbrite. Tickets cost \u00a330 and payable at the door."
