  "content": "Kanye West is atwitter about Twitter \u2013 but not in a happy way. The rapper has posted a rant against the micro-blogging website, lashing out at impersonators and the \"irresponsible\" staff who allow them to continue. \"I DON'T HAVE A FUCKING TWITTER!\" Kanye shrieked, posting (naturally) on his blog. Though thousands of Twitter users had followed the postings of \"kanyewest\", the real Kanye West insisted that the account had nothing to do with him. \"Why would I use Twitter?\" he asked, albeit in attention-grabbing capital letters. \"I only blog five percent of what I'm up to in the first place. I'm actually slow delivering content because I'm too busy, actually busy being creative, most of the time \u2013 and if I'm not and I'm just laying on a beach I wouldn't tell the world.\" After all, Kanye West is too busy macro-blogging about music, design, cars and pretty women to have time for micro-blogging about, say, music, design, cars and pretty women. \"Everything that Twitter offers, I need less of,\" he wrote. \"The people at Twitter know I don't have a fucking Twitter [account] so for them to allow someone to pose as me and accumulate over a million [followers] is irresponsible and deceitful to their faithful users.\" It's Twitter's staff, and not Kanye's tricksy hoaxers, who attracted most of the rapper's fury. \"It's a fucking farce,\" he raged. \"Hey Twitter \u2013 take the so-called Kanye West Twitter [account] down now. Why? BECAUSE MY CAPS LOCK KEY IS LOUD!\" Indeed, Kanye's caps lock key \u2013 as well as the blogpost's nine concluding exclamation marks \u2013 seem to have worked. The principal \"fake\" account, kanyewest, has now been suspended. Unfortunately, at least two more fraudulent accounts \u2013 including MrKanyeWest, which is just a front for selling ringtones \u2013 remain online. Maybe it's time for even more exclamation points."
