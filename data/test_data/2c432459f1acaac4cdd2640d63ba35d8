  "content": "We now have the government's new proposals for a DNA retention regime which, it says, complies with the European court's December judgment in S and Marper v UK. We should welcome the proposal to destroy the actual bodily samples taken from anyone, convicted or not, once the numerical profile has been extracted and uploaded onto the database. It is right that samples taken from volunteers for elimination purposes should not be uploaded onto the database and should be destroyed. And it is true that the proposals provide for a more nuanced scheme of retention \u2013 not difficult since the previous system was as far from nuanced as it is possible to be. That said, the new regime still fails miserably to strike a reasonable balance between the need to detect crime and the need to respect the privacy rights of those who have done nothing wrong. In the words of the European court: \"Weighty reasons would have to be put forward by the government before the court could regard as justified such a difference in treatment of the applicants' private data compared to that of other unconvicted people.\" The new proposals maintain a major distinction between the \"genuinely innocent\", such as volunteers, whose profiles will not be uploaded at all, and those forced to give their DNA on arrest, whose profiles will be retained for at least six years, or 12 if they are accused (but not convicted) of a serious sexual, violent or terrorist offence. So what are the \"weighty reasons\" put forward to justify this new retention policy and the six and 12-year periods? I am frankly astonished to find, at Annex C to the consultation paper, a rather embarrassed-sounding Ken Pease of the Jill Dando Institute attempting to justify these new retention periods on the basis of a minuscule sample of some 500 people taken from the Metropolitan Police Area over three separate days (one of which he says might be a bank holiday and therefore a bit skewed). Apparently, we can deduce from this sample that those arrested but not convicted are actually slightly more likely to commit crime in the future than those who are convicted but given a non-custodial sentence. This, says Pease, means we can apply all the research that already exists about recidivism rates in criminals, and bingo, those arrested are actually just as guilty as those convicted after all. With marvellous figures like these, one wonders why we bother with a criminal justice system in the first place. Pease has the honesty to admit that his research is unfinished, but if we waited for it, it would delay publication of the consultation paper. He admits that his analysis includes those subsequently arrested but again not convicted, that no analysis has been possible of how ethnicity impacts on the figures, or of the relationship between the seriousness of the initial offence and any subsequent offences. The European court was at pains to say that retention of numerical profiles (even without the bodily samples) engages the right to respect for private life, so retention of profiles must be justified as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. It simply beggars belief that the government has the chutzpah to attempt to justify the intrusion into privacy rights with such a patently inconclusive and misleading piece of \"research\", and really the Home Office ought to be ashamed.",
