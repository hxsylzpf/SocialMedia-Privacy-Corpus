  "content": "How important is it for companies to engage with social media in their marketing effort? \"Long term, it is survival\", says Simon Nicolson, Social Media Manager at Honda. \"You need to stay relevant with consumers. Traditional ways of communicating are going to erode in their effectiveness. Brands are either going to do this, or fall by the wayside.\" Strong words; but the journey made by today's customer or potential customer before making a purchase or other commitment is increasingly an online journey. Social media matters, not only to commercial businesses, but also to the public sector with talk of the \"connected citizen\", and to any organisation for which marketing is important. The pace of change has been quick, and recognising the vital role of social media engagement is only the beginning. How do you interact successfully with a medium that by its nature lacks cohesion and control? What level of resource is appropriate, and how can you measure the effectiveness of a social media campaign? Another key area is the emergence of tools and resources that help with listening and analysing online conversations about your business. This new content hub will investigate and inform how social media can support your business goals."
