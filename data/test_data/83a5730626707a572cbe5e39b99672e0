  "content": "San Francisco's technology scene has long been regarded as the centre of the free economy, where offering a service at no charge can, one day, lead to a business worth billions. Take Twitter, which allows users to broadcast SMS-length messages on the internet to a self-selecting group of followers. Biz Stone was one of the co-founders of Twitter in 2006, along with Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey. His new book, Things A Little Bird Told Me, starts with what he learnt before then, while creating Blogger in 1999; it was bought by Google in 2003 and Stone was made very wealthy when Google floated in 2004. The obvious first question is whether his book is a response to Hatching Twitter, the history of the company written by the New York Times journalist Nick Bilton. Based on extensive interviews, it recounts in unflinching detail the creation, jockeying for position and boardroom inveigling that the messaging service has gone through. \"We were writing at the same time, so I didn't know what he was going to write when I was writing,\" Stone says. \"He didn't want to share it ahead of publishing. All I could do was write my own experience.\" He adds that he hasn't read it in detail \u2013 though one gets the impression that he has looked at it in more detail than he describes. Stone adds: \"There's a lot... my experience is my experience. I didn't do research, I based it on my life. I didn't go researching board members about meetings I wasn't in.\" One particular strand of Hatching Twitter is how Jack Dorsey, the first CEO who was eased upstairs in October 2008 to be chairman, and replaced as CEO by Williams, appears in the book to be akin to a Bond villain, planning a Machiavellian return to the company that threw him out. He eventually became executive chairman in March 2011, and Williams was replaced by Dick Costolo, who remains in place. Stone, the peacemaker So is Stone's book a rebuttal? \"This isn't an attempt to refute anything \u2013 if you read both then I confirm certain things as true. What you might take away is that in my version of reality Jack Dorsey is an incredibly generous and empathic and helpful and wonderful friend of mine. Not some classic Machiavellian-Mr-Burns-Count-of-Monte-Cristo plotting revenge in a cave. That's drama whipped up to make a page-turner.\" Then he effectively denies reading it: \"I only skimmed the section about me to make sure I'm not portrayed as a fool. My wife says it makes Jack seem very Machiavellian. My version is, what I experienced was, that every single person who had stock in Twitter all had the best of intentions. Whether 'the best' and 'aligned with each other' could be questioned, I guess. But everybody thought that they were doing the right thing. Nobody was trying to do harm. It was, 'If this thing benefits me, it benefits us all.' Though there were people who came late to try to get as much wealth as they could...\" His voice drifts off and he lets the comment \u2013 which sounds as close as he'll get to an accusation \u2013 hang. Stone's depiction of himself in his book tallies well with Bilton's: self-deprecating, a peacemaker, but also someone who gets things done. As he says in the introduction, it's about \"making something out of nothing, about merging your abilities with your ambitions, and about what you learn when you look at the world through a lens of infinite possibility\". Four degrees of separation And Stone is very good at that. The idea behind his his latest startup, Jelly, is that you pose a question which is then sent out over your social network (on Facebook or Twitter) where, you hope, someone will know the answer. But people on those networks can pass the question on to people on their networks, which suddenly multiplies the number of people who might see your question enormously. In effect, it's using the idea of the \"six degrees of separation\" \u2013 that everyone is just six acquaintances from everyone else on the planet \u2013 to try to find the person with specialist knowledge. \"Now is the perfect time for Jelly,\" enthuses Stone. \"It's based on the premise that you will network, via social and mobile.\" The core idea is very like Aardvark, a \"social search engine\" which Google bought for $50m in February 2010 but shut down in September 2011, but \"nobody had mobile\" then, says Stone. \"People now are hyperlinked by mobile phones,\" he says. \"And now, the six degrees of separation, because of our social networks, is less than four \u2013 there are new scientific papers which show that the average connection is just 3.8 people now.\" That research comes from a team at Facebook, though it hasn't had formal scientific confirmation yet. \"Most people have a modest network on Facebook or Twitter. Jelly combines them into one network and routes questions to a certain percentage of people and to people nearby, via location\u2026 You can go from a few followers on Facebook or Twitter, and route your question to almost anybody on the planet.\" It could be something as simple as finding someone in the park where you're sunbathing who has some suncream; or solving a complex equation. In future he hopes to include gigantic mobile messaging networks, including Chinese ones such as QQ or Line. Startup game has changed But having two big successes behind him is no guarantee of success this time round, and Stone has discovered first-hand how much the startup game has changed since he last did it eight years ago. \"There are so many companies starting out on a shoestring now. I get the impression that kids today don't want to be massive stars, they want to be entrepreneurs. When we launched Jelly, we had twice as many accounts created in the first 24 hours as we did in the first year of Twitter. That's because of social networks. This sounds negative, but \u2014 new apps can blow up like a tick on a dog. You can go to 100 million users in days. It's an amazing new world.\" But, he notes, you have to keep giving people value. He picks out Snapchat \u2013 the temporary picture app\u2013 as important: \"They're changing the way people communicate, and making it useful. You're sending pictures about what's up, rather than a text\u2026 it's joyful, people laugh about it. The ephemerality [because the pictures vanish after a few seconds] is interesting, but pictures are interesting too \u2013 it makes it not about language.\" He contrasts that with games, expressing reverence for play more broadly. \"But when your measurement for success is people staring at a screen for eight hours a day, versus having people coming to the app 60 times a day for 15 seconds because it helps with their day \u2013 there's a metric I prefer.\" He's reserving judgment on Secret and Whisper, the two apps that allow people to leak secrets anonymously to a broad social network. \"I'm not sure how I feel about anonymity and not having to take responsibility for your actions.\" The joys of volunteering Stone and his wife Livia, a writer and artist, have already set up a foundation to support charitable environmental and animal welfare work. The multimillionaire does volunteer work himself, and says that volunteering, even for two days, is a way that young people can get experience and have something to share in job interviews. \"It's an interesting thing to tell a prospective employer, and you also are networking with people with jobs. You see,\" his voice kicks up a notch in enthusiasm, \"it's more for you than the people you are helping. You have to think about what you're gaining, rather than whether you're giving something up.\" Much of the discussion in San Francisco recently is about tensions between wealthy young tech entrepreneurs and developers pushing up housing prices, while native San Franciscans are being forced out of the area. Twitter has taken some heat for this, creating 1,600 millionaires since its IPO in November 2013, adding to the perception of a pampered tech elite detached from the soul of the city. The fact that a lot of the would-be entrepreneurs face the same problem \u2013 renting is hard, purchasing impossible \u2013 hasn't stopped resentment bubbling over, with attacks on the private buses operated by Google and Yahoo, and owners of Google's Glass device \u2013 a head-worn camera and video screen \u2013 are too scared to wear them in some bars for fear of assault. Stone says: \"It seems that in boom times, it should be good times with a lot of jobs being created and wealth being created, right? It baffles me that it isn't good. What's the alternative, a ghost town? So how can we turn this boomtown into a boomtown for all?\" He has begun talking to technology leaders and non-profit organisations to try to understand the situation, but is also politically averse. \"The divisions between people are getting worse and worse, though. It seems that lot of arcane city regulations need to be changed but can't be changed overnight.\" The challenge is complex in an industry where immense wealth can be generated by so few people. WhatsApp, bought for $3bn in cash and $16bn in Facebook stock, employs 55 people. In contrast, the giant Detroit car factories of the 1950s employed more than 100,000 people and created billions of dollars of value every year. \"But the technology is being built now by people all over the world,\" says Stone. \"People in China are building these phones in giant factories \u2013 we don't have factories in San Francisco building them\u2026 people don't want to do that, either. It's a different sort of industrial revolution. Enormous wealth can get generated by very few people and then doesn't get spread around. \"The problem is it's not in any one person's basket. It's a bit like climate change \u2013 no one person did it, and it's a whole that's greater than the sum of its parts. It has massive effects on the whole world, though. That's a negative effect.\" Typically, he looks for a path to an upside. \"You can harness the same effect for positive ends. So it seems to me that it's a solvable puzzle. The pieces are there.\" \u2022 Hatching Twitter by Nick Bilton \u2013 review"
