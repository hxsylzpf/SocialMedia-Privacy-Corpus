  "content": "The Sun and the Daily Star face being banned from the England camp just days before the Euro 2004 championships in Portugal kick off after defying a Football Association ban on using pictures of David Beckham in his underpants. The FA last night warned newspaper editors and sports reporters in Lisbon ahead of England's opening match with France on Sunday that it considered the pictures \"an unjustifiable intrusion into his private life\". But both tabloids today went ahead and published the pictures of the England captain on his balcony wearing nothing but a pair of sunglasses and white pants, the contents of which he is busily rearranging. The Sun features the picture on its front page alongside the headline \"Hold 'em balls\" while the Star also has the shot on its front page, as well as devoting a double-page spread inside to more pictures. The FA also complained to the Newspaper Publishers Association, which circulated a note last night warning of the implications of using the pictures, thought to have been taken by a Portuguese paparazzo. FA insiders said last night they would complain to the Press Complaints Commission if the pictures were used and may also consider legal action. In its warning to editors, the NPA said the FA communications director, Colin Gibson, had warned of \"the withdrawal of opportunities\" for titles that published the pictures. The use of the pictures is likely to break the already fragile truce between Beckham and certain sections of the press after he hit out last month at the Daily Mail and the News of the World over their coverage of his alleged affair with Rebecca Loos earlier this year. The England team's hotel in Lisbon is already surrounded by heavy security in an attempt to restrict photographers and reporters to official photo calls and press conferences. The FA had arranged for a limited number of photographers to have access to the hotel in order to take a series of lifestyle shots but will now reconsider that decision. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
