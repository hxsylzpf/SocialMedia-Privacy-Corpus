  "content": "The Reverend Dr Judy Cummings likes to say she speaks for the underclass \u2013 for the African Americans locked in poverty in Buena Vista, a neighbourhood cut off from the rest of this prospering city by a ribbon of freeways, industrial blight and neglect. It's for them Cummings has become one of the leading voices of opposition to Amendment 1, a ballot initiative that would overturn Tennessee's powerful protections for abortion rights, enshrined since a 2000 court decision. The proposal's passage would hurt not just poor women and their children in Nashville, she believes. It also would affect thousands of women living beyond Tennessee's borders who have come to rely on abortion providers in Nashville for services they can't get in their home states. \"This issue right here is not about whether we believe in abortion or not,\" Cummings said at a rally of liberal ministers earlier this month. \"It's a justice issue. When politicians try to take away the voice of the people, that's an injustice. And we're called on to do justice.\" Tennessee has served as a bulwark for women's right to access and as a haven for women who have lost reproductive freedoms in nearby states. Alone among states in the south, Tennessee does not require women to receive pre-abortion \"counselling\" designed to discourage them from going through with the procedure. The state also lacks a waiting period, which forces women to travel to a clinic twice for a procedure. Tennessee has not required private insurers to sell abortion coverage separately, and conservative lawmakers have shied away from any kind of ultrasound requirement. As a result, more than 20% of the abortions performed in the state were for women who lived outside Tennessee, health records show. But that will end if voters agree next week to remove abortion rights from the Tennessee constitution \u2013 a move that would let Republican legislators here enact restrictions as draconian as those passed in states such as Mississippi and Texas, two states where conservative lawmakers have passed stringent requirements tailored to shutter the few abortion clinics still available to women. 'The last lifeboat' If passed, Amendment 1 would overturn a landmark 2000 ruling by Tennessee's highest court, which said the state's constitutional guarantees of privacy extend to abortion services. That determination awarded women in Tennessee even greater protections than Roe v Wade and struck down a mandatory two-day waiting period in the state. Since then, the ruling has held at bay ideas like compulsory ultrasounds and limits on insurance coverage, both of which have passed in nearby Mississippi and Virginia. Conservatives have spent the past 14 years working to overturn that ruling. But because victory for the amendment would cut services for women not just in Tennessee but in the eight states that border it, abortion rights supporters are staking a fierce defence. Supporters of the \"Vote No on 1\" campaign have carefully calibrated their message to appeal to Tennesseans' religious zeal and fear of government overreach. They also have poured more than $1.5m into the effort to defeat the amendment, twice what pro-life groups have raised. Hundreds of volunteers have called tens of thousands of households, while four separate television ads are playing in the state's major media markets, all urging Tennesseans to vote \"No\". Recent polling shows the amendment is likely to pass. The fight over Amendment 1 may be the most important electoral battle over abortion this year, even more critical than \"personhood\" question on the ballots in Colorado and North Dakota and on par with the legal cases winding through the courts. Understanding why begins with Tennessee's geography. Stretching 500 miles, a distance farther than New York City to Detroit, the state links the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River, the midwest to the deep south. Because of that location \u2013 and because anti-abortion forces have succeeded in so many of its neighbours \u2013 Tennessee's abortion providers serve a clientele far beyond its borders. More than one in five of the 14,216 abortions performed in the state last year were obtained by women who lived outside Tennessee, according to health records. If Tennesseans approve the amendment, women in Kentucky \u2013 where women must wait at least 24 hours and sit through a \"counselling\" session before receiving an abortion in either of the state's two clinics \u2013 will no longer have the option to travel to Nashville or Knoxville for services. Likewise, women in Mississippi, where abortion services have been all but eliminated, will find it much harder to rely on providers in Memphis. \"You can think of Tennessee as being sort of the last lifeboat,\" said Tracey George, a law professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville who specialises in social issues. Opponents of abortion have seized on that role to paint Tennessee as an abortion \"destination\". They say Tennessee, as a matter of public safety, needs to align its laws with those of its neighbours. \"[Amendment 1] simply restores to the people the ability to decide what our public policy should be, and hopefully that's going to bring us back in line with our eight surrounding states, which have much stronger protections for women and girls who are considering an abortion,\" said Brian Harris, the president of Tennessee Right to Life and a coordinator of the Yes on 1 campaign. \"Why should we be thrust into a position where we are not allowed to enact \u2013 or debate, even \u2013 passage of these protective policies?\" But Tennessee has been able to debate and enact restrictions on abortion providers since 2000. Just two years ago, the Republican-led legislature passed a law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges in a nearby hospital \u2013 a requirement that abortion foes say ensures a woman's safety if an abortion were to end in complications. In addition, clinics that provide surgical abortions, rather than those in which medication is used to induce termination, must be licensed by the state, just as they are in its neighbours. Abortion providers have not fought such requirements, even though they have shut down two of the nine clinics that were in operation in Tennessee three years ago. Pro-choice and privacy Amendment 1 would open the door to imposing still more requirements on providers \u2013 and to placing burdensome ones on women as well. \"This amendment will give politicians the green light to push for more and more restrictions,\" said Jennifer Dalven, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's reproductive freedom project. Conveying that message to Tennesseans has been a delicate task. While commentators in other parts of the country tend to place access to abortion among other women's rights or even argue it's a social good, Vote No on 1 campaigners more often attack the amendment on libertarian, pragmatic or even theological grounds. Ministers such as Cummings argue the amendment will interfere with their ability to counsel congregants who have gone through abortions. Were abortion illegal, they argue \u2013 with repurposed pro-life claims that developing foetuses are able to suffer pain \u2013then those foetuses with birth defects would needlessly suffer in utero were abortion illegal. Some opponents even focus their arguments on protecting the rights of men. \"Women do not get pregnant by themselves,\" the Rev Calvin Barlow said at a 14 October gathering of clergy who oppose the amendment. \"Legislation that denies women their reproductive rights simultaneously denies men their reproductive rights.\" Canvassers also argue the wording of the proposed amendment is \"dangerous and misleading\". They argue that the wording implies abortion rights would be protected in instances of rape and incest and to save the life of the mother. But, in actuality, those protections would be in place only if Tennessee's legislators enact yet more new laws. Getting voters to understand those nuances could be the difference in the campaign. A recent poll by the conservative Family Research Council found that 50% of Tennesseans were prepared to vote for the amendment, with only 22% opposed. But a survey taken by Vanderbilt University, in which pollsters spelled out to voters that they would be giving lawmakers control over access to abortion, placed public support for the amendment at only 23%. Cummings, the Buena Vista minister, thinks it improbable that the religious conservatives and Republicans who control the legislature would exercise that power responsibly. She notes that they have had several years to help women and children by attacking Tennessee's high infant mortality rate, lowering its equally high teen birth rate, or offering Medicaid to the 175,000 poor Tennesseans who could have their coverage paid through Obamacare. Instead, she says, lawmakers have turned to this: stamping out the south's remaining preserve of abortion rights. \"The very children who are born,\" she said glumly, \"these same politicians are not willing to help support those children \u2026 This is an issue of justice.\""
