  "content": "A paparazzo is being held at Brighton police station this afternoon after an incident involving the alleged harassment of Heather Mills McCartney. Brighton police confirmed that a photographer, who has given his name as Jay Cappa, is being held at the station. The officer on duty said Cappa would be interviewed about \"an incident\" but refused to confirm that it was relation to Mills McCartney. Mills McCartney's television agent confirmed that the wife of Sir Paul McCartney, from whom she recently split, had complained of being harassed by Cappa for the past four weeks. The agent said that Mills McCartney had been expecting police to arrest the freelance photographer today. Sources suggest that Cappa may have been working for the News of the World, but the paper is adamant he was not. A News of the World spokeswoman said: \"The photographer was not representing this newspaper in any capacity at all.\" Mills McCartney has been the focus of much tabloid attention since the recent collapse of her marriage to the former Beatle. She is to take legal action against the News of the World over lurid allegations about her past, which her lawyers called \"vicious and untrue\". A statement issued by her lawyers said Mills McCartney would commence legal proceedings against the Sunday paper and the individuals behind the allegations once her divorce from Sir Paul was finalised. Her lawyers \"vehemently denied\" the \"highly defamatory\" stories alleging she was a highly paid prostitute when she was in her 20s, and said the claims in the News of the World were \"untrue and highly defamatory\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
