  "content": "Do you know who's looking at your credit report \u2013 and are they entitled to be nosing around in your affairs? A businessman is calling for an investigation after discovering that some of the other parties in a commercial dispute he was embroiled in, had managed to get access to information about him from two of Britain's credit reference agencies. A large law firm and a team of private investigators acquired information about Bev Oates from the files of Callcredit and Equifax, even though he had not given his permission. The law firm and the investigators had been hired by other people involved in the dispute, and were delving into Oates's background. The credit reference agencies store data on the financial activities of millions of Britons, and say they have strict controls to prevent improper searches of their databases by their clients \u2013 but admit they are unable to verify at the time that each search has been carried out legitimately. Oates is calling for an in-depth probe as he believes what has happened to him is not unique. In January this year, Guardian Money featured the case of Gary Gadston, who had discovered that, unbeknown to him, private detectives had accessed his credit report to get the lowdown on his finances. Gadston had been immersed in a legal row with NatWest, and was shocked to see on his Experian credit report that a firm of private investigators had carried out a search of his file on behalf of Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest's parent group. Oates discovered that law firm Weightmans and Manchester-based investigators BTG, who had been hired by separate parties in the property dispute, acquired information about him from the credit reference agencies. Equifax, Experian and Callcredit gather data from a number of sources to compile detailed financial files on members of the public. They make money by charging companies to search these files when people apply for loans, credit cards, mortgages and so on. These searches are often done online so they can be completed quickly, and are sometimes carried out by investigators and lawyers on behalf of the client companies. Crucially, the agencies say that none of their clients can search their databases for information about an individual unless that person gives their permission on each occasion. Individuals are typically deemed to have given their consent for such searches when they apply for products from banks and other firms. Callcredit says Weightmans obtained \"very high-level information, most of which is also available from other publicly available sources\". However, it adds that none of the information was \"highly-sensitive financial\" data. Weightmans says: \"Any information obtained by Weightmans LLP was in the public domain and Mr Oates has not suffered any loss as a result.\" However, Oates had previously complained to Weightmans, which accepted in a letter to him that \"you were not a client of this firm and that you did not give Weightmans permission to access your credit reference file\" held by Callcredit. Weightmans also wrote that it was \"acting in the best interests of our clients in accessing your credit file\", as they wanted to establish if he had enough money to pay their clients' legal costs if he lost the dispute. It has emerged that BTG \u2013 the private investigators hired by Oates's opponents in the dispute \u2013 conducted four searches of the Equifax database for information about him. According to Equifax's records, three of these searches were done to trace Oates, and the other one for \"debt collection\". Equifax says BTG has had \"direct access to our systems\". Oates had not given BTG permission for these searches. BTG says it was permitted to conduct the searches under a legal exemption that did not require it to obtain his permission, as the matter related to legal proceedings. Intriguingly, however, Equifax says BTG did not cite this exemption when it carried out the searches. Equifax says the private investigators made an error as they had indicated they did have his consent when they conducted the searches. Equifax and BTG say the investigators only obtained information about Oates that was publicly available. They say this related to the register of voters, court judgments and his current and previous addresses. BTG, part of insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor, says: \"Mr Oates's credit information was never accessed by BTG. BTG did not, and does not, have the ability to access an individual's full credit report through Equifax.\" Oates only found out about the searches after applying to see the files held on him by the credit reference agencies. However, he believes that relatively few members of the public check their files, and so other intrusions are going undetected. \"These databases hold more personal, confidential, financial data and other information about the lives of the UK's adult population than any other databases outside of government,\" he adds. Callcredit told us: \"As a responsible credit reference agency, we are fully committed to upholding the security of the data with which we are entrusted.\" It also says it does not require clients to confirm they are acting in line with the rules every time they conduct a search. Instead their clients confirmed they would follow the rules when they signed a contract with the agency. Equifax, meanwhile, says the need to give its customers swift access to its database and the volume of searches conducted would make it impossible to check every inquiry. The agency adds that its clients are required to sign a contract stipulating that they \"should ensure searches are carried out in accordance with our terms and conditions and the Data Protection Act\". It added that it did \"regular spot checks on the information accessed by its customers\" and \"takes the security of its data and how it can be accessed very seriously\". Equifax says it has \"taken action against customers that have not adhered to the rules of data access and supply. It cannot confirm exact numbers because this is commercially sensitive information\"."
