  "content": "A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team If TaskRabbit is the future of employment, the employed are fucked &gt;&gt;&gt; Valleywag As of two weeks ago, the company no longer uses the bidding system. Each Rabbit is pegged at an hourly rate, accessible only via smartphone, and expected to be available immediately, a la Uber. If you can't commit to a task within 30 minutes, it moves on to someone else, reassigned via computer. Tasks that don't fall within generic categories like moving, cleaning, or food delivery are discouraged. Rabbits are matched with people looking for help via yet another mystical algorithm, removing whatever personal connection eager users enjoyed. So TaskRabbit is... a temp agency. But it's probably got a higher valuation than your typical temp firm. Teen's Samsung phone bursts into flames while she's sleeping &gt;&gt;&gt; Betabeat Like all of us, 13-year-old Ariel Tolfree is addicted to her cell phone, so she keeps it tucked under her pillow while she's sleeping. But, last week, the battery on her Samsung Galaxy S4 apparently overheated and bursted into flames in the middle of the night. Aaaaaaaaaaaaargh. Star.21 is a \u00a319 fitness tracker that aims to permanently change your attitude to health &gt;&gt;&gt; The Inquirer \"Most Fitness Bands today do not work because the novelty is short lived\" said Oaxis CEO, G-Jay Yong. \"Our human brain is capable of rewiring itself in 21 days to establish new neural pathways. Through 21 days of repetitive actions, the long lasting healthy habits can be formed.\" \u00a319 for 21 days. Worth a shot, but could just end up being yet more landfill. 3D holograms that track you around for any viewing angle are here &gt;&gt;&gt; Pocket-lint The artwork was named Help Me Obi, for the Star Wars fans out there, and offers a 360-degree view. The floating baby might freak you out at first but watch on in the video to see how the image follows the position of the viewer. Clever stuff, but mass market? Not any time soon. Do people actually want holograms still? Might be good for video conferencing, Star Wars style. Dear Instagram &gt;&gt;&gt; Bolt We know it's a great name, because we chose it last year when we set out to build a better mobile voice and messaging experience. We've worked really hard since then building the Bolt brand and technology to where it is today. Please don't destroy all that effort. Complaints before its even announced. Is that a new record? EU gives the green light to Apple's $3 billion acquisition of Beats &gt;&gt;&gt; TUAW In addition, Apple and Beats Electronics are not close competitors because the headphones they sell differ markedly in functionality and design. Moreover, even after the transaction, a large number of global competitors such as Bose, Sennheiser and Sony would remain. The EU's fine with it, not sure Bose is. Also has to go through US regulators, so not quite done yet. Want a 3D-Printed Bobblehead? Amazon Can Help &gt;&gt;&gt; PC Mag The online retail giant is embracing the 3D printing phenomenon with a new Web store where you can find more than 200 3D-printed products available for purchase. Most of the items in the store range from around $40 to $100, including cufflinks, bobble head figurines (pictured) wine glass holders, and fashion accessories like pendants, earrings, and necklaces. So, tat and jewellery then. Some of them even have a limited number ready to ship. Pretty sure that's not quite how 3D printing is meant to work. Printed on demand, surely? Anything else is just selling normal stuff that just happens to be printed. PantryChic's Bluetooth ingredient dispenser is for lazy, type-A bakers &gt;&gt;&gt; Engadget Meet PantryChic, an airtight food canister that dispenses ingredients into a digital scale, so that you never even have to break out a measuring cup. Internet of things gone too far, or not far enough depending on how you look at it. You can follow Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard.
