  "content": "Images of a Barbie wearing a beanie hat, thick-rimmed glasses and a classic canvas rucksack as she poses on rocks, drinking fresh coffee on top of mountains, have infiltrated the carefully manicured streams of Instagram travel photos. Launched this summer by an anonymous wedding photographer from Portland, Oregon, the 'Hipster Barbie' instagram feed (@socalitybarbie) captures the worldwide adventures of a well-dressed brown-haired doll as she takes photos of her luggage from above, goes kayaking and relaxes in a hammock in \"absurd places\". \"Could I be any more authentic?\" she asks in the captions, \"We must have adventures in order to know where we truly belong.\" If Instagram has captured the imagination of a new generation of travellers, then Hipster Barbie (now accelerating past the 600,000 followers mark) is the best pastiche account to help you understand the extent to which the photo-sharing app has cultivated a unique style of imagery around the world. While the cliched pseudo-profundity and unabashed privilege of many Instagram travel accounts can be galling, the app's impact cannot be underestimated. Instagram is moulding the way millions of people relate to travel. Travel photographer Dan Rubin, creative director of The Photographic Journal, was one of the first people to use the app when he was invited to take part in beta-testing six weeks before its launch in 2010. For Rubin, the stylistic repetition is just \"growing pains\", when you consider how quickly mobile photography has exploded \u2013 the app already has 300 million active users. \"It's easy to say these cliches are a negative thing,\" he says. \"But Instagram has opened up a new world of creative discovery for people who previously didn't have access to it. For me, it gives people access to see, create and mimic. Ten years from now, we'll have different patterns.\" As for why travel stands out so firmly on the app \u2013 58 million posts are tagged #travel and 21 million with #holidays \u2013 Rubin believes it comes from the desire to see places you may never have access to. \"Travel photography is aspirational in a way that almost all other photography isn't,\" he says. \"Apart from maybe fashion. But travel is aspirational whatever your personal style.\" Travel brands and tourist boards have been increasingly capitalising on Instagram as a way to promote themselves. It's now common for tourist boards to commission Instagrammers with big followings to travel around a destination, sending a stream of beautiful images into the feeds of millions of people. \"One of the best examples I've seen with Instagram is Iceland,\" says Rubin. \"It just wasn't happening in terms of tourism before Instagram. And Iceland Tourism and Icelandair just jumped on that. The difference it made in the popularity of that country is huge because people aren't just travelling there to travel, they're going to capture the photos they've seen on Instagram.\" He adds: \"The more we see something the more it gets into our head. If you're thinking about where to travel and you're seeing people repeatedly going to the same place it has a huge impact on you, and no other outlet has that effect.\" By providing a platform from which anyone can develop an audience, the app has also had a democratising effect on a particularly elite genre of photography - elevating some photographers, who previously may never have had their work seen, to almost celebrity levels of exposure. Travel and nature photographer Konsta Punkka from Helsinki is one of a growing number of photographers whose career path has been shaped by Instagram. He started posting pictures of squirrels to the app three years ago, \"to beat the number of likes on my friends' selfies\". Now, aged just 21, he has 384,000 followers and a constant stream of work from tourism companies running Instagram campaigns. \"I had no idea what the app could actually give me,\" says Punkka, who is travelling from one destination to the next until Christmas. \"Pretty much 80% of my jobs are in some way related to Instagram.\" Instagram has also taken on a role as a visual diary for many travellers \u2013 both amateur and professional \u2013 a snappy update on the travel blog. \"There's a whole new generation which uses Instagram as a platform for storytelling and sharing experiences,\" says Adrienne Pitts, a travel photographer with 112,000 followers on Instagram. \"And that is hugely exciting. While blogging might be quite a solitary act requiring you to be on a computer writing and posting, the instant nature of Instagram allows you to live more in the moment. I have a travel blog, but everything goes up on Instagram first. I hope when I am old and grey I am able to look back on these moments and share them with my children. I've also printed books of my four-plus years on Instagram, so that I can hold these memories in my hands.\" And for fellow travel blogger and Instagrammer Brooke Saward, who has close to 300,000 followers, the spontaneity of the app is what draws people to follow individuals on their adventures around the world. \"Unless the Instagrammer chooses to go into great detail to describe what is happening in that moment, there's usually an allure of the unknown that allows you to attach your own value to it,\" she says. \"I think this resonates with followers because it is a quick insight into your adventures with a touch of the unknown as well.\" This element of the app \u2013 offering users a glimpse into the unknown \u2013 means it can often go beyond the traditional ideas of travel photography such as eye candy and adventure. Instagram helps facilitate unlikely connections with people and places around the world. The \"Everyday...\" series of feeds are probably the most high-profile example of this, giving access to a stream of images taken by local people in different cultures. The series started with the Everyday Africa account, which was launched by documentary photographer Peter Di Campo to challenge the images of the continent most commonly found in the media. He believes the account's success \u2013 it currently has 166,000 followers and has spawned countless versions in other locations \u2013 is testament to the idea that people are using the platform to go beyond just what's cool, or celebrities on beaches. \"It's really hard to attract people to photojournalism,\" he says. \"But that word Everyday, just triggers something. It doesn't need a mission statement. People just get it right away. They know what they're going to get: this window into other people's lives.\" For Di Campo, Instagram allows for a much more democratic exchange of ideas. The Everyday series are \"people from many cultures learning from many cultures\", rather than the Western world learning about other places. But a unique part of the appeal of Instagram, compared with say, photo books and other photo sites, rests on the \"Insta\" element of it: \"Not only did this happen on the other side of the world,\" he says, \"but it happened right now.\" As for where this photography revolution is taking us: \"My feeling is we're moving into this space where professional and user-generated, or non-professional, work is blending together,\" says Di Campo. \"There are things to learn from both and the viewers are intelligent enough to understand this difference. We're heading towards a broader perspective.\" And when it comes to the more traditional travel photography trends seen on the site: dreamlike, HDR shots of landscapes, misty pine forests, pastel shades, street food markets and, well, all the stuff you see on the Hipster Barbie account, there is still no sign we've reached saturation point. \"Will these kinds of photographs ever lose impact? I don't think so.\" says Rubin. \"Look at accounts like Beautiful Destinations, they just republish these pics on their feed and it's followed by millions of people. And look at the engagement on these feeds. People just love seeing beautiful places they dream of visiting. And that's not going to get old.\""
