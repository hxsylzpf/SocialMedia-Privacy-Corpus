  "content": "Many of the abuses uncovered by the Leveson inquiry would not have happened if Rupert Murdoch's News International had been prevented from achieving such a dominant position in British media, Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger has said. In his closing statement to the inquiry on Tuesday, Rusbridger urged Lord Justice Leveson to consider the \"significant dangers to democracy\" of media power being concentrated in too few hands and warned that there would be more consolidation in the industry, not less. Rusbridger said media organisations that have accumulated too strong a presence in the sector might abuse their position. \"They may, in a troubled economic climate for news, stifle or destroy the ability of others to hold them to account,\" he added. He said that over the three-and-a-half-year investigation into hacking by the Guardian, he and investigative reporter Nick Davies had encountered numerous examples of people who lived, and in some cases, still live, in fear of one particular newspaper company. Rusbridger added that few believed the day would come when the practices of all newspapers could be put under the spotlight by a public inquiry. \"At the height of the Guardian's coverage of the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World, we did not believe there could or would, ever be a public inquiry. We had seen other news organisations fight shy of what was being revealed. The police had sat on their hands,\" he said. \"Most politicians didn't want to know. The industry regulator turned a blind eye.\" Rusbridger suggested to Leveson that many had been cowed by the power of Murdoch. \"The Murdoch influence, power, money, dominance and reputation was such that it seemed to confer a form of immunity from scrutiny,\" he said, adding that the courage of a small number of phone-hacking victims such as Sienna Miller, one of the first to take civil action, helped \"prise open the evidence\". He went on to outline his proposals for a new regulator to ensure the press thrived long into the future. Rusbridger backed Associated Newspapers, which also made its closing statement on Tuesday, saying that \"anything that looks like direct statutory or political control is undesirable\". But he said he agreed with the proposal for a statute which would give a new arbitration unit within a revamped Press Complaints Commission legally binding powers to adjudicate on complaints from the public and others who felt wronged in newspaper articles. This unit would provide speedy and cheap resolution to complaints, he added. Rusbridger said he shared the anxieties of other newspaper editors and executives that statutory regulation could be a \"the thin edge of the wedge\" towards state control of the industry, but said this should not apply to a new arbitration unit. \"Narrowly defined uses of law\", as this was, may help public interest journalism and restore public confidence in the press's ability to regulate itself, Rusbridger said. He added that it was \"healthy\" that there was no \"perfect consensus about the shape of regulation\" of the industry in future among newspapers, as this reflected the plurality of the media. Proposals recently outlined by Lord Black and Lord Hunt, the PCC chairman, for a new body had the Guardian's broad support although the publisher has reservations about some elements, he said. Rusbridger added that he had issues with the \"prominence of serving editors\" on any new regulator; the role of the body that finances it; and the selection methods for the press representatives. Part of this chimes with evidence given by the Express Newspapers on Monday, proposing Nolan-style transparency on appointments to the new press regulator. In a recent submission to the inquiry Lord Black, chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, the co-ordinating body for the newspaper industry, suggested 12 serving editors sit on the body that draws up the code of practice for journalists. Serving editors would also sit on the division which would adjudicate on complaints. Rusbridger said it would be \"refreshing to involve journalists who are not editors \u2013 possibly even members of the National Union of Journalists \u2013 on the code [of practice] committee\". Jonathan Caplan QC, counsel to Associated Newspapers, opened his closing statement by warning Leveson that he should not jeopardise the 19,000 jobs in British newspapers when he comes to making his recommendations. Caplan said the PCC had been found wanting but urged him against \"reading the last rites on the industry which sees circulations falling year after year\", with provincial newspapers closing and the rise of global internet news and social media. He argued that it was important to have serving editors on the new regulator. If editors not involved they would mount legal challenges \"at every opportunity,\" he said. Caplan also reiterated a warning made by Black when he testified that clamping down on the freedom of the press might drive some publishers out of the country altogether. \"Whatever recommendations you inquiry makes for future regulation, great care, we suggest, will need to be taken to ensure that it does not jeopardise the 19,000 jobs still remaining in British newspaper journalism or drive publishers in the great growth area of the Internet to move their operations to another summer jurisdiction,\" he said. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
