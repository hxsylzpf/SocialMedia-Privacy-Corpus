Yes, it can only be one thing \u2013 William Shatner's sci-fi social networking site, myouterspace.com. Get it? \"Welcome citizens of the Myouterspace United Planets,\" says Shatner. Planets? Oh yes. As well as the one you're reading this from, there's Creatia, Triton, Sirius and, well, lots of others too, and starships such as Republic, Aurora and Nautilus. No Battlestars, alas \u2013 probably a rights thing \u2013 and no base ships either, thank goodness. The site also has a serious side, hoping to give people a leg-up into the sci-fi creative industry. \"Register now on the planet that hosts your talents,\" says Shatner in a \"message from the admiral\". Monkey can vouch for that. We registered on the wrong one and our phone bill went through the roof."
