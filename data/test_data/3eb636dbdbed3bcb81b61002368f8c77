  "content": "Affairs conducted via social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are increasingly a cause of marriage breakdowns, according to divorce lawyers. Matrimonial experts at law firm Turner Parkinson said social networking is increasingly cited as a reason for divorce as spouses embark on cyber affairs. The trend has been fuelled by websites that introduce like-minded adulterers such as Meet2cheat.co.uk and Affairsclub.com, as well as a host of self-help websites telling spouses how to look for telltale signs of a partner cheating online. Martin Karran, partner and head of family law at Turner Parkinson, said: \"People are using websites like Second Life to reinvent themselves and live out their fantasies. We have already noticed this having an impact in the divorces we deal with.\" Although aggrieved spouses would not be able to petition for divorce on the basis of cyber adultery unless actual sexual intercourse had taken place in the real world, they could claim unreasonable behaviour, according to Suzanne Kingston, partner at Dawsons solicitors. \"A wife might say her husband is spending several hours on the computer each evening and not giving enough attention to her or their family, or that he has formed an inappropriate relationship with someone via the computer and this is having a detrimental effect on family life,\" she said. David Lister, partner with Mishcon de Reya, the firm that represented Princess Diana and Heather Mills in their divorces, said the use of digital technology is cited in most cases that cross his desk: \"Digital information \u2013 texting, emailing and having conversations on Facebook \u2013 is often the first cause of suspicion. A partner may wonder if such behaviour is appropriate.\" However, evidence of online affairs are unlikely to have an effect on the financial result of a divorce settlement. \"Conduct is only considered in a minority of cases,\" Kingston said. \"The impact of the unreasonable behaviour would not have any impact on the financial outcome of the case unless there has been financial or litigation misconduct.\" Lister agreed that while information about such behaviour may be useful in obtaining the divorce, it will have little impact on who gets what. \"Behaviour is irrelevant in the apportionment of money unless it's really, really bad,\" he said. Online affairs In November a British couple were set to divorce after a wife found her husband cheating on her with a female in Second Life, the online virtual world. It wasn't the first time he had been caught out: Amy Taylor had previously played on Second Life with her husband David Pollard, but discovered him watching his character having sex with a prostitute in the virtual world. In January, journalist Georgina Hobbs-Meyer warned Guardian readers not to get dumped online after her husband two-timed her on Facebook with a woman he met at a party. The cyber affair was exposed when Georgina read messages sent between the pair after her husband forgot to log out of his Facebook account. It remains unclear whether the article was genuine, however, with a number of bloggers claiming Georgina could not be found on Facebook. A woman was set to divorce her husband in February after she discovered him having virtual sex with another man in Second Life. Lisa Best caught her husband, John, 34, while in bed at their home in Derby, according to the News of the World. In March the Sun reported that a wife had called in divorce lawyers after seeing her husband's car parked outside another woman's house on Google Street View. An American blogger claimed he invented the story to dupe the newspaper, but it helped raise awareness of privacy issues surrounding Google's latest venture. The Daily Mail reported that an Italian man decapitated his wife after suspecting she was having an online affair. Giuseppe Castro, 35, reportedly told detectives: \"She was always chatting with other men, I couldn't take it any more.\"",
