  "content": "Trevor Kavanagh, the Sun columnist and former political editor, and Dame Sue Tinson, the former editor of News at Ten, have been named as members of a new \"foundation group\" that will kick start the process of setting up a regulatory body to replace the Press Complaints Commission. Their names have been circulated along with three others as the group selected by the former supreme court judge, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, to work out the process for the creation of an appointments panel, which will ensure the board of the new watchdog is robustly independent of the press. The remaining three on the group are Sir Simon Jenkins, the Guardian columnist and ex-Times editor, the former cabinet secretary Lord Butler of Brockwell, and Lord Smith, the former Labour culture secretary. Lord Hunt, the PCC chairman overseeing the transition to the new regulator, said on Thursday that he is hoping the move will help extricate the process of setting up a new watchdog out of the \"quagmire\" it has become stuck in since the Leveson report was published in November. He refused to name the six on the so-called \"foundation group\", but informed sources told MediaGuardian the names have been distributed to newspaper groups. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857. For all other inquiries please call the main Guardian switchboard on 020 3353 2000. If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
