  "content": "Rebekah Wade made her name at the News of the World, the paper she joined as a researcher in 1989, rising rapidly through the ranks to become its editor in 2000. Later this year she is to become chief executive of News International. Born in Warrington, Cheshire, in 1968, she became one of the youngest ever national newspaper editors when she was handed the top job at the News of the World days before her 32nd birthday after serving a two-year apprenticeship at its sister title the Sun, where she was deputy editor. Wade made headlines as News of the World editor, launching a high-profile campaign to introduce \"Sarah's Law\", named after Sarah Payne, the child who was murdered the year Wade took up the post. It aimed to change the law to give parents the right to know if sex offenders were living in their area. That backfired after several suspected paedophiles were attacked by angry mobs, and was condemned by some senior police offers, but Wade remained unrepentant. Under her editorship, the News of the World circulation averaged around 3.5m, less than the 4m it sold during its 1980s heyday, but sales held up at a time when the circulation of many of its rivals were falling sharply. She was made editor of the Sun, Murdoch's most influential paper, in 2003, and was not caught by the fall-out from the Clive Goodman affair because the crimes for which he was convicted were committed after she had left the News of the World. Along with Andy Coulson, who succeeded her at the Sunday paper, Wade was identified as a potential executive early in her career, finally achieving a long-held ambition to break into Rupert Murdoch's cadre of key corporate lieutenants last month. It was announced in June that Wade will become chief executive of News International, publisher of the Times, Sunday Times, News of the World and the Sun, in September. The promotion from editor to businesswoman confirms her status as one of Murdoch's favoured UK executives. Her six-year editorship of the Sun has been characterised by some major scoops, including publishing the findings of the Hutton report into the death of David Kelly before it was made public, but there have been some slipups along the way. Soon after she took the editor's chair, Wade ran a front-page story about ex-boxer Frank Bruno after he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act under the headline \"Bonkers Bruno Locked Up\". She subsequently donated money to Sane, the mental health charity. Like most News International executives, she rarely gives interviews. Her public appearances have not always gone smoothly. In 2003 Wade told a House of Commons select committee that the Sun had paid police offers for information, a statement that prompted News International to issue a hasty clarification emphasising that the practice was highly unusual. In a letter to the same MPs, she also wrote that: \"The days of foot-in-the-door harassment and snatched photos are gone\" \u2013 an attempt to improve the paper's image in the eyes of politicians. Wade has ventured into the spotlight more regularly recently as James Murdoch, appointed by his father to take run his UK newspapers in 2007, prepared to relinquish some of his powers to her. At another parliamentary grilling, this time at the hands of the House of Lords media committee in January 2008, she was more self-assured, teasing the Bishop of Manchester after he criticised Page 3. \"If you wanted to meet [page 3 girl] Keeley you only had to ask\", she told him. In January, Wade delivered her first public speech to an audience of media executives, attacking a High Court decision to award Max Mosley damages for invasion of privacy following the News of the World's revelation he had taken part in orgies. She also criticised rival papers, including the Guardian, for failing to support its fight to prevent the introduction of a privacy law by the backdoor, a familiar News International complaint. Wade has been called \"the most charming tabloid operator of all time\" but her personal life has been as colourful as the lives of the celebrities her paper covers. In 2005 she was arrested following an argument with actor Ross Kemp, her then husband, at the home the couple shared. No charges were ever laid. She married partner Charlie Brooks, a racehorse trainer, last month, at St Bride's church on London's Fleet Street, and threw a huge party in the Cotswolds attended by some of the biggest names in showbiz, the media and politics. Guests included David Cameron, Gordon and Sarah Brown, Blur bassist Alex James, Guy Ritchie and, of course, Rupert Murdoch. The guest list was testament to the power she wields at the Sun. Her influence is likely to grow stronger when she is installed as News International chief executive in September."
