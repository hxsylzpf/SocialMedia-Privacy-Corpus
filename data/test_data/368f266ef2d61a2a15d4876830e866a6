  "content": "When James Chin Moody decided to give up his successful online sharing company, TuShare, he thought for \"20 milliseconds\", about selling it. With almost 50,000 users, it could have been a lucrative proposition and would have kept alive a project that had consumed his time and energy for two years. The company's assets, however, consisted entirely of its database. Chin Moody realised that selling the business meant selling the users' details: names, street addresses, email addresses. The answer arrived swiftly: \"Absolutely not\" Users' private information was not his to sell. In a world in which governments and mega corporations collect, use, share and trade citizens' and consumers' personal data on a massive scale, Chin Moody took a stand. \"Our overarching principle is that the personal information of our members is owned by our members,\" he says. \"They get to choose what to do with it, whether they share it with us, with others or ultimately delete it. We start from there.\" TuShare, established in 2012, matched people who no longer needed stuff with those who could use it. It was about not letting good things go to waste and not contributing to landfill. The only money involved was the cost of delivery, paid by the recipient. Eventually, the courier side of the business emerged as the real innovation. Using economies of scale and making deals with large courier companies, whose business-to-business runs often return to base empty, Chin Moody was able to offer individuals and small businesses the heavily discounted rates for door-to-door parcel delivery that big business enjoys. In November 2014, he launched Sendle, a dedicated courier company. A year later, he closed TuShare. \"We can't run two business well,\" he says. \"The thing about being a startup is you have to focus.\" He wrote in a letter to members, \"Sendle began to grow more quickly than we had imagined, while at the same time, we were unable to fund the long-term costs of TuShare without breaking our commitment to remain authentically community-focussed.\" Sendle's appeal comes from its simplicity: it has only four price points, across three service levels, which Chin Moody compares to Australia Post's cumbersome 5,200 price points. And that is made possible by sophisticated software engineering. \"We consider ourselves a tech company, not a logistics company,\" Chin Moody says. \"Most of our people are writing code.\" Chin Moody sits on the World Economic Forum's global agenda council on the future of software and society. Its recent document, Deep Shift: Technology Tipping Points and Societal Impact, looks at the effects of digital developments, including transparency and privacy. Next year, he says, the council will work on policymaking: what governments should be considering. \"Things are moving very rapidly in the software world and how do we make sure government policy keeps up so the protections are in place before things happen?\" he says. The issues of mass surveillance and data retention are increasingly being discussed but we tend to overlook that the smallest daily transactions aggregate into our online profile. \"When you go to the bank, when you order a book, when you use your bus-card, a company is watching what you do,\" Matthew Rimmer, prof of intellectual property and innovation law at Queensland University of Technology, points out. Like frogs in slowly heating water, we have accepted the encroachments because each small step seems both useful and harmless. It's handy to be told when the groceries we purchase most are on sale. The collation of data across phone and laptop is what makes communication increasingly seamless. We've even become too blase to check terms and conditions statements, and just click on the handy 'agree' box. Indeed several types of company are required by law to share the content of accounts with the government departments, for example, which is why \"pre-filling\" information about salary, bank interest and share dividends, and private health insurance makes preparing online tax returns so easy. Governments, like banks, work hard to protect their data, though shocking breaches have occurred. Rimmer warns against taking anyone's claims at face value, however. \"Remember that Google, Yahoo, Facebook and co were part of the global network initiative, saying they respected human rights and privacy, at the same time, as they were secretly dealing with the NSA in its dragnet mass surveillance,\" Rimmer says. \"We need to change the creepy surveillance of our corporate world, and fight for the privacy of consumers.\" He also says it's up to consumers to get behind entrepreneurs such as Chin Moody and \"not support companies that are careless about protecting information security and privacy.\" For Chin Moody, ethics and profit are not mutually exclusive. \"It's about having the highest standards of ethics in business,\" he says. \"And we see that as a competitive advantage.\"",
