  "content": "Because the Safari browser treats cookies differently from Internet Explorer and Firefox, says Dr Richard Clayton, a security researcher from Cambridge, after a detailed briefing on the Phorm user- and ad-tracking system. Privacy settings in Safari prevent Phorm's system of cookie identification, by which it \"pretends\" to be the cookie's originating site, says Clayton. In a writeup available on his team's lightbluetouchpaper.org site, Clayton notes that \"if a [web page] request does not appear to have been generated by a \"well-known\" browser, then the request will be ignored [by Phorm's system inside the ISP's system].\" Explaining this in an interview with the Guardian's Tech Weekly podcast, Clayton said that this was because many other processes, such as software update checks, can go via port 80, the web browsing channel that Phorm inspects. Dipping into those streams might cause problems. \"So they've concentrated on traffic just from browsers where they understand what will happen. If you're using Internet Explorer or Firefox, then they will intercept your traffic and snoop on it.\" Apple's Safari, though, \"has some built-in settings which means that the cookies which [Phorm] rely on at the end of the process to serve you up targeted ads will not be sent by Safari because it considers that a privacy risk and doesn't send them\". Clayton had other criticism for Phorm and for BT, which carried out two separate trials of versions of the company's technology - affecting about 18,000 users in each case - in 2006 and 2007. The Phorm system \"definitely\" invades privacy, Clayton said, and is a prima facie breach of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) 2000, which governs interception of communications. The reason: because the websites have not necessarily agreed to have their content interfered with as the Phorm system does. Clayton reserved his greatest ire for BT, saying that the 2006 and 2007 trials \"absolutely\" breached the Ripa: \"because it can't even argue that they got permission from the person who was sending the [web page] requests, so essentially they've been snooping on this data. BT will doubtless say they didn't look at this data, which seems an odd sort of trial ... that seems to me extremely wicked of BT. Whether they're going to go to jail for it, one leaves to the courts, but it's not the sort of behaviour one expects from major public - well, private - institutions\". Phorm said that narrow interpretations of Ripa like that would mean systems such as Google Mail or spam filtering would also be illegal. \"We conducted extensive due diligence on the legality of our system under current interception law,\" it said. These \"have led to only one conclusion - that Phorm's systems are legal under any full interpretation of the law\"."
