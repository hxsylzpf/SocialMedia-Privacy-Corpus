  "content": "The live screen in the Chirp conference lobby. Photo by d.mosher on Flickr. Some rights reserved ReadWriteWeb has a handy crib from the Twitter Chirp conference (at which our own Chris Thorpe has demonstrated the Guardian's implementation of the @anywhere service (which is like Facebook Connect: it lets people tweet from almost anywhere but without having to hand over their login details; if you want a guide on how to use it, here's Michael Brunton-Spall's, one of the Guardian developers who worked on it). A few of the statistics (and our questions) \u2022 Twitter has 105,779,710 registered users (our previous best guess was 45m - though this 105m, soon to be 106m, isn't active users, of course) \u2022 300,000 new users sign up per day (but: how many are spam?) \u2022 Approximately 60% of them are coming from outside the US \u2022 Twitter receives 180 million unique visitors per month (is that to twitter.com, or totally?) \u2022 75% of Twitter traffic comes from third-party applications \u2022 60% of all tweets come from third-party apps (those tow make an intriguing combination: third-party apps are used more to read than tweet?) \u2022 Since the new Blackberry application was launched, it has accounted for 7 to 8% of new signups (encouraging for RIM) \u2022 Twitter now has 175 employees, up from 25 one year ago \u2022 There are 600 million search queries on Twitter per day (that's a lot of chances for Promoted Tweets) \u2022 There are more than 100,000 Twitter applications \u2022 Twitter gets 3 billion requests a day through its API \u2022 37% of active Twitter users use their phone to tweet (that's a lot - and shows how Twitter has escaped from the web) More will come, we're sure."
