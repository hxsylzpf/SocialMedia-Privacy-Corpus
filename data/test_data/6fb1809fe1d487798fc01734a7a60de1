  "content": "If you looked across social media as news of the Brussels attacks unfolded, you would have seen that within minutes of the first reports of explosions at Zaventem airport, people were lashing out. At commentators for using the attack to make a political point. At Twitter for suspending the account of a Belgian expert on terrorism by accident. At a man who tweeted that he'd \"confronted\" a Muslim woman about the attacks. And plenty of the lashing out was at journalists, especially those contacting members of the public to see if images they had posted of the attack were available for re-use. Robert Andrews may have meant this tweet as observational rather than snarky as he later clarified, but many of the retweets were by people disgusted by the practice. Let's not shy away from this. It looks ugly. Breaking news situations and social media are an ongoing ethical challenge for journalists. There's clearly a public interest in reproducing the images, and it seems surely preferable to contact a witness and ask them for permission to use their images with a credit, rather than just ripping them off and using them anyway. Others don't agree, saying this kind of newsgathering used to be done \"with a little dignity. And once done with more skill than 140 begging characters.\" Was it? I suspect it was always a bit on the shabby side, but just not so much in the eye public. Asking to re-use pictures of tragic events is in some ways the digital equivalent of the old newsgathering \"death knock\". But now it is a death knock that everybody can listen in on. The proliferation of cameras in people's hands, embedded in their phones, connected to the web, has changed reporting of events like Brussels. News organisations no longer have to rely on professional photographers or camerapeople getting to the scene of a dramatic event several hours after it has happened, and getting some pictures of police tape cordoning off a place where something quite clearly isn't happening any more. We now get footage of nearly every news event in western Europe or the US from someone near the scene almost instantly. It is a shift that has happened over the past decade. One of the most iconic images from London's 7/7 bombings was of people moving through a tunnel along the tracks, taken by someone who had narrowly avoided the carnage. It was an image eerily echoed this week in Belgium. It is instructive to think back to how 9/11 was covered, and how that would be different today. Had that attack taken place in 2011, rather than 2001, it is almost certain that some of the first images journalists would have had would have been people in the south tower of the World Trade Center, taking photographs of the north tower in flames, and posting it to social media, unaware that United Airlines Flight 175 was at that moment on course to hit the building they were standing in. There would almost certainly be video footage from inside the towers as people evacuated. Would news organisations use those images or run that footage? Might they choose to use them initially, until it became clear that the people who had taken those pictures were now most likely among the dead? In breaking news situations editors and journalists have to make very quick decisions, under a lot of pressure, at a time when they are undoubtedly feeling the same turmoil of emotions that any member of the public does when a tragedy unfolds before them. You are often dealing with a very confusing set of information from a variety of sources, including people who have deliberately set out to post false information. We have to accept that we don't always make the right decisions in the heat of the moment. And technology is pushing us into ethical situations that we have just never had to consider before. On my phone at any given time I am about three button clicks away from being able to initiate a live video stream from the Guardian's Facebook page, which would potentially alert an audience of 5 million people that I'm filming. Of course, where we've experimented with this format so far we've done it in a pre-planned way at a protest we knew was going to take place, or from the audience of an event we were hosting. But what if I, or any of the other reporters and editors who have access, suddenly find ourselves in the middle of a breaking news situation? We can theoretically go live without the intervention of a desk or an editor or a video producer, or any of the usual checks and balances you expect to have in the newsroom. Individual journalists have never been in this kind of situation before. And it's only a matter of time before we hit a situation where someone is live-streaming a terrorist attack or a natural disaster as it develops from their phone. Would you choose to use that footage, or embed that stream? Mobile video technology is a massive boon for our ability to tell stories, to empathise with the situations people find themselves in, and yes, as a way of grabbing the attention of the audience. But it is also uncharted water for journalists. Whether it is the way that we approach witnesses in public, our duty of care to people who may have put themselves into dangerous situations to get footage, or the morality of using images where we have consent from the person who took the photo, but maybe not the consent of the people depicted in the image, the ethics around audience-shot images of news events will be a work in progress for some time."
