  "content": "My niece's Facebook account has been taken over by someone who is putting up very bad things about her. Tina Bardwell Facebook provides online help, and the help centre's Help page 797 covers Security: Account was hacked or \"phished\". The section headed \"My account has been hacked\" has a link to a form you can fill in. In general, the quickest approach is to go to http://www.facebook.com/reset.php, enter the account's email address and ask for the password to be reset (ie changed)."
