  "content": "Of course it was foolish of Facebook to censor the image of Kim Phuc, injured and fleeing from a napalm attack during the Vietnam war (Report, 10 September). However, I was surprised and encouraged to discover that it has a policy of child protection which includes censoring nude photos of children. If all the various internet providers adopted this policy there might be less child abuse worldwide. When Lowell Goddard, former head of the inquiry into child sexual abuse, resigns and says that sexual crimes against children are too big, too tolerated and altogether too much we should be grateful to Mark Zuckerberg, a father himself, for trying to do something about it.
