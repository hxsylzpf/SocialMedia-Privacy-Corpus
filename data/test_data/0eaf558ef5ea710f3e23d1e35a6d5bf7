  "content": "Sometimes, the obvious thing to say is also the right thing. So let us begin there: it is obviously daft that Paul Chambers was convicted at Doncaster magistrates court on Monday on the basis of a solitary tweet. True, his joke threat was not the wisest use of technological innovation. But a message \u2013 sent while airports were snowbound this January \u2013 reading \"Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!\" can hardly be construed as a serious terrorist threat. It is unlikely that the next 9/11 will begin with a 133-character message published on a social networking site and distributed among 600-odd followers \u2013 or that it will come bedecked with exclamation marks. If only that were so, terror prevention would be a much simpler affair. Even if police officers were worried by the small-hours ramblings of a 26-year old accountant, it did not require four of them to storm into his workplace and arrest him. Nor did it require a district judge to hand down a fine and a description of his message as \"menacing\". After all, the named airport described the threat as \"not credible\". Put all this down to overreaction and hope that such a case does not come up again. But the Chambers affair has two other messages for us that are worth considering. First, there are bound to be many more instances of unwise messages sent using Twitter, Facebook and all the rest. Parents say angry things to children that they later regret, and couples often have heat-of-the-moment rows. The ability of almost anyone with access to technology to publish whatever they want makes for livelier debates \u2013 but it is also another opportunity to air dirty linen in public. Individuals, companies, regulators and authorities need new rules for these new means of communication, which are not as formal as a letter on headed notepaper, nor as instantly forgettable as a playground insult. Should a newspaper be penalised for an intemperate tweet filed by a journalist? There is also the case of Stacy Snyder, who was denied a teaching degree after university officials found pictures of her on MySpace. Labelled \"drunken pirate\", they showed Snyder at a party, wearing a pirate's hat and drinking beer \u2013 which officials deemed made her unfit for the classroom. One solution to what is going to be a growing problem lies in technology. Social media sites could automatically delete users' personal information after a set period (unless specifically requested otherwise) \u2013 and they could make it harder for users to file messages at particular times, or with particular words in. A simple \"do you really want to send this?\" query could forestall an awful lot of trouble.",
