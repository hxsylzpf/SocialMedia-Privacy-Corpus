  "content": "James McMahon blogged for us yesterday about Mike Skinner's latest internet adventures and his fondness for turning followers' tweets into songs. A few hours later we checked back on Skinner's blog to find a rather more personal update. \"Hello to James McMahon from the Guardian newspaper, thank you for your kind words ...\" Skinner went on to say that he was a tad disappointed at McMahon's claim that he has given up tweeting about his hangovers. And how best to vent this disappointment? Through a song, of course, and a video that aims to show \"the genuine process through which one obtains the clouded head that leads to the morning after a day off on one\". Enjoy!"
