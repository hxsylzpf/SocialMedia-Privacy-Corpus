  "content": "In his memoir-cum-polemic Devil's Advocate, John Humphrys writes about his time as a cub journalist in south Wales in the 1960s: I often had to knock on the doors of miners' wives who'd been widowed hours earlier, the sound of the pithead siren still echoing in the valley. \"Hello Mrs Jones, I'm from the Merthyr Express, can I please have a picture of your husband for the paper?\" Almost always they would give you one, and a cup of tea. Such a scenario is pretty much unthinkable now. People thrown unexpectedly and unwillingly into the media gaze are protected by a cordon of police liaison, counselling, damage limitation and, in particularly juicy cases, Max Clifford. Contact with victims and their families is mediated by press releases and press conferences; a doorstepping hack is unlikely to be offered a cuppa. So what can a reporter do to distinguish his or her copy from that of the competition? A brief glimmer of hope came in the late 1990s, as it became fashionable (especially post-Diana) to create spontaneous public shrines in response to sudden death. All a reporter needed to do to add a little poignant flavour to the story was to quote one or two tributes to the victim. Poor spelling and grammar only added to the pathos. The current popularity of social networking sites offers an extension of this phenomenon. Take as an example in the recent case of Essex teenager Natasha Coombs, who went missing last month. A body was found by railway tracks. Police believed it was Natasha's, but it was not possible to make an immediate, definite identification. In the Observer, Anushka Asthana quoted from a Bebo page called Find Natasha: the message \"Praying 2 God that it isnt you they've found\" seemed to hit the right note. And it could be acquired without having to intrude on the grief of Natasha's family. Cynics, however, might add that these sites enable journalists to avoid the hassle of knocking on doors to get quotes. They're even easier to fillet than those floral tributes: you don't need to leave your computer. Just as press releases offer a deceptively easy, ready-made story that time-poor hacks can use to fill a space, Bebo and Myspace and Facebook offer a tempting trove of one-liners. But who put them there? Are they friends of the victim, or \"friends\" like those complete strangers who ask you to be their Facebook friends? Things get even more problematic when these sites become the source, not just for quotes and colour, for reported facts. Asthana writes: But there were also friends who wrote that, despite her bubbly personality, striking looks and lively social life she had fits of depression. Are these phrases any more attributable than those concocted quotations that tabloids plant in celebrity gossip stories, prefaced with the all-purpose \"a friend said\"? Journalists and readers alike should be more circumspect. And there's a wider problem. Young people are increasingly abandoning the mainstream news media, spending far more time in the world of games and, yes, social networking. Put yourself in their shoes. If the only added value a newspaper report can offer is something you've probably seen already on Bebo, why should you bother?"
