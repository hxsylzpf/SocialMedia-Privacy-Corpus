  "content": "Kate Middleton, Prince William's girlfriend, has accused the Daily Mirror of harassment in her first complaint to the Press Complaints Commission. The 25-year-old made the complaint via her lawyers, Harbottle &amp; Lewis, about a picture in today's Mirror showing her on her way to work. The PCC said in a statement: \"The Press Complaints Commission has today received a formal complaint from Kate Middleton that a photograph of her in today's Daily Mirror was obtained as a result of harassment in breach of clause 4 (harassment) of the code of practice. \"The complaint will now be investigated in the normal way and the commission will not be making any further statement on the subject until the matter has been dealt with.\" Today's complaint represents a tougher stance on the part of Ms Middleton and her lawyers. Previously they have relied on private appeals to newspaper editors. The Daily Mirror did not byline the picture to indicate if it had been taken by a staff photographer or a paparazzo, or a picture agency. The Mirror ran the story on page 22 with a photograph that showed Ms Middleton on a footpath carrying her handbag and a cup of coffee, with a caption: \"Smouldering: Kate heading for work yesterday\". Today's story detailed the prince's alleged \"laddish escapades\" with several women at a Bournemouth nightclub and speculated that the incidents had led to her looking \"stoney-faced\" as she made her way to work. The Mirror then advised the 25-year-old to \"give him hell - just go easy on the crown jewels\". Ms Middleton instructed her lawyers to act two months after her law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis wrote a \"last warning\" letter to newspapers editors after the paparazzi scrum outside her flat on her 25th birthday. At least 20 photographers and five TV crews, some of whom followed her down the street, were in attendance. As a result, the Sun and the News of the World have banned the use of paparazzi pictures of Ms Middleton, as has Hello! magazine. The photograph that the Mirror used was taken when Ms Middleton was on her way to work while she was followed by two or three paparazzi. The Daily Mirror has not yet commented on where it purchased the photograph from, but paparazzi agency Photobox had photographs taken at the same time on its website today. \"She wants to be left alone to get on with her life,\" a source close to Ms Middleton said. \"There's no excuse for not knowing the harassment she has been suffering. \"Over the past few days she has had some serious aggression from them. \"She has been chased all over the land both to and from work every moment of the day both on foot and in cars. \"She has personally made it clear to them on many occasions that she wants to be left alone.\" Press coverage melted away after the widespread adverse reaction to photographers following Ms Middleton on her birthday. The Sun's royal photograph, Arthur Edwards, let slip to the Commons culture, media and sport select committee earlier this month that Prince William had told him that he would marry Ms Middleton, his girlfriend of four years, but not for several years. Edwards added that he had heard from friends of Ms Middleton about her distress at media intrusion into her life and said photographers had followed her shopping and even climbed onto buses to photograph her. The PCC chairman, Sir Christopher Meyer, has labelled paparazzi pursuit of Ms Middleton as \"grotesque\". A Daily Mirror spokesman said: \"We will provide the necessary thoughts and comments to the PCC. We will not be commenting any further at this stage.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
