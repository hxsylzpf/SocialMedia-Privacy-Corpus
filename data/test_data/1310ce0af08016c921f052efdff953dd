  "content": "In post-Snowden America, 65% of adults say that limits on the data government agencies can collect about them are not adequate, according to a new study. A study by Pew Research found that only 6% of US adults were \"very confident\", and 25% \"somewhat confident\", that government agencies could keep their data private and secure. The findings come two years after the Edward Snowden leaks, published in the Guardian, revealed that the US and UK security forces had access to and collected individuals' private phone call and internet data without permission, causing a backlash from the technology and security industries. Distrust of internet companies Americans show a lack of trust in internet companies, with 76% of adults saying they were \"not too confident\" or \"not at all confident\" that details of their internet activity would remain private or secure with advertising companies. Social media sites, search engines and video sites were equally distrusted, with 69%, 66% and 66% of adults saying they were not confident their data would remain private and secure in each respectively. Control over who could access Americans' private data and who was watching them was also a concern. According to the survey, 93% of adults said being in control of who could get information about them was important and 90% said controlling which information was collected was important. Meanwhile, 88% said it was important they weren't watched or listened in on without their permission, and half of adults thought online advertisers shouldn't be able to track their internet activities. Only 40% of those surveyed said search engines and social media sites should not track their activity, with 44% saying the same of video sites. False information Despite fears about data collection, surveillance and tracking, few US adults are taking extra steps to protect themselves in the post-Snowden era. Only 10% of adults say they encrypted their phone calls, texts or emails, and only 9% used tools such as Tor to obscure their internet activity. But more Americans have taken simpler steps, including 59% clearing browser cookies or history; 57% refusing to give information to companies or organisations when it wasn't relevant to the transaction; and 24% giving false information. Temporary usernames and email addresses were used by 25% of people, while 23% simply decided not to use a website or service that requested a real name \u2013 a measure employed by sites and social networks in an attempt to kerb trolling and abuse."
