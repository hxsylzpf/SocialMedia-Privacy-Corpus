  "content": "Imaginary titles for middle-class protest songs have been captivating Twitter users over the last few days. Where Have All the Servants Gone?, Stuck in the Squeezed Middle With You, Glyndebourne in the USA, etc, etc \u2013 you get the idea. But there seem to be some transatlantic differences in the perceived interests of the middle classes. On the American side, a lot of it is about money and possessions: If I Had a Hummer, Escrowing in the Wind and (one that didn't need changing at all) This Land is MY Land. On the British side, the #middleclassprotestsongs response focused more on middle-class shopping and eating habits: Give Chickpeas a Chance, Waitrose Voucher Redemption Song, Jamie Oliver's Army and Aint Gonna Work at Maggie's Farmers Market No More. So tell us, do you think middle-class concerns are universal, or do they differ from country to country?",
