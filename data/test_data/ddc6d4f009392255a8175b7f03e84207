  "content": "Piers Morgan, the editor of the Mirror, has dismissed as \"complete rubbish\" the idea his newspaper set out to make Naomi Campbell's life hell. Taking to the witness stand for the first time in the high court action the model has brought against the tabloid, Morgan said: \"The idea that we try to create havoc for Naomi Campbell and others is a myth perpetrated by certain celebrities.\" The model is suing the paper for alleged breach of privacy after it published photographs of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous session. In a ground-breaking case, she is using the European Human Rights Act, which was recently incorporated in British law, to press her case. Earlier today, Campbell said her PR representative, Matthew Freud, had warned the paper would \"make her life hell\" if she did not co-operate following the publication of the pictures and accompanying article. Morgan brushed aside the claims but admitted he and Mr Freud had discussed the issue. He said he and Mr Freud had been \"in agreement on the points that legal action in these matters is competely self-defeating and bonkers\". Morgan added: \"Matthew has always taken the view that legal action is not desirable. \"I believe the press complaints commission and self-regulation is a very good forum with which we might come to a solution for treatment of these stories in the future.\" He continued: \"Once you pop the balloon, in every interview subsequently she would have been asked about this. We were prepared to give her a very sympathetic interview.\" Morgan said he thought a sympathetic piece would have made an \"inspiring\" interview. When Desmond Browne QC asked him whether it was true the Mirror had set out to make Campbell's life hell, Morgan responded: \"It is complete rubbish, absolute nonsense.\" The case continues."
