  "content": "Legal claims resulting in millions of pounds in damages are certain to follow the revelations of the News of the World's phone-hacking scandal, in what is being described by a former Murdoch editor, Andrew Neil, as one of the \"most significant media stories of modern times\". Murdoch's News Group Newspapers has paid out more than \u00a31m to settle cases that threatened to reveal evidence of his journalists' repeated involvement in the use of criminal methods to get stories. But that amount may yet prove to be just the tip of the iceberg. Once the court seal on suppressed evidence emerges, the door will be opened to hundreds more legal actions by victims of News Group, the Murdoch company that publishes the News of the World and the Sun. Other tabloids are also trembling in trepidation. The payments revealed yesterday secured secrecy over out-of-court settlements in three cases that threatened to expose evidence showing the systematic use by Murdoch journalists of private investigators to illegally hack into the phone messages of public figures and gain unlawful access to confidential personal data. By persuading the high court to seal the court files in relation to these claims and by paying the claimants in exchange for their silence, News Group prevented the public \u2013 and those victim to the phone hacking \u2013 from knowing anything about the hundreds of pages of evidence that had been disclosed in these cases and prevented the exposure of potentially criminal behaviour by its journalists. The full police file is understood to reveal that several thousand public figures have been targeted, including cabinet ministers, MPs, actors and sports stars such as John Prescott, Boris Johnson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Elle Macpherson, George Michael and Jade Goody. Each of the individuals targeted in the scandal have potential claims for breach of privacy against the media outlets for hundreds of thousands of pounds. Those affected by the phone-hacking scandal should take immediate action to report matters to the police for investigation of suspected crimes (including attempts and conspiracies), obtain access to the sealed court records, take defensive action \u2013 change their phones \u2013 and take proceedings for breach of privacy against the private detectives and journalists responsible. Yesterday, assistant commissioner John Yates confined his comments to the case of Clive Goodman, the News of the World royal editor jailed for four months in 2007. He didn't address the hundreds of people whose communications were intercepted by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire on the commission of News of the World journalists. Yates hasn't addressed whether the commission of illegal activities against those individuals includes a conspiracy to commit criminal offences. There are several hundred banker boxes of material to review, just in relation to the Goodman case. The DPP estimates it will take it days just to review it, so one is amazed at Yates's ability to do it in five hours in a definitive way. The court has power to unseal court records. Individuals and news agencies could apply for release of the records on the grounds they were sealed unnecessarily and that it is unjust to withhold from the public evidence involving such wrongdoing. The Crown Prosecution Service could apply to access the records for the purpose of criminal investigations, as can the information commissioner, who has a statutory obligation to protect the public. The individuals affected each have a claim for breach of privacy. The claims must be brought individually and not by class action. But since many of the claims will give rise to the same issues of fact and law, the matters will for convenience be heard as a consolidated claim. Criminal investigations should have been instituted against the private investigators and the journalists and their editors involved for interception and conspiring to intercept under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. This act prohibits intentional and unlawful interception of communications by post or phone or other telecommunications systems. Goodman was jailed for conspiring to intercept the phone messages of royal aides under these provisions. His co-defendant, private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, was also jailed in 2007 for six months for interception. At the time, these were presented as isolated cases. But the evidence emerging today shows systematic use of criminal methods by journalists. Serious questions are raised by the failure of the Metropolitan police to inform the public figures targeted by the phone hacking and the Crown Prosecution Service decision not to prosecute the journalists and editors involved. It appears that the police may well have fallen short of their statutory duty to investigate crimes and wrongdoing.",
