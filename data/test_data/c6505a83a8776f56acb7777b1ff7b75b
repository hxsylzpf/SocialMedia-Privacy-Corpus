  "content": "A fund recently set up by Wall Street bank JP Morgan is reportedly trying to bag stakes in Twitter and Zynga, two of the hottest firms in online social media. JP Morgan is aiming to take a minority stake in Twitter, the microblogging company, which could value the firm at more than $4bn (\u00a32.46bn). It would value the firm, which has yet to make a profit, in line with its last round of funding in December. But the price is far below the $10bn offers Google and Facebook are believed to have discussed. The bank is also believed to be interested in Zynga, the social gaming firm behind FarmVille and CityVille. Zynga is raising $500m in new funds from private investors at a price that is believed to value the firm at $10bn, more than 10 times its estimated 2010 revenues of $850m. The investments will be made from the bank's new $1.2bn digital growth fund, which was disclosed in a regulatory filing earlier this month. The bank is believed to be using the fund to target \"late-stage\" social media firms \u2013 those already established in the market. JP Morgan declined to comment. The potential investments come as some of the top social media firms are preparing to sell shares in initial public offerings. LinkedIn, the business-focused social network, has already filed for an IPO, making it one of the first social networking sites to go public. JP Morgan is underwriting along with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Groupon, the online discount firm, raised $1bn in new funds this year after rejecting a $6bn offer from Google. The firm is now believed to be looking at an IPO that could value it at more than $10bn. Twitter has more than 200m registered users. Research firm eMarketer expects the company to generate $150m in revenue this year, largely from advertising on the site. Last year the firm lost money as it spent heavily on its service and hiring. Zynga is profitable, making money from selling virtual goods to its players. Close to 100m people a month play CityVille, a game in which players manage their own cities online, making the game even more popular than its predecessor FarmVille. The game firm's latest round of funding comes from Silicon Valley investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and Russia's DST Global, a big investor in Facebook. The investment is believed to be a precursor to a float in 2012, when Facebook too is likely to go public. Facebook staff are discussing selling shares at a price that would value the firm at $60bn.",
