  "content": "How, exactly, do things go viral on Twitter? It's a question that thousands of self-styled social media mavens, gurus and ninjas claim to have the answer to, but Twitter itself should be much better placed to explain. The bad news from the company's latest UK blog post: \"There is no single magic formula.\" That's one finding from Twitter's study of three videos that recently went viral on its network: the Ryan Gosling series of \"Won't eat cereal\" videos; astronaut Chris Hadfield's performance of Space Oddity; and Dove's Real Beauty marketing campaign. \"One of the key things we learnt from looking closely at these three is that videos don't go viral in the same way,\" writes Twitter UK's Gordon MacMillan in a blog post based on the work of researchers Jake Steadman and Louise Chow. \"There are no rules to 'virality' \u2014 while some ignite, and spread like wildfire across the web, the growth of others is much more measured, like ripples spreading across a lake.\" The Gosling cereal videos were shot using Twitter's Vine app, and became popular when they were \"carefully seeded with key influencers\" like the Best Vines Ever and Vine Loops accounts on the social network. Meanwhile, Hadfield's space-bound cover of the David Bowie song was a genuine word-of-mouth hit, with more than 90% of its shares on Twitter happening in the three days after he posted his video on YouTube on 12 May. It has since been watched more than 17.2m times. Perhaps most interestingly for brands and their marketing agencies, Dove's Real Beauty Sketches video \u2013 which came with its very own #WeAreBeautiful hashtag \u2013 was a longer-burning viral success on Twitter \"largely driven by a long tail of link-sharing and by positive audience sentiment\" growing through \"clusters of communities spread around the world\". Twitter has published videos showing the way all three videos spread on its network through tweets and retweets. Here's Hadfield's: Naturally, the research's main aim is to promote Twitter to brands and agencies: the blog post's conclusions are that brands should share videos on Twitter, use hashtags, pay for its Promoted Tweets and Promoted Trends ads, and use Vine. The research also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Twitter in the UK, where the subject of trolls \u2013 and rape threats towards female users in particular \u2013 led to a day-long boycott of Twitter by some users, and promises by senior Twitter executives to \"make our rules clearer, simplify our abuse reporting process, and promote the responsible use of Twitter\". Continuing to attract brands with promises of viral success, while protecting and serving the community of 200m people whose presence makes that viral scale possible, is Twitter's key challenge in 2013 and beyond.",
