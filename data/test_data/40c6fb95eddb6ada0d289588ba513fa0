  "content": "The culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, today met the Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to discuss how the social networking site could be used to foster social engagement. Hunt is exploring how the site could inform the government's \"big society\" agenda, encouraging public involvement in more open politics. Hunt tweeted: \"Just met Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook. Really smart guy with some good ideas on improvement [sic] digital culture in policy making.\" Zuckerberg is in Europe to speak at Facebook's European developer conference, and will also speak at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival later this week. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
