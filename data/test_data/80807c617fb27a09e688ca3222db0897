  "content": "Almost 700 people queued in the snow and freezing wind last night outside a warehouse in London's east end to claim their place at Twestival, a global charity event that has become the Live Aid of the tech world. 700 people gathered for London Twestival. Photograph: Jon Cartwright/Flickr/Some rights reserved - used with permission Organisers had hoped to raise more than $1m by holding parties in multiples cities, but had so much demand for new Twestivals that more than 175 parties were organised in just a few weeks. In London - the founding city for the Twestival movement - the audience of twenty and thirty somethings danced, drank and chatted in the cavernous venue but there was also a crafts table for those who wanted to make a small, Twitteresque bird brooch, free burgers and a stall selling small 'Poken' pandas that would 'zap' your contact details to someone else. Co-organiser Tom Malcolm, a PR by day, said they had been amazed by the turnout. \"On Facebook people tend to know someone else before adding them as a friend,\" he said. \"On Twitter you meet people you wouldn't necessarily meet in real life.\" Hundreds more volunteers and sponsors contributed to Twestivals around the world, including DJs, photographers and bar staff. The donations from ticket sales and a prize raffle would be totted up today; that's likely to spark some furious competition as donors register their contributions against their own local Twestival. It's 'act local, think global' in action. And with surprisingly few people actually using Twitter while they were there, the event seemed to disprove the assumption that people use social networks instead of real live communication. Twestival gave Twitter users the chance to meet up with people they have come to know online, like-minded because of their interest in talking and sharing ideas.

Photograph: Jon Cartwright/Flickr/Some rights reserved - used with permission Marketing strategist Katy Lindemann started going to geek events in 2000 when blogging took off, and says these kind of events are now much more acceptable. \"Is Twitter mainstream? It's being mentioned in the Daily Mail, the One Show and on every chat show. It's not Facebook yet, but it's on the way.\" \"I was intrigued to meet everyone. Twitter is very collegial, though I don't know what it will be like as it gets bigger. There's a general spirit of community with people who want to share. I don't know how long that lovely spirit will last but it's great while it does.\" Alex Hoye, chief executive of digital marketing firm Latitude, said the first thing he does each day is check Twitter. \"A huge part of the news, and what I think is interesting, is self selected by those people, and I follow specialist news like financial news too. My fear is that it can only go downhill because it's so good right now.\" So what does happen next for Twitter? The users might move on to something else, but the phenomenon will stay on, says Lindemann. \"It's about sharing and communicating with like-minded people, and meeting new people,\" she said. \"That behaviour won't change. Whether Twitter is the place people carry on doing it, who knows?\" \u2022 Bobbie Johnson at Twestival San Francisco \u2022 Flickr's Twestival photos from around the world \u2022 Tweets about Twestival \u2022 Video coverage on Live Nation \u2022 See more of Jon Cartwright's photographs from the London Twestival in our gallery.
