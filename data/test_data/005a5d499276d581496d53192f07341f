  "content": "Even when something seemingly goes right for BlackBerry in 2013, it swiftly goes wrong. For example, 1.1m people were so keen to get its BBM messaging app for Android that they downloaded a leaked version ahead of its official release on 21 September. The problem being that the app was buggy, generating \"volumes of data traffic orders of magnitude higher than normal for each active user\". Cue network issues, a swiftly-pulled launch, and the admission by BlackBerry's head of BBM Andrew Bocking that the Android and iOS versions of BBM need some more work. \"This will take some time and I do not anticipate launching this week,\" he blogged. BlackBerry may be able to fix those problems and get BBM live for iOS and Android devices, but its real challenge is ensuring people care. BBM still has 60m active users on BlackBerry devices, but it's a fair question to wonder how many of them want to use it, as opposed to have to use it. That's not to deny that BBM has fans, but there's a nagging sense that at its peak, many people in its two key demographic groups used it because they couldn't not use it, rather than because they loved the service. Employees used it because their employer told them to, and teenagers used it because it was THE social network for their peers. BBM was hugely important, but to some extent it was forced upon people \u2013 something that by extension could be said about BlackBerry handsets too. And, of course, it was free \u2013 which is why it caught on with the teens in the first place. But fast forward to 2013, and the reasons why people were forced to use BBM / BlackBerry have fallen away. Bring Your Own Device is increasingly common in workplaces, and teens have discovered a world of free messaging apps on other smartphones. So yes, 60m people still use BBM, but that pales next to the numbers being posted by newer, cross-platform rivals. WhatsApp has 300m active users, and WeChat has 236m. Line, Nimbuzz and KakaoTalk have 200m, 150m and 100m registered users apiece, although how many are active is unknown. BlackBerry has a fellow Canadian firm snapping at BBM's heels in the shape of Kik Messenger, with 80m registered users. And there are apps emerging from other categories like video calling (Tango), VoIP (Skype), social networks (Facebook Messenger) and photo-sharing (Snapchat). BlackBerry's decision to finally launch BBM for other company's devices was a response to this competition, but how does it stay relevant? It comes down to a choice between security or stickers. Enterprise or consumer. Security means doubling down on business users and their messaging needs, while playing up its experience providing secure communications \u2013 a couple of years ago, I would have added \"stable\" to that sentence, but more-recent service outages have dented BlackBerry's reputation on that front. Going the enterprise route would be a more-obvious move for BBM, and one that would fit more neatly with BlackBerry's claim last week that it was refocusing its business on the \"enterprise and prosumer\" market. There may be a sweet spot between companies' desire for secure messaging, and wider concerns among those \"prosumers\" about recent revelations around the cyber-spying activities of bodies like the NSA and GCHQ. Secure messaging is already a category: Silent Circle may have shut down its Silent Mail encrypted email service, but it still offers its Silent Text messaging tool. Recently, startup Wickr made plenty of headlines with the launch of an app promising messages that \"leave no trace\". BBM could try to play in this market too. Another line of development might be to expand BBM into a wider workplace tool taking in collaboration as well as communication, heading off the threat that messaging may become just a feature for those kinds of services. Could BlackBerry go down that route? Certainly. Could it do it well? The jury's out. Plan B: stickers. Double town on the teens and the twentysomethings who used BBM when they were teens. Go head to head with WhatsApp in the West, while learning from what Line, KakaoTalk and WeChat are doing in the East and adapting those lessons to the West better than they do. Another tough task in a world that can be confusing for thirtysomethings, let alone telecoms execs 10 or 20 years older. It's a world of emoticons and virtual stickers, of impermanent photo and video-sharing, games and digital scribbling. It's also a world of fast-evolving business models, from WhatsApp's annual subscriptions to the in-app sticker sales on pretty much all its rivals; the Facebook-esque social gaming platforms emerging from Line and KakaoTalk; and WeChat's exploration of real-world payments. Consumer messaging is an exciting and innovative space, and the numbers of users already signed up to the services above make them look formidable foes. Yet BBM isn't starting from scratch: it has whatever proportion of its 60m active users who are using it for play rather than work. Security or stickers. The first seems a safer choice, but has plenty of pitfalls in store. The second is certainly riskier, but with huge potential if BBM can truly understand the messaging needs of young people, and out-innovate those rivals to keep meeting them. Both paths hold out considerable opportunities. ScotiaBank analyst Gus Papageorgiou recently estimated that BBM could add $5 to BlackBerry's share price by growing its user base from 60m to 250m people, and bringing in $300m a year from in-app advertising \u2013 with a valuation of $2.7bn if BBM was a standalone business. But opportunities are one thing, and successfully seizing them quite another. BlackBerry's first task is to decide which way to jump \u2013 Papageorgiou's sums were seemingly based on it going down the stickers path \u2013 before knuckling down to the task of actually delivering that value.",
