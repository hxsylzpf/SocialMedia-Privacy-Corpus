  "content": "No question, the Press Complaints Commission is history in its current form. David Cameron has called for a review. Even the late News of The World rather belatedly admitted as much this Sunday, saying: \"Self-regulation does work. But the current makeup of the PCC doesn't\". So does the PCC itself, agreeing that the \"outcome of phone hacking should be a more independent PCC\". The Guardian would like to know what readers think. Here are a few questions to get the ideas flowing: Is self-regulation dead? Should broadcast regulator Ofcom take on the job? Should newspapers be licensed? Should a reformed PCC have the power to compel evidence and levy fines? Is it right that Richard Desmond can duck out of the system altogether? Should bloggers be included in PCC-2? Can there be any role for editors in the PCC body? If you want a few more ideas, read this Monday's articles by John Kampfner and Janine Gibson. Above all, though, let us know.",
