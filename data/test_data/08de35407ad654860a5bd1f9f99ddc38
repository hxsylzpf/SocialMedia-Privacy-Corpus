  "content": "Facebook saw its UK user base drop by 1.86% in December, and while it still has over 31 million monthly active British users (around half of our 61.8m population), some have speculated that Facebook has reached its saturation point and will now experience a decline. On SocialBakers index, the UK ranks as the world's sixth most active Facebook user base, but with users' anger over privacy changes and the ever-increasing popularity of Twitter \u2013 which boasts the UK as its fourth largest global user base \u2013 this could change. Do you think Facebook has reached its peak? Will it ever go the same way as MySpace? Are you fed up with the social media site?"
