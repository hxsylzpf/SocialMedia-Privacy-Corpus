  "content": "Manti Te'o's story of losing his grandmother and girlfriend within a few hours of each other has now been pretty much established as a hoax. But whether the Notre Dame football star was victim or perpetrator, the US media was complicit. The list of national media outlets that didn't report, even in passing, that Teo's girlfriend died of leukemia hours after the death of his grandmother, is much shorter than the list of those that did. Since the sports website Deadspin revealed that Teo's girlfriend never existed outside a fake online persona, news organizations have been scrambling to deal with the questions over their own reporting. The Boston Globe, Associated Press and the New York Times and CBS were among the many news outlets that recounted the tragedy-that-wasn't. The surreal tale, coming in the same week that Lance Armstrong was revealing all to Oprah Winfrey about his Tour de France doping conspiracy, has left America's sports pundits wondering whether they can tell truth from fiction. \"We can't believe the record books, because so many great athletic achievements have been accomplished with the help of a steroid-filled syringe. And now we can't even believe a great love story,\" lamented Boston Herald columnist Bryan Burwell. Certainly the romance of Te'o, 21, and \"Lennay Kekua\" had seemed a dream come true for sports scribes. The young linebacker, a devout Mormon of Samoan descent, had an amazing season, driving his team forwards and earning himself a place as one of three finalists for the coveted Heisman Trophy, which is awarded to the best player in college football. He is also expected to be a top pick in the NFL draft, with the possibility of a gigantic pay check. But it was his off-pitch story that truly captured people's hearts. For Te'o was hit by a double tragedy just before a big game as Kekua \u2013 who had already suffered a near fatal car crash, according to reports \u2013 finally succumbed to cancer at the same time as Te'o's grandmother also died. Yet, despite the double tragedy, Te'o went on to play the game of his life as Notre Dame beat Michigan State 20-3. The revelation that, unlike Teo's grandmother, Kekua had never actually lived, let alone died, has stunned a nation and a sporting press that had blithely reported details of their relationship for months on end. Many are now angry at the media. \"Nobody asked: who is she? Where did she live? Not one reporter dug deep. The lack of legwork is a total surprise to me,\" said Frank Shorr, a sports and journalism expert at Boston University. Eileen Murphy, spokeswoman for the New York Times, said Wednesday morning that conversations about how to address the issue were \"ongoing\". \"I mean, sometimes, as reporters you are subject to what you are told by people, and I think everybody is in the same situation here,\" Murphy said. \"So I don't know that we've made a determination yet about how we're going to go back on other stories and correct them.\" The New York Times sports editor, Joe Sexton, expanded on his thinking with public editor Margaret Sullivan in a blogpost. \"I'm not sure the full assortment or exact nature of them have yet become clear,\" Sexton said. \"First, we have to figure out the truth. It's certainly a story that makes that effort a formidable one.\" SB Nation has named 21 institutions that believed Teo's story. Even that is not a comprehensive list: the Elkhart Truth, an Indiana newspaper based less than an hour's drive away from from the Notre Dame campus, reported the claims as true. Rachel Terlep, who has been covering Notre Dame football for two years at the Elkhart Truth, said that journalists, including herself, should have at least made a call to the Stanford admissions office to see if Kekua existed. \"When you think about it retrospectively, why weren't any of us checking this? You think to yourself, why would we? Who's going to say this kid made-up a girlfriend? Is that lazy journalism? Is that irresponsible?\" Terlep said. \"Retrospectively, absolutely.\" She added: \"So when we read that that's not true, that she [Lennay Kekua] never existed, it's like getting your legs cut out from underneath you,\" said Terlep. \"I can't imagine how a fan feels right now, but as a journalist, I feel shocked.\" The South Bend Tribune had published a since-removed story about Teo's girlfriend that described how the two had met. In a statement that is no longer on their site, but was published by Poynter, editor Tim Harmon said: \"If this story was a cruel hoax, as the University of Notre Dame has now indicated, we indeed were taken in, as were many others, including officials of the Notre Dame football program.\" The South Bend Tribune provided one of the most detailed accounts of the false story, as did CBS This Morning. In addition to an online story, CBS ran a three-minute video package about Te'o's tragedy and included photos of a girl they said was his girlfriend. CBS did not respond to email or a call for comment. Sports Illustrated, which ran a cover story on Te'o, did not have a comment and ESPN could not be reached for comment. Columnists who spoke directly with Te'o about his tragedy for previously published stories offered their response to the stories in Thursday columns. Dan Wetzel at Yahoo said: \"I knew nothing about Lennay Kekua. Was she pretty? Smart? Funny? Blonde? Brunette? Did she like football? The only thing I thought I knew was that she had died, and that Manti Te'o, the best linebacker in college football and her boyfriend, had dominated a football game for Notre Dame a couple days later. \"What I didn't know, and what Te'o apparently didn't know, either, is that Lennay Kekua wasn't pretty or smart or funny or blonde or brunette or a football fan or a far-too-young leukemia victim. She didn't exist.\" Greg Couch wrote a column in October 2012 about a letter Te'o allegedly wrote to two parents whose daughter was dying from a brain tumor. Couch posted a response to the news early Thursday morning. \"Every time we put an athlete on too high a pedestal, it burns us,\" said Couch. \"That's what I wrote in October about Manti Te'o, while putting him on a high pedestal.\" As for Notre Dame, it insists that Te'o was in fact the victim of a staggeringly strange conspiracy, and that he believed in the identity of his girlfriend as much as everyone else. The college's athletics director, Jack Swarbrick, broke down in tears at a news conference as he addressed the issue and claimed Te'o had been hoaxed by someone who \"apparently ingratiated herself\" with the player under false circumstances. The person had then convinced Te'o they were in a relationship and spun a yarn about a car crash and a struggle with leukaemia. Swarbrick said Te'o had alerted the college to the problem after getting a phone call in December from a phone number he had associated with Kekua. \"When he answered it, it was a person whose voice sounded like the same person he had talked to, who told him that she was, in fact, not dead. Manti was very unnerved by that, as you might imagine,\" Swarbrick said. He added that the college had used private investigators to then expose what was really happening. In the press conference, Swarbick said that he was standing by Te'o, and likened his experience to the movie \u2013 and now MTV series \u2013 Catfish, in which film-makers discover a woman they have been having an online relationship with is in fact a completely fake identity. \"Nothing about what I have learned has shaken my faith in Manti Te'o one iota,\" Swarbrick said. So far, Te'o himself has only issued a single statement about the story. \"To realize that I was the victim of what was apparently someone's sick joke and constant lies was, and is, painful and humiliating,\" he told ESPN. Perhaps some sort of truth is set to come out soon though. A Twitter account, which appeared to be a re-activated version of the one that Kekua had used and that Te'o had interacted with, has re-appeared. In it the unknown user behind the account promised to release a statement. Whether or not that would clear things up or only add to the confusion, remains to be seen."
