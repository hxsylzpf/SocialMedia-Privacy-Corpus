  "content": "In his book Exposed! Gerry Brown, the veteran journalist and master of the tabloid sting, describes a new genre which he calls tabloid techno. \"Sort of halfway between papers and tabloid telly,\" he says. \"I've got a range of miniature tape recorders, radio microphones and micro video recorders that mean whenever I do an investigation it gets secretly recorded every which way. \"The gear is ready to be used again - surveillance vehicles, radios, cameras - next time I get a tip off about somebody who deserves the tabloid treatment. Don't complain to me about invasion of privacy. If it's in the public interest, I prefer to call it invasion of secrecy.\" Brown still works for the tabloids, amassing hours of video and audio material. His notable stings include those involving Lord Archer and Monica Coghlan and the Frank Bough sex and drugs scandal. Without the technology, there could be no story. Radio scanners are used by many journalists and they enable them to listen to both sides of a conversation before the signal fades. Even more powerful is a device called a Celltracker - which is a hybrid of a laptop computer and modified mobile phone. It allows the computer to lock on to the signal when the target's mobile number is punched in. The cost: more than \u00a310,000. \"There is so much now available,\" Brown says in defence of the technology which he uses. \"But we would be criticised if we didn't use it. In a drugs investigation, we couldn't go to court without it. I hate going to court with just an audio recording - I have had people saying: 'It sounds like my voice on the tape, but it is not me'. In a libel case, if you produce a faded notebook in court they are going to ask why you didn't tape it.\" However, the technology has one unexpected downside - people are much more conscious of being secretly filmed or taped. \"Unfortunately, nowadays people like to boast about hidden video cameras - it is making people very aware,\" he says. \"The gear is much more reliable, but it won't get much smaller. The technology is still expensive, but it is worth it.\" It was technology which provided the conclusive evidence in the notorious Sophie Wessex fake sheikh sting last year. She and her public relations business partner accepted an invitation to meet an Arab sheikh at the Dorchester Hotel in London. They didn't realise one of sheikh's assistants was the News of the World's investigations editor Mazher Mahmood, who was wired with tiny microphones and video cameras. Because she was captured on video, it put an end to any squabbling about what had actually been said. \"Without naming names, the threat of libel actions and angry solicitors letters disappear once they are aware of video recording,\" says Brown. Former reporter Yvonne Ridley has worked for the Mirror, News of the World, Sunday Express, Sunday Times and Observer. \"In the end, the equipment would become part of me rather than just a tape machine in my handbag,\" she says. \"My clothes would be adjusted so I would be able to carry around this equipment without being detected.\" But the days of the tabloid sting may be numbered. A ruling by the press complaints commission in April 2001, Found the News of the World to have breached the editors' code of conduct by covertly filming a private party given for the cast of the television series Emmerdale - even though the journalists left when spotted and no story was ever published.",
