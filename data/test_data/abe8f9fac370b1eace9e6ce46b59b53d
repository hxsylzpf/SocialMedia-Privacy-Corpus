  "content": "Kim Kardashian West has revealed that she never allows her Instagram account to be made part of promotional brand deals \u2013 and why she owes her husband Kanye West for pushing her to break into the world of video games. The reality TV star said that her single biggest social media bugbear is those celebrities who over-promote products on Instagram. \"Every deal I do I never include my Instagram,\" she said, speaking at the Cannes Lions festival. \"I've been really strict about that. My Instagram is off limits. It is my personal world. I know a lot of my brands get frustrated that I don't promote as much as they would like. I love just posting when something is really authentic. I can smell a mile away when something is not authentic. I'm really choosy. I don't follow a lot of people and I have unfollowed people who have promoted too much. I just don't like it when people hold up similar products and post everyday about something different\". Kardashian West quipped that some thought she posts \"too many bikini selfies\" on her Instagram feed \"but that's what I want\". She admitted that in the past she \"overkilled\" on endorsement deals and rethought the Kardashian West brand following the birth of her first child. \"A couple of years ago I probably was more inclined to work with brands that didn't make as much sense,\" she said. \"I used to do so many things that I was into at the time but maybe didn't make sense for my brand. I think it was overkill. I'm glad that I was put in a position where I just wanted to take time off and figure out what my brand was.\" In Cannes to promote her successful mobile app game, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, said that it was her husband Kanye West's love of video games that inspired her to make the deal to launch the product a year ago. \"Kanye really talked me into doing this partnership,\" she said. \"He always wanted to do video games, music for video games, so he thought it was the coolest idea to have a video game with a character of myself ... as long as I had control. I thank Kanye every day for making me do this deal.\" The game, which she says allows players to \"make it in Hollywood, get to the A-list, get as many fans, followers and cool wardrobe as possible\", cleverly follows Kardashian West's real life. The game has proved extremely popular with more than 22m downloads of the app, and an average playing time of 26 minutes per day. One of her sister's argued on family reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians that she should be paid for involvement in the game. \"I take it extremely seriously,\" she said. \"It is a full time job. We put in the time and that is what pays off.\" She also said that she is getting into Twitter, but despite the heavy demands of her lifestyle she refuses to get a team to post on social media on her behalf. \"I found I'm really into Twitter right now,\" she said. \"I go through modes. Especially when you travel a lot and are jet lagged late at night. When I'm travelling and I can't sleep all I do is look at Twitter. I love interaction on social media. I don't have a strategy, I don't have a team doing it for me. Not knocking anyone else who does that [but] I don't find that to be authentic. When you are talking about personal things, sharing personal photos and things and having someone do that for you.\"",
