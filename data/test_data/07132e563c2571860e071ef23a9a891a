  "content": "In his blog yesterday, David Drummond, corporate development and chief legal officer at Google, introduced a tool that names the countries where governments and their agencies have requested Google to remove content or data from its servers. The tool is still in its early stages, and Drummond has clarified that the statistics aren't definitive and don't provide an accurate picture: a single request may include multiple sites, or contain information about several users. He also notes that many of the requests are legitimate \u2013 such as removing child pornography \u2013 and some requests are made for criminal investigations. Google's approach to the internet, freedom and privacy came into sharp focus when it decided to operate in China because the company had proclaimed that it would do no evil. Among internet users, censorship is as close as you can get to evil. In testimony at the US Congress in 2006, Google had noted it was sailing in uncharted waters when it agreed to operate under Chinese censorship rules. Early this year, the company announced a new approach to China. It decided to stop censoring searches in China and moved its operations to Hong Kong, because it said computers based in China had been attacking Google's architecture, penetrating its security. Among those whose identities the attackers were after were Chinese human rights dissidents. Within days, the US Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton, stated: \"Some countries have erected electronic barriers that prevent their people from accessing portions of the world's networks. They've expunged words, names, and phrases from search engine results. They have violated the privacy of citizens who engage in nonviolent political speech. These actions contravene the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which tells us that all people have the right 'to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers'. With the spread of these restrictive practices, a new information curtain is descending across much of the world. And beyond this partition, viral videos and blog posts are becoming the samizdat of our day.\" She called upon companies to build trust with their consumers, so that people can believe, \"no matter where you live \u2026. that what they put into the internet is not going to be used against them\". Many critics of Google's move asked at that time if Google was not being hypocritical in singling out China. What about requests for censorship from other countries? Google has now made some statistics available. By doing it, Google has raised the game to another level \u2013 for itself, for the industry and for governments. Google is trying to ensure it cannot be accused of inconsistency \u2013 grandstanding with China while acquiescing with others. Its bold move should also compel other companies to become more transparent. And it should force governments to rethink their approach to the internet and personal freedoms. Google alone cannot, and should not, bear this burden. It is a company, not a human rights organisation. Nor is it a state. Many companies have chosen the easier option of complying with government requests and said they are merely following orders. That's not good enough, as Yahoo knows. Shi Tao, a Chinese journalist, had used his Yahoo account to reveal a Chinese government circular about steps the Chinese media should take to underplay dissident activities around the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre. The Chinese Government wanted to know his identity; Yahoo provided the details. Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. At the US Congress in 2007, Yahoo!'s CEO, Jerry Yang, dramatically apologised to Shi Tao's mother and said his company would do all it could to secure her son's release. As the literature on complicity in human rights abuses shows, assisting a crime, or knowing that a human rights abuse is going to be committed and yet aiding or abetting a particular action, raises the risk of complicity for business entities. \"I was only following orders\" was a defence rejected at the Nuremberg Tribunal after the second world war; since then jurisprudence has grown, strengthening that view. Google is exploring ways to avoid being complicit, which deserves to be commended. Its move should make governments rethink their policies. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\" To be sure, there are some restrictions placed on the right, but in general it is an empowering, enabling right expanding individual freedoms. Furthermore, Article 12 states: \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home, or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.\" But government approaches vary. The US has the first amendment, which prevents the government from making any law that restricts freedom of speech; Scandinavian countries also have liberal free speech rules. But then there is a downward slide, with Myanmar, China, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, and many others, at the other extreme. In between are countries which are outwardly democratic, but which place some restrictions on freedoms \u2013 including Brazil and India in the developing world, Germany, France and the United Kingdom itself in rich countries. Companies such as Google are caught between their claim that they want to uphold the Universal Declaration on one hand and the demands governments make to take down certain content, or provide information about specific users. Companies in the information technology sector have come together to create the Global Network Initiative to deal with the complexity. But freedom of expression is too important to be left in the hands of businesses alone. As the Google example shows, all companies don't share an understanding on transparency. Truly global solutions and frameworks are needed which expand individual freedom, restrict state powers and provide certainty to businesses so that human rights abuses are reduced.",
