  "content": "With an election looming, charities are under pressure from politicians and the media to be more transparent \u2013 which means, in today's digital world, that charity chief executives need to cultivate their social media profiles. Our awards for the top 30 charity chief executives on social media seek to recognise pioneers in this area, and identify those using digital strategically as part of their modus operandi. The results were announced on Thursday evening. Comparing this year's top 30 to last year's reveals that there has been a significant shift in charities' relationship with digital. Previously, chief executives have used social media for profile raising, promoting their charities and networking \u2013 all very valuable skills. Yet the 2014 winners have raised the bar further by demonstrating a deep engagement with social media in achieving their goals. Here are six things we can all learn from their approach. 1. Tackling sensitive issues Following Max Clifford's conviction, Peter Wanless of the NSPCC was unafraid to say what the verdict could mean for those who sexually abuse children. Peter says: \"Discussion can be robust, we let our feelings show, but there is no substitute for debate and providing people are social, I will always be social back.\" Similarly Cathy Ashley of Family Rights Group uses Twitter to bring together lawyers, social workers, and family members to discuss child protection and family courts issues. 2. Giving beneficiaries a voice A patient living with bowel cancer nominated Deborah Alsina, CEO of Bowel Cancer UK, for organising tweet ups, involving their community in policy making and seeking their feedback. She is a great example of using social media to draw upon the knowledge and experience of those closest to the cause. 3. Leading from the front Truly social chief executives encourage their staff to use these tools themselves, as they know it will increase their charity's reach and strengthen its brand. Julie Devonshire, director of ventures at UnLtd told us that Cliff Prior, her CEO, 'encourages us to tell the stories of social entrepreneurs, their aspirations, successes, motivations... clearly these are best told with the assistance of social media.' 4. Using the best platform to get the job done Vicky Browning, director of Charity Comms, knows that LinkedIn is a good way to reach members who need advice. If one of the charities she works with needs to crowdsource some help or information for an issue they're having - she will post on a relevant Linkedin group with their request, so that the charity can remain anonymous. 5. They aren't scared to challenge trolls Polly Neate, head of Women's Aid, impressed the judges by handling trolls calmly and deftly. She says: 'I don't believe \"don't feed the trolls\" is a good way to deal with it, because that can end up silencing people. I won't be silenced, but I don't reply directly to trolls and I never block anyone. I tend to ignore stuff that is just accusatory or aggressive. I only respond if they are putting out false information - if someone makes a damaging factual error I'll challenge it. But I won't tweet the response directly to them. That way other people don't see unchallenged wrong information but I don't get bogged down in direct conversations with the trolls.' 6. They're supportive One patient's daughter nominated Mark Flannagan, head of Beating Bowel Cancer, praising him for responding to her request for help on Twitter which was swiftly followed up by a direct message from one of his nurses. She also commended him for his kind words, consoling responses and use of humour when appropriate in supporting patients who shared their journey with him on social media. Social media is now central to the skillset of chief executives. In the current climate, charities have never needed to be more visible, more open and vocal about the needs of the people who they help.
