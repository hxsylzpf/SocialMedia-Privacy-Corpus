  "content": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team UK ISPs secretly start blocking torrent site proxies &gt;&gt; TorrentFreak Several UK Internet providers have quietly added a list of new sites to their secretive anti-piracy blocklists. Following in the footsteps of Sky, the first ISP to initiate a proxy blockade, Virgin, BT and several other providers now restrict access to several torrent site proxies. The surprise isn't really that proxies have been added to the blocklist, but that the music industry and ISPs are failing to disclose which sites are being banned. Following High Court orders, six UK ISPs are required to block subscriber access to several of the world's largest torrent sites. The blocking orders are intended to deter online piracy and were requested by the music industry group BPI on behalf of a variety of major labels. The order also means that new proxies that appear can also be silently blocked. It's an arms race. (Thanks @LazioLazio for the pointer.) iOS 7 &gt;&gt; Matt Gemmell Whilst much of the rest of the industry has moved to a less embellished UI style (admittedly partly just for differentiation's sake), iOS remained firmly rooted in the practice of clearly delineating sections of each screen, using pseudo-3D visual effects like gloss and shadows, and mimicking physical affordances. The thing is, we've grown up. We don't require hand-holding to tell us what to click or tap. Interactivity is a matter of invitation, and physical cues are only one specific type. Thoughtful post. Why I (almost) never use my Surface RT &gt;&gt; CITEworld Nancy Gohring: I'm looking forward to the release of Windows 8.1 in hopes that it will contain some performance upgrades that will make me reach for my Surface RT more often. I have a Surface RT and a Windows 8 laptop and I more often reach for my laptop \u2013 even though it's bulkier \u2013 than the Surface RT. That because Windows RT, at least as executed on my Surface, fails at one of the central reasons for its existence \u2013 speed. My biggest beef with the tablet is how slow it is to start up and to launch programs. It's gotten noticeably slower since I got the tablet, right around the time it first went on sale. It's slow enough to start up that I'd rather dig out my laptop than use the Surface, which is typically closer by. Before you ask, she's tried a wipe-and-reinstall. Big data has to show that it's not like Big Brother &gt;&gt; FT.com John Gapper: One of the concerns that springs from this is that big data companies with such software are very difficult to compete with. The more data that I and other users provide them with, the better they are at predicting what we want. The machine brain becomes cleverer with use. Another is trust. Social networks have been poor at protecting users' data, and they hold only a fraction of the information on people's behaviour, habits and intentions on the new generation of services. It is no wonder that the NSA turns to them \u2013 it has computing power and they have swaths of material. A third is ownership. We each have rights over our own information, but what happens when it gets mixed up with that of others and combined into a vast database of intentions? If I change my mind, how can it be unscrambled? (Subscription required.) All sizes | iOS 6 iOS 7 Full Comparison &gt;&gt; Flickr Matt Gemmell puts all the apps that have new faces side by side. It's quite a difference. Google Glass teardown &gt;&gt; Catwig Scott Torborg and Star Simpson: Growing up on a rich diet of dystopian tech fiction, we were filled with both intrigue and concern about Glass and decided to take our model apart to bring you a detailed view into the electronics guts of the device. Also contains a typically prescient quote from Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash. Wall Street is obsessed with Snapchat &gt;&gt; Daily Intelligencer Snapchat, which now transmits roughly 150 million shared photos a day, isn't totally safe for Wall Street workers. Screenshots of snaps can still be captured and a public leaderboard can give hints about a user's activity. One Wall Street executive said that while his firm didn't have a specific Snapchat policy for employees, Snapchat use would be covered under the firm's general social media policy, which prohibits inappropriate use or disclosure of privileged information. But compliance officers can only track what they can see. And though Snapchat may never be truly safe, it's safer than most of the other messaging apps out there - which means that its use as a haven for incriminating Wall Street photos looks poised to grow. Perhaps should be a top priority for BlackBerry if it wants to regain its position there. (There's an Android port, but not native.) The story of how temperature and humidity sensors made it into the Samsung Galaxy S4 &gt;&gt; OpenSignal James Robinson: Since we're big fans of sensors at OpenSignal, we were rooting for someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 to put that chip in a phone, but would never have guessed that it would first appear in the S4 \u2013 Samsung's flagship phone. The technology seemed too new &amp; geeky to see first light in such a mainstream device. Last week I got some of the backstory on how this came about from Sensirion, the Switzerland based company that produces the very same SHTC1 chip in the S4. It's a fascinating tale that reveals a lot about the relationship between Google and device manufacturers. To me, it illustrates why Android is such a brilliant platform for encouraging innovation. It's chickens, eggs and forks. And allows crowdsourcing of weather conditions.
