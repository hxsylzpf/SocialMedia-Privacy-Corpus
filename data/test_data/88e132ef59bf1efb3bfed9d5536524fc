  "content": "The BBC canteen has long been the butt of jokes from corporation employees. Now The Filling Station has taken its, er, unique reputation online with a new parody account, dubbed The Killing Station. The Independent reports that the Twitter account is remarkably well-informed and suggests it is run by a journalist with intimate knowledge of the canteen and its clientele. Some of the BBC's best-known faces, including Robert \"Bobby\" Peston and John Simpson, are the subject of quippy missives from the Twitter account. An example of one @KillingStation tweet goes: \"Just seen Huw Edwards getting curry and rice from @KillingStation \u2013 don't be surprised if he doesn't manage to present News at Ten.\" Just who could be behind the mystery account?"
