  "content": "Almost four years ago, I wrote a piece for this column about public service bloggers. They were, I opined, changing our perceptions of the NHS, or local government, or the police, or social work. They brought insider knowledge and credibility. They were able to measure the difference between ministerial policy utterances and frontline reality far more sensitively than most journalists. At their best, they were able to articulate the experiences, moods and rhythms of frontline life, and its frustrations and satisfactions, in ways the mainstream media could rarely achieve. Bloggers, I believed, were rewriting the media script: the mainstream press would feel inauthentic by comparison; bloggers would become influential, and would, by virtue of their powerful truth-telling, influence policy and force institutions, from Whitehall to the town hall, to become more open and accountable. \"It is bloggers\u2026 and not politicians, PR managers or the traditional media, who are beginning to tell the real inside story of public services,\" I wrote. Was I right? No. In my piece I mentioned Reynolds, the ambulance technician who wrote Random Acts of Reality (now retired). Others have come to the fore: Winston Smith, who won the Orwell prize in 2010 for his Working with the Underclass blog about working with teenagers in supported housing; or Fighting Monsters (\"The life and thoughts of a British social worker\"), and many others. These are all valuable pieces of reportage, a kind of 21st century mass observation archive, giving real insights into the life and work of public sector workers. But I was naive to believe that they would become influential, as opposed to simply admired. I was too much the writer and editor myself: I trusted too much in the power of pure literary accomplishment. It was lawyers who brought to light the scandalous political shenanigans behind the Baby P fiasco; it was old-fashioned patient activism (with the help of the traditional media) that forced the failings at Mid-Staffordshire NHS trust hospitals out into the open; it was much-derided district auditors who held to account the wretched incompetency of Doncaster council. Most naively, I believed bloggers would shift the media balance of power. National media is in some ways even more remote and out of touch than it was four years ago, but \"fear of the Daily Mail\" is as big a factor in policy as it ever was. Once, the rightwing press vilified and stereotyped social workers; now all public sector workers are fair game: with their \"gold-plated pensions\" and \"non-jobs\" they are routinely presented as lazy, parasitical and inefficient. The government, with breathtaking cynicism and dishonesty, is more than happy to collude in these crude portrayals. Am I disheartened? No. Social media is growing stronger. In the \"age of austerity\", interactive \"crowdsourcing\" websites like voluntarysectorcuts.org.uk and falseeconomy.org.uk bring fine detail to big number budget cuts. The Broken of Britain site gives a powerful voice to disabled people facing benefit cuts. Twitter's ability to break and share news, and question \"the official version\" of the cuts is only beginning to be felt. There is huge potential for social media to audit public data and hold institutions to account. And I haven't lost faith in literary excellence. For the past few months, a blogger by the name of Redundant Public Servant has with immense grace, style and sensitivity described the \"half-life\" of a public servant working through his last months of notice after 20 years. Read it as an powerful antidote to media stereotypes. That blog is now coming to an end: Redundant Public Servant has got his P45. He's also, after multiple failed interviews, got a new job. And that, in these grim times, I'm taking as a good omen for us all."
