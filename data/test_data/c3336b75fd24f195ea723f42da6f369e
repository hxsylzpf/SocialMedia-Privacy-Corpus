  "content": "Facebook usually get what they want. Right now they're chasing dominance in the video marketplace. In 2012, marketers didn't even consider alternative options for sharing videos on Facebook. The standard process was to create a video, upload it to YouTube and simply publish it via Facebook. Now, Facebook have developed their video offer to appeal to the modern day social media user. In the past year alone their videos reached a billion views per day. Take the recent John Lewis ad, #MontyThePengiun, after 24 hours of sharing its latest Christmas campaign it'd been shared 202,953 times across Facebook, according to data from Unruly. At the same point last year, their ad \"Bear and the Hare\" had 198,244 shares. It may not seem like a huge change, but John Lewis didn't upload the ad directly to Facebook; they shared the YouTube link. Although YouTube may have dominated in terms of views, 4.1m v 2.8m, it means 40% of John Lewis's views are on Facebook. Last year there were zero. This time, Facebook is dominating in social-media shares. Within the first 24 hours the Facebook video had been shared 156,063 times, compared to the YouTube upload's 46,890. And for advertisers, sharing can be considered just as important as viewing. Social Bakers, who recently analysed 180,000 Facebook video posts from 20,000 Facebook pages, also revealed a steep rise in the number of marketing videos being uploaded directly to Facebook. At the start of 2014, YouTube clearly had the lead in regards to the share of video posts, nearly double. However, as the year progressed Facebook saw an increase of 50% from May through to July, and is now on trend to surpass YouTube by the end of the year. When it comes to engagement around videos on Facebook (measured by the number of people who clicked anywhere in a post) they're a long way ahead, and have been for a while. The edge on engagement is what's spurring creators to shift their distribution emphasis from YouTube to native Facebook videos, says Jan Rezab chief executive of Social Bakers: \"It's much easier to like, comment and interact\" on the native Facebook videos, he says. On the other hand, analytics site ComScore's Gian Fulgoni noted that Facebook's auto-play function does not reflect the same engagement represented by YouTube, where a video view is user-initiated. \"While there's reach advantage for auto-play, there's an issue as to whether you're getting good engagement. You're getting good engagement from user-initiated (video on YouTube) by definition.\" Either way you look at it, it was only a year ago Facebook began testing their auto-play function &amp; Comscore estimate they've delivered around a billion more desktop views than YouTube Of course, YouTube allows us to gain revenue from our videos, Google taking 45% of ad revenue and partners gaining 55%. Whereas, Facebook takes 100% of revenue from videos and promoters and advertisers get zero. Let's hope this'll change soon with Facebook's $400-500m acquisition of video ad-tech firm LiveRail. Most promoters and sellers may argue that YouTube still remains the strongest and most tactical platform to drive these views (both on YouTube as through social sharing). Facebook's regional director of UK &amp; Ireland, Steve Thomas Hatch admits: \"Right now, if you're thinking digital video, you're thinking YouTube. But the perception and reality [of consumer usage] are really far apart. Facebook is right at the heart of video.\" Although it's debatable whether Facebook will surpass Youtube across desktop and mobile combined, should they introduce a robust search functionality it could change everything. At the moment Facebook's short life span of a video is a major issue, but they're not going down without a fight - especially, as video content continues to grow stronger among consumers. So watch out YouTube, there's a new video platform in town.
