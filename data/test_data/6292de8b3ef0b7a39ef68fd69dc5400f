  "content": "Celebrity PR man Max Clifford, the go-to man for those with kiss-and-tell tales, believes that only 20% of the stories he has placed in his 30-year career would qualify for publication on the grounds of public interest. Clifford \u2013 who has made millions looking after clients as varied as Frank Sinatra, Freddie Starr, Jade Goody, Rebecca Loos and Kerry Katona \u2013 argued that there needs to be a clear \"halfway house\" between protecting privacy and freedom of speech, and newspapers should be forced to justify publishing stories about people's personal lives. \"I've got to be honest and say I've probably broken more stories than anyone in Britain in the last 25 or 30 years, although I've stopped a lot more than I've broken,\" he said, speaking in an interview on BBC Radio 4's The Media Show on Wednesday. \"But probably [only] 20% of the stories I've broken you could justify on the grounds of public interest, a real public interest, that's all.\" Clifford expressed his displeasure over the treatment of his client Imogen Thomas, the former Miss Wales and Big Brother contestant, who has turned to the courts to try and overturn an injunction obtained by a married Premier League footballer to cover up their alleged affair. He was asked by the presenter of Radio 4's The Media Show, Steve Hewlett, if the use of injunctions and superinjunctions was killing the classic kiss-and-tell story. \"Certainly at the moment it is but I think obviously the answer I'm hoping will come about will be a halfway house whereby you [newspapers] know you have to justify public interest in order to print a story,\" he said. \"So in other words if someone is having an affair with a cabinet minister ... and all kinds of secrets have been passed on to that person which shouldn't be passed on then of course it's a matter of public interest. But if it's a straightforward 'footballer is doing this' then I think there is no public interest in this at all other than circulation.\" The culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, speaking at Google's Big Tent event in London on Wednesday, said that digital media has made an \"ass of the law\" and created an \"unsustainable situation\". Last week a Twitter user published the names of some of those alleged to have obtained gagging orders against the media. \"Technology has made a bit of an ass of the law, we have this very unfortunate and unsustainable situation where newspapers are not able to print things that are freely available on internet,\" Hunt said. \"We have to remember that internet has been huge force for freedom before going in with big ambitions to clamp down on this part of the net.\" Hunt said the way the law has been interpreted by judges is \"inconsistent with what parliament decided when we implemented the Human Rights Act\". \"In some cases that's not been reflected in decisions courts have made,\" he added. \"Law has not caught up with changes in technology and we need to have big think about how we take things forward.\" Hunt is soon to meet with justice secretary, Ken Clarke, to discuss what steps can be taken, although he has previously reacted cautiously to those who have called for the introduction of a privacy law. On Tuesday, Clarke told the Commons he would consider introducing privacy legislation, saying it could help judges decide when granting a gagging order was appropriate. However, Clarke cautioned that the difficulty of deciding in individual cases where freedom of speech justifies publication means there will never be a simple, legal solution. He also said that introducing a new privacy law would be a \"long controversial process\" and that it may be preferable to \"find some other way of tackling\" the issue. Last week Max Mosley, the former Formula One boss, lost his legal challenge to force newspapers to warn people before publishing stories exposing their private lives, after a European court ruled that such as system would have a \"chilling effect\" on the press. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
