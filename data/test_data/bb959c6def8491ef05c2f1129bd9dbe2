  "content": "The best thing about top 100 lists is the argument that inevitably ensues after publication - unless you're talking about those late-night Channel 4 list shows with increasingly desperate subjects. What are they on now - the top 100 numbers between 1 and 100? Time's Top 100 is particularly ambitious, attempting, as it does, to list the 100 most influential people in the world. Out of 100 entries, this is who made the grade from the tech world: Sam and Dan Houser The British video game designers behind Grand Theft Auto have their praises sung by Simpsons executive producer Matt Selmen. \"What makes the Housers' creation unparalleled is that their games have a take on American cultural history... The Housers are doing the work of Tom Wolfe, creating tapestries of modern times as detailed as those of Balzac or Dickens. At least, I assume that's true. Instead of reading those guys, I've been in Liberty City stealing tanks.\" The Twitter Guys Written by Ashton Kutcher (Mr Demi Moore and first Twitterer to reach 1m followers) it's amusingly reverent, with Kutcher describing how Twitter will retrospectively be recognised as being \"as significant and paradigm-shifting as the invention of Morse code, the telephone, radio, television or the personal computer\". The word revolution, he tells us, is written with 140 characters... Jeff Bezos Bill Gates says the Amazon creator is an \"insatiable pioneer\" and that the ebook reader, the Kindle, might turn out to be his biggest legacy. \"This electronic book is Jeff's brainchild and may well revolutionise not only how we acquire books and periodicals but also how bookworms like me actually read them. That would put him in the same ranks as Johannes Gutenberg.\" Moot. Photograph: fimoculous/Flickr/Some rights reserved moot Time managed to extract Rick 'Rickroll' Astley from the woodwork to profile the creator of the 4chan messageboard and the overall winner of Time's online Top 100 poll. \"Back in the '80s, I was known for being reclusive, often shying away from media attention. It's perhaps ironic that the internet phenomenon of Rickrolling should bring my video for \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" to a new generation. But that's one of the great things about the Internet.\" Nate Silver Nate Silver is a master and interpreting and analysing data. Baseball statistician Bill James says that \"in a world choking on retreaded arguments long worn bald of the facts, this type of analysis has proved to be stunningly - and reassuringly - popular\". Nandan Nilekani The Infosys co-founder and co-chairman has become a corporate icon and India's brand ambassador, says Slumdog Millionaire author Vikas Swarup. \"As the new India, fueled by its robust democracy and favorable demographics, seeks to make the transition from a developing nation to a developed one, it will need the vision and talent of people like Nandan Nilekani.\" Jack Ma \"There were three reasons why we survived,\" the Alibaba creator and Chinese internet entrepreneur once said. \"We had no money, we had no technology, and we had no plan.\" What's the key to his success? Flexibility, says Time Warner executive editor Adi Ignatius. Robin Chase Craig 'Craigslist' Newmark says the Zipcar founder has tapped one of the fundamental goodnesses of the internet - community sharing. \" not well-intentioned yet futile do-goodism but business that's also a community service. It's about people using the Internet to work together in the service of one another. I hear a guy got elected President as part of this movement.\" Shai Agassi Investor Alan Salzman says over the course of a 3.5-hour meeting he turned from scepticism to being convinced of Agassi's plans to replace petrol stations with a national infrastructure for battery recharging. \"Agassi is the closest we've seen to a Steve Jobs of clean tech - visionary, technologist, businessman. What's it like working with him? Exhilarating, exhausting, challenging, gratifying. He recently turned 41. Wonder what he'll do after transporting us to a better place?\""
