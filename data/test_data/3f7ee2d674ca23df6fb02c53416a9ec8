  "content": "The fashion for all things Twitter may finally have reached its zenith. The Daily Telegraph reports that police in the West Midlands have been criticised for wasting time and manpower setting up a Twitter page for their labrador. The two-year-old pup, Smithy, has attracted \"just\" 115 followers. Smithy tweets several times a day with \"occasional links to crime stories in the West Midlands\" and has \"even had a special keyboard made\"."
