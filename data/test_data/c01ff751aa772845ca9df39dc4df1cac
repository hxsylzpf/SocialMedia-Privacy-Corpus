  "content": "New guidance is expected to be issued to the police on how long they could retain details of sex offences and unproven sexual allegations, the regulator in charge of overseeing the Data Protection Act (DPA) said today. The information commissioner Richard Thomas said it was \"more than likely\" that \"sharper guidance\" would be issued on the handling of sexual allegations and offences in light of the vetting failures by Humberside and Cambridge police that allowed Soham murderer Ian Huntley to get a job as a school caretaker despite previously facing allegations of underage sex with schoolgirls. Giving evidence at the inquiry into why police intelligence and vetting procedures failed to identify the risk Huntley posed to young girls, Mr Thomas said: \"Looking for the future, I would imagine it is more than likely there will be, as a result of this inquiry, much sharper guidance given in the area of sexual offences. \"My philosophy is to do as much as we can to bring data protection down to earth, to a more practical level. We have to work very hard to dispel many of the myths about data protection and get the right message across.\" The commissioner said it would be up to the police forces to make suggestions on how long it would be appropriate for them to retain information about sexual offences and allegations. Mr Thomas rejected the \"false impressions\" and \"misconceptions\" that the DPA was to blame for the \"weeding out\" of police intelligence on Huntley's past. He welcomed the admission by the chief constable of Humberside police, David Westwood, that it was wrong to blame the DPA for his force's deletion of this information. \"I will not disguise from you the sense of relief that it was accepted in this particular case by the chief constable of Humberside, despite what he had said at the time of the trial, of the verdict in the trial, he now fully accepts that neither the legislation nor my office were in any way responsible for the deletion of these critical records. It is very important to get that message across, that data protection was not responsible for this case,\" said Mr Thomas. The commissioner said that comments by Mr Westwood and the Association of Chief Police Officers had been \"very damaging\" and undermined public confidence in the DPA. \"There are no victories in this area of course, but I do find it extremely relieving that it is not suggested now that data protection was responsible for the deletion of these records,\" said Mr Thomas. Earlier today the inquiry, chaired by Sir Michael Bichard, heard that Mr Westwood was twice warned not to blame the DPA for the deletion of records on Huntley. Both the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on sexual offences, chief constable Terry Grange, and the assistant information commissioner, David Smith, had discussed the issue with Mr Westwood just two weeks before he said his force believed it was required to delete the records in order to comply with the DPA. In his evidence to the inquiry earlier this month, Mr Westwood admitted he was wrong to blame the act and had misinterpreted guidance on following it. The inquiry continues.",
