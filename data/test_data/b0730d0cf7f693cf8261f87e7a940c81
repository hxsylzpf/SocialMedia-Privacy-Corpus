  "content": "Highly explicit front covers of \"lads' mags\" may be a thing of the past, Tesco said on Friday, after the country's biggest retailer responded to pressure from campaigners and customers and demanded action from publishers of the controversial magazines. Zoo, Nuts and Front have agreed to make their covers \"more modest\", the retailer said \u2013 meaning no more nudity, with less salacious coverlines and a more conservative feel. The move follows an energetic social media campaign to have the magazines removed from the shelves, and comes days after the Co-op said it would stop selling explicit lads' mags unless they were supplied in \"modesty bags\" to screen their content. The new code on more modest images will apply only to the covers of the magazines rather than their full content, and campaigners dismissed the move as \"a half-measure that doesn't address the harm of these publications\". Kat Banyard, founder of UK Feminista, one of two groups behind the Lose the Lad Mags campaign, said that lobbying to have the titles removed from shelves altogether would continue, \"because they are deeply harmful. They fuel sexist behaviours which underpin violence against women.\" She added: \"By continuing to profit from the content of lads' mags, Tesco is still sending out the message that it's acceptable to portray women in this way.\" The decision from publishers to tone down their titles demonstrates the purchasing power of the retail giant, and comes after a decade in which such magazines have become increasingly explicit, featuring nudity and highly sexualised imagery. Tesco said it was acting \"on behalf of the industry\" in calling for the curbs. \"We've had in-depth conversations with our customers about this issue, and we're putting new measures in place based on what they have told us they want. We've listened carefully to the concerns raised by the campaign groups, but our priority is to make sure we meet our customers' needs and expectations.\" In addition to demanding toned-down covers, the store said Nuts, Zoo, Front and Bizarre would now be sold only to customers over 18, \"to reassure parents who do not want their children to be able to purchase these titles\", and the magazines will be displayed at the back of sales racks, where their covers will be obscured by other magazines. Banyard said that by age-restricting some titles, Tesco was breaching its own guidelines, which state it will not stock adult magazines. She and other campaigners met the retailer after lobbying shareholders at its AGM. Tesco's response follows a letter to the Guardian from a group of lawyers specialising in anti-discrimination and equality legislation, arguing that by continuing to stock titles with \"pornographic front covers\" it risked breaching the Equality Act. A spokesman for Bauer Media Group, publishers of Zoo, said it had \"addressed the cover by toning down the look and feel, whereby models are now in lingerie or bikinis only, there are non-salacious cover lines and more non-girl editorial\". Calling itself \"a responsible publisher [that] supports the existing best practice guidelines\", the spokesman said: \"We are sensitive to the mood of the public; to that end we have responded accordingly and have changed Zoo magazine's cover imagery and phrasing.\" Nuts, which is published by IPC Media, said it had introduced \"new covers \u2026 which have a more conservative tone\" several weeks ago, adding: \"We are delighted with our readers' response and this week's issue is our biggest selling since February.\" While previous issues have shown women fully topless with their nipples covered only by headlines or their hands or hair, and promising \"the boobiest shoot ever\" or \"big-boobed brunettes\", recent editions of Nuts feature models in less highly sexualised poses, wearing slightly more modest lingerie. The publishers of Bizarre, Dennis Publishing, opted not to tone down their covers, however, and the title will instead be sold in Tesco in modesty bags, publisher Paul Rayner said. \"Bizarre has an extremely loyal following and we feel that this move will allow us to stay true to our brand, as well as respect the retailers' request on the newsstand.\""
