  "content": "Australian media industry figures, the journalists' union and key crossbench senators have argued a compromise deal on data retention legislation does not go far enough to protect confidential sources. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, indicated Labor was likely to vote for the bill after the prime minister, Tony Abbott, agreed on Monday to an amendment to force agencies to obtain a court warrant if seeking to access a journalist's call records or other metadata for the purposes of determining a source. But questions remain about the operation of this amendment, including the definition of a journalist. There is a fresh push from the media industry for the warrant process to be contestable so that lawyers could argue their case for keeping the source confidential. Senior industry figures said the law should require the court to balance the security requirements with free speech considerations, based on a presumption in favour of protecting the source. The wording of the amendment is yet to be finalised. The independent senator Nick Xenophon said the compromise was \"a superficial and ineffective fix\" and media organisations should be given an opportunity to argue before a judge why a warrant should not be issued. \"The warrant will be a formality and journalists and sources will be investigated just as before,\" he said, dismissing the Labor-Coalition deal as a tick-and-flick approach. \"In the age of mass data retention, no journalist will be able to offer confidentiality to a source.\" The Coalition wants parliament to pass its data retention legislation by the end of next week, requiring telcos and internet service providers to store customers' details such as call logs and email recipients for two years. Labor's communications spokesman, Jason Clare, said Abbott's agreement to move an amendment was \"a victory for journalists\" and a \"victory for Bill Shorten\". Clare said Abbott had been \"terrified\" at the prospect of senior media representatives attending a public hearing on Friday telling him his previous stance was inadequate. When asked about whether the warrant should be contestable, Clare appeared to keep the option open. \"This is a question that should be asked of the government. They should sit down and work through the details of this amendment with [attorney general] George Brandis and Tony Abbott,\" he told Sky News. \"You don't want a tick-and-flick approach \u2026 Journalists are different. Unless you can protect their sources it undermines freedom of the press.\" Brandis played down the prospect of allowing journalists to contest a warrant application, saying it had \"never been a case in our system that a party against whom a warrant is sought is given advance notice of the warrant\". \"The warrant process is an application to the court or to the tribunal or in unusual circumstances the attorney general,\" Brandis told the ABC. He insisted the targets of the data retention law were \"criminals and paedophiles and terrorists\", not media organisations. \"I regret that the debate about this law has diverted down this path about journalists, for heaven's sake,\" he said. \"Journalists are not the object of the law. This is a law that continues to guarantee the availability to the police, to the law enforcement, the national security authorities, to essential evidence in criminal and terrorism investigations.\" Asked about the difficulties of defining who would be covered by the warrant requirement, Brandis said he would not regard bloggers as journalists. \"But a journalist is, for the purposes of this law, a person engaged in the profession of journalism and there is an interesting argument, of course, as to what at the margins a journalist is,\" he said. \"Ultimately that is an issue resolvable by courts.\" The union representing journalists said the prime minister's proposal remained inadequate. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) said the addition of a hurdle such as a warrant did not change the fact that agencies would be able to use reporters' metadata to pursue a whistleblower. \"Accessing metadata to hunt down journalists' sources, regardless of the procedures used, threatens press freedom and democracy,\" said the alliance's chief executive, Paul Murphy. Brandis rebuked the MEAA for \"outrageous hyperbole\". The Greens senator Scott Ludlam said nobody except Shorten was really convinced that the proposed limited warrant amendment fixed the problem. Ludlam said the principle of storing the phone and internet records of millions of citizens who were not suspected of any crime was offensive. And he said if agencies wanted to engage in intrusive snooping they should be required to seek a warrant \"whether you're a journalist or not\". \"We will turn up the heat on the Labor party; do not throw this beleaguered failed prime minister a surveillance lifeline,\" Ludlam told the ABC. \"The parliament is better than that and this country needs an opposition at the moment.\" The Liberal Democratic senator David Leyonhjelm said he remained fundamentally opposed to the ability for the government to \"snoop\" and treat everyone as suspects. \"It's a step in the right direction but there are a lot more steps that need to be made,\" he told the ABC when asked about the warrant deal for journalists. \"It is just one of my concerns.\" The votes of crossbench senators will not be required if Labor supports the bill in the Senate. Leyonhjelm said he accepted parliament would pass the bill because Labor had \"rolled over\" on the fundamental principle, so he would try to move numerous amendments to make the law \"less obnoxious\"."
