  "content": "Girl Online, the first novel by Zoe Sugg AKA \"Zoella\" has pushed Jeff Kinney's newest Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul off the top of the chart as the fastest selling book of the year. Zoella's book, published by Penguin, has also become the fastest selling hardback of 2014 \u2013 pretty impressive as it was only published on 25 November. On hearing the news Zoe said, \"It's such an amazing feeling. I'm so grateful to everyone who has bought a copy of Girl Online. I love that so many of my viewers are enjoying the book! This year has been so exciting and this for sure is the icing on the cake.\" Zoella started her blog and YouTube channel in 2009 when she was still a teenager herself (she's only 24 now) to share her love of all things beauty and fashion with the online world - plus her thoughts and advice on issues from cyber-bullying to anxiety to self-esteem. She now has nine million YouTube subscribers and a humongous Twitter following @ZoZeeBo. Zoella says she has dreamed of writing a book since the age of 14: \"I started writing my blog in 2009 and would never have imagined it would bring me the opportunity to make my teenage dream come true.\" Zoe's debut novel, Girl Online, has been described as a modern-day Notting Hill for teens, where an ordinary 15-year-old girl's relationship with an American pop star goes viral as her anonymous blog is exposed to the world. The sequel to Girl Online is promised in summer 2015\u2026 Under 18, love books and not a member of the Guardian children and teens' books site? Come on in, the water's fine!"
