  "content": "Is this article already too long? It's a question to which I'm sure many people already have a strongly affirmative answer, in which case \u2013 stop reading. But even if you aren't reading I have to carry on writing until the space is full. It's an uncontroversial model, an inevitable consequence of newspaper layout rules. But in a digital world, and one where the cost of journalism is not falling as quickly as the revenues that support it, the opportunity arises to rethink what is \"enough\" in terms of good reporting, or commentary. In fact, online this article could be less than the 140 characters permitted on Twitter plus a link to the Atlantic Monthly article written by the journalist Michael Kinsley (theatlantic.com/doc/201001/short-writing), which posited that many newspaper readers are put off by most articles being too long and adding nothing to the value of the news. I could also add links to the Columbia Journalism Review response by Greg Marx \u2013 cjr.org/behind_the_news/is_shorter_really_better.php \u2013 (and half a dozen others) which queries Kinsley's underlying thrust that quotes which \"add authority\" to an article often do little but pad it out. But in the unmade world of digital news and comment and analysis, we find ourselves, like the music industry, creating to a format that is much more appropriate for another era, because we are hardwired to do so. The debates about \"what is an article?\", or indeed \"why make albums?\" are philosophically interesting but they also have an impact on the economic model of journalism, or music, or television or any other digitised format. A further twist to the text format will become more obvious to news organisations this year, and that is that even the internet is not formatted for content in the way it used to be. The idea that the internet looks like a computer screen is long over. It looks increasingly like a mobile phone with a touch screen, or any number of internet-enabled devices. The launch of the Nexus One (which is not as you might think a new eco car or Doctor Who villain but a new Google phone) caused a huge stir in the business and technology world, but also should cause a stir in the media world. Content, journalism, programmes and visual communication will need to be comfortable in a new format, on a smaller screen, where the issue of where you are may also become part of how you are reading or reporting or watching. This is not the froth of stupid innovation and gadget mania, instead it is a permanent shift in communications consumption. It is ripping the format of journalism and potentially other media so far away from the page-centric world we all grew up reading and writing for that it raises the question of how long it will be before even the concept of a website becomes old hat. Curiously it does not necessarily mean that all formats will be shorter. The \"tweet\" length of information will begin to prevail for breaking news, but as web traffic shows time and time again, really strong, well differentiated long form content is as eagerly consumed as the quick soundbite. Several years ago it was something of a surprise to the statistics department that the Guardian website's top story for the month was a piece on Victorian sewers written at length for G2. Its uniqueness and quality inevitably meant it gained wide traffic by virtue of the one-line link, circulated by aggregators and people who enjoyed the read. What is under most pressure is the 400-word article, and this is where Kinsley's piece is important. It brings a direct challenge from a respected print journalist to examine whether, in a world where context and citation are only a click away, we are imagining ourselves the right journalistic future and doing our bottom lines a disservice in the process. Emily Bell is the Guardian's director of digital content and this article appears in Monday's media section where Emily has to write 78 lines of text"
