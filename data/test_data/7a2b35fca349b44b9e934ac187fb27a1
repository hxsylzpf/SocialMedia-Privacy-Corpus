  "content": "The front page of the Guardian on 13 October 2009 published this article, reporting on what the Guardian had been banned from reporting. The right to report parliament has been a fundamental facet of journalism since the 18th century, and the article caused wide spread alarm. Within hours, Twitter users had picked up on the story and revealed the details the paper was prevented from publishing. The order was overturned the same day. Click here to read Alan Rusbridger's anatomy of the super-injunction. The story was one of the first collisions between traditional journalism, privacy laws and new social media, and was hailed as a historic moment for Twitter."
