  "content": "Perhaps Google's biggest threat doesn't come from Microsoft: perhaps it comes from Facebook. That might explain why it just splurged pots of money on an advert during the US Superbowl (a traditional piece of traditional media willy-waving): because it's worried about people using Facebook and other social networks instead of its product. Update: the below struck-out paragraphs aren't right - but the overall point is. Scroll on to the good stuff... I'd like at this point to show you the picture showing how the Wall Street Journal's website traffic from Google News has remained largely static, while that from Facebook has shot up. But as the picture has a \"no commercial use\" licence, I'll point you to it instead (here it is at the original size). What it shows is that while in January 2009 visits from Facebook to WSJ.com were about 1.3% of traffic, and from Google News were about 1.5% of traffic, by the end of January 2010 they were 3.45% from Facebook, and still around 1.3% for Google News. Conclusion from that slide: Google News isn't becoming more important as a traffic source for WSJ.com. But Facebook is. (And don't think that there's a paywall; if you follow a link from Google News to WSJ.com, you'll be allowed straight in to the full text of the article.) Heather Hopkins, North American analyst for Hitwise notes in a new blog post that \"Facebook was the #4 source of visits to News and Media sites last week, after Google, Yahoo! and msn\", and that the proportion it sends to US media sites has grown dramatically from about 1.2% to 3.52% over the past year, while that sent by Google News has remained roughly static, at around 1.4%. And she adds: \"Facebook could be a major disruptor to the News and Media category. And with the Wall Street Journal already publishing content to Facebook, perhaps the social network can avoid the run-ins that Google has suffered recently with Rupert Murdoch. We will continue to watch this space.\" Combine that with a point made on Twitter by John Minnihan, the founder of Freepository, that the real threat to Google (or as he calls it, $GOOG, the stock ticker term) isn't from Microsoft with Bing plus Yahoo (which aren't gaining any scary amount of traffic), but instead from Facebook - as Minnihan commented, \"With recent data showing a large uptick in 'Facebook as home page', $GOOG may well indeed need to remind emerging generation who/what it is. In that case, the $GOOG ad makes some business sense. Whatever the real reason, it has nothing to do with 'sharing video more widely'. If FB dev'ed an integrated web-wide search engine, think about how much traffic would evap. from $GOOG overnite. That's nightmare stuff.\" And that may well be the real threat. As Minnihan says, it's really not very believable that you're going to blow $5m simply because you thought a video about France was nice. No way. Meanwhile, bonus link: Spain's Telefonica has got into the act, saying that Google, Bing and Yahoo are using its networks \"without paying anything at all\". Es loco, si?"
