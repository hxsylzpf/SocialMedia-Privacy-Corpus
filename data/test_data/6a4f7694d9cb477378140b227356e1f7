  "content": "Although it is by no means the worst gaffe to come out of parliament, Tom Watson has got himself in a tangle with Twitter users after he let slip a spoiler for new blockbuster The Amazing Spider-Man 2. The Sun reports that the Labour MP tweeted about a huge plot twist and fans were not impressed. One wrote \"I would have thought that even MPs would get the concept of spoilers. That was completely t****ish. [Asterisks courtesy of the Sun]\" Tom's tweet was deleted and he later said his son had told him he should have waited for the DVD to come out before giving away the plot. He's not the first person to fall foul of Spider-Man and the web."
