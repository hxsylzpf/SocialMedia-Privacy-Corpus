  "content": "I seem to be writing about Facebook a lot these days \u2013 not really intentional given that I'm not even on it (although not, as you might conclude by the end of this blog, because I'm anticipating becoming a defendant in a criminal trial). But circuit judge Patrick Moloney QC got me thinking today with some of his stories from the crown court bench. Speaking at the IBC Protecting the Media Conference in London yesterday, Moloney said that he gives a standard direction at the beginning of trials warning jurors not to google the person in the dock, in case they find prejudicial information. I've written about the problem of google-savvy jurors before. High-profile criminal trials, such as that of those accused of harming Baby P, have been put at risk by material posted abroad but widely available online. As I write, I'm aware of another important criminal investigation which prosecutors fear could be compromised when it comes to trial because of the volume of material on the web. One one hand, this presents a serious problem for the press. A lawyer from a well-known news organisation asked Moloney whether he would hold them in contempt if the prejudicial information were taken from an archive on their site. The answer, according to the judge, was that rather than going after the media whose sites contain the information, judges are trying to deal with the problem at the other end, by cautioning jurors and preventing them from looking. The problem is that young jurors whose immediate response to any curiosity is to hit an online search are not necessarily as obedient as judges might hope. And this is where Facebook comes in. Moloney pointed out that in his experience it used to be details from the rare, famous criminal trial that could be found in online newspaper archives and blogs. Now, almost everyone has their own website, thanks to Facebook, making the temptation for jurors to do some investigative journalism of their own greater than ever. You may think that the defendant who is stupid enough to post incriminating personal details on their Facebook page deserves everything they get when they come to trial. Moloney told a story of a young man accused of aggravated burglary with a weapon whose page was described as a \"gangster zone\" and showed pictures of him holding a gun. Sympathy wanes somewhat. But the presumption of innocence is not conditional upon intelligence: even an act of such stupidity should not interfere with the right to a fair trial. It's becoming increasingly clear, though, that those are ideals dreamed up by people who had the luxury of not thinking about Facebook. Meanwhile, warnings from judges are just not cutting it.",
