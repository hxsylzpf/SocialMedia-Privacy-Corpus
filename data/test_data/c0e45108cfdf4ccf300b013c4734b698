  "content": "For those who dismiss Facebook as a time-waster's plaything, where \"friends\" post unflattering pictures and smart-arse colleagues write cryptic status updates, a little story from New Zealand may make them think again. Police in Queenstown, southern New Zealand, are trumpeting their \"first Facebook arrest\" after they posted security-camera footage and pictures showing a man's face as he attempted to break into the safe of a bar on Monday. The local man, 21, is due to appear in court today. He was caught thanks to \"members of the public viewing him on Facebook and also seeing him on TV after the Facebook images were displayed on the news\", police said in a statement on their Facebook page. It appears that our would-be thief was not the sharpest tool in the shed. Local media said the man got too hot while trying to break into the safe, took off his balaclava and showed his face to a security camera. \"He was a very silly young boy. The room is really small and it gets really hot in there at the best of times,\" said the bar's assistant manager, Mel Kelly. It is not the first time the social networking site has been used to track down criminals. Last November Facebook helped a seafood restaurant owner in Melbourne identify five customers who walked out without paying having spent $A520 on oysters, trout and fine wine. One of the diners had asked about a former waitress. A quick stroll down her friends later and the bill dodgers had been spotted. Last month an Australian lawyer served legal documents on a couple via Facebook. Mark McCormack tracked them down after they defaulted on a large loan and was given permission by the Australian courts to use the social networking site to file papers against them. Great to see social networking sites spearheading the fight against crime, but it does raise the question: who dawdles on a police force's Facebook profile?"
