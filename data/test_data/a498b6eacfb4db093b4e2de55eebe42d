  "content": "As we head for the general election, the London Press Club is staging a panel debate about the people who want our votes, \"Do we get the politicians we deserve?\" Given what appears to be widespread disenchantment with politicians, there are many questions to ask. Are politicians to blame for public antagonism towards them? Are journalists to blame? Have they and their media outlets been responsible for bringing politicians, and politics itself, into disrepute? Perhaps it's all the fault of the public. Are they merely apathetic about politics or aggressively hostile? If so, why? Fewer people seem to be getting involved in politics, especially at the local level. Can that be attributed to the (alleged) falling away of local journalism? Turning to the growing role of social media, is that now the preferred forum for political debate? Or is it diversion from serious affairs? Is is nothing more than a sideshow? Does it really have any influence over events? That's enough questions - ed. But I think you get the idea by now. It's a rich subject for discussion and the Press Club has lined up four knowledgeable panellists to mull it over. They are: Anne McElvoy, public policy editor for the Economist, London Evening Standard columnist and broadcaster; Steve Richards, chief political columnist for the Independent and a regular TV and radio broadcaster; Stephen Bush, formerly of the Telegraph and now editor of the New Statesman's Staggers political blog; and Heather Brooke, City University journalism professor and the award-winning journalist who exposed the MPs' expenses scandal. I have the honour of chairing the event at City University London, where I teach a journalism course. It will be held at the university's St John Street campus on Tuesday 31 March, beginning at 6.30pm. London Press Club members can book their spaces now by emailing info@londonpressclub.co.uk. Public booking will follow later. Source: London Press Club"
