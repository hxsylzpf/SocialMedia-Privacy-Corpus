  "content": "The information commissioner is to meet the Home Office to clarify his concerns over the potential privacy risks involved in a revived Whitehall project to track the email, internet and mobile phone use of everyone in Britain. David Cameron promised at prime minister's question time today that coalition ministers would work with the commissioner, Christopher Graham, on the details of the project. A spokesperson for the commissioner's office said: \"The commissioner's key concern is whether the case has been made for the project. On the face of it, the proposal seems disproportionate when any perceived benefits that might be gained from retaining this data are set against the risks to privacy involved.\" Graham hopes to establish whether his concerns have been addressed when he meets Home Office officials. The ICO's official response to the last round of consultation on the project said the usefulness of communication data in prosecuting criminals was not enough justification \"for mandating the collection of all possible communications data on all subscribers by all communication service providers\". Home Office sources say details of the \"interception modernisation scheme\" are to be published within weeks and will build on Labour's proposal to require mobile phone and internet service providers to collect and store the \"traffic details\" of all internet and mobile phone use. The decision to push ahead with the \"Big Brother\" surveillance scheme follows pressure from the security services, including MI5 and GCHQ, as well as Scotland Yard, who have argued that it is essential to bring phone-tapping into the internet age. The Home Office stresses that the scheme would not give the police and security services access to the content of emails or text messages but case-by-case access to the traffic details of who contacted whom at what time and from what location. The problem for internet and phone companies is that, while they keep a limited amount of such data already for their own subscribers for billing and other commercial purposes, the project will also require them to store a much bigger volume of third-party data such as from Google Mail, Twitter, Skype and Facebook that crosses their servers every day. The scheme now being worked on within the Home Office is based on the fact that 95% of all internet traffic crosses the servers of the \"five or six main communication service providers\", such as Vodafone. Legislation is to be introduced requiring them to collect, store and allow police and security services access to the personal data. Although the Home Office capital budget is to be cut by 49% the department is expected to argue that such communications data is key to successful prosecutions in 90% of terrorism and organised crime cases and the wider costs of not proceeding are far greater than the cost of the project. The option of creating a single centralised \"Big Brother\" Whitehall database, which carried a \u00a32bn price tag, was ditched early in 2009 by Jacqui Smith when she was home secretary. However, detailed plans were prepared for draft legislation for the company-based option for last autumn's Queen's speech but were also shelved at the last minute. The issue has a political dimension because the coalition agreement pledges \"to end the storage of internet and email records without good reason\". Julian Huppert, the Liberal Democrat MP for Cambridge, invited Cameron at PMQs today to confirm that the government was not reviving Labour's original proposal for a centralised Whitehall database, which he was happy to do.",
