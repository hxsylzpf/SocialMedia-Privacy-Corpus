  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission has rejected a complaint from the Spectator publisher, Kimberly Quinn, that a photograph of her published in the Sunday Mirror intruded into her privacy and had been taken following harassment. Ms Quinn, known as Kimberly Fortier until she changed her name this year, complained to the PCC after the Sunday Mirror published a photograph of her with her child, whose face was blanked out. But the PCC said it did not consider that the manner in which the photograph was taken amounted to harassment, and there was nothing to suggest the photographer had \"persisted unduly in his attentions, or had acted in an intimidating fashion\". It said Ms Quinn's identity, in connection with the allegation that she was involved with the home secretary, David Blunkett, had been established in the public domain, and that the photograph contributed to a general public debate and was taken at a time when the story was developing. The PCC also said that a previous request by Ms Quinn's lawyers for journalists to stop approaching her could not last \"in perpetuity\". \"As developments in the story had occurred subsequent to the initial request, the photographer was entitled to approach the complainant in the manner that he did,\" the PCC said. The editor of the Sunday Mirror, Tina Weaver, said: \"It's a very sensible decision by the PCC. People cannot cry 'privacy' if they are photographed in a public place in relation to a story which is clearly the result of their own actions.\" The ruling marks an important development in the PCC's approach to privacy, and makes clear that the watchdog does not consider the publication of photographs of people in public breaches its code."
