  "content": "In tech circles, alongside words such as \"scaleable\" and \"the gig economy\", you often hear the phrase \"tech for good\" bandied around. Sometimes it's a fairly innocuous but ultimately toothless concept, essentially denoting the idea that technology has the potential to be a driver for positive social change but not doing very much about it. Other times it can take on a more creepily utopian tone, suggesting that should the world more closely represent the shiny libertarian enclaves of Silicon Valley, the world's problems would be solved. And sometimes \u2013 just sometimes \u2013 it does what it says on the tin. A new game, designed to test spatial navigation, appears at first glance to do just that. Sea Hero Quest, which involves navigating a boat through choppy waters, contains a diagnostic test for the early signs of Alzheimer's disease. The game has now been played by more than 2.4 million people \u2013 which the team behind the game say makes it the largest dementia study in history. It's now set to be adapted for use in a clinical setting \u2013 data could be fed back to clinicians, allowing for earlier diagnosis, better understanding of how medication is working for a particular patient and a more accurate and precise measurement of a patient's decline. It could even be incorporated into NHS programmes. This, it goes without saying, is initially incredibly attractive. Understanding and managing an illness or being alerted when you're at risk simply through the daily use of an app sounds simple, easy and most of all useful. Could this not be a genuine use of tech for good, rather than the banal and empty proclamations often heard from CEOs and founders? In theory, yes. In practice: maybe not. As with any health data-driven project, it comes with stipulations. A recent study in Lancet Psychiatry suggested that data gathered on Facebook could provide a \"wealth of information\" about mental health, with a series of language analysis and facial emotion recognition algorithms providing \"insights into offline behaviours\". This, too, sounds great. Having your health monitored and managed through the passive use of technology you probably already use \u2013 what more could you want? But there are a number of concerns here: primarily, the safety of private health data. The addition of a private company in the latter study may make it feel different: a towering behemoth such as Facebook obviously feels more threatening than something set up for and run by clinicians. But to not have the same reservations just because the data was being sent to scientists would be incredibly naive. Science, much like technology, is often presented as objective, reasonable fact, without mentioning the very obvious caveat that it is conducted by human beings, who are often neither reasonable nor objective. Multiple studies about statistical analysis are useful to recall here \u2013 the results of such analyses may seem completely objective, but often reflect the preconceived biases of those conducting them. That's not to say that would be the case with Sea Hero Quest, of course: just that the results of such research can be fallible. And it's also important to remember that, should the Conservative party have its way, the NHS may be in the hands of several, separately operated and privately owned companies before too long. This adds further complications: who would have access to our health data? How would they use it? How would data be efficiently and safely communicated across different companies? Would their data protection processes be cohesive? Would they be meticulous enough to protect our most private, personal data? The idea of having your phone feed data to a central NHS database sounds great in principle, but these questions would need to be answered before that could safely become a reality. In an ideal world, tech would be utilised to help us to diagnose and treat illnesses: anything that can efficiently and effectively help people manage long-term or life-threatening conditions can only be a good thing. Similarly, the idea of a National Health Service that is genuinely innovative, that uses new ways to help people and that has a strong grasp on data security while it does so is incredibly appealing. Unfortunately, as with most utopian ideas, you're left wondering whether it might just be too good to be true.",
