  "content": "The Daily Mail's announcement that it will no longer moderate comments on its web site unless they are reported by readers represents the second big retreat from the ideals of open and co-operative journalism this month, after Rupert Murdoch's decision to charge for content. But it's going to come unstuck a whole lot sooner. All media organisations that have opened themselves up to the readers have had problems with the stupidity and ignorance of the results; there is an entire site devoted to the crass remarks that people put on the BBC's web site, but no newspaper is really in a position to mock them. On top of those problems, there is the threat of libel and other legally dangerous speech. That's why we all employ moderators, whose job is at the very least to weed out comments which will cause either commercial or legal damage to the papers. This is a very narrow description. They might be much more pro-active: a purely Internet site like Boing Boing, which lives on its advertising, has a much stricter comments policy; and a wider justification for it, from which I quote: Everyone automatically reads the text that's there. If it's nasty or unpleasant, they get a dose of that. If there's too much of it, they stop participating. There's far more internet discourse lost to trollage and casual rudeness than is ever lost to moderators. But the Mail, with this decision, shows that it does not believe in Internet discourse. The implicit justification is that it doesn't matter much what the crazies post, since no one but the other crazies will read it. And that, let's face it, is how most print journalists think of the Internet. Fair enough. Very few newspapers really believe in Internet discourse, in the sense that they believe their reader comments are anything to learn from. At best they are a cheap way to invite reader to let off steam. I think this is a really terrible mistake. There are two core journalistic skills: finding things out, and leaving things out. In the last decade or so, even before the web became omnipresent, these have been less and less valued by the business, as Nick Davies's Flat Earth News makes clear. But finding things out and leaving things out are the only skills apart from propaganda that anyone will in the long run pay for. Merely transmitting news is futile. Reader feedback can help both parts of the process, if it's carefully done. For one thing, on almost any story, there will always be someone who knows more than the journalist. The trick is to get them to share this knowledge. Then everybody wins. That's finding things out. But it will only happen if the loonies, the trolls, and the axe-grinders are ruthlessly suppressed. That's leaving things out: the comments are there for the benefit of readers as much as the stories that provoke them, and they should be moderated with that in mind. It's easy for us on the Guardian to suppose that Mail readers, by definition, have nothing to add to any conversation. But if the Mail itself supposes the same, as this decision suggests, why is it making space for them? In legal terms, the Mail may more or less get away with it: if it removes legally dodgy comments as soon as they are brought to its attention, then it can't be blamed for those that haven't yet been noticed. We'll see how long that defence survives a really determined assault by the racists, the crazies, and the spammers. I give it a week. But after the train wreck is cleared away, the problem will still be there. How are the news media to harness the intelligence and knowledge of their readers, even the Mail's readers? Or, to put it more democratically, how can we become the means for the readers to learn from each other?"
