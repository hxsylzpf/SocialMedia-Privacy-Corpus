  "content": "Good news for fans of first-world problem-solving! You can now embed Instagram photos and videos on websites. Grab a friend, pop The Pogues' Fiesta on the stereo, and celebrate (while, obviously, Instagramming a tilt-shifted Hudson-filtered snap of your capering for posterity). Yes, it's fair to say that the inability to easily embed Instagram content outside social networks hasn't been a huge problem for most of the app's 130m users, who've seemed happy with its ability to share pics and vids on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr and Foursquare as well as Instagram itself. Those people will be blissfully unaware of Instagram's announcement of \"Instagram web embeds\" yesterday, but it's interesting for another reason: how it positions Instagram as a source for the media against rivals like Twitter's Vine. It's easy enough to embed something from Instagram on a website now, as the company's announcement blog post explains: Now, when you visit an Instagram photo or video page on your desktop web browser, you'll see a new share button on the right side of your photo (just under the comments button). Click the button to see the embed code. Copy the block of text it gives you and paste it into your blog, website or article. When you hit publish, the photo or video will appear. As always, you own your photos and videos, and we want to make sure that's understood no matter where your content appears. Whether you want to embed your video on your blog or a friend wants to feature your photo on a website, everyone will clearly see that your content belongs to you. Your embedded photo or video appears with your Instagram username, and clicking on the Instagram logo will take people to your page on Instagram.com where they can discover more of your photos and videos. It's certainly easy, even if the default dimensions of 612x710 pixels mean you'll have to do some calculations if you want to squeeze it into a smaller space (for example, the 460-wide dimensions used here): The new feature patches one of the holes in Instagram from a journalist's point of view, which was that to embed photos or videos in an article, you had to turn to external services like Embedly. That worked well enough, but embeds from within Instagram are better. Journalists are just one reason why embedding is a good idea for Instagram. Celebrities and musicians are another \u2013 those who want to embed snaps from their official accounts elsewhere, anyway. And don't forget the brands who've been flocking to Instagram, and are intrigued by the potential in its new video features. Videos posted using Twitter's Vine app have been embeddable for a while now, and Twitter has been thinking about how tweets are presented elsewhere on the web for some time too. It has worked hard to persuade journalists to embed tweets rather than simply quoting their text, and in September 2012 launched a widget to embed entire Twitter timelines within websites. It also provides resources for media companies trying to use Twitter more effectively, and has just launched a dedicated Twitter Media blog to highlight what it sees as best practice. It's tempting to think about Facebook (and Instagram), Twitter and other services as engaged purely in a battle for users. But they're also engaged in a battle for media of various kinds, positioning themselves as a source for social content, but a source that maintains control over how that content is presented. What about control for the people actually shooting the photos and videos? \"Is your content private? Then nothing has changed. Embed code is only available to those whose photos and videos are public,\" explains Instagram. Which, of course, raises the question of how the land lies for people who want their content to be public, but not embeddable. YouTube has a tickbox that controls whether your videos are embeddable or not, but for now, Instagram appears to be taking a different approach.",
