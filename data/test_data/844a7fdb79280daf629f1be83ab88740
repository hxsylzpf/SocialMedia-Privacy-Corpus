  "content": "An injunction preventing Mary Archer's former secretary from selling her story to the press has been extended for one more week. Jane Williams worked for Lady Archer for 13 years, looking after her personal affairs in the Cambridge home she shared with her husband, Lord Archer. Today a high court judge agreed to continue the gagging order until a new half-day hearing, which is expected to take place next Friday. The injunction taken out against Ms Williams is similar to one used against the former nanny employed by Tony and Cherie Blair. Ms Williams' barrister, Andrew Monson, told Mr Justice Stanley Burnton that new evidence had been served on behalf of Lady Archer hours before today's hearing. He said it contained accusations by a former lover of Ms Williams, which claimed the secretary had downloaded information about Lady Archer from her computer and brought it home to use as her \"pension fund\". Last month, the News of the World ran a story about Lady Archer having had a face-lift operation."
