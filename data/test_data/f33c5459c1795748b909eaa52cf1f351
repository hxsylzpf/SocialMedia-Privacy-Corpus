  "content": "Daily Telegraph editor Will Lewis has taken to micro-blogging service Twitter with gusto, with a series of entertaining tweets from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. But it seems he's a bit upset at Media Monkey over our piece this morning about him swapping fashion tips with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. It seems Lewis wrote a blog post about his encounter with Zuckerberg yesterday, but Monkey saw it in the print edition this morning \u2013 and credited the Telegraph accordingly. This morning he took time off from his busy Davos schedule to send this tweet: Bizarre Guardian theft of a blog posting I did yesterday Now, now. We thought talking about the media and other blogs was kind of the point. But we're glad he's reading. Meanwhile, we're enjoying his tweets on Davos (see below). We're wondering if his enthusiasm for Twitter has anything to do with the half-page profile on the company on page 16 of the Telegraph today. It seems Twitter is the flavour of the month in the UK media. Quite funny? Change of Davos theme song this year \u2013 from Money Money Money to Staying Alive Some things in Davos do not change \u2013 Barry, the Piano Bar, and one giant karoke-style sing song. Hilarious, even more so amid the gloom Is it possible that Davos turned Hollywood star Will Smith down for a pass? David Beckham you can understand, but Will Smith?",
