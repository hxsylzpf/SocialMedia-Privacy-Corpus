  "content": "The editor of the Independent has launched an outspoken attack on some of his most high-profile rivals, accusing them of \"bringing shame\" on the profession. Simon Kelner said the scandal over Ulrika Jonsson's claims in her autobiography had revealed \"all the most disreputable elements\" of the modern press, which he accused of \"hypocrisy, irresponsibility, arrogance, cynicism and plain nastiness\". Kelner was careful not to name John Leslie, the television presenter who was sacked earlier this week following a welter of allegations about his private life reported by the tabloids. But he accused David Yelland, Piers Morgan and Paul Dacre of acting as self-appointed judges of the presenter, basing their accusations on little more than gossip. \"So it is that, on the word of a TV weathergirl with a book to promote, supported by the supposedly inadvertent 'outing' by a gossip columnist and on the lurid testimony of a group of largely anonymous witnesses, a man is tried and convicted of serious sexual offences in the columns of our mass circulation newspapers,\" Kelner wrote in this week's Spectator magazine. \"His career as a television presenter is, we are told, in triumphant tones, in ruins. No defence, no cross-examination; the verdict from judges Yelland, Morgan and Dacre is guilty as charged.\" Kelner accused the tabloid media of jeopardising any future court case with their coverage of the scandal. \"The dubious moral justification for this story is that it involves a potentially serious criminal act. But we can only ask: if this man is guilty, what are the chances of his now being brought to justice?\" he wrote. The Daily Mail today put the boot in to Kelner, a former executive at the Mail on Sunday who was expected to eventually to return to Associated Newspapers after a sojourn on the broadsheet that he has edited for last four and a half years. In the Ephraim Hardcastle column, the Mail speculates acidly: \"Friends say his hatred for the popular press coincides with his recent realisation that no successful newspaper group is now likely to offer him an escape route from the dead duck Independent\". In the Spectator Kelner claimed the lack of any effective political opposition to the government has emboldened newspapers to behave as a \"form of unofficial counter-force\". He pointed out that Estelle Morris's resignation as education secretary has been portrayed by some of her colleagues as that of a \"decent woman who found press intrusions into her private life... too much to bear\". And he criticised the Daily Mail's campaign against the Lottery Community Fund, the quango set up to distribute lottery funds to good causes, saying the paper's reports had a \"spiteful, xenophobic edge\" that have \"inflamed the worst instincts of it readers\". Although Kelner reserved his harshest criticism for tabloid newspapers - accusing Veronica Wadley's London Evening Standard of becoming \"the provisional wing of the Daily Mail\" with its investigations into Ms Morris's private life - he said it would be naive to think broadsheets were innocent of such practices. While he conceded there was a \"clear division\" between the broadsheets and tabloids in the coverage of the Jonsson affair, Kelner believed \"editors at the more serious end of the market are increasingly tempted to forsake the high ground\"."
