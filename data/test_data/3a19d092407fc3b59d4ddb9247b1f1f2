  "content": "Yes, my boss follows me on Twitter. And it's no use denying that this makes a difference to what I tweet. For example, I always feel bad about not tweeting, because I report on digital media and a tacit part of my job description is to maintain an online presence. However, I don't tweet if I am in a bad mood or am simply too busy. On the other hand, we should examine where the line should be drawn for social media and our private lives. Our after-work life is rapidly disappearing, and being replaced by a non-working life. It remains to be seen if increased transparency regarding our private lives will make employers more tolerant - or make employees better behaved. \"The business use case in Twitter is turning out to be very important,\" Twitter co-founder Biz Stone said yesterday as the company announced the possibility of cross-posting tweets to the professional network LinkedIn. Fine. But careful with that. Think twice about tweeting that you hate your new job, but are grateful for the fat paycheck. And you might want to consider changing your job if you want to express your sexuality but you are a teacher. Those people with a second, non-work-related, Facebook account or Twitter identity can do a lot anonymously, but yes, they have to manage their identities. And the London Underground worker who left his job after rude comments he made to an elderly passenger were circulated on the internet might struggle for sympathy. In fact, most of the problems have nothing to do with new media, but are simply because people tend to forget their manners online. As behaviour is very important in public and we all live public lives now, etiquette is making a comeback. Since my boss is a nice boss, he reminds us all from time to time that he is following us on Twitter. However, don't forget that these days camera phones and Twitterers are everywhere, so each of us can become a representative of our company wherever we go. Here are my three rules: \u2022 Don't be rude. Don't be abusive about people, projects or your company. You might feel that you can talk behind someone's back to your friends and they will never find out - but it is becoming increasingly likely that they will. \u2022 Don't post rumours or reveal things about colleagues, partners, projects or your own job situation. Being the first is old media, while being to the point is new media. And Twitter never forgets. \u2022 Post at haste, repent at leisure - it is easy to write something in the heat of the moment that you will come to regret, so wait until you have calmed down. Even though private is the new public, some things are better left private. What are your experiences with your working life and social media? Can you think of some examples of society getting more tolerant? Or have we lost our freedom by being forced to act and write in a more constrained manner?"
