  "content": "Phorm can't seem to get the hang of staying out of the news (possibly because it's now hired a small army of PR people). So here's your roundup on what's been going on. Latest is its preliminary results for the full year to December 31, and notes from the first quarter of 2008, in which the notable points include a $30m (\u00a315m) equity fundraising; OIX (its advertising portal) and Webwise \"successfully launched in February 2008\", \"significant progress made with the advertising and publishing community\", \"advanced talks with other ISPs both in the UK and internationally\", \"positive initial feedback from a number of regulatory bodies\" and - on March 19 - another $65m equity fundraising. OK, but as Sir Alan Sugar would ask, what about the numbers? Operating losses for 2007 were $32.8m (post-tax $32.6m), making a loss per share of $2.74. The balance sheet showed net assets on December 31 of $15.1m (of cash and equivalents: $16.6m) and \"virtually no debt\". Net cash used was $22.4m, and mostly funded by the equity fundraising, after issue costs, of $35.2m. Which means that at that sort of burn rate, even if (big if) there's no cash inflow, Phorm could carry on for nearly four years without needing more money. There's also plenty about high-powered appointments to the board - from Coca-Cola, BT, aQuantive (an ad-serving company lately acquired by Microsoft) and AT&amp;T. If the pedigree of your board members was cash in the bank, Phorm would be rich. But that's not how companies are, or should be, judged. An interesting quote from Ertegrul: Our technology complies with all relevant data protection and privacy laws including RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act) and the Data Protection Act And: Furthermore, we have initiated a dialogue with the Information Commissioner's Office who are pleased with the way that we have engaged with technical experts and concerned individuals following the announcement of the service. But what's the ICO got to say? Looking at its statement, we note that it says Regulation 7 of PECR [Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003] will require the ISP to get the consent of users to the use of their traffic data for any value added services. This strongly supports the view that Phorm products will have to operate on an opt in basis to use traffic data as part of the process of returning relevant targeted marketing to internet users. Whether or not the Phorm products are a concern for the Commissioner will depend on the extent to which the assurances Phorm has provided so far are true. [emphasis added - CA] If Phorm has to go opt-in, I suspect that would leave it grounded before it starts. If anyone has figures on how many people opt in to services (as opposed to opting out), I'd love to hear. And finally in this roundup, Phorm's marketing team has been caught wiki-fiddling. Specifically, altering the Wikipedia page about it to make it, um, more friendly. But as you'd expect, this was noticed and almost instantly reverted. The side-by-side before and after comparison is interesting, but it's more fun to look at the Phorm-edited version and the one before it; a notable change being that the quote by the Guardian's advertising people is shortened significantly (\"Our decision was in no small part down to the conversations we had internally about how this product sits with the values of our company\" vanishes). Phorm admitted doing this, telling the Register it \"wanted to clarify a number of inaccuracies\". Hmm, but it hardly fits with the NPOV, does it? To sum up: doing well for cash, bad for PR, but possibly holed below the waterline by the ICO demand. We'll see how this all pans out."
