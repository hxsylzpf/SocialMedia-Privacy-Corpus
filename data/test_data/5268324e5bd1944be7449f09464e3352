  "content": "\"The people, the culture, the architecture \u2026 everything is unique here.\" Jen Karpowicz moved to New Orleans in 2011 and has captured her love affair with the city on camera ever since. \"Living in the French Quarter, I started bringing my camera with me everywhere I went because there was always something interesting going on,\" she says. \"I'd walk to the grocery store and pass by an opera singer, a poet-for-hire, 2 brass bands, a wedding second line, a bunch of horse-drawn carriages, and an endless stream of the most interesting mix of people, all with a background of gorgeous buildings ... And that's just walking to the grocery store! You should see Mardi Gras!\" Follow @guardiancities on Instagram and tag your best city shots with #guardiancities."
