  "content": "Lil B, the prolifically tweeting rapper from California's Bay Area, learned about the speed of an online backlash when he went from making a throwaway joke on Twitter to apologising for being transphobic in a matter of hours. \"I might start saying I'm trans and I'm a woman so I can be in the girls Locker room with the ladies !!!!!!,\" he first tweeted. \"No homo I'm still growin \u2013 Lil B.\" The comment, made in jest, didn't go down particularly well with other Twitter users. Responses ranged from the measured: \"this is really disrespectful and hurtful to trans people. i know you have a good heart. please reconsider this tweet,\" to slightly more irritated \"could u not\". Lil B quickly apologised, \"to all humans\", seven minutes after posting his locker room tweet. \"I am transphobic and I need help to learn to accept I'm scared because I'm not comfortable with my self,\" he wrote. \"I love u I love born girls \u2013 Lil B.\" In a series of self-aware tweets, Lil B linked his own insecurities and \"respect for women's boundaries\" to his reasons for posting the joke and said he was \"still growing\". He wrote: \"This new science is very new to me this surgery stuff from man to women is different,\" before thanking another Twitter user for explaining to him that the correct term to use is, in fact, transitioning. Towards the end of the flurry of tweets, the rapper drew a comparison between being transphobic and being a racist supporter of the Confederate flag, adding: \"people showen me today this is bigger then a joke.\" Lil B has sent more than 141,000 tweets since he first joined the site in May 2009, and is well known amongst his followers for posting often. A recent tweet about Bill Cosby stirred up controversy last week: It appeared to contradict Lil B's proclamation, in early June, that he considered himself a feminist. He had appealed to his followers to teach him about feminism in December 2014. Lil B also uses Twitter as a medium to retweet selfies taken by his young female followers, in a session he calls Girl Time. He tweets often about honouring women's beauty and individuality."
