  "content": "Aleksander Gensitskiy Katie and I met at church camp in 2013, and we've been dating for nine months. I'm an electrician in Portland, Oregon, and she is a schoolteacher in Spokane, Washington, six hours away, and whenever we see each other, we hike. I picked her up from the airport and said, \"We're going on a road trip. If you see anything you want to explore, let me know.\" We stopped and had a picnic at Beacon Rock, and while we were coming down the Oregon side, I said, \"Hey, that mountain looks beautiful \u2013 let's go climb it.\" I'd gone to the peak of Munra Point with a friend to plan the route a month earlier, but she had no idea I knew exactly what I was doing. The climb starts out easy, then gets tough: a 1,500ft elevation over the course of a mile. I figured that, since my heart would be beating so hard from nerves, I might as well have a plausible excuse. She was worried we were on a trail that led around the mountain. I didn't know how to reassure her that we were going to the top without giving away that I'd been there before, so when a guy passed us, I said, \"How is it up there?\" and he said, \"Great.\" One of those we passed and said hi to turned out to be Paul Wolfe, who took this picture on his iPhone. When I proposed, Katie said, \"Yes! Yes!\" A few days later, Wolfe uploaded the picture to Reddit, hoping to track us down. It took five hours. My best man, Dimitry, sent it to me. He wanted it to be a surprise, but it had already gone viral. There was no way to contain it. The great thing about this picture is it wasn't staged, it captured an authentic moment. It's amazing how fast the Redditors found us. I think everyone wants to be in a love story, and this was their opportunity to be part of one. Katie Verkovod I didn't suspect at all that he was going to propose. Halfway through the hike, I gave him a hug and noticed his heart was beating really hard. I said, \"Wow, Alex, you're really out of shape, huh?\" He said, \"Round is a shape!\" Now I know he was just nervous. At the top it was so beautiful, I went to give him another hug and he sort of pushed me away. I thought, \"Maybe he wants space\", so I walked to the edge to look at the mountains. He told me later he thought, \"Darn it!\" because he was going to propose right there \u2013 he was pushing me away to talk to me. He'd never told me he loved me until that moment. Then he got on one knee and asked me to marry him. It was unbelievable. I'd known from the very beginning that that's what I wanted. I was the last to find out about the photograph. A friend in Hawaii posted it, saying, \"Is that you and Alex?!\" It was crazy. I thought, how did that happen? Aleksander didn't have a photographer. It's incredible that complete strangers worked together to give us that photo. At that moment, it felt like the entire world had our backs. \u2022 Interview by Erica Buist Are you in a famous photograph? Email thatsme@theguardian.com"
