  "content": "I just had a pint with Demand Media co-founders Richard Rosenblatt and Shawn Colo today, fresh with the scent of Silicon Valley gossip that Yahoo is trying to buy the social media firm for up to $2bn. Photo by philcampbell on Flickr. Some rights reserved. Rosenblatt was chief executive of Intermix, the MySpace parent company, when Rupert Murdoch's News Corp bought it for $580m (\u00a3293m) in 2005, and founded Demand a year later, buying back some of the social media technology from Intermix. Based in LA, Demand Media owns domain name services alongside a swathe of niche content sites (including Trails.com, GreenCar.com and eHow.com) and the recently acquired social media tools company Pluck. Pluck powers the social media features on long list of mainstream media sites in the US and, increasingly, the UK, including theguardian.com, Economist.com, Sky News and Reuters. Chatter on TechCrunch and a characteristically robust intervention from Kara Swisher on AllThingsD have speculated that Yahoo has been in negotiations with Demand over a takeover estimated at $2bn. Either Yahoo's US head Hilary Schneider was visiting Demand's office after negotiations, or she was having dinner with Rosenblatt. Either way, he was insistent that nothing if afoot, and pretty bullish about the state of Yahoo and the value of Demand. Just a diversionary tactic to make Yahoo still appear to be on the ball? Here's what Rosenblatt said when I asked him about the rumours. And there will be audio on this tomorrow morn: \"Well Yahoo is an important partner of ours. We partner on a number of different fronts and a number of things, and talk about a lot of things. But Yahoo is going through a crazy time, with Carl Icahn and the board taking over - so there has not been any detailed discussion about that. \"I don't want to sell the company, and I have told them [the press] that repeatedly. This is a company we want to nuture and build and take public when the markets are ready.\" How about the figure of $2bn? \"You probably know our last valuation was $1bn. We have really only scratched the surface of our potential. I would never say that $2bn is not a lot of money, but we think as a public company we could be worth more. Right now we are really excited.\" \"If you believe the Google built an entire marketplace around search and if you believe, like most peope do, that social media is the most important thing for websites' growth - we are the leading provider and we have an enormous opportunity to be the leading social media provider around the world. We think that's worth a lot of money.\"",
