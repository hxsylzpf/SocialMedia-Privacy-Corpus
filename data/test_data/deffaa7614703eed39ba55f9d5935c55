  "content": "Facebook has become the target of an 80,000-plus protest by irate mothers after banning breastfeeding photographs from online profiles. Facebook's policy, which bans any breastfeeding images uploaded that show nipples, has led an online profile by protestors - called \"lactivists\" in some circles - called \"Hey Facebook, breast feeding is not obscene\". The online petition, which accuses Facebook of instituting the policy to \"appease the closed-minded\", has attracted almost 82,000 supporters. The actions of the group came to a head over the weekend when the protesters organised a virtual \"nurse-in\" on the social networking website where for a day angry supporters posted a profile picture of an image of a mother breastfeeding and changed their Facebook status to say \"Hey Facebook, breastfeeding is not obscene!\". A small demonstration was also launched outside Facebook's office in Palo Alto, California. The campaign was initiated by the Mothers International Lactation Campaign. Barry Schnitt, a Facebook spokesman, said that no action was taken over most breastfeeding photographs. \"Photos containing a fully exposed breast, as defined by showing the nipple or areola, do violate those terms (on obscene, pornographic or sexually explicit material) and may be removed,\" he said in a statement. \"The photos we act upon are almost exclusively brought to our attention by other users who complain.\"",
