  "content": "The opening game of the FA Cup is to be streamed live on Facebook, the first live football match to be broadcast on the social networking site. FA Cup sponsor Budweiser brokered the deal with non-league teams Ascot United and Wembley FC. The live stream from Ascot's 1,150-capacity ground will be made available via an application built into the US brewer's UK Facebook page. \"To be involved in the first game of the FA Cup this season is an honour in itself, but to be part of a world first and have our match broadcast to a massive global audience is fantastic for our club,\" said the Ascot United chairman, Mike Harrison. Budweiser said that the match, which kicks off at 7.45pm on Friday, will only be available to those of legal drinking age. Viewers must be aged 18 and over to gain access to the free live stream. Facebook said that the live stream is not sponsored by, endorsed by, administered by or associated with the social networking website. In 2009 England's World Cup qualifier with Ukraine was broadcast on the internet \u2013 the UK's first professional football match screened exclusively live online \u2013 on a pay-per-view basis after a rights offer to find a replacement broadcaster to air it on TV failed following Setanta's collapse. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
