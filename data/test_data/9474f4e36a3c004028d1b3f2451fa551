  "content": "Job: founding partner, Schillings Age: 55 Industry: legal Staff: 39 New entry Silencer to the stars, Keith Schilling is the first port of call for celebrities in a spot of bother with the press. But the privacy injunction obtained by his client Ryan Giggs was swept away by thousands of people naming him on Twitter. The celebrity law firm, renowned as a tough operator with an \"attack dog\" reputation, has represented clients including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, JK Rowling, Lance Armstrong, Gordon Ramsay, Liz Hurley and Premiership footballers doubtless too numerous to mention. Credited with inventing the modern legal concept of privacy, along with rival law firm Carter-Ruck, Schillings has also been active in representing celebrities with phone hacking cases, such as Andy Gray. Schilling, who left school at 15 to work as a teaboy at a Soho law firm specialising in media law, was made a partner before leaving to start his own firm aged just 28. The firm that bears his name, which now specialises in what it calls \"reputation management\", is rarely far from any tabloid story about a famous name."
