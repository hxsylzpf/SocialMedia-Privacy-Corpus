  "content": "Charlotte Church has called on Rupert Murdoch to apologise and withdraw his comments after he called phone-hacking campaigners \"scumbag celebrities\" in a Twitter attack on the singer and others who are lobbying David Cameron to implement press reforms. Church, whose family got a \u00a3600,000 payout from Murdoch for phone hacking earlier this year, went on Twitter on Monday to join the growing number of people who have rounded on the News Corporation chairman and chief executive for his remarks. \"It would be decent to withdraw &amp; apologise for calling me, @CharlotteChurch and @jacquihames *scumbags*,\" Church said in a tweet. She was responding to Murdoch's outburst on Saturday when he lashed out against the prime minister for meeting a group of phone-hacking campaigners, including Church and the former policewoman Jacqui Hames who is suing News International over alleged hacking by the News of the World. He tweeted: \"Told UK's Cameron receiving scumbag celebrities pushing for even more privacy laws. Trust the toffs! Transparency under attack. Bad.\" Church and Hames are part of the Hacked Off lobby group which is campaigning for press reforms. The group last week met with Cameron to discuss reports he was preparing to allow newspapers one more chance at self-regulation. Murdoch's remarks on Twitter have angered many including Evan Harris, one of the founders of Hacked Off who said: \"The mask has slipped. This is no longer the humblest day of my life Murdoch is it?\" Last year Murdoch went before a parliamentary select committee to apologise for the News of the World's hacking of the phone of murdered school girl Milly Dowler, describing his appearance as \"the humblest day of my life\". He also paid \u00a33m to the Dowler family and charities of their choice in compensation. Murdoch's remarks come days after the high court heard News International was facing more than 170 claims for damages for alleged phone hacking by the News of the World, including cases brought by Cherie Blair, Neil Kinnock, Sarah Ferguson and Joanne Lees, whose boyfriend was killed in the Australian outback. On Twitter, Murdoch tried to back-pedal for his \"scumbag\" remark, telling Hames that he wasn't referring to her or Church, tweeting \"not referring to these ladies\", but then went on to make a direct attack on Hugh Grant, who is also part of Hacked Off and suing News International for alleged hacking. When one Twitter user responded to Murdoch: \"Scumbags? And your journalists and executives are what?\", the media baron replied: \"They don't get arrested for indecency on major LA highways! Or abandon love child's.\" He then, on Sunday, linked the issue with the Jimmy Savile scandal. \"Likes of Saville [sic] further protected if we don't fight Cameron, dodgy celebrities in UK,\" he tweeted. \"Could not happen in US.\" Church hit back on Monday tweeting: \"@rupertmurdoch What do you mean by 'dodgy'? My understanding of the word is 'lacking legitimacy', a term that befits NI before me or J.Hames\". Hames then tweeted: \"When you're in a hole Rupert....Celebrities not scumbags, just 'dodgy,' Murdoch tweets\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
