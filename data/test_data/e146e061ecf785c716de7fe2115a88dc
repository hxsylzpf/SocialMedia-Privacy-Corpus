  "content": "The decision by MySpace to tie up with a major search partner is an obvious, albeit critical, strategic step that ultimately could determine whether it develops a viable business model or becomes another over-hyped dotcom fad. MySpace is in talks with internet giants Google and Microsoft about providing search services in a move that would open the door to major revenue growth for Rupert Murdoch's social networking site. While the popularity of the site is nothing short of a phenomenon, analysts and observers have thus far questioned how Mr Murdoch will recoup the $580m (\u00a3310m) he spent acquiring the site last year. While MySpace's online advertising revenue is continuing to rise, tapping the search revenue market will be a key move to develop the site into a mature business. ITV's \u00a3175m acquisition of Friends Reunited illustrates the purchase of a firm with an existing multichannel business model. Although the broadcaster has much to do to draw serious revenue from the product, the first step has been taken to tie the brand to its broadcasting capability: namely an interactive TV show on the new participation games channel ITV Play. The underlying assumption at News International has run along the lines that if you own a property with huge numbers of users then advertisers will come. \"There has always been the question of monetisation at MySpace as advertising beyond the homepage is limited,\" says Julian Smith, online advertising analyst at Jupiter Research. \"A potential tie-up with one of the big portals or a search engine is likely to be a big revenue generator, making the acquisition of MySpace by News International look more and more prudent.\" Similarly, eBay's strategy in acquiring voice-over-internet protocol company Skype is based on betting that the hugely popular service will be leveraged for serious revenues going forward. While eBay is looking at various models to pay for calls and leads, social websites such as MySpace are advertising dependent and must be very aware of marketing saturation when targeting users. Delivering huge numbers of traditional online advertising formats - banners, buttons and skyscrapers, for example - is not going to sit well with the largely \"uncommercial\" ethos of MySpace. Furthermore, the revenue generated from this strategy is not going to be huge in the long term. MySpace simply does not have the online advertising inventory. While MySpace executives are successfully leveraging content deals with film and music companies - to develop branded pages for example - a deal in the search arena is critical. By partnering with Google or Microsoft - to provide the search function and resulting listings - every time a MySpace user decides to do a search, ads can be delivered. The partnership will be mutually beneficial to both parties. The likes of Google or Microsoft currently generate massive revenues from search-related advertising and any deal with MySpace will provide a huge number of new users. In recent internet usage figures for the traditionally hard-to-reach 18- to 24-year-old market, MySpace ranks fifth behind established giants eBay, MSN, Google and Hotmail. According to internet measurement firm Comscore, users spend almost 30 minutes per session on the site, averaging around 6.4 visits overall per month. \"Search engines need to encourage more searching [to build revenue] and youth audiences are spending increasing amounts of time on social sites,\" says Smith. \"So whoever provides the search facility to MySpace will generate a lot of traffic, search results and, ultimately, revenue.\" Google beat Microsoft to buy the strategically important 5% stake in AOL for $1bn. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that Microsoft is in a \"must win\" situation this time around. Youth audiences are huge fans of instant messaging, a valuable marketing and advertising platform and, across Europe at least, MSN is the market leader. Many MySpace users are almost certainly already customers because MSN messenger is packaged with PCs. One site aiming to make sure that the social networking website market remains more than a one horse race is UK startup Bebo. Proving that there is still a lot of venture capital interest in the market, Benchmark Capital, the backer of Irish TV company Setanta, announced it is investing \u00a38m to grow the business. Bebo launched in July last year following the runaway success of MySpace. Recent figures from internet research company Hitwise UK predict that at current growth levels it could pass its arch-rival. One analyst sounds a note of caution about getting too fixated on the belief that sites like MySpace are guaranteed to remain dominant: \"Social networking sites are relatively easy to build. If users keep their profiles updated - churn and dormancy are always an issue - then MySpace will remain critical to people's social lives. If not, the site may possibly only last a few years.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
