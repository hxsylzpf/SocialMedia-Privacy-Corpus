  "content": "If you start seeing multiple pictures of cute kittens on friends' Facebook pages, it may not mean they have suddenly become an ailurophile. Wickr, the secure messaging company, has launched a new feature that allows users on Apple devices to share pictures with friends that will self-destruct after 24 hours. What sets WTF - Wickr Timed Feed - apart is the ability to allow selected users of Facebook to click through to those pictures via Wickr. Any users who have not been approved will instead see pictures of kittens. Nico Sell, founder and chief executive, said: \"Wickr is ad free and collects no information on its users. Users fully own and control pictures shared through Wickr.\" She chose kittens to disguise users' images because they were \"tremendously popular\" online. More than 3.8m cat photos and videos were shared a day online last year, according to Wickr. \"The problem I have with Facebook is that anything people post, they give up ownership and control over,\" Sell told the Financial Times. \"They just do not realise it is happening.\" Facebook allowed Wickr to use its application programming interface to link WTF to its users' profiles. This month Sell told the Observer of her concerns about the privacy policies of social networking sites such as Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. \"With all of them you're granting control and ownership of whatever you post on that site to the service. We're now seeing people's Twitter photos being put on billboards without them getting paid,\" she said. \"I think those people don't need to, or don't want to, lose this control of ownership of their baby pictures but they don't realise it's happening.\" Wickr is one of the \"secure\" messaging apps that use encryption technology to keep conversations private that have been developed in the wake of revelations about intelligence agencies' surveillance prompted by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Others include ChatSecure, Cryptocat, RetroShare, Signal, Silent Text, Telegram, TextSecure and Threema."
