  "content": "Channel 4's second screen app will be called 4Now and will offer viewers real-time votes, games and quizzes \u2013 and enable advertisers to target them with interactive ads synchronised with the broadcaster's commercial breaks. 4Now will also give the channel's 8 million registered viewers extra programme information and will be integrated with Twitter. The \"always on\" app, the first to be launched by a free-to-air broadcaster in the UK, is intended to piggyback on the \"second screen\" phenomenon, viewers' penchant for going on social media while watching their favourite shows. The app will be launched into beta phase in July, available to the channel's database of registered users which includes one in three every 15- to 24-year-olds in the UK. The broadcaster said 4Now would in the future include \"exclusive content and a range of interactive experiences, including play-along games designed to be enjoyed whilst watching specific TV programmes\". It will also feature interactive sponsorship opportunities and \"audio-triggered, real-time advertising\" synchronised with the ads on the main screen. Previous C4 second screen ventures have included the playalong app to Davina McCall gameshow, Million Pound Drop Live, and its Grand National app, HorseTracker. It will also launch what it describes as the \"first ever Twitter play-along game\" for the new David Mitchell panel show, Was It Something I Said?. Part of the channel's \"viewer engagement strategy\" under chief executive David Abraham, 4Now is a working title, with feedback from its users shaping the app and may even influence what it is eventually called. Keith Underwood, Channel 4's director of strategy and technology, said the \"centralised product destination\" would enable it to offer a \"range of interactive, synchronised experiences for shows which may not have warranted a standalone application\". Channel 4 aims to have a full launch of 4Now later in 2013. It will initially be available on iOS with other platforms being \"considered\" in the future. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
