  "content": "Twitter and a variety of blogs are humming this morning with one of those newspaper cock-ups that puts a shiver up night editors' spines and makes sub-editors red-faced. Pictures supposedly showing Britain's gold medal-winning dressage team were really the rival Dutch trio, who won bronze. Apparently, Getty Images sent out a wrongly tagged picture, which was featured on the front page of the Daily Express and got a big show in the Daily Mirror. It's easy to poke fun. But I can well imagine how that happened, especially in papers where equestrian pursuits are not quite so well followed as, say, football. Who, in fairness, would have thought to check? And with whom? Let's be honest, it could happen to anyone, couldn't it? Did other picture editors or night editors realise it was a mistake before publication, I wonder. But, turning to the Daily Mail's coverage of the dressage team, is something of much more concern. In a sidebar to its report are the profiles of the two female members of the team - Laura Bechtolsheimer and Charlotte Dujardin. Their male teammate, Carl Hester, is rightly described as a four-time Olympian. It goes on to tell how he encouraged Charlotte, who lives in a cottage on his equestrian estate, to ride, adding: \"Hester, who is gay, allowed her to ride his young horse, Valegro, as a novice, planning to ride the animal himself when he reached international standard.\" What? Who is gay? What was the point of that? How did it creep in, and why?"
