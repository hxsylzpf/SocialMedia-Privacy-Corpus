  "content": "The Telegraph group website has been wiped out for most of the day by hackers. A spokesperson confirmed that the site had been hit by a distributed denial of service attack, and said specialists were now working in-house \"to get the system back to normal\". The attack began late morning and intensified throughout the day. DoS is a malicious attack where thousands of multiple requests are sent to a site's servers at once, causing it to crash. The busiest websites can manage hundreds of thousands of requests per day, but DoS attacks can make as many as one million requests in five seconds. The Telegraph's blogs and bespoke news tool, My Telegraph, are not affected as they run on a different server. \"National newspapers are particularly high-profile targets, particularly if they publish a story that someone doesn't like,\" said Paul Vlissidis, the technical director at security specialists NCC Group. \"Most sites are geared up to deal with high traffic but not simultaneous traffic.\" DoS attacks are often powered by networks of computers or \"botnets\", controlled by one \"botmaster\". One hacker recently claimed that as many as one in eight PCs could be part of a botnet, with malicious software installed without the owner's knowledge. As many as 14% of major UK businesses are thought to have been the subject of DoS attacks, according to a report by the Department of Trade and Industry. There have also been cases of criminal gangs attempting to extort money from sites including the Paddy Power betting site, which was forced offline for several hours on a critical pre-race day in 2004. Mr Vlissidis said hackers use secretive websites and private messaging networks to sell their services as \"hackers for hire\" - including offering to organise DoS attacks on sites. Publishers can take some measures to protect against DoS attacks, such as using \"guarantee of service\" routers that monitor incoming traffic and block suspicious activity. Most major sites use these kind of precautions, but such routers still can be overwhelmed during major attacks. Estonian authorities revealed recently that at least 1 million computers had been appropriated to launch an unprecedented wave of cyber-attacks within the Baltic state. The attacks targeted government sites, banks and the media and are said to have cost tens of millions of euros. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
