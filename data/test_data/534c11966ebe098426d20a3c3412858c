  "content": "Job: founder, chief executive, Facebook Age: 26 Industry: digital media Staff: 1,400 2009 ranking: 11 It has been a year of two halves for Mark Zuckerberg, the youthful founder and chief executive of Facebook. First, the good news. Zuckerberg's six-year-old social networking site has enjoyed runaway growth over the past 12 months. Having long eclipsed one-time rivals such as MySpace and Bebo, it now has about 500 million users sharing more than 25bn pieces of content a month. Zuckerberg's baby \u2013 which is valued at about $10bn, making the Harvard dropout one of the world's youngest paper billionaires \u2013 is now edging towards making a profit. Zuckerberg has said it is only a matter of time before it hits its 1 billionth user. Next, the bad. Hugely controversial changes to Facebook's privacy settings prompted one of the fiercest online backlashes of recent years. Critics accused it of playing fast and loose with people's data, opening up the amount of personal information users expose online and to advertisers. A \"Quit Facebook\" day organised by two Canadian campaigners may only have recruited a tiny proportion of Facebook's total users, but it was a PR blow for a company that had previously enjoyed almost uninterrupted goodwill. The site has also had to deal with privacy concerns from regulators both in the US and Europe. \"People think we don't care about privacy but that's not true,\" countered Zuckerberg, who overhauled the site's settings in response to the criticism. No wonder Zuckerberg \u2013 who had previously suggested that privacy was no longer a \"social norm\" \u2013 said it had been an \"intense few weeks\". The Facebook founder is the youngest person in the MediaGuardian 100 and makes our top 10 for the first time this year. New York-born Zuckerberg founded Facebook from his Harvard dorm room in 2004 as a way of helping students in US universities keep in touch with friends. Its mission statement: \"Making the world more open and connected\". The social media site, which has become an important platform for driving traffic towards news and media sites, generates most of its revenue by selling advertising space on users' pages. It will continue to do so after Zuckerberg indicated it would remain free. The Facebook campaign to save the BBC's digital radio station 6 Music was evidence of the site's effectiveness as a campaigning platform. But groups set up on its pages have not always met with universal approval, with fierce criticism of a page in memory of Raoul Moat. Facebook has double the number of users it had this time last year, and five times the number it had two years ago. The challenge for the company, which paid out $65m last year to end a lawsuit which accused Zuckerberg of stealing the idea for the site from three former Harvard classmates, is how to manage that phenomenal growth. Facebook's shareholders include Microsoft, which paid $240m for a 1.6% stake in 2007, and Russian company Digital Sky Technologies, which paid $200m for a 2% stake. Facebook bought Silicon Valley startup FriendFeed last year. The story of Facebook has been turned into a film, The Social Network, written by Aaron Sorkin, produced by Kevin Spacey and directed by David Fincher. \"You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies,\" says the trailer. Or without appearing in the top 10 of the MediaGuardian 100."
