  "content": "Be careful what you wish for \u2013 Monkey fears for Rod Liddle's personal safety after his latest rant in Thursday's Sun, where he says his resolution for 2012 is to \"become disabled\". Liddle writes that being disabled is \"incredibly fashionable\", it brings government cash, you don't need to work \u2013 and you can even get a car parking badge. But far from pulling his horns in after another shellacking on Twitter, the Rodster barrelled merrily along on his Spectator blog, asking if Britain has become a nation of immoral, lying, cheating, scumbags. He concluding that, thanks to journalists, we now know more about the \"chicanery of public figures\". Judging from the responses on Twitter, Liddle might want to reduce his own public profile or he could be enjoying those disability benefits sooner than he expects.",
