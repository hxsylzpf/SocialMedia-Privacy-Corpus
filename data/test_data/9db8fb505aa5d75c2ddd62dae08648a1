  "content": "The punishment for Closer magazine having breached the privacy of Julie Gayet is risible. A French court has ordered the publishers to pay her damages of \u20ac15,000 (\u00a312,000) and to publish its ruling on the front page of its next issue. The judge also banned Closer from selling or reprinting the photographs that revealed Gayet's friendship with France's president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Yet the pictures were taken b a paparazzo and Closer doesn't even have the rights to them. This knuckle-rapping verdict is unlikely to stop that magazine, or any other, from intruding into people's privacy in future. In commercial terms, it was worth breaking the law. Closer's editor, Laurence Pieau, has estimated that the magazine made about $2m (\u00a31.7m) from the Gayet-Hollande issue on 10 January. It was so popular that 150,000 extra copies of the magazine were printed after the original edition had sold out. In all, it sold more than 600,000 copies. Although Closer lost the case, it did not apologise for its actions. Instead, during the court case, it justified them on public interest grounds. For those in Britain who favour a privacy law, it is a sharp reminder that it would always be difficult to make the punishment fit the crime. The more worrying factor would, of course, be prior restraint to prevent publication. But even that would be open to a public interest defence. Meanwhile, the door to the bedrooms of France has certainly been opened by Pieau's magazine. Its philandering politicians had better beware in future."
