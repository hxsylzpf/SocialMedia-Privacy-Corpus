Into the inbox comes a charming missive telling us that our story about the 1% rule has won a \"Gold Reddit\" because it's \"the source of today's top link on reddit.com\" - see http://reddit.com/info/al9n/comments. So what do we do? Dance around the room? Yes, but also bury face in hands. (It's quite hard to bury your face in your hands while you dance around the room - you keep banging into things. But we managed it.) Why? Because we got the sums wrong in the story. More precisely, I - me - Charles - didn't check the sums on Antony Mayfield's site. Don't panic, now. The 1% rule still holds (and if you need a quick recap, it's this: in an average population of 100 people online, 1 will be a content creator, 10 will be content tweakers (adding comments or making suggestions) and 89 will just read/view/listen to it. There's independent evidence suggesting it's a pretty good rule of thumb. It's just that the proportion of people uploading stuff to YouTube is wayyyyy below 1%. Here are the stats from Antony's site (now, you'll note, marked \"Updated, corrected\"): 60% of all videos watched online are on YouTube 100 million downloads a day 65,000 uploads a day (that's 1,538 downloads per upload) However when one does the calculation of the ratio of uploads to downloads, you discover it's not 0.5% (as Antony originally said and I repeated) but 0.065%. Which is 15-fold shy of 1%. In other words, there are far fewer \"creators\" on YouTube than metrics from other organisations would lead you to expect. But I alluded to that in the story: video creation (even doing video grabs and preparing them in a format for upload) is difficult, much more difficult than writing a blog post. So I'm not surprised at the disparity. Oh, but in future, the calculator will come out on it all. Update: some more data points: Top 100 Digg Users Control 56% of Digg's HomePage Content: \"of all stories that make it to the front page of Digg, more than 20% come from a select group of 20 users. Digg isn't shy about hiding this fact, their top users page plainly displays the statistics\". Of course, with Digg, the story has to get dug(g) by others to reach the front, but that's your 10% in action."
