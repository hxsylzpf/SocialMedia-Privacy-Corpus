  "content": "Madonna (madonna) It's only in its early stages, but Madonna's account shows real promise. While most stars like to demonstrate what nice normal people they are, these pictures offer a truly frightening glimpse of life as the Margaret Thatcher of pop. So far we know she likes children (presumably her own), the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and scaring photographers. It's most ungallant of Instagram to threaten her with dismissal for \"mature content\". It would be a great loss to humanity if this were shut down. Typical shot: Sections of Madonna's face glaring at you. Beware: \"Addicted to sweat\". Post frequency: Two or three a week. Pet content: One horse, rear view. Jamie Oliver (jamieoliver) The artist formerly known as the Naked Chef has made Instagram yet another outpost of his multimedia empire, bringing us a 14th helping of what we already know and feel ambivalent about. Expect incessant enthusiasm for food, chummy relationships with anything that moves, and a tastefully glossy sheen covering it all. When a fox killed his black swan on Saturday, he gave us a poignant photograph of the bloodstained eggs, when what we really want is video of him chasing it around with a boning knife. Typical shot: \"Pimped chocolate tiramisu\". Beware: Evidence of perfect family. Post frequency: Daily. Pet content: Low (swan aside). Kim Kardashian (kim kardashian) She knows what the public wants, that Kim Kardashian, and luckily it's exactly what she wants to give them: ceaseless half-clothed pouting surrounded by evidence of money. If this account shows us the real Kim, then her image as a clothes- and attention-obsessed numbskull is fully earned. If it doesn't, she's a genius. Typical shot: D\u00e9colletage having dinner; decolletage after the apocalypse; d\u00e9colletage taking a hard-earned break.. Beware: Vapid handwritten homilies. Approximate post frequency: Daily. Pet content: Low, unless you count children. Rihanna (badgalriri) What the kids don't understand about life as an international pop star and glamour icon is how much smoking you have to do to achieve your dreams. Rihanna's account puts the record straight, along with a few subtle hints about what precisely you need to smoke in order to be as cool as her. The price we pay is rather a lot of stoned wisdom. Typical shot: Rihanna's bottom. Beware: Her Jesus days. Post frequency: Near-constant. Pet content: None. Lena Dunham (lenadunham) It's fair to say that this is not a very airbrushed picture of Dunham's daily life. It also seems fair to say that Dunham's daily life involves mostly pottering about in comfortable clothes and being witty to her dog. At least she is witty, which is a rare quality on Instagram, especially among celebrities. Typical shot: Friend beneath duvet, 2013. Beware: Fishing for compliments. Post frequency: Daily. Pet content: High, always dog. Justin Bieber (justinbieber) If it's a choice between him and Harry Styles, stick with the original. Styles gives more or less the picture of boyband life you might expect: backstage hijinks and views from hotel windows. Bieber, on the other hand, has had a few years' practice, and has become entertainingly strange. At times worrying. At others, probably not worth thinking too much about. But always unintentionally hilarious. Typical shot: Look, I'm even handsome sideways! Beware: Weird self-mythologising. Post frequency: Twice a day. Pet content: Low, but a lot of younger relatives."
