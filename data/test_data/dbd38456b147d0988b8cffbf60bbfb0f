  "content": "It's what ChatRoulette was invented for \u2013 so a chap in a hoodie at the piano can make up songs about whatever you are doing \u2013 immediately! The keyboard guy clearly knows his stuff, and fortunately wasn't required to make up a song about anything too, you know ... un-family friendly. The voice, the piano skills, and those big glasses prompted speculation that it could be none other than Ben Folds, formerly of Ben Folds Five fame and now just plain old BF. The piano man later denied he was Ben Folds, according to reports. But he would say that wouldn't he? Looks familiar?"
