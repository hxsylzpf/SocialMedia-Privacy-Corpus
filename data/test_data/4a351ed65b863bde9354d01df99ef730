  "content": "It was a tough weekend for David Moyes, leading to Tuesday morning's news that the Manchester United manager had been sacked by the club. Legoland Discovery Centre in Manchester couldn't help but pile on the misery for Moyes, tweeting a picture on Monday afternoon featuring a teary-eyed Moyes waiting suitcase in hand outside Old Trafford, lovingly created out of blocks. The caption read: \"Rumours are rife at @ManUtd right now. Is that a taxi we see?', #TaxiForMoyes?\" It tweeted it again on Tuesday with obvious glee. Was this the final straw for the Man Utd board? Monkey hopes Lego will picture a similar scene featuring David Cameron in time for the next general election."
