  "content": "Having seen the recent report from ComScore, the growing popularity of Snapchat among millennials (people aged 18-34) is clear \u2013 along with a shift which sees a move away from the use of traditional social media such as Facebook among younger generations. Snapchat taps into people's greater desire for privacy through self-destructing content. Teens want to share without fear of the potentially embarrassing legacy content being stored on channels like Twitter, which may come back to haunt them in later life. The channel has provided a forum prime for sexting \u2013 the act of sending sexually explicit messages, primarily between mobile phones \u2013 which has become popular among an audience keen to explore their sexuality. Lynx's Snapchat experiment For more strait-laced brands, opening up a channel prone to sexting might seem like a PR nightmare. Lynx's Snapchat experiment, however, embraced this and addressed the issue head on, in a way that suited the brand proposition. For the launch party of its new fragrance, Deep Space, Lynx used the app to leak exclusive content featuring host Charlie Webster on a photoshoot. As the brand shared photos, they drove a great response. For those responses which were a little close to the line, Lynx replied with an image of the new Deep Space shower gel, urging people to clean up and take a cold shower. As one of the first brands to use this platform, Lynx clearly showed Snapchat can be used to build deeper engagement with fans. Behind the scenes at McDonald's Likewise, it's this need for voyeurism that US-based McDonald's exploited in its use of Snapchat, albeit in a more family friendly way. When filming the TV launch of its new sandwich, McDonald's invited fans to connect for the chance to see exclusive photos from the shoot. As a familiar brand, people expect to see big budget ads, so giving its audience the chance to see behind the scenes is a great way to engage and give the audience a reason to follow. Using Snapchat to offer sneak previews is one of the most common themes among brands with the likes of the National Basketball Association, and fashion brands releasing exclusive first looks at new collections. But like most social activities, some of the best uses of a new channel are when they're incorporated into the broader channel mix. Southampton Football Club's treasure hunt Southampton FC used Snapchat to help announce its move back to a traditional stripe pattern on their kit for the Premier League season 2014-15. Hosting a treasure hunt around the city, the club gave fans the chance to win a new shirt before they went on general sale. Snapchat was used along with Twitter and Facebook to give different clues to the locations of hundreds of footballs hidden around the city which fans could take a selfie and post using the hashtag #EarnYourStripes for a chance to win the new kit. These are great examples, but before a brand takes a running jump into Snapchat it needs to consider three key points: 1) What's in it for the user? Be it sneak previews, exclusive content, offers, the point remains the same: as a user I should be able to see the benefit I will gain from following the brand on Snapchat which I couldn't get through any other platform. 2) Don't just use it for the sake of it The use of new (and old) channels are much more effective when used as part of a broader mix. 3) Be brave and be creative Snapchat presents brands with a whole new set of opportunities to engage its audience. Brands need to be brave and exploit the unique functionalities. Be creative to ensure you stand out from the crowd and become the brand an audience wants to engage with. It's still early days for Snapchat, but if the latest reports about its popularity are anything to go by, it's not a channel which is going anywhere soon.
