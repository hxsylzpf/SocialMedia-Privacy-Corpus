  "content": "The EU's so-called \"right to be forgotten\" laws have not gone far enough to protect citizens' privacy, according to Dan Geer, one of the world's best-known security experts. Geer, currently chief information security officer at the CIA's venture capital arm, told delegates at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas that he was confused by the Guardian's coverage of the issue. The so called \"right to be forgotten\" issue stemmed from a European court of justice ruling, forcing Google to remove a link relating to a 1998 newspaper article from its search results after a complaint from the person named in the article. Geer described it as \"notably ironic\" that the Guardian had championed Edward Snowden's revelations about intrusion by government agencies into civilians' privacy, while also claiming in one editorial (though he did not specify which) that nobody has a right to be forgotten. Speaking at the conference, Geer said: \"Au contraire, mesdames et messieurs, they most assuredly do.\" Some commentators have declared the ruling a threat to press freedom as it allows people to have stories with \"irrelevant, outdated or incorrect\" information about them removed from search results in Google, and other Europe-based search engines, for searches on their name. \"I don't think the right to be forgotten is nearly strong enough,\" Greer said. \"In a sense digital rights management and privacy are the same thing. It is possible to reinvent yourself. This disappears when there is enough data and I'd like to think there is something important about being able to reinvent yourself that we shouldn't give up.\" Vanishing rights Greer continued: \"I conclude that a unitary, unfakeable digital identity is no bargain and that I don't want one. I want to choose whether to misrepresent myself. I may rarely use that, but it is my right to do so. If that right vanishes into the panopticon [a system of perpetual surveillance] I have lost something and, in my view, gained next to nothing. \"In that regard, and acknowledging that it is a baby step, I conclude that the EU's right to be forgotten is both appropriate and advantageous though it does not go far enough.\" Speaking to the conference, Geer described the removal of links to oneself as like moving to a new town or changing one's name: \"a definition of privacy that turns on whether you do or do not retain the effective capacity to misrepresent yourself, a right which I will remind you is routinely granted but to those who have especially helped governmental causes [such as] witness protection.\" He called the right to be forgotten \"the only check on the tidal wave of observability that a ubiquitous sensor fabric is birthing now, observability that changes the very quality of what 'in public' means.\" He pointed to sites and organisations that block \"deep links\" directly to pages within a site, bypassing its front page, and governments which are blocking other indexing, and said that they are effectively claiming that the right to be forgotten, or not , \"is inherently theirs\". The only democratising brake on this runaway train is for individuals to be able, in their own small way, to do the same as do other entities,\" he concluded. Google: against the \"right to be forgotten\" Soon after the ruling in May, the Guardian received notifications from Google that six of the publication's articles had been removed from the tech giant's search results \u2013 though not the names against which they had been removed. Google later reversed a number of the removals. It says it has a number of \"paralegals\" who determine whether to accept removal requests. Google, which has more than 90% of the search market in Europe, has insisted that removals from its index only apply for searches using a complainant's name \u2013 not generic terms that would normally find the same page. The original pages remain untouched online. The search company has noted numerous times it is against the idea of the right to be forgotten, which the European commission is keen to further entrench with data protection regulations currently being debated in Brussels. Some claimed Google tried to create negative press around the laws by convincing journalists the right would be harmful for freedom of expression and information. Jimmy Wales is wrong: we do have a personal right to be forgotten",
