  "content": "As the internet consolidates its position as the dominant medium(s) of our era, it's not just Amazon's terrifying brand reach - with the new smart phone app that allows people to use bricks and mortar booksellers as 3D versions of itself - that's affecting the consumption of reading. More and more, we are getting to our information via Facebook, Twitter and other online networks, and that seems to go double for books: there is an exponentially growing number of people coming to their information and shopping via recommendations on social \u2013 or \"socialising\" as I like to call them \u2013 media. So I sat up when I saw that Lady Gaga, one of the web's commanding giga-stars \u2013 with 21.5m followers on Twitter (Stephen Fry has a mere 4m) \u2013 has recommended a book, on Facebook. \"L\u00fcc Carl Buy his book. HE'S AWESOME!!!!! Great memoir about losing weight on your own terms.\" Within a matter of hours, more than 15,000 people had \"liked\" it, a pretty reliable indicator of a coming \"viral\" success, since the socialising networks can magnify the book trade's treasured \"word-of-mouth\" marketing to a global scale in a matter of days. If Oprah Winfrey was able to make a star out of web sceptic Jonathan Franzen with her TV show, what Gaga might do for L\u00fcc Carl boggles one's reading glasses. And given that her 21.5m followers - the healthily \"troubled adolescent\" Little Monsters, as she calls them \u2013 are mostly the notoriously book-phobic but economically vital teen demographic, the potential for her to become a book trade player to rank alongside eminences grises like Jeff Bezos, is plainly vast. Since she's a tremendously successful pop star with a highly polished (if avant-garde) media profile, can we safely presume she'll be bigging up trash? Well, I haven't read the book, but I want to. And remember that her \"favourite philosopher\" is Rilke, whose influence on her she has honoured with a tattoo reading \"'In the deepest hour of the night, confess to yourself that you would die if you were forbidden to write. And look deep into your heart where it spreads its roots, the answer, and ask yourself, must I write?\" She is not without class, reader. Sante's website describes The Drunk Diet as \"memoirs of a year in which he went from being an out of shape, bloated asshole, to the sexiest, most delightful man on the planet. You will not find any 'do this, don't do that' in The Drunk Diet. This is simply one ordinary rock'n'roller's story, filled with awe-inspiring, hilarious accounts of his day to day life. \"After reading countless books and being told time after time that it's impossible to lose weight while drinking alcohol heavily, L\u00fcc Carl decided to take matters into his own hands. Join him on his journey to lose 40 pounds, without giving up his principles of being a hard drinking party maker.\" Many of the Little Monsters are struggling with eating disorders (like all of the rest of us, to a less acute degree) and as someone who tried and failed a couple of years ago to pitch a mass market title, The Eat What You Fancy Plan (\"Pioneered by Mother Nature. Now available to humanity\"), seeking the same demographic with fun and jokey recipes inspired obliquely by Adorno's micro-essay in Minima Moralia, The Sickness Unto Health, I'm immediately digging the idea of the book. The internet's potential, as Walter Benjamin continues to remind us from before its invention, is genuinely revolutionary... In a world where artefacts are stripped of their \"aura\" the citizen can discover the potential of cultivating their own critical thinking faculties. This is something that teenage girls, particularly, desperately trying to conform to the warped phantasms of healthy bodies in the media, could do with acquiring more of. Benjamin was no starry-eyed Utopian, and his essay also predicts that Hollywood would strive to reproduce the aura of traditional, site-specific art wonders with reified myths. In Lady Gaga, we have a great star who is busy dismantling such morbid, market-driven constructions from within. With all this, and apart from her other humungous commercial successes, she might yet save the book trade, too."
