  "content": "Online campaigners have already started fighting Conservative plans to introduce new surveillance powers. The proposed powers appear in the draft communications data bill, labelled as a snooper's charter, was announced in 2012 and subjected to widespread criticism and blocked previously by the Liberal Democrats. The bill expands existing communications data retention requirements and grants access to law enforcement and other public authorities, in an effort to assist intelligence agencies and the police investigate crime and terrorism. However, the obligations imposed upon electronic communications services providers (CSPs) raise serious issues for both them and the public. Application of the draft communications data bill The draft bill regulates CSPs and applies to communications data. Communications data is generated by CSPs in the transmission of electronic messages; telephone, internet access, or email. It includes the identity of the sender and recipient of a message; time of sending and potentially the geographical location. It may also include subscribers' names and billing address, though not the content of the message. The bill requires CSPs to retain more data and to make it available to enforcement and other public authorities. However, these obligations are clearly problematic: the greater the volume of data held, and the more people it is made available to, the higher the likelihood of it being compromised, whether through accidental loss, damage, destruction or unauthorised access. Further, the bill increases the risk of cyber-attacks and conflicts with existing data protection and privacy laws, as explained further below. Cyber risk Cyber risk is an increasingly recognised threat. Cyber-attacks and cyber breaches feature in the headlines on a near daily basis and are perceived by many businesses and governments as one of the biggest challenges they face. Within the cyber-security community is an oft-used phrase: \"There are two sorts of organisation: those who have been hacked and those who just don't know it.\" No longer the sole preserve of the teenager in a bedroom, hacking is a powerful tool used by organised criminals, state-sponsored \"cyber armies\" and so-called hacktivists. Business, government and the public face an ever increasing risk from cyber-attack, and mounting costs in addressing the risk. Central to a well-considered cyber-security strategy is retaining only that information which is necessary. Frequently, where organisations undertake forensic IT investigations as part of a security strategy, swathes of redundant information are found, increasing cost and risk to the organisation for no benefit. Deleting redundant data is clearly an exercise in risk management and containment. Yet the bill would require companies to retain data above and beyond their business needs, increasing their exposure to the risk of cyber-attack. Data protection legislation Data protection laws apply to information about people; from identifiers such as name, address, employment history or medical records, to more subtle identifiers, such as social networking content, browser history or call log. The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) imposes a number of principles on organisations that use personal information. These include transparency, where people must be told how their information is used and by whom; organisations must not collect excessive personal information and what they do collect should not be kept for longer than is necessary; and citizens have a right to access the data held about them by organisations and to object to processing where it causes damage and distress. These principles appear at odds with the snooper's charter. Data protection rules have increasingly become more of a concern for organisations. Potential fines for breaches have increased from \u00a35,000 to \u00a3500,000. The trend set to continue, as Europe seeks to implement a new law with fines of up to \u20ac100m for non-compliance. The bill's requirement to retain more data and make it available to an increasing number of recipients increases the risk of breaching data protection laws, leaving CSPs between a rock and a hard place, and eroding individuals' rights. Privacy law A common law concept of privacy is increasingly being recognised by the courts. The concept, enshrined in and evolving through case law, is more amorphous than the DPA. It acknowledges, for example, that employees may have a right to privacy over their communications in the workplace, even when using the employer's systems. Or a person in severe distress has an expectation of privacy even in a public place, while celebrity in a public place may still be doing a private thing. This subtle and complex right conflicts with the blanket collection of the who, when and where of peoples' interactions. The bill would allow the state to create a detailed picture of a person's personal life, including what they view online, who they talk to and where they go. Conclusion The draft communications data bill creates a significant burden for CSPs, who will be required to invest significantly in managing the balancing act between the bill and conflicting data protection and privacy law. But it ultimately comes down to a financial cost, a line on a balance sheet, to be passed on to the customer. The risk to the citizen is profound. Eavesdropping on a person's communications, his or her everyday interactions, enables the state to build an intricate and intimate picture of that person's life. There should be no dispute over the need to maintain national security, but is mass surveillance really the answer?
