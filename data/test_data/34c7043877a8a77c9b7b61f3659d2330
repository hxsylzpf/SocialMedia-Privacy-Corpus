  "content": "Consumers are to be given new powers to ask companies to hand over their personal customer data so that they can make more informed choices on how they spend their own money. Companies will have to release data about a person's consumption or transactions in an electronic machine-readable standard format upon request. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills plans to bring in legislation if companies fail to co-operate. Possible legislation will focus on three \"core\" sectors: current accounts and credit cards, mobile phones and energy, with further powers to extend the legislation to other sectors if appropriate. The plan \u2013 branded \"midata\" by the department \u2013 is being launched by the consumer affairs minister, Jo Swinson. The proposal has been drafted by ministers with help from evidence provided by the government's behavioural insights team, or \"nudge unit\". Swinson said: \"Many businesses reap huge commercial benefits from the information they gather from consumers' daily spending patterns. Why shouldn't consumers also benefit from this by having access to their own data to enable them to make better choices? \"It's great when your energy provider tells you how much gas or electricity you're using at any point in the year or when phone companies tell you which one of their tariffs suits you best. But it's even better when consumers can use that information to get better value for money deals or adjust their lifestyles.\" Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?, said: \"We're pleased to see the government putting in place measures to give people the right to data that companies hold on them. Giving consumers more power with their personal data will help them make better use of their money, and that's not only good for customer-friendly businesses, but good for growth in the economy.\" The government argues the relationship between businesses and their customers is now about more than simply buying products. With the popularity of loyalty cards, comparison sites and mobile apps, businesses are increasingly helping consumers manage their lives. The department said \"midata\" had made significant progress as a voluntary measure, with more than 20 leading businesses in the energy, finance and telecoms sectors signing up."
