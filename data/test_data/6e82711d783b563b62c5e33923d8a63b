Ian McEwan has inspired me to fill my own green notebooks with a novel of my own! @Dulcie_Lee Vince Cable at #GdnOpenWeekend: \"Your security makes government look quite amateurish\" @PreeceOfficer Sat in the sun on the Battlebridge basin. A delightful little marina full of canal boats, the smell of breakfast in the air #gdnopenweekend @ClaraBreen Excellent one-liners and endless inspiration from a true one-off: Grayson Perry's chatter yesterday @DanuelKC Absolutely brilliant layout of @GdnOpenWeekend. If only music festivals were this modern! @iCoo The arts funding budget for Berlin is greater than the entire budget for the arts across England. Thoughtful discussion at @GdnOpenWeekend @unfortunatalie They have a CHEESE BOAT. CHEESE. ON A BOAT. #gdnopenweekend @marymaryw Son complimented as natural headline writer and daughter's front page praised by Observer reader editor. #ahem @mackechrun Lively debate at @GdnOpenWeekend on religion, atheism and culture. Atheism can be too extreme. Is a better alternative an agnostic culture? @andrealync Enjoyed watching Grayson on my laptop sitting in my sunny garden! Very entertaining @TheBookBarge There's nothing like 5,000 Guardian readers to skew poetry sales for the year... #GdnOpenWeekend @OhVinoir #SteveMcQueen probably the pick of the bunch do far. Inspiring and profound explorations of all taboos he enjoys exploring @siobhanwatts @dan_lepard is so endearing &amp; his bread baking session is by far my highlight. Can't wait to put his tips into practice @chrissiemurray Michael White: Conservative party a \"leaderist\" party. Adonis: Labour not ruthless enough after Blair. #GdnOpenWeekend @olealsaker Former al-Jazeera head @khanfarw: journos' future role will be to analyse, citizen journos will set the agenda #GdnOpenWeekend @SSchonfield Feeling old-fashioned with a laptop (not iPad) at #gdnopenweekend, trying to brush up job application for tomorrow @pollset Elderly woman nods vehemently when Steve McQueen announces: \"We all have the urge to fuck and be fucked\" #gdnopenweekend @PeterMannionMP #GdnOpenWeekend novel, but being sat inside with hundreds of Guardian readers on such a glorious day like being in the 7th circle of hell \u2026 @Diddydavid Am I the only one who's managed to get a little too drunk at #GdnOpenWeekend ? @Angelina Karpovich What is the collective noun for a huge friendly crowd of Guardian readers? I vote for \"a gentle murmur\" ;-) @edwards_jen Ian McEwan describes in great detail his writing process, including colour of his notebook + the shop where he bought it @amycking Alain de Botton and Giles Fraser make a great conversational pair @martinnbrown Quite enjoyed a session on architecture. It's like going to see a band you've never heard of @ Glastonbury! @5aik Astonishingly inspiring day @GdnOpenWeekend. Thanks so much for putting it on! So much awesomeness all going on at once! @tom_bell95 What inspired me: The sheer extent of The Guardian's desire to develop an infrastructure for collaboration with its readers @RoxanneNejad Ian McEwan swirling his water like a fine whisky during #gdnopenweekend Q&amp;A @TwitTwooUK Dr Charlie Alcock dedicated to helping young people on the edge of society. Easily the most inspirational story I heard today @moreelf Not a moment exactly but way people attending have struck up conversations and been nice to each other. Unusual! @TheVintageYear Jonathan Scott introducing himself to a reader of 40 years as \"CP's grandson\". She nearly fell off her chair",
