  "content": "The man charged over his role in Australia's deadly bushfires was a loner obsessed with fire and was bitter about an ex-girlfriend, it was claimed today. Brendan Sokaluk, 39, a former volunteer firefighter, is facing one count of deadly arson and one of lighting a wildfire in connection with a fire around the town of Churchill, in which at least 11 people were killed. As the only person so far charged with starting some of the fires which have killed 189 people in total, Sokaluk has been the focus of much of the anger among the Australian population. At a Victoria court hearing today, magistrate John Klestadt lifted the suppression order on Sokaluk's name but ordered that his photograph and address should not be released. Sokaluk, who has been in protective custody since Friday, was in the court precinct but did not appear because of security concerns. Despite the court order, at least three Facebook groups had already \"named and shamed\" him, and have posted his photograph. \"Tie the bastard to a post and put a ring of fire around him ... let the fire make its way to him and make him suffer like the other 100's of people had to endure,\" wrote one. And from another: \"He should be thrown into his creation and left to burn.\" According to neighbours, Sokaluk was a loner who loved to play with fire. At least once a month he would light a backyard blaze that would blanket the neighbourhood in smoke. \"Quite often at night you would see thick black smoke coming from his backyard,\" one neighbour told the Australian. \"He must have been burning rubber or tyres because it was really strong on the nose. We would have to shut all the windows.\" Other reports suggested he was in a relationship with a volunteer firefighter. Remarks on his MySpace page suggest his suspicion that the woman had been unfaithful. Sokaluk, who has no friends on his Facebook page, seems preoccupied with love, revenge and finding a girlfriend. Writing about himself, he says: \"I'm a young happy male who wants to meet a young loven female to marrid.\" [sic] He also wrote: \"My hero is mother earth \u2014 without her we all would be dead.\" Sokaluk was a gardener for Melbourne's Monash University, but was sacked three years ago, according to the Herald Sun. It was also revealed that Sokaluk joined the Churchill brigade of the Country Fire Authority in the late 1980s. He left the brigade in the 1990s and attempted to rejoin twice, but was rejected. Four days after the Churchill fire which he is accused of lighting, Sokaluk logged on to another social networking website, myYearbook, and wrote that his mood was \"dirty\" because \"no one love [sic] him\". Sokaluk's lawyer, Helen Spowart, urged the court to continue the suppression of his name amid serious concerns for his safety and that of his family. \"This is an extraordinary case,\" she said. \"The level of emotion and anger and disgust that the alleged offences have aroused in the community is unprecedented ... he remains in risk while in custody.\" Earlier today, the funeral of 22-year-old victim Greg Lloyd was held. He had been looking after a house in Yarra Glen with his girlfriend, 23-year-old Melanee Hermocilla, and her brother Jaeson, 21, when fire swept through the area."
