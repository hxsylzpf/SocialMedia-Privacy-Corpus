  "content": "Job: founder, chief executive, Tumblr Age: 27 Industry: digital media New entry David Karp is this list's $1bn man. Well, $1.1bn to be precise after Tumblr, the blogging platform he founded six years ago in the bedroom of his mother's New York apartment, was bought by Yahoo earlier this year. Karp could be worth an estimated $220m after the purchase of Tumblr \u2013 seen as a bid to make Yahoo cool again \u2013 which attracts 38 million unique visitors a month. Yahoo chief executive Marissa Meyer promised \"not to screw it up\" \u2013 with memories of previous ill-fated purchases including Flickr, Delicious and GeoCities \u2013 and said Karp would be left alone to do what he does best: \"create\". Karp, who was building websites for businesses aged 11, is the latest high school or college dropout to make his digital fortune, following the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Napster's Sean Parker. Still only 27, he turned Tumblr into one of the hottest properties on the web. Following its purchase by Yahoo, he told staff that the deal meant Tumblr would get \"better faster\" before signing off, \"Fuck yeah.\" Indeed.",
