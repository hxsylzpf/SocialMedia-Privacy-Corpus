  "content": "The popularity of sites such as Facebook and MySpace is driving growth in public relations as companies tap into the power of recommendation, according to WPP advertising boss Sir Martin Sorrell. The group yesterday reported a weaker-than-expected third quarter, knocking its shares - but it revealed that revenues from PR were growing strongly. \"It is unusual for it to be so strong at this stage in the cycle and the reasoning behind it is to do with social networking and the web,\" said Sir Martin. \"Social networking seems to underline the importance of editorial publicity. Social networking is really recommendation between people about the things that they are interested in and they like... this has stimulated people's attention.\" WPP's third quarter update showed an 11% jump in revenues from public relations and public affairs to \u00a3157.3m, making it one of the group's strongest drivers. Sir Martin said that companies' increasing focus on getting into news stories reflected an appetite among web users for \"ideas and knowledge\" from apparently \"independent\" sources. Using a PR company to generate more coverage also helps brands get around social networkers' typical aversion to adverts, he added."
