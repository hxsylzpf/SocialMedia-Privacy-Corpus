  "content": "Kanye West has cancelled an appearance on Today, the popular US morning news programme, to protest a perceived slight against him when he was interviewed earlier this week on the same show about his claim in the wake of Hurricane Katrina that George Bush \"doesn't care about black people\". The US rapper had been due to perform on 26 November but cancelled after what he described as a \"set up\" during an appearance on the show, broadcast by America's NBC television network. West used his Twitter page yesterday to publicise his decision, saying: \"I'm not performing on the Today Show for obvious reasons. I'm so happy the world got to see just a small piece of 'the set up'.\" The dispute stems from his comment after the 2005 hurricane that the US government was slow to respond because Bush, president at the time, \"doesn't care about black people\". Largely black areas in and around New Orleans were devastated by the disaster. Bush referred to West's criticism in his recently released memoirs and told Today interviewer Matt Lauer: \"I resent it. It's not true. And it was one of the most disgusting moments of my presidency.\" The former president's remarks were widely regarded as having been some of the most emotional comments made by him during a lengthy interview that covered topics including the September 11 attacks, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Katrina disaster. When Lauer interviewed West on the programme on Wednesday to discuss Bush's reaction, the hip-hop artist appeared to back down from his criticism, saying: \"I would tell George Bush in my moment of frustration I didn't have the grounds to call him a racist.\" But West grew agitated when producers played video during the interview, including silent video of Bush's interview with Lauer. \"I didn't need you guys to show me the tape to prompt my emotion,\" West said. Lauer then asked West about an incident during last year's MTV video music awards ceremony when he grabbed the microphone to protest an award for the country-pop singer Taylor Swift, which he said should have gone to the R&amp;B superstar Beyonce. When Today played video of that incident with the sound at low volume, West said: \"How am I supposed to talk if you're going to run this thing while I'm talking?\" \"Please don't let that happen again. It's like ridiculous.\" He later complained on Twitter about how he was treated, calling the display of the video disrespectful. Lauer has defended the use of video as standard television practice."
