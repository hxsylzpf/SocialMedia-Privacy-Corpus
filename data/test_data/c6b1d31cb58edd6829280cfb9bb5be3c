  "content": "Hollywood star George Clooney has found himself embroiled in a spat with his new neighbours, who claim the actor's plans for an 18-camera CCTV system at his \u00a310m home in Sonning Eye would be a violation of their privacy. Clooney is seeking planning permission to put up eight cameras on wooden poles in the grounds of Mill House and attach a further 10 to the Grade II-listed property, which he bought with his wife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney in October. Six of the poles would be four metres high, another would be five metres high and the eighth would be six metres, according to local paper the Henley Standard. Each camera would be housed in a protective vandal-resistant dome and could be tilted to face in any direction. Eye and Dunsden parish council said the wide range of the cameras represented a potential infringement of the privacy of neighbouring properties and the poles would be a visual intrusion into the village's conservation area. \"A more appropriate security system could be achieved by a greater number of inward-facing, low-level cameras,\" it said. But the decision falls to South Oxfordshire district council, whose conservation officer has recommended approval of the planning permission as long as the cameras can easily be removed from the building. Two months ago, the district council also approved the Clooneys' plans for a new swimming pool, pool house, home cinema and annexe, a replacement river house and new boundary fencing, despite opposition from the parish council, who wanted fencing set further back from the river. The couple were asked to reduce the size of the river house, which they agreed to. It is believed that the couple bought the 17th-century Mill House from London banker Omar Bayoumi after George Clooney fell for the area when filming scenes from The Monuments Men in the nearby Buckinghamshire village of Fingest last June. The nine-bedroom property, formerly known as Aberlash House, sits on a four-acre island in the Thames. It was once owned by the lords of the manor of Sonning, and is just an hour from Highclere Castle, the 5,000-acre estate used in hit TV show Downton Abbey."
