  "content": "Lord Justice Leveson has indicated that he believes social networks such as Twitter and Facebook should be treated differently from newspapers in any new regulatory regime for the media. Leveson said on Thursday there was a difference between an online version of a newspaper or an online magazine and social media websites which are hosting conversations between individuals. \"I think that I might see there is a distinction between Facebook, where one person is communicating with their friends, or Twitter, and organisations that are in the business of selling themselves with reference to news or information. \"That is the difference between the pub chatter, to take the analogy that was mentioned before, and that which the state \u2013 I don't mean government, I say immediately, but the broad corpus of all of us \u2013 has an interest in seeing as a level playing field,\" he added. Leveson has stressed on several occasions during his inquiry that he has not reached any conclusions about the best form of future press regulation, but is seeking to explore potential options in his discussions with witnesses. He has publicly grappled with the question of regulation of the internet, after hearing how celebrities and public figures have found it difficult to stop offensive material or private photos being spread virally almost instantly. He has also heard a succession of national newspaper editors and proprietors say they believe that news aggregators such as the Huffington Post should be encouraged to join any new regulatory regime, otherwise traditional print media could be subject to stricter regulation and left at a disadvantage. Last year Leveson heard from Harry Potter author JK Rowling, who told how she fears photographs of her children, taken without consent, are still on the internet. \"A lie can spread around the world before the truth had got its boots on,\" she said. Former Formula One boss Max Mosley told of his \u00a3500,000 battle to have false Nazi references removed from the internet after he won a privacy action against the News of the World. He said he was forced to sue Google in France and Germany to get the libellous content taken down and has launched legal action in 22 or 23 countries. Mosley described his strenuous efforts to get articles removed from websites, adding: \"The fundamental thing is that Google could stop this appearing but they don't or won't as a matter of principle.\" On Thursday Google executives defended their policies on libel and defamation to Leveson, telling the judge they complied with local law around the world. Daphne Keller, the legal director of Google, said material would be removed in a matter of days if they were shown a court order where a judge found material to be defamatory. Keller confirmed hundreds of references to Mosley had been removed, but said he would have to apply individually to have webpage URLs removed from Google's sites in different countries. The inquiry also heard on Thursday from the co-founder of gossip site Popbitch, who told Leveson that the service she provided was very different to that of newspapers because it was on the internet. She said unlike a newspaper, it was a \"two-way conversation\" and readers expected to be able to respond to stories, give feedback and help shape stories about celebrities. Camilla Wright told the Leveson inquiry she had certain rules about not covering health issues or children but it was very difficult to \"say where the line would be\" between legitimate public interest and stories the public is interested in. \"It's a moving line, there's no absolute line. We look at who is making themselves influential and if so are they living up to it,\" Wright said. She added that a lot of celebrities \"live beyond their talent\" and put themselves in the public eye and Popbitch liked to provide a \"counter\" point to that and to poke fun. \"They [celebrities] are there for our fun and it can be a bit darker and they are for people to joke at,\" she told Leveson, adding \"you can't choose when are you are public and when you are private\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
