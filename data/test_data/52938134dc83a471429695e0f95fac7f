  "content": "What do Britain's journalists tweet about? Throughout the month of February Tweetminster analysed 82,340 tweets posted by UK media sources and journalists on Twitter. This infographic visualises what they talked about. It aims to display each source's level of activity on Twitter and the attention that each source gave to different news stories and topics during February 2011. A list of accounts for each source can be found here. These are some of the findings that we found most interesting: \u2022 Sky News is the most active news source among UK media on Twitter. \u2022 While as expected most top stories are common across all news sources, there are insightful differences between each source. \u2022 The Independent is particularly keen on the AV referendum, and together with the Telegraph, is the source with the most political party-related news stories. \u2022 The Telegraph was the source that posted the most stories about Barack Obama and the Royal Wedding* . \u2022 Of the sources analysed, The Financial Times is the only one that provides significant coverage of China, focuses heavily on US news and has consistently reported on inflation. \u2022 Channel 4 News and BBC News follow similar news agendas. The BBC has been particularly paying attention to job losses and prices. \u2022 The Guardian is more interested than others in phone hacking, and together with The Independent is the source that has most reported on cuts. \u2022 Sky News has plenty of sources, and consistently reports on ministerial statements. \u2022 While both appear further down the lists, it's surprising to see the Oscars in the top-spots, while not finding the Liberal Democrats or EU-related stories among the top-20 trends of any of the analysed sources. \u2022 Compared to a previous analysis (of the Coalition Government's first 100 days in office), several trends remain central to the UK's media coverage, including David Cameron, banks, the Big Society and cuts, while other topics have dropped out of the media limelight - the most notable example being the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. *(not as part of the same stories) You can get a PDF of the graphic above.
