  "content": "Facebook's move to tighten its rules on gun advertising has failed to satisfy the pro- and anti-gun lobby. The social network has become one of the world's largest marketplaces for guns, and has come under pressure to clamp down on illegal sales. Craigslist, Google and eBay all prohibit unlicensed gun sales. On Wednesday the company announced a series of \"educational and enforcement\" measures regarding discussion of guns and other regulated items on its network. Following a campaign by law enforcement officials and gun control advocates the company introduced age limits for posts and pages promoting private sales of firearms. The company is also planning a public service ad campaign encouraging private firearm sellers to perform background checks. Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of global policy management said the company \"will not permit people to post offers to sell regulated items that indicate a willingness to evade or help others evade the law. For example, private sellers of firearms in the US will not be permitted to specify 'no background check required,' nor can they offer to transact across state lines without a licensed firearms dealer.\" The changes come after investigations that found it could take as little as 15 minutes for children or people without IDs to buy guns on Facebook pages. Last year Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, sent Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg a letter saying that \"a recent review of Facebook found a number of groups in which users promoted the sale of assault rifles, handguns, rifles, shotguns and gun parts.\" Schneiderman noted that the site's users could easily circumvent a New York law requiring background checks. The company was also under pressure from groups including Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America to tighten its rules. Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, called the changes \"meaningful steps to prevent illegal gun sales to children and dangerous people.\" Other groups were more critical. In a statement, Daniel Gross of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said: \"This new policy is not a victory because Facebook continues to make it too easy for dangerous people to evade a background check when buying guns. A mere warning to follow the law and community-based reporting will not do enough to prevent unchecked gun sales to dangerous people.\" \"As we and thousands of others have told Facebook, unlicensed gun sales have no place on the social network. Facebook should prohibit all posts that advertise the unlicensed sale or transfer of firearms in the United States. Sadly, it's only a matter of time before a gun purchased through Facebook without a background check is used in a terrible tragedy.\" Gun rights groups too slammed Facebook. Chris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association, said the changes were so minor that its opponents had \"failed\". \"The NRA enjoys 150 times more support on Facebook than Michael Bloomberg's Mayors Against Illegal Guns. That's why Bloomberg and the gun control groups he funds tried to pressure Facebook into shutting down discussion of Second Amendment issues on its social media platforms. Bloomberg failed. NRA members and our supporters will continue to have a platform to exercise their First Amendment rights in support of their Second Amendment freedoms,\" said Cox. On Facebook people took to the the Guns For Sale page to voice their anger at the change. The page, which has been liked 215,000 times, allows people to post pictures and details of the firearms they have for sale. \"We applaud Facebook for taking a deeper look into this issue that will help make our country a safer place while still keeping our freedoms intact,\" the group said in its official comment. Commenters were less politic. \"Moms demand action is nothing but a trouble making group with no real evidence or real stats to back anything. They just want to run and cry wolf at every crime as if it's the gun and not the person that committed the crime. Assbags,\" wrote Kerry Phillips. \"I wish Facebook would spend more time monitoring and battling cyber bullying and sexual predators which is a far greater social ill on our society than gun sales, most of which are completely legal,\" wrote David Roman."
