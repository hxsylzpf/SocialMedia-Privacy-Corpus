  "content": "Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, will help make government data more easily available online, Gordon Brown said today. \"So that government information is accessible and useful for the widest possible group of people, I have asked Sir Tim Berners-Lee \u2026 to help us drive the opening up of access to government data in the web over the coming month,\" the prime minister said in a statement about electoral and parliamentary reform. Berners-Lee has been a proponent of better access to data. In a talk to the TED conference in March, pictured above, he said: \"People in government departments \u2026 hug their database, hold it really close, so they can build a beautiful website to present it. Sure, make a beautiful website, but first give us \u2013 all of us \u2013 the unadulterated data.\" The government is known to be working on the creation of a central data source for government data, as introduced by the Obama government. \"You have no idea about the excuses people come up with to keep data out of your hands, even when you as taxpayers have paid for it,\" Berners-Lee told the TED talk."
