  "content": "Goldmund Byrne, community product manager for The Sun, has some predictions for next year and what we can look forward to. \"So, it's a time of decreasing ad revenue and recession hitting businesses large and small. But will the online world spend the year crying into its beer? \"I don't think so. Look at all the great stuff just around the corner. An increasing number of mobiles are coming with flat-rate data access as standard. Remember how much more eagerly we used the net when we stopped paying by the minute? Stop the cost clock and mobile booms. Checking mail, synching calendars. Using geo-tagging and location aware services to see what's cool and nearby for a quick impulse buy. \"Expect winning social media aggregation services with smooth interfaces that make it easy to do all these things in one place. My money's on the ones that help us elegantly manage our various online identities and share data between devices with the minimum of fuss. And then? Mobile media... \"Happy holidays!\""
