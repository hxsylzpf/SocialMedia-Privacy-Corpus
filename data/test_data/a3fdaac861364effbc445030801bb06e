  "content": "This blog, and thousands like it, is part of the IT revolution that's changing the world of books beyond recognition. I've said it before, but it bears repetition: not since the late 15th century, specifically the Gutenberg-Caxton innovations of the 1560s and 70s, has there been such a wholesale transformation of our literary environment. Yet, although the literary community \u2013 in the broadest sense \u2013 is part of this paradigm shift, it is odd, and slightly baffling, how little reference is made to it in poetry, drama or fiction. Jeanette Winterson published The Powerbook in 2000, exploiting emails as a genre. In India, Chetan Bhagat (One Night @ the Call Center) and Aravind Adiga (The White Tiger) have flirted with the socio-economic impact of the new technology on Indian life. Otherwise, I cannot think (perhaps readers can help out here) of a contemporary scene or character whose narrative or development owes much, if anything, to the new technology. Well, why should it, you will say, and fair enough. Electronic media is/are a delivery system, a means to an end. The creative act of putting black on white remains unchanged, even if you use a screen to do it. A hundred years ago, writers weren't writing novels about typewriters and linotype presses. Mark Twain lost a fortune on a new printing press, but that's another story ... So I was interested to read Carl Wilkinson in the Telegraph exploring the theme of writers who acknowledge the distractions of social media, Wikipedia etc. Zadie Smith \u2013 always at the cutting edge \u2013 has a note in NW, apparently, in which she makes a wry reference to the distractions of the worldwide web. Wilkinson develops this point to explore the impact of the new technology on our brains. As he puts it, \"the internet is not just a distraction \u2013 it's actually changing our brains, too.\" He goes on, \"In his Pulitzer prize-nominated book The Shallows: How the Internet is Changing the Way We Think, Read and Remember (2010), Nicholas Carr highlighted the shift that is occurring from the calm, focused 'linear mind' of the past to one that demands information in 'short, disjointed, often overlapping bursts \u2013 the faster, the better'. \"For the last five centuries, ever since Gutenberg's printing press made book reading a populist pursuit,\" he writes, \"the linear, literary mind has been at the centre of art, science and society. As supple as it is subtle, it's been the imaginative mind of the Renaissance, the rational mind of the Enlightenment, the inventive mind of the industrial revolution, even the subversive mind of modernism. It may soon be yesterday's mind.\" Wilkinson continues: \"Our working lives are ever more dominated by computer screens, and thanks to the demanding, fragmentary and distracting nature of the internet, we are finding it harder to both focus at work and switch off afterwards. 'How can people not think this is changing your brain?' asks the neuroscientist Baroness Susan Greenfield, professor of pharmacology at Oxford University. 'How can you seriously think that people who work like this are the same as people 20 or 30 years ago? Whether it's better or worse is another issue, but clearly there is a sea change going on and one that we need to think about and evaluate.'\" Quite so. After a week in which the impact of computers on books has been confined to news about \"sock puppetry\", and Philip Roth whingeing about his Wikipedia entry, it's time to consider the questions Wilkinson raises more carefully. After all, didn't Shakespeare have a character, Holofernes, in Love's Labours Lost who \"eats paper\" and \"drinks ink\" (a clear reference to booming literacy and the consumption of books an pamphlets)? Is it not high time we began to integrate the IT revolution into the creative process? Where, for instance, is the creative dividend of the new IT? A contemporary Holofernes might be expected to \"eat e-media\" , \"inhale tweets\" and \"drink at the Cloud\". In due course, if he can tear himself away from Flickr or his Facebook page, he might find inspiration for the first genuine e-novel, something of more significance and durability than Fifty Shades of Grey.",
