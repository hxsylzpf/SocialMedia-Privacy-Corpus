  "content": "The Question Time audience member must have been feeling really clever when she questioned our new home secretary and minister for equality, Theresa May, about her less-than-gay-friendly voting record. Yet the audience should have left their self-righteousness in the bike rack. May performed a vivid manoeuvre, rarely seen in public life. \"I've changed my mind,\" she said, and went on to explain why \u2013 to a mixture of warm smiles and shocked gasps from the crowd. The question was prompted by the Facebook group Sack New Homophobic Equality Minister, which has nearly 70,000 members calling for May's head. Of course, post-mind-change, the group hasn't disbanded, in fact, its reaction perhaps helps illustrate how you often get little respect for changing your mind. \"She's relented today apparently!!!! TWAT\"; \"if she has to be persuaded, that is just it\" and \"Sorry, Theresa: not nearly good enough. Too little, too late. Off you go!\" \u2013 were just some of the group members' considered reactions after they had had a chance to sleep on it. Never mind the fact that before the Question Time appearance May had voted in favour of civil partnerships, there's nothing one set of bigots dislikes more than the other group becoming ex-bigots. Quick, we've got nothing to do and we've got bile to spare, get us someone else to hate!",
