  "content": "The supermodel Naomi Campbell had abrogated her basic right to privacy by invading it \"hundreds, if not thousands of times\", Piers Morgan, editor of the Mirror, told the high court yesterday. By revealing intimate details of her relationships in over 10 years of interviews and by courting the media to propagate her image, \"I have rarely encountered a celebrity who has so voraciously invaded her own privacy\", Mr Morgan said. Asked by Ms Campbell's barrister, Andrew Caldecott QC, if the fact that she had talked about her lovers and posed naked in Playboy meant she should be exposed for receiving treatment for drug abuse, Mr Morgan replied by likening the press to a cinematic cannibal. \"If you are going to voluntarily enter Hannibal Lecter's cage, then eventually you are going to get nibbled round the back of the neck,\" he explained, to laughter. As it subsided, he continued: \"If you are going to relentlessly use the media to promote a commercial image of yourself, if you are going to continue to talk about very intimate private parts of your life ... you have less right to privacy than the man or woman in the street.\" His comments came as he defended the action of his paper in publishing an article headlined Naomi: I am a Drug Addict, which showed Ms Campbell leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, and detailed her \"courageous battle\" against drug addiction. The Streatham-born model, 31, is suing Mirror Group Newspapers for breach of confidence, invasion of privacy, and breach of the Data Protection Act. Giving evidence on the second day, Mr Morgan denied Ms Campbell's claim that he had told Matthew Freud, the PR guru employed by her manager, that he would \"make her life hell\" if she refused to drop the legal action. \"That's complete rubbish. Absolutely untrue nonsense. The idea we all sit there to try and create a hell for people like Naomi Campbell is a myth perpetuated by certain celebrities,\" he insisted. In deciding to print the story, the paper had \"gone out of our way to be sympathetic\", and he rejected as \"absolutely untrue\" her barrister's claim that he had not considered the model's feelings. \"You have a rather sub-human view of us, don't you, Mr Caldecott?\" Mr Morgan said. \"Do you think we sit there without a care in the world about these stories impact on people's lives?\" Mr Morgan insisted that the fact Ms Campbell had taken an illegal drug, and had been hypocritical in lying about this in the past, together with her invasion of her own privacy justified the paper's actions. \"I believe in freedom of speech and opinion. That's the right of newspapers in this country,\" he continued, adding that he did not believe Ms Campbell's claims that she had suffered undue stress from the article. He insisted that she had \"lied through her back teeth\" throughout the hearing. He added: \"It's a problem that editors like me have in writing stories when celebrities are so willing to lie on such a relentless basis.\" Mr Morgan cited as an example of Ms Campbell's revelations to the press, when she talked to a newspaper about her relationship with U2 guitarist Adam Clayton. In the piece Miss Campbell dismissed as \"complete crap\" claims that Mr Clayton had been involved with prostitutes in a weekend-long orgy. Mr Caldecott: \"And that disentitles her to privacy about her drug therapy?\" Mr Morgan: \"How much more intimate do you want it to get, Mr Caldecott?\" Mr Caldecott: \"She is simply denying the story.\" Mr Morgan: \"She isn't. She's revealing the contents of a private conversation with her lover. She says she doesn't. I'm quite glad she does sometimes because it sells newspapers.\" Asked by Mr Caldecott if he meant that she had therefore waived her protection to privacy about her drug therapy, Mr Morgan replied: \"No, she is seriously damaging her rights to privacy for drug therapy. \"I have a general view that celebrities who talk generally or publicly for private gain can't then turn around and bleat privacy as so many of them of the current mode seem to do. It's a ridiculous situation.\" Mr Morgan drew a distinction between the paper's treatment of Miss Campbell and that meted out to Countess Spencer, when he was at the News of the World. On that occasion, he said, the paper wrongly took pictures of her with a long lens in the grounds of a clinic where she was receiving medical treatment. \"That was hasty, ill-advised, wrong and breached the press complaints commission code. I wish I hadn't done that and I certainly learned my lesson. Given my track record in this area, it would have been absolutely ridiculous of me not to have taken extreme care (with Ms Campbell).\" In a bullish court performance Mr Morgan admitted his paper's attitude to Ms Campbell had changed once she issued a writ on February 1 last year, the day of publication. \"I thought the whole idea of her trying to go after us on privacy on this particular matter was absurd ... and worthy of condemnation,\" he added. Earlier the court saw dramatic evidence of what Ms Campbell has admitted is her \"notorious\" propensity for tantrums when a video was shown of her tussling with a woman and accusing her of being \"an ugly bitch with the head of an alien\". The fracas was recorded during the making of a documentary, after the woman tried to take a photo of her as she slept while flying to attend a fashion show and see Nelson Mandela in South Africa. Ms Campbell was shown trying to wrest the camera from her and screaming. The video then cut away to her discussing the incident with the supermodel Kate Moss, as they were driven in the back of a convertible. \"What did I say then?\" Ms Campbell asked. \"You said: 'You're an ugly bitch. An ugly bitch with the head of an alien,' \" Ms Moss said, as they collapsed into laughter. The film also showed a female publicist trying to restrain Ms Campbell, who has had treatment for \"anger management\", before she tells the documentary's director, Douglas Keys: \"I'm going to get the ANC to stop them at the fucking airport.\" Under cross-examination, Ms Campbell, who had previously denied there was any tussle, said she was merely trying to retrieve the photo. She denied the film - which also revealed her speaking from a toilet about diarrhoea - was intimate. \"Would you agree that if you open yourself up in this way you inevitably as a public figure lay yourself open to criticism?\" Desmond Browne QC, for MGN, asked her. \"No, not in this respect,\" she said. Describing her reaction to the Mirror story, Ms Campbell said her immediate decision to launch a legal action was confirmed on February 2 when the columnist Sue Carroll accused her of being as \"ineffective as a chocolate soldier\" - a remark she took as racist. But, pointing out the column did not appear until February 7, Mr Browne insisted: \"That answer is quite untrue ... because it hadn't even been published. This is another of your whoppers, isn't it?\" The case continues."
