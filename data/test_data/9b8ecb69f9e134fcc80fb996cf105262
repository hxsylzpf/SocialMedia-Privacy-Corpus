  "content": "Instagram's controversial change in policy that means it can now sell users' pictures and data has shaken many users. Whatever your feelings about the app, in its short life it has changed photography. Since launching in October 2010, it knocked the likes of Hipstamatic and Flickr out of the picture, with its easy usability and retro aesthetic. Its success was vindicated when Facebook bought the company for $1bn (\u00a3629m) in April this year, when there were 30m accounts. Ironically it is Facebook who made the decision that has already made many users quit this week in protest that their work can be sold to no profit of their own. Instagram might not appeal to photography purists, but for many fans it's the community they are most faithful to. Most mornings the first thing I do is refresh my feed to check out the latest submissions from real life friends or Instagrammers I've come to know. There is a certain commitment to contributing that you don't get with other social networks. And how much more soulful is sharing a simple picture than 140 characters? It's a network of foodies, proud parents, hipsters, aspiring artists and, unfortunately, celebrities. For those of us who don't own a camera other than an iPhone or Android, adding a filter can make you feel like a proper photographer. I like the fact we will baffle people of the future with this phase of trying to make our photos look older than they are. Instagram's co-founder Kevin Systrom backpedalled late on Tuesday, clarifying: \"It is not our intention to sell your photos. We are working on updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear.\" But it seems the damage has already been done. To add insult to injury, there has been some confusion over how to download your archive before pulling the plug, and whether this means you have to update to the latest version of the app, and therefore agree to the sale of your pictures. Luckily this is not the case and you can actually export them using Instaport. My colleague Josh Halliday has argued that the fact the app is free comes at the cost of making yourself the product. Yet in an age of the commercialisation of pretty much all internet services, can you really upload personal pictures and information, and not expect it to be exploited in some way? Perhaps reverting back to a good old-fashioned photo album is the only option. I know that I'm not alone in hoping that this isn't the end for an app that has become a lifestyle. As a friend, @edwardiansnow, who posted her 1,000th picture today, astutely put it: \"Taking photos has been an Important Thing for me this year and I have discovered some wonderful things via Instagram. I would like this to continue.\" I'm still in two minds. What are you going to do?",
