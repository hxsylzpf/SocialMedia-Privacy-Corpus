  "content": "The fastest growing technology isn't the smartphone, live video streaming or blogging; it's instant messaging (IM). Its rapid growth has destroyed the text message business and put the power of instant, peer-to-peer communication in the hands of over 2.5 billion people around the world (expected to grow to 3.6 billion by 2018). But it's been totally ignored by businesses. WhatsApp has 990 million users, Facebook messenger has 800 million, WeChat 650 million, representing large and fast growing addressable audiences. Yet, few if any businesses or ad agencies seem to have noticed. The scant marketing conversation going on seems to entirely miss the point, this is not just another place to place ads. At Havas Media we believe in thinking beyond traditional media to find new ways to build meaningful brands. This has to happen not just by considering new platforms and media channels as places to buy attention, but fostering new ways for brands to build relationships with consumers. IM is not an advertising play, it's a marketing play. It's a powerful new growth agent for business \u2013 a whole new way to think about retail, customer service and how we experience brands. A generation of people have grown up hating phone calls. Even those that grew up with them now prefer any form of brief written communication over verbal, in fact 72% of people (according to a TeleTech study) think phone calls are the worst way to undertake customer service. Companies have not listened. In advertising we throw out sentences such as \"people want conversations with brands,\" yet businesses hide behind no-reply email campaigns, don't reply to tweets, refuse to offer email customer services, let alone IM. New technology doesn't just reflect culture, it shapes it. We now text with emojis, hold conversations with 12 different people at the same time and reply at all hours of the day. We've become masters at short concise, personal, secure image-based conversations but virtually no companies have taken advantage of this. The promise of IM is that if offers the best ever way to form personal, intimate, one-to-one links between brands and people. There are several key unique advantages of IM over phone calls and emails: Secure and immediate: Unlike email, snail mail or even phone calls, IMs are a guaranteed way to reach the specific correct single person. Using Touch ID, cameras or facial recognition to unlock phones creates the most secure platform we've even known. No more pin numbers, passwords, just frictionless personal, secure service. Asynchronous and immediate: Nobody likes waiting for call backs or for slow computers. IM offers both immediate and asynchronous communication, which allows multitasking while the customer services representative investigates. It also allows dropped signal areas to not interrupt calls and means customer services can work with several people at the same time. More informative: IM platforms allow messages to include location maps, images, videos, money, attachments and other rich items, which allow a far better conversational exchange. Want to see what shoes are left in stock? A quick IM makes it possible. An opportunity for everyone All service companies should be offering customer service and information via IM. There are no excuses for this not being text enabled. From ordering dry cleaning collections to booking haircuts and buying items from designers directly or even getting the news. Our primary mode of transactions on mobile could be within IM. Just imagine the possibilities. Location-based technology allows people to order a pizza to their current location. Technology such as application programming interfaces (APIs) allow messaging to become embedded with other overlaying services. For example, Facebook Messenger allows people to order taxis from Uber, book restaurant tables using OpenTable, or nearby cinema seats from the Fandango API, quickly and securely. And what happens to bank accounts in an age where 62% of people have less than $1000 (\u00a3700) in savings, why do we need banks when we can merely transact with digital money. And it's all getting smarter \u2013 we're seeing more personal touches and more automation. So while Nordstrom may offer smart personal shopping with Textstyle and Magic offers trained operators contacted via text who can find you anything you ever need. The computers are coming to automate everything, this is where we come to AI and machine learning. It's this new world that offers the most promise. A world where basic customer service is done by smart bots who predict our needs and service us in the fastest most immediate way possible, where bots offer us items we didn't know we needed. The future of commerce and customer service is a hybrid of IM as our primary way to interact with companies, buy things, get service. From renting cars, to seeing where the rental car is, to checking the bill, to submitting receipts for expenses, IM will be the best platform for everything. It's a place where intimate data about our behaviours and choices, commerce and brands come together. It's time for agencies and brands to jump in and reap the rewards of the most powerful place to be \u2013 instant messaging apps.
