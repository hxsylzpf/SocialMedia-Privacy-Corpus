  "content": "The famous American baseball manager Yogi Berra was also famous for his gnomic \u2013 even Zen-like \u2013 remarks such as \"when you come to a fork in the road, take it\" and \"nobody goes there any more \u2013 it's too crowded\". The latter seems to be the case for Digg, the site that exploded into web consciousness in 2004 and 2005 as part of the new wave of web 2.0 sites that, rather than telling you what you should read, let their readers determine what the day's most interesting stories were. Digg, founded by Kevin Rose, quickly outstripped Slashdot, the \"news for nerds\" site where editors picked and chose from among user-contributed links to post on to its news pages. And instead of sites being \"slashdotted\" by a flurry of clicks from Slashdot, they would stagger under the weight of Digg traffic as readers in their thousands followed links. BusinessWeek featured a lank-haired, stubble-faced Rose asking how he could have built a site of such (speculative) value so quickly. The $40m of venture capital it has attracted testifies to the excitement about its future prospects. Now, the latest figures from compete.com, one of the many web metric measurement agencies, suggests that between March and April, Digg lost a third of its visitors \u2013 from 38 million in March 2010 to 24.7 million in April \u2013 below the 26 million it was claiming in 2008 when we interviewed Rose. Why? The suggested reasons vary. One comment pointed to Rose's killing-off in April of the year-old \"DiggBar\", which meant that any links you clicked on were actually framed inside the digg.com site \u2013 so people stayed longer. More important, anyone outside who clicked on a http://diggurl would be taken to the Digg site \u2013 not the site being linked to. In killing the bar, Rose said that it had been \"bad for the internet\". But doing so may have been bad for Digg: if clicking on those links no longer takes you to Digg, there go loads of visitors. A separate suggestion, via Twitter by Nick Halstead, is that tweaks in March and April to Google's ranking algorithm meant that Digg fell in its search results \u2013 and that half Digg's traffic comes from Google. Quite possibly both are correct. But either means that Digg's influence on news sites, which have over the past four years become familiar with incorporating Digg buttons all over their content and surreptitiously \"digging\" their content through various accounts, is on the wane. The drop in visitors can't be reversed without restoring the DiggBar, which Rose isn't going to do. So just as you thought you were getting a handle on \"social news\", and which sites are important, the focus changes again. If Digg's visitors are indeed below the 2008 number, and the DiggBar was inflating visitor numbers, then it's unlikely there's any way back. Just as in American politics, there are no second acts on the web: the examples of Bebo, AOL, MySpace, Friends Reunited and many others show that it's OK to stop growing; what's not OK is to shrink, because you lose advertising income and can't increase your rates. Result: a death spiral. Certainly, 24.7 million visitors in a month is a more-than-respectable number: but it's also an inflection point, where on Compete.com's graphs it begins to cross over with the rising traffic to twitter.com. But in fact, Twitter is already far bigger than Digg, because those compete.com figures only measure what desktop browsers do \u2013 not mobiles, the mobile internet or API traffic via dedicated applications such as Tweetdeck or Twitter's official iPhone app. It's probably not an accident that a notably tidier Rose \u2013 shorter hair, no stubble \u2013 showed off in a video the other day how he wants to reshape Digg: when you log in you'll have \"people you follow\", who'll post links that you can \"digg\" to your followers and perhaps set off a chain reaction to find the stories of the day. Looking at it, one thought that it looked exactly like Twitter, with perhaps a little more data. Rose as much as admitted it: \"Because we're only links and news, we cut out all the miscellaneous status updates that you see on other sites,\" he says. So, Twitter without the gossip sociability? That's not quite closing the sale, Kevin. Berra's other impenetrable aphorism may yet turn out to be the fate of Digg: it came to a fork in the road, and took it. But everyone else took the other one. For news sites, it means another adjustment to a new landscape. For Digg, it could mean life or death. Shall we give it a year?"
