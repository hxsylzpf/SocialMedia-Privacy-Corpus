  "content": "Maria Gilbert, senior writer and editor, J. Paul Getty Museum Showcase visitor content on Pinterest: It's great for capturing and highlighting the creativity of your visitors. A great example is our Insta-Getty board, which features many of the fantastic photographs taken at our two sites, the Getty Center and Getty Villa. Showcase your own resources: Pinterest is terrific for knitting together a visual story about initiatives and projects. An example of this would be a board we created to celebrate and promote the Google Art Project when we initially joined. Our board, Mark of the Winged Serpent, is a game that challenges users to find the winged serpent symbol used by the painter Lucas Cranach the Elder after 1508 to sign his works, using the Art Project's terrific zoom tool. Curate around your collection: As an art museum, this is core to what we do in the galleries \u2013 with Pinterest we can extend that online and include juxtapositions that we couldn't necessarily make in real life. One example is our Watteau's Colorful Characters board. Showcase your collection in a fresh, playful manner: This board on Winged Creatures features details from artworks across our collection that could easily escape notice \u2013 they aren't something you could easily find with a text search. Hannah Waldram, community manager for Europe, Instagram Setting up on Instagram: If you're just starting an account, we have some great resources for brands and businesses getting on Instagram. We have a new Business Blog, where we highlight lots of tips and best practice examples, and we also have a breakdown here of how to get started with your account. As a brand, I would say you need to have a separate strategy for using Instagram to your other social media strategies; it's brilliant for brand awareness and engagement and you should think about it entirely differently to how you might use Twitter or Facebook. In general, behind-the-scenes glimpses of how things are run, sneak peaks at new shows to build buzz and interest, all the way to running competitions and hashtag projects with winners gaining exclusive access to a new exhibition or show are great ideas to think about. Here's more about how to run a photo campaign. You should also definitely make sure your venue has a location page for Instagrammers to tag their great photos and videos to. Vicky Pearce, Horniman Museum and Gardens How to use Instagram hashtags: Hashtags are absolutely essential for Instagram sharing. For the large part they are the means by which most Instagram users browse photographs; unless they are already following your account, a hashtag is necessary for someone to find, like and comment on your images. When you upload a photo, you have the opportunity to add a caption. This is where you should use hashtags, either within the caption itself or simply as a list of words. Hashtags can also be added later in image comments, which is useful as you can't go back and edit your caption. There are plenty of sites and services online that offer lists of commonly used hashtags, which you can apply to your photos and share them with a wider audience who may be browsing those tags. Tips for your hashtags: Just keep them appropriate and relevant. There's nothing so irritating as #every #word #in #the #caption #being #hashtagged \u2013 so #museum is the big one we try to always include. I don't think the tag itself gets an awful lot of traffic, but from our point of view it's important to be setting our pictures in that museum community. Animals will always win big, so we never miss an opportunity to tag #owl, #cat or #bird. But it's worth knowing your audience and which online interest groups and communities hold possible new audiences for you, and gain some insight into what hashtags they're using. Although there are many lists of popular hashtags, these are usually widely overused (often by people looking for likes) and your picture may get lost in that tag. Need some inspiration?

Don't share images unless they are in the public domain or licensed accordingly. Don't write too much; let the images curate themselves. Don't expect your colleagues to take great images with bad-quality mobile phones; make sure they have the appropriate equipment. Don't accuse colleagues of taking bad pictures \u2013 make sure that everyone involved can experiment without fear of being shut off. Do show naturalistic photographs (nothing too formal or stagey). Do show spontaneous images in a good mix. Do use videos. Do show a mix of actual people, activities and museum objects. Do interact with your audience \u2013 ask questions.
