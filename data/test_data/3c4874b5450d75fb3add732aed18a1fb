  "content": "The publishers of regional and local newspapers have long pointed out that their titles take an impartial stance at election time. Few, if any, ever tell readers which party to vote for. That neutrality too often tends to sideline regional papers during general elections so I welcome an innovation by Trinity Mirror's regional division to give its titles a role and a purpose this time around. It has published election demands based on the opinions of more than 18,000 readers as part of what it calls a My Manifesto project.* The demands have been drawn up by canvassing the readers of 24 titles, including the Manchester Evening News (MEN), Liverpool Echo, Newcastle Chronicle and Birmingham Mail. As you can see from the list published in the MEN, the six main demands include getting swift appointments with doctors; the scrapping of the bedroom tax; the introduction of a wealth tax; and the cutting of train fares. Now editors plan to set the election agenda in their circulation areas by using the manifestos as a basis to question and lobby local candidates. Neil Benson, editorial director of Trinity Mirror's regional papers, says: \"We aim to be the conduit for readers... local issues are placed quite highly on most manifestos, making the role regional media plays in this election even more vital. He also points to the benefits accrued by the papers' growing online audiences. \"The way our audiences consume news has changed dramatically since 2010\", he says. \"This year we can talk to our readers \u2013 via print, social and digital \u2013 and crucially listen to them like never before\". The MyManifesto project will continue with digital hustings, Findmyseat interactive maps and Google hangout interviews with candidates. *A total of 18,187 Trinity Mirror readers took part in the project across 24 titles. Of those who took part, 25% were aged 18-30; 39%, aged 31-50 and 34.2% aged 51 or above. Source: Trinity Mirror PA goes into partnership with Facebook The Press Association (PA) has partnered with Facebook to curate social media content for its 2015 UK Politics general election page. PA's politics and social team will select the best election stories and updates from across the web as well as posts and statuses from Facebook's users. The page will be updated with relevant posts, images and video on Facebook plus some updates from the PA's election wire. Pete Clifton, PA's editor-in-chief, describes Facebook's page as a \"fantastic platform\" to showcase the agency's journalism, saying: \"We're delighted to be overseeing the it\". And Nick Wrenn of Facebook believes PA \"is an ideal news organisation to run the Facebook UK Politics page because of its commitment to impartiality and balance, and its ability to curate quality content from a wide range of journalists, analysts and public figures\".
