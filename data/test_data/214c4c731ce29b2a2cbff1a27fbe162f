  "content": "A man whose suicide attempt was captured by his local council's CCTV cameras and released to newspapers and TV companies won a landmark ruling yesterday from the European court of human rights, which lawyers said could usher in a new privacy law in Britain. The Strasbourg court ruled that Geoffrey Peck's right to respect for his private life was violated and that he had no remedy under the UK's existing privacy law. The court awarded him \u00a37,800 in damages, and nearly \u00a312,000 costs. Mr Peck, 47, said his life had been shattered since a film of him taken in Brentwood high street, Essex, in August 1995 with a kitchen knife, about to slash his wrists, was shown to more than 9m viewers in 1996 on BBC TV's Crime Beat. He was severely depressed after losing his job and learning that his partner, the mother of his daughter, had been diagnosed as terminally ill. Police led Mr Peck away. He was not charged with any crime. Brentwood council issued the CCTV footage to two local newspapers, Anglia TV and the BBC to publicise the success of the CCTV cameras in deterring town-centre crime. Mr Peck's features were not properly masked and he was identified by friends, neighbours and relatives. With the backing of the civil rights group Liberty, he took the council to the high court in 1996. The judge, Mr Justice Harrison, ruled in November 1997 that the council was within its rights under English law to release the film and had not been acting irrationally. But he added: \"Unless and until there is a general right of privacy recognised by English law - and the implications are there may soon be so by the incorporation of the European convention on human rights into law - reliance must be placed on effective guidance being issued by codes of practice in order to try and stop such undesirable invasions of a person's privacy.\" The independent television commission and the broadcasting standards commission both agreed that his privacy had been infringed, through human error. In October 2000, the human rights convention, which guarantees respect for private life, became part of UK law. Since then, however, UK judges have resisted attempts to carve out a freestanding privacy right, choosing instead to develop existing remedies such as breach of confidence. In Mr Peck's case, the Strasbourg court said the council's action had been a \"disproportionate and unjustified interference with his private life\". His high court challenge to Brentwood council's decision to release the CCTV footage had been rejected because the court could not consider any right to privacy but only whether the council had acted irrationally. James Welch, legal director of Liberty, which took Mr Peck's case to the European court, said: \"The court has confirmed something that should be glaringly obvious to people operating CCTV systems - they can't pass on footage of people without any regard for those people's right to privacy. Sadly, that's too often ignored. \"CCTV is still very poorly controlled by UK law - it's high time proper regulation was put in place.\""
