  "content": "Kate Moss and Kanye West have joined Instagram in the same week. A curious move in 2016, given that your mum joined last easter. So what does it mean? Judging by the first posts that communicate very little, the two have had a change of heart or direction \u2013 West stayed safe with an arty image (a shot from Total Recall), while Moss first posted a picture of her in a field in shorts (which she then deleted) before posting a picture from an interview with Business of Fashion. Moss's post might be new but a model on Instagram is not and this picture is (perhaps) illustrative of the power social media has in fashion. Since leaving Storm, her agency last year, the model has been stealthily setting up her own eponymous agency. In a recent interview, she said of models including Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner: \"They've definitely got another side with it, like the Instagram side, and they know their business, I think.\" We know digital media is changing the way fashion and its people are presented but this has always seemed like a chicken/egg situation. Gigi Hadid's fame would be halved in the absence of social media \u2013 Moss is already famous and doesn't need to calibrate her brand. Still, agencies are having to cope with a shift towards a system where models are hired for their social media presence, one where their personal brands are multi-faceted to the point of exhaustion: \"Modelling is so much about \u2026 the constant demand for content. Models aren't just walking the runways and appearing in campaigns. They are also managing a constant feed of content through social media and online,\" says Imran Amed of Business of Fashion. Since Kate Moss is Kate Moss, suggests there's something to be learned from the move: black and white is the new lark, outdoors is the new indoors and trousers are still optional. West's post, however \u2013 an image of the Johnny Cab's cab from Total Recall \u2013 tells us nothing we don't know about the artificial fragility of our world.",
