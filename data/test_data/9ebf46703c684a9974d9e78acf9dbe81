  "content": "Are you scrabbling around for Facebook likes for your business page? Or perhaps you've got a solid social media following, but that's not translating into sales? During our live Q&amp;A on using social media to build your brand, our panel of experts offered advice on where to start, making an impact and developing a business personality. Getting started Several readers identified a common problem \u2013 getting started on social media when you've just launched a business. Two of the main things to consider are: which platforms should you set up accounts for? And how can you get attention once they're up and running? One reader, who had recently started a training company, asked the panel where she should begin. The panel suggested Twitter and LinkedIn as her enterprise was a B2B business. Alison Battisby, founder of social media consultancy Avocado Social, said: \"Start following experts within the industry, companies that you'd like to work with [...] and tweet useful and practical tips to show off your knowledge and gain credibility.\" Rachel Wicking, PR and marketing manager at Primrose Bakery, which uses Instagram and Facebook to show off its cakes, encouraged experimentation. She said: \"Sometimes it's good to take an hour out of the day, review the last few days [of] posts and try and make a plan based on these\". Facebook pages and Twitter accounts offer inbuilt analytics \u2013 how many people have seen or clicked on a Facebook post or how many retweets, likes and clicks each tweet has gained. Meanwhile, Matt Kurkowski, social marketing manager at MOO, recommends putting budget aside for social media. \"If you're a new business and want to get word out quickly, I'd suggest setting up a small paid/promoted campaign on Facebook first,\" he said. How to hold on to followers A number of questions came in through Twitter, including: \"How can you add value [for customers] via social media?\" Examples might include offering freebies or tips in your area of expertise. Both Gil Kahana, co-founder of ChattyFeet and Wicking from Primrose Bakery, admitted this runs the risk of gaining attention from those just interested in the competition, rather than your brand. However, offering freebies had worked well for them. \"Sometimes it's about asking who cares about what you do,\" said Kahana. \"We sent a sample of our Kate Middle-Toe socks to the British Vogue because we thought they would like it. They instagrammed the socks and the post got more than 6,600 likes which gave us great exposure.\" Wicking added: \"It's also great for forming B2B relationships. We recently ran competitions with Lakeland, Joe &amp; Seph's and Fake Bake Beauty.\" Planning for events With Black Friday imminent, the panel discussed how to plan social media around the event as a small business. Kurkowski said: \"Consider a fresh approach (like making the day about your customers or offering something for nothing, like a piece of useful content or a thank you to customers) to stand out from the crowd.\" Meanwhile, Kahana suggested targeting a certain demographic, who are likely to enjoy your brand: \"posting ads on twitter, Facebook and now even Instagram can work well because they let you define the audience. For example, we can post an ad that will only show to people between the age of 24 to 40 who like art.\" Battisby summed up how you make the most of the Black Friday hype: \"Use amazing images and exclusive one-off deals that you have never tried before and will only do for Black Friday. Oh and don't forget to use the hashtag #BlackFriday for maximum exposure.\" Work on your personality The businesses that were on our panel have a fun and lively tone on social media. Kahana said of Chatty Feet: \"We encourage people to have fun by telling stories with our characters. For example, The Sockfather is very bossy, Prof. Brian Sox is a really curious guy and La Diva has a great voice.\" He said that they aim to create characters that customers will connect with. Wicking added: \"Try and have one voice behind all posts. We [at Primrose Bakery] just really want to share what we are doing as a business.\" Kurkowski encouraged brands to be playful. He said: \"Don't be afraid to push the envelope \u2013 make a joke that not everyone will get, be ok with engaging with your customers in the way they want to engage with you.\" Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.",
