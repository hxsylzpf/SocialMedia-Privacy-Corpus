  "content": "The editor of Private Eye has told the Leveson inquiry that he was reluctant to let the satirical title join the Press Complaints Commission because he did not expect a fair hearing from newspaper editors unhappy with its Street of Shame column. Ian Hislop also appeared to extract a statement from Lord Justice Leveson that he is not considering recommending the introduction of mandatory \"pre-notification\" of subjects of stories about them \u2013 while in turn conceding there was merit in creating a libel and privacy tribunal to adjudicate on cases before they reach court. The editor said Private Eye gives over \"two pages a week attacking individual [journalists] and [national] newspapers\" and that he would not anticipate getting a \"fair hearing\" at the PCC, a body whose membership is partly comprised of national newspaper editors. Private Eye has been edited by Hislop since 1986. The fortnightly magazine runs Street of Shame, a two-page column devoted to stories about journalistic hypocrisy, misbehaviour and examples of editorial or proprietorial influence in news. Hislop, who gave evidence for an hour, also said he had \"some issues\" with the number of tabloid editors sitting on the press regulator \u2013 and \"the amount of influence that News International has had on the PCC\". Although Hislop said it was \"a bit embarrassing\" that Private Eye was in the company of Richard Desmond's Northern &amp; Shell in not being a member of the PCC, he said he did not see a need for a separate regulator. \"I believe in a free press and I don't think it should be regulated, but it should abide by the law,\" Hislop said. Hislop told Leveson that activities in focus such as phone hacking, contempt of court and \"police taking money\" are already illegal and questioned the need for a press regulation system, adding that what was required was enforcement of existing laws. Later he added: \"A reasonable editor could not have thought 'I must hack into a murdered girl's phone' \u2026 those things seem to me self-evidently unreasonable.\" Hislop expressed a wariness of statutory regulation, noting: \"If the state regulates the press then the press no longer regulates the state\u2026 an unfortunate state of affairs.\" The Private Eye editor, who also is a long-serving team captain on Have I Got News For You, kept Leveson entertained with a series of pithy and humorous observations about the conduct of the press. Easily the most entertaining of all the editors giving evidence, Hislop was the top trend on Twitter for most of the period while he was speaking. On phone hacking, Hislop pointed the finger of blame at a network of close relationships between News International bosses, top politicians and the police. \"News International thought it could get away with whatever it liked, because the Murdoch family was deeply embedded in our political top class,\" Hislop said. He added that the inquiry needed to hear from David Cameron, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown to explain how they interacted with the Murdochs. Hislop said that phone hacking was initially brushed aside because \"the fact these laws were not rigorously enforced is due to the \u2026 interaction of the police and News International\". The editor also said Private Eye did not need to use private investigators because most of its stories were sourced from readers. Street of Shame, for example, was filled with the help of tips and information from newspaper reporters, it being \"a loyal profession\". He added: \"That is Paul Foot's view \u2013 the secret of investigative journalism is people ring you and tell you things.\" Hislop said he been a target of private investigator Steve Whittamore, who obtained the phone numbers of himself, his friends, family and bank manager \u2013 although he did not know who commissioned him. He added that his bins had been opened by Benjamin Pell \u2013 \"Benjy the Binman\" \u2013 who was seen doing so on a camera set up by Private Eye. Hislop said that Pell was working for Mohamed Al Fayed. When challenged on whether he had evidence to support the claim by Robert Jay QC, the editor chuckled and said that information from his bins \"appeared in Al Fayed's Punch\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
