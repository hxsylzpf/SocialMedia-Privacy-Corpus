  "content": "Sony chief Sir Howard Stringer has spoken about the security breach of the PlayStation Network for the first time, apologising to the users affected and unveiling a $1m identity theft insurance policy to protect each user in the future. Stringer has remained tight-lipped about the two attacks on the PSN carried out last month which saw personal information of as many as 100m gamers stolen. However, Stringer has been forced to take action to try and control the crisis as Sony's share price fell by as much as 4% in trading on Thursday as investors worried about the ultimate cost of the attacks. In a blog post, Stringer said that there is \"no confirmed evidence any credit card or personal information has been misused, and we continue to monitor the situation closely\". Stringer announced plans to introduce more stringent security measures to \"protect your information better than ever\" and unveiled a $1m identity theft insurance policy per user to \"cover identity restoration costs, legal defense expenses, and lost wages that occur within 12 months after the stolen identity event\" \u2013 but only for US gamers. He said that announcements regarding gamers affected in other territories would follow. \"As a company we \u2013 and I \u2013 apologise for the inconvenience and concern caused by this attack,\" he said. \"Let me assure you that the resources of this company have been focused on investigating the entire nature and impact of the cyber-attack we've all experienced and on fixing it. We are working with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies around the world to apprehend those responsible.\" Sony has been criticised for not notifying custmomers about the attacks quickly enough and while Stringer acknowledged the accusations, he fell short of admitting that the consumer electronics giant bungled its response. \"I know some believe we should have notified our customers earlier than we did. It's a fair question,\" he said. \"As soon as we discovered the potential scope of the intrusion, we shut down the PlayStation Network and Qriocity services and hired some of the best technical experts in the field to determine what happened. I wish we could have gotten the answers we needed sooner.\" Stringer said that the game network would be restored \"in the coming days\" \u2013 the service has been offline for almost three weeks \u2013 with all users having to change their account passwords before being able to sign in. To try to entice users back onto the system, and by way of apology, Stringer reminded gamers that a \"welcome back\" package is being offered that will include benefits including a month free of its premium-level service \"to make up for time lost\".",
