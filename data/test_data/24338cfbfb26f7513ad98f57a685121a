  "content": "More than 100 people who suspect they were the target of a private investigator have asked the Information Commissioner's Office whether they are named in the Operation Motorman files. The Information Commissioner's Office has received inquiries from members of the public about the files since December last year, when Operation Motorman returned to the spotlight during the Leveson inquiry into press standards. Christopher Graham, the information commissioner, is understood to have received 97 requests since December 2011 and about 40 before that. The Operation Motorman report is the result of a 2003 inquiry by the ICO into private investigator Steve Whittamore, which resulted in him pleading guilty to breaches of the Data Protection Act and receiving a two-year conditional discharge. The report details thousands of requests by journalists to Whittamore for personal information about almost 4,000 people, including celebrities and public figures. Most of those named in the report \u2013 which the ICO has repeatedly declined to publish \u2013 have never been told they were the target of potentially unlawful requests from journalists. The report details requests to Whittamore for information including criminal record checks, vehicle registrations and ex-directory telephone numbers, which would constitute a prima facie breach of the Data Protection Act. However, journalists have legal protection from the act if the story published is in the public interest. The information commissioner has come under mounting pressure since December to publish the files, after the 2003 Operation Motorman report was the subject of conflicting evidence at the Leveson inquiry. These calls intensified last month after the Guido Fawkes political blogger, Paul Staines, published a section of the Motorman report on his website. Graham, who took over as information commissioner in 2009, resisted the calls by maintaining that publishing the files would intrude on the privacy of those named in the documents. He said last month he would consider publishing the files if he was given the lawful authority to do so, which could come from Lord Justice Leveson. However, the ICO does not expect to be given legal cover because Leveson has indicated that he does not believe publishing the files would be firmly in the public interest. An investigation by ITV News in March found that national newspapers and magazines paid more than \u00a31.2m to Whittamore for the private details between early 2000 and March 2003, which included requests for information about Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, and her sister, Pippa. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
