  "content": "The Radio 1 DJ, Sara Cox, has hired the top media lawyer, Keith Schilling, in a move that indicates she may pursue a privacy lawsuit against the Sunday People. The paper yesterday apologised to the star for printing nude pictures of her and her new husband, the club DJ, Jon Carter, on their honeymoon in the Seychelles. However, the decision to hire the Schilling and Lom lawyer indicates Cox and Carter are not satisfied with the apology. The statement published in the Sunday People read: \"The honeymoon pictures we published last week of Sara Cox and her husband Jon Carter understandably deeply upset them. \"The photographs were taken of them while they were in a private area of the hotel, we now discover, and therefore should not have been published.\" The apology means the press complaints commission will no longer adjudicate on the complaint that Cox made last week. Neither Mr Schilling nor Cox's manager, Melanie Coupland, would comment on the likelihood of legal action. Mr Schilling also acts for the model, Naomi Campbell, who is bringing a lawsuit against the Mirror for publishing photographs of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. The actress, Amanda Holden, is invoking the new Human Rights Act in her action against the Daily Star. She launched the lawsuit after the paper published pictures of her sunbathing topless in a private villa in Italy. The action follows Anna Ford's failed high court bid to have a PCC adjudication overturned. The BBC newsreader went to court after the PCC said the Daily Mail was entitled to publish pictures of her sunbathing on a beach because the beach was considered a public place. A celebrity has yet to win a lawsuit based solely on privacy and courts are unlikely to make judgments that impose blanket rulings on the press. However, a recent judgment in favour of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who were granted an injunction banning Hello! from using photographs of their wedding, could assist other stars in future privacy claims.",
