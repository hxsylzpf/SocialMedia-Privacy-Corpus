  "content": "Joe Hockey is calling for a \"sensible, mature debate\" about tax reform options, including an increase to the rate or base of Australia's goods and services tax (GST). In a speech in Melbourne on Wednesday, the federal treasurer will also offer qualified support to digitally disruptive companies such as Uber, saying governments should not \"try to tax or legislate them out of existence\". Hockey's planned address to the PwC Tax Reform Forum canvasses six key principles of tax reform, but his comments about the GST will attract the most attention. The treasurer is seeking to prepare the ground for state and territory governments to \"take responsibility for their own budgets\" including hospital funding. All GST revenue is distributed to the states and territories, which have less capacity than the federal government to raise funds but are responsible for key frontline services. Before the Council of Australian Governments (Coag) leaders' retreat in Sydney next week, Hockey will say that \"as best as possible, the revenue raising capacity of each tier of government should be aligned to responsibilities of funding and service delivery\". \"Our current federal system clearly fails this objective. Because of the high concentration of revenue raising capacity at the federal level, vertical fiscal imbalance is higher in Australia than in other federations,\" he will say, according to speech notes distributed by his office. \"Not only do the states and territories raise considerably less revenue than they spend, around a third of their tax is from inefficient taxes: stamp duties on real and intangible property, insurance duties and so forth. \"Many submissions [to the tax white paper process] have called for the abolition of these taxes and a broadening of the GST base, or an increase to the rate, or both. \"But when it comes to the GST, let me be very clear: no change will be considered without the unanimous agreement of state and territory governments and bipartisan support in the federal parliament.\" The federal Labor party and most state and territory governments have expressed opposition to increasing the GST, a proposal which Abbott ruled out before the 2013 election. But state and territory leaders from across the political divide have also criticised Abbott for his 2014 budget decision to cut about $80bn from long-term projected hospital and school funding payments. Premiers and chief ministers argue this will place an \"unsustaintable\" crunch on their budgets. They are expected to raise the issue when they meet the prime minister, Tony Abbott, at the Coag event next week. Hockey will call on leaders to use the Coag retreat to engage in a \"constructive discussion about reforming our federation\". \"This must include the states taking responsibility for their own budgets in order to ensure they can afford their ever increasing expenditure \u2013 such as the costs of their public hospital systems as our population ages into the future,\" his speech notes say. \"Thankfully, we have started to see some taxation reform at a state level. The state government in South Australia has engaged in tax reform, as has the ACT government. And the former South Australian and Victorian governments moved to a broad-based land tax to wholly replace inefficient insurance-based fire services levies in 1999 and 2013 respectively. \"Surely it is not beyond the capacity of us as a country to have a sensible, mature debate about long term tax reform more generally.\" In an interview with the ABC on Wednesday, Hockey acknowledged a GST increase would have the biggest impact on poorer households and they would need to be compensated. \"If you were to increase the GST, it would be the federal government, through the income tax system or through the payment system, that would need to compensate low and middle income earners who would carry the greatest burden associated with an increase in the GST,\" he said. \"So if you were to increase the GST and the benefit went to the states, the commonwealth would have to find the money to compensate people for the impact of that. Now, that is a very complicated equation, that is why we say emphatically the silver bullet in tax reform is not increasing or broadening the GST. It is about having a considered approach to the entire tax base.\" Hockey reaffirmed his previous comments about the need to address \"bracket creep\" \u2013 the phenomenon whereby people move into higher income tax brackets as a result of inflation. Abbott said on Wednesday the government wanted to see \"more efficient and more effective governance over time\" including better schools and public hospitals with less interference between levels of government. \"That is very much what I will be canvassing with the premiers next week at the leaders' retreat,\" the prime minister said. The government is developing tax and federation reform white papers, which will provide options for the Coalition to take to the next election. A new paper from the Grattan Institute suggests state governments could raise $7bn a year by introducing a property levy that could eventually replace inefficient taxes such as stamp duty. Defining his six principles, Hockey says tax reform should: align revenue raising capacity to government responsibilities; promote a stronger economy; be fit for purpose in the modern economy; encourage workforce participation and ensure families control their own money; avoid taxing people until they have earned the income; and encourage innovation and opportunity. In his speech, Hockey will note the rise of companies such as Facebook, Uber, Airbnb and Alibaba. Governments are wrestling with how to treat such companies amid complaints from existing operators \u2013 including the taxi and hotels industries \u2013 that they are on an uneven playing field. \"One of the lessons of this digital disruption is that our tax system should not favour one type of economic activity or punish another, because what these businesses have shown is that digital disruption is real,\" Hockey's speech notes say. \"It simply won't work if governments try to tax or legislate them out of existence.\""
