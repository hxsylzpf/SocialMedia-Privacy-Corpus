  "content": "Hello\" publishing chief Sally Cartwright said today that rival celebrity magazine OK! had made a \"rod for its own back\" in suing over the publication of snatched photos of the wedding of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones. \"I think it's unwise of them to sue and they may well be making a rod for their own backs. Every newspaper, every magazine since the beginning of the printed press has tried to scoop others,\" said Ms Cartwright. \"When it happens to you, you're annoyed and you're cross but you don't sue. It's the world that we live in and I think suing is very unwise,\" she added outside the high court in London immediately after the judge had announced that Ms Zeta Jones, Mr Douglas and OK! magazine had won their case. Along with other senior media executives and lawyers, Ms Cartwright said she feared the ruling would lead to the introduction of a privacy law by the back door. \"It may well move the law forward and establish a law of privacy which no English journalist, no English legal person would want,\" she told Sky News, adding that the UK could end up like France, \"where you can't even take crowd shots without getting the signature of every single person in the shot before publication\". Maninder Gill, the legal director of Northern &amp; Shell, publisher of OK!, admitted the win could leave the magazine open to similar lawsuits from disgruntled celebrities but said there was a crucial difference. \"The law's the law. If you infringe the law you have to face the consequences like you would if you infringed any law. The difference is we've never crossed the boundary of publishing photos we knew were taken in confidence, and that's a key point,\" he said outside court. \"We own four national newspapers, and soon a London newspaper and a national magazine but this is all about loyalty. Catherine and Michael came to OK! magazine despite being offered more money by Hello! and we had to stand by them all the way,\" said Mr Gill. \"It's a fantastic result. It's been a tough two and half years but we've finally got there and got victory,\" he added, saying that he was \"optimistic\" that OK1 would receive a substantial part of the \u00a31.75m damages it was seeking. Ms Cartwright also denied that Hello! had lost the case. \"We certainly haven't lost ours. Of the 13 claims against us nine have been completely dismissed,\" she said, adding that the magazine would appeal against the judge's ruling that Hello had broken the confidence of the Douglases. \"One thing we were cleared of which I'm delighted about is any intention of damaging the Douglases and that's very important to us. Hello! exists on its reputation of supportive treatment of stars and that is what we have always done,\" she said. She also denied the magazine had broken the press complaints commission's code of conduct, despite the judge specifically saying in his judgment that it had. \"No I'm sorry, I don't think we did. I realise that's what the judge has said. But if people sell an event for monetary gain then that places them outside the provisions of the code, so in our opinion we haven't broken the PCC code of conduct,\" said Ms Cartwright."
