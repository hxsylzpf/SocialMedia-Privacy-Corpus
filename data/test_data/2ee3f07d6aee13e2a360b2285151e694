  "content": "David Cameron had to respond to the Twitter hilarity around his \"look-at-me-I'm-on-the-phone-to-Obama\" tweet eventually, but he's been outdone yet again - this time, by a bookshop. On Friday morning, the PM took advantage of former president Bill Clinton's visit to the UK as an opportunity to reply to Sir Patrick Stewart, who joined the mocking on Wednesday evening armed with a tube full of wet wipes. A bit catty, but at least he tried. The internet wasn't that impressed, though. \"Do some work Dave,\" said @Biltawulf. Compare that with the gleeful response Waterstones Oxford Street's account got when they tweeted their (far funnier) take on the whole affair: \"PERFECTION,\" tweeted one enthusiastic follower. We think we can chalk this one up to Twitter 2 - PM 0. Better luck next time, Dave."
