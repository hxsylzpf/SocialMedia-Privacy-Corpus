  "content": "So Instagram video is a real thing that people can really download on iOS and Android devices right now.  With the new function, users can record videos up to 15 seconds long. The interface looks almost exactly the same though the company has added 13 new filters specially for video.  Instagram worked with \"video scientists\" to create a stabilization feature called Cinema.  That's it. After showing off an Instagram-made video full of little children running around, the presentation has concluded in under 30 minutes. Instagram video is available on iOS and Android devices, now.  \"Everything we know and love about Instagram, but it moves,\" said Systrom.  Systrom said Instagram teamed up with \"the world's leading video scientists,\" which a bunch of people just learned is a job.  He then unveiled Cinema \u2013 a video stabilization tool.  Instagram videos can be up to 15 seconds long. The video function is very similar to regular Instagram \u2013 users will tag and caption photos in the same way.  Also, Instagram created 13 brand new, custom filters for video. There is also a cover frame function to improve how videos look on mobile devices.  Systrom confirms that today is about unveiling Instagram's new video-sharing capabilities.  To build this service, Systrom said they focused on simplicity, beauty and community.  The interface is almost exactly the same, just with an added video button.  Systrom says 16 million photos have been shared on Instagram.  \"That's a lot of pictures of coffee,\" he jokes and possibly encourages.  More stats: 1 billion likes per day and 130 million people use the app.  \"When I think about Instagram, I think about moments,\" said Systrom.  He's explaining how life is short and taking pictures is the only way to preserve memories destroyed by naturally declining brain functions, but in less words.  Systrom is showing slides of the moments that it's important to preserve, like one of a bulldog in a top hat and pipe.  Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg opened the event by talking about the website's most popular services and how they work on mobile. He said the focus for today's event is on Instagram.  According to Zuckerberg, the Instagram team has tripled in size since being acquired by Facebook and invited Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom on stage. Facebook's invitation to press said: \"A small team has been working on a big idea. Join us for coffee and learn about a new product.\"  Ahead of the new product launch, Facebook unveiled other changes to its site.  As of this week, users can now respond to comments with photos. Last week, the site announced it has integrated hashtags, like Twitter.  ABC's Joanna Stern explained how the hashtag tweak could have major implications for Facebook user privacy.  It's a small feature change, sure, but it has far-reaching implications, especially in making what you say on Facebook more widely visible to others. Now, including a hashtag in your post will make it more easily discoverable by others. Facebook itself has said it is looking to make more public conversations on the service. Stern also offered privacy tips including reviewing status update privacy settings, reviewing older posts you may have used hashtags in and reviewing friends and lists.  Facebook is unveiling a new product today at its Menlo Park headquarters at 10am PT (1pm ET, 6pm BST). It is widely assumed that this new product will be an update to Instagram that enables video-sharing.  Instagram video is expected to allow people to use the popular photo-sharing app to share short videos, much like Twitter's video-sharing app Vine. As these rumors have been brewing, Vine posted a thank you to its users in a blogpost and promised updates to the service. \"Over the next few weeks, we'll be introducing some exciting new parts of Vine.\" TechCrunch predicted that Facebook would unveil its own news reader service to make up for the end of Google Reader, but the tech blog has since said it is not likely and that the author expects a video service as well. Facebook acquired Instagram for $1bn in April 2012. The service has 100 million monthly active users and 40 million photos are uploaded to the app daily, according to Instagram. "
