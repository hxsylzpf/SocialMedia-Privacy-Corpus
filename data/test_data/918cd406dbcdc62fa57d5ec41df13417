  "content": "A US student blogger has found herself at the centre of a Twitter storm after a magazine allegedly lifted her work \u2013 and then told her she should be grateful it had done so. Monica Gaudio was congratulated by a friend when an article she had written for Gode Cookery website appeared in Cooks Source magazine with her byline. However, she said she had never heard of the magazine, or given it permission to use her work. She writes in a blog: However, some basic Google-fu lead me to find them online and on Facebook. In fact, after looking at the Cooks Source Facebook page, I found the article with my name on it on on \"Page 10\" of the Cooks Source Pumpkin fest issue. (No worries, I have screencaps.) The magazine is published on paper (the website says they have between 17,000 and 28,000 readers) as well as being published on Facebook as well ... Apparently, it was just copied straight off the Godecookery webpage. As you can see from the page, it is copyrighted and it is also on a Domain name that I own. After a phone call and several emails to the magazine, she was asked what she wanted. She told them \"I wanted an apology on Facebook, a printed apology in the magazine and $130 donation (which turns out to be about $0.10 per word of the original article) to be given to the Columbia School of Journalism\". Gaudio says she then received the following reply from the editor: \"Yes Monica, I have been doing this for 3 decades, having been an editor at The Voice, Housitonic Home and Connecticut Woman Magazine. I do know about copyright laws. It was \"my bad\" indeed, and, as the magazine is put together in long sessions, tired eyes and minds somethings forget to do these things. But honestly Monica, the web is considered \"public domain\" and you should be happy we just didn't \"lift\" your whole article and put someone else's name on it! It happens a lot, clearly more than you are aware of, especially on college campuses, and the workplace. If you took offence and are unhappy, I am sorry, but you as a professional should know that the article we used written by you was in very bad need of editing, and is much better now than was originally. Now it will work well for your portfolio. For that reason, I have a bit of a difficult time with your requests for monetary gain, albeit for such a fine (and very wealthy!) institution. We put some time into rewrites, you should compensate me! I never charge young writers for advice or rewriting poorly written pieces, and have many who write for me... ALWAYS for free!\" She continues: \"The web is NOT public domain! Don't believe me? Try the University of Maryland University College -- or just Google it ... I should be thankful because I wasn't flat out plagiarized? Don't college students get, oh, I dunno, tossed out for being caught for plagiarism? How is this a valid argument?\" Twitter users including author Neil Gaiman reacted angrily to the magazine's stance, many suggesting that she launch a copyright case against the magazine; an anonymous protester opened a spoof Twitter account; and others created a \"#CrooksSource\" hashtag. Meanwhile, the magazine's Facebook page has been swamped with comments from angry web users. It remains to be seen whether Gaudio will receive an apology from the publisher \u2013 or how else it will respond to the internet onslaught. Friday update The Cooks Source editor, Judith Griggs has posted a message on its Facebook page: Hi Folks! Well, here I am with egg on my face! I did apologise to Monica via email, but aparently it wasnt enough for her. To all of you, thank you for your interest in Cooks Source and Again, to Monica, I am sorry \u2014 my bad! You did find a way to get your \"pound of flesh...\" we used to have 110 \"friends,\" we now have 1,870... wow! ...Best to all, Judith Just as when she stated \"the web is considered 'public domain'\", it appears that Griggs doesn't get Facebook \u2013 you can be sure that those extra 1,760 \"friends\" didn't click on \"Like\" because they loved her magazine, but because they wanted to post abuse. Sadly, many of the comments on the Facebook page turned excessively vitriolic. In a further twist, there have been claims that the magazine lifted material from other magazines - there is a list on Facebook of alleged sources. Later today, the mood turned more lighthearted on the magazine's Facebook page, with Cooks Source being blamed for, among other crimes, starting world war one and killing Laura Palmer. Boing Boing's Andrea James has compiled some of the best here.",
