  "content": "ITV News political editor Tom Bradby found himself trending on social media on Monday morning as thousands of well-wishers took to Twitter to congratulate him on a job well done. Then the haters got in on the act and began giving him him abuse for the same thing. What had Bradby done to deserve such attention? Had he snagged a huge scoop about internet privacy that had riled the web's darkest recesses? No, it was a mere case of mistaken twidentity. The thousands of lovers and haters weren't reflecting on Bradby's journalism, rather they had muddled him up with the NFL star Tom Brady, star of Sunday night's Super Bowl. The New England Patriots quarterback was voted \"most valuable player\" for the third time in his career as he won his fourth Super Bowl crown in the early hours of Monday morning. ITV News chief flak Laura Brander noted how marvellous it would be if all those tweeting their admiration for her Tom's work stay tuned for the service's election coverage. And Bradby himself showed some knowledge of the game he doesn't play and the recent controversy over the amount of air in the balls used."
