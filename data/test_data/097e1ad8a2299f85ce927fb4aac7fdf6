  "content": "\u2022 The confusing Digital Economy bill continues, with the Lib Dems and Tories forcing through a surprise amendment to the notorious Clause 17 - the one that had internet companies so concerned. Except it may turn out to be a pyrrhic victory because, whether well-intentioned or not, the change has certainly got up the noses of campaigners who say the new version is even more draconian. \u2022 After yesterday's information about Facebook's revenue, today it's Twitter's turn to have its numbers examined. Nothing on money yet, but their growth continues to be explosive. In an email to users, co-founder Biz Stone said that accounts have grown 1500% in the last year, the number of staff grew by 500% and there are now 70,000 registered Twitter applications. Where next? Trying to make money out of it all, of course. \u2022 And that's a convenient place to segue into a quick housekeeping notice. We've relaunched our Games-related Twitter feed as @gdngames - an easy way to get all our stories, blogposts, reviews and commentary pinged to you - as well as contributions from the bloggers, Keith, Greg and Jack. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed."
