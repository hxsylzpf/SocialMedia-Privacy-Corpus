  "content": "Job: high court judge Industry: legal Age: 68 New entry The rulings of Mr Justice Eady have shaped UK libel and privacy law, and in the process made him the country's most controversial high court judge. It was Eady who granted the gagging order to Ryan Giggs over his alleged affair with Imogen Thomas - only to see his ruling made redundant by thousands of people naming the footballer on Twitter \u2013 and it was Eady who found in favour of Max Mosley after the former Formula One boss sued the News of the World on privacy grounds over claims he took part in Nazi-themed orgies. His critics, chief among them the Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, have accused him of introducing a privacy law by the back door at the expense of freedom of speech. His supporters claim he is doing what he is required to do \u2013 interpreting the Human Rights Act and ruling where the public interest lies. But the rash of gagging orders granted to the rich and famous has prompted David Cameron to set up a parliamentary investigation into injunctions, saying the development of a privacy law by judges made him feel \"a little uneasy\". It remains to be seen whether Eady will be among those able to give evidence. Eady, once a successful libel QC who defended the tabloids that he now curtails, said in the the Giggs case that \"tittle tattle\" had no \"automatic priority\" over the right to privacy. Characterised by his friends at the Daily Mail as \"cold as a frozen haddock\" and an \"almost bloodless figure who sits in deathly judgment\" on the press, Eady said: \"The media have nowhere to vent their frustrations other than through personal abuse of the particular judge who happens to have made the decision.\" Eady is a man who enjoys his own privacy too. His Who's Who entry omits any hobbies or interests.",
