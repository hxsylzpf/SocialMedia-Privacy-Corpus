  "content": "Alan Sugar has criticised the Sun over its coverage of how he was tricked into retweeting a fake birthday message containing an image of the serial killer Harold Shipman. The business magnate and star of BBC show The Apprentice fell victim to a prankster who claimed the image was of his father and asked Lord Sugar to wish him a happy birthday. A report in the Sun, which said Sugar had \"carelessly\" tweeted the birthday message, was met with a furious response from the businessman, who recalled criticism of the newspaper's coverage of the Hillsborough disaster and said it had shown \"no compassion\" for the victims. Sugar went on to tell his 4.8 million followers: \"When u leave a junior in charge of newsroom over the holidays this is what happens. I hope the kid keeps the job. #firesuneditor.\" He also turned his ire on the Daily Mirror, recalling its publication of photographs that were alleged to show a British solider urinating on an Iraqi prisoner but were subsequently discovered to have been faked. He received backing from BBC sports presenter and former England footballer Gary Lineker. Sugar's counterpart on the US version of The Apprentice, Donald Trump, was duped in 2014 into inadvertently sharing a picture of Fred and Rose West by a prankster who claimed that his parents had died. Trump was also tricked last year into tweeting a picture of the Labour party's new leader, Jeremy Corbyn, after being told that the image showed the father of a supporter of the US presidential candidate. Harold Shipman, who died in 2004, was jailed for life in 2000 for murdering 15 patients with lethal doses of the drug diamorphine while working in Hyde, Greater Manchester."
