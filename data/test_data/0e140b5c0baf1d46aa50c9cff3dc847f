  "content": "WhatsApp is one of the few apps that isn't in a folder on my phone's home screen and it's probably the only app that has existed on every smartphone that I've owned. In fact, back when I first downloaded it \u2013 when I was rocking an iPhone 3G \u2013 it was free. Now both iPhone and Android users have to pay a $1 (69p) annual subscription charge to renew the service. Facebook recently announced it would acquire WhatsApp, a mobile messaging app, for a staggering $19bn (in cash and stocks). The app, available across all platforms, syncs with your phone number and address book and automatically adds those who have WhatsApp installed to a separate contacts list. From my experience, there are two key features that are important to every WhatsApp user: the first is that the app uses your data package (or WiFi) instead of taking away from any messaging packages, which means that you can send text, images or video to friends for free. Even better, you can send messages to friends and family abroad at no cost. These days, I don't get texts, I get WhatsApp messages. And the younger members in my family, still on pay-as-you-go contracts, send thousands of messages on the app each year, which as texts may have cost more than they could afford. The second is the ability to host group conversations. Although this is available on newer versions of iOS, this has been a core WhatsApp feature for some years. This is incredibly useful if you want to, say, create a group conversation for those you've living with or people with whom you're organising an event. I suppose Facebook might have bought it because users keep going back to the app and send dozens of messages a day. Not only is it a pseudo in-built app on all my phones, it's something I use multiple times a day. That's important for a company that has been looking to build their mobile presence for years, starting with Facebook Zero (which allows those in emerging markets to access Facebook without being charged for data) before acquiring the photography-based social network Instagram and then introducing Facebook Home, an Android app meant to replace home screens. Staying connected with friends The other factor is that, arguably in a similar way to Facebook, WhatsApp has helped me to keep in touch with friends and family. It has probably been better than Facebook, actually, because my family in Tanzania have either never been that interested in the social network, or their difficulties in finding adequate network have made it frustrating to access the site. And for someone with family abroad, WhatsApp has been crucial in keeping us together. Previously, my father invited me to an email chain with his four brothers and sisters and their children (or my 14 first cousins). There were times when I came home to 120 emails. Now I have multiple groups for my family and I get notes throughout the day. But these feel much more manageable as they accompany me throughout my day \u2013 and the pictures of adorable nephews and nieces don't go amiss either. But that's not all. When I travel, access to WhatsApp means that I can speak to my friends and family on a device that I am carrying around with me at all times. Whether I want to send my dad a quick \"hey, everything's good and I'm alive\" message without being charged 50p, or make my friends jealous by sending them a picture of a cronut, I can send a picture in seconds. More experienced WhatsApp users will also know that you can \"game\" the app to use your old number even when you have a different sim card inside, which makes it easier for friends to contact you. And despite it's rather plain and bland aesthetics, the app does the job it promises. It lets you message your friends without getting in the way. But best of all, no-one ever sent annoying broadcast messages like they did on Blackberry. That was quite possibly the worst."
