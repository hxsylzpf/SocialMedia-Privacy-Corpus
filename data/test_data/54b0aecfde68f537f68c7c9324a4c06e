  "content": "LinkedIn insists its major executive reshuffle was amicable and will allow founder Reid Hoffman to \"take his vision for the company to a higher level\", after announcing that he would replace Dan Nye as chief executive of the business social networking website. European managing director Kevin Eyres said today that Nye, who resigned late yesterday, had left after discussions with Hoffman over \"what was the best way forward for the firm\". \"Reid has a vision for the company and they both felt it best that he runs that vision as chief executive. Everyone has tremendous respect for both of them but the point is what is best for the company,\" Eyres added. Hoffman founded LinkedIn in 2003, and brought in Nye, a former Procter &amp; Gamble executive, in February 2007 to take over from him as chief executive and overhaul its finances and day-to-day operations. Under Nye, LinkedIn went from 67 staff and 8 million members to 350 employees and 32 million members, and started running in profitability. Last night, LinkedIn announced that former Yahoo executive vice president Jeff Weiner would be joining the firm as interim president, following last week's appointment of Dipchand Nishar, a former Google executive, as vice president of products. Eyres denied the suggestion in a recent Business Week interview that Hoffman's management style was chaotic. He also praised Weiner as \"a tremendous operator who has been very successful at Yahoo\". \"That's why we're making him interim president for day-to-day operations and Reid is focusing on vision and strategy. It's a great marriage of skills,\" Eyres added. LinkedIn claims it has benefited from the economic downturn as members try to promote themselves to find work through the network. The company claims that one new user signs up to the site every second. Eyres said the site would continue to aggressively expand its European presence next year, following the launch of a French version three weeks ago. He added that there would be a series of product changes in the new year. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
