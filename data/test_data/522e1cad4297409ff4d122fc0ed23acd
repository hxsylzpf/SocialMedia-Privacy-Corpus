  "content": "Britain's government has survived for 1,000 years without an IT strategy, but this is about to change. Chief information officer Ian Watmore is this summer drafting a national plan that will aim to transform public services through IT. Speaking at the New Statesman new media awards earlier this month, Watmore hinted that the as-yet-untitled strategy will be ambitious. It will not set out to computerise organisations and procedures, but look to find new ways of providing public services from scratch with the citizen at the centre. This goes hand in hand with Watmore's other big priority - to find \u00a321.5bn in efficiency savings by joining up government. If Watmore is looking for ideas to pad out the strategy pages, plenty of people are offering help. Two Labour-leaning thinktanks this month published their views of government in the IT age. Both place citizens at the centre, but perhaps not in a way that government may like. Both studies were sponsored by the IT industry: the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) credits Atos Origin, BT, Steria and Microsoft while the Work Foundation's project was supported by Adobe. The IPPR's Manifesto for a Digital Britain aims \"to democratise debates about the function of information and communication technology in society\". It argues that we have built the hardware of a digital Britain, but have not yet found a way of using it. One issue crying out for democratisation, as well as balance, is privacy. In particular, it warns of an imbalance between the government's enthusiasm for joining up databases and its respect for \"constitutional due process\". Citizens should have a choice on what level they engage digitally with government, the manifesto argues. The Department for Constitutional Affairs, which should be in charge of such questions, is not a party, \"let alone an equal party\", in developing e-government and surveillance strategies, the strategy claims. Transformed government implies different agencies sharing information. The manifesto warns against assuming that, because consumers are happy to sacrifice privacy for convenience when dealing with private firms, they will feel the same about government. Citizens cannot choose whether to use government, which covers many more activities than any private firm. \"In a highly interconnected society, privacy is the right to disconnect, to be anonymous and to be alone should one wish.\" No consumer would want to sign up to a mobile phone package if there were no way of cancelling it. Yet government promotes the benefits of its modernisation without offering any way of opting out, either periodically or permanently. In another criticism of e-government policy, the manifesto attacks the \"techno-centrism\" of targets, such as putting all government services online. While it welcomes Watmore's ambition of transforming public services, it warns of difficulties ahead. \"Transformation\" success stories from industry usually involve creating new services, not reshaping existing ones. Amazon and easyJet were set up from scratch. \"It is far harder to think of long-standing organisations that have been dramatically reinvented through the injection of technology.\" The manifesto also warns that up to now, the Treasury has underestimated the cost of government computing, officially \u00a314bn a year. It calls on the Treasury to take into account the real cost of change, not just the hardware and software. \"This will mean that e-government will start to appear more costly, but in the long run, investment will be made more sensibly and more productively.\" To help balance the books, the manifesto says that new systems be assessed by their contribution to \"public value\", rather than by the money they save. Public value may come from users' satisfaction, or less carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere because people can work at home. This idea may strike a chord with a civil service obsessed with finding more creative ways of measuring productivity. In a gift to satirists, the Office for National Statistics announced on Tuesday that it is setting up a \"UK Centre for the Measurement of Government Activity (UKCeMGA)\", responsible for \"delivering programmes to produce improved output and productivity measures for health, education, public order and safety, and for social protection\". Watmore's strategy will almost certainly look at ways of ending the digital divide. The IPPR's manifesto suggests that previous attempts to promote digital inclusion, by for example giving away internet-connected PCs, were misguided. \"The important realisation has now been made that the digital divide is a symptom of economic inequality, and not a cause.\" The Work Foundation's publication What ICT? Providing more citizen- focused services, shares this concern about the gap between digital haves and have nots. It claims that ICT \"has the potential to transform the relationship between citizen and public services\". Whether citizens will embrace transformed government is another matter. Research found concerns that IT would liberate some individuals, by giving them round the clock access to \"self service\" government, at the expense of people less happy with computers and the internet. Watmore's plan for transformed government will need to recognise that different groups of people will want to communicate in different ways. Like the IPPR, the Work Foundation calls for better public debate about data sharing and privacy - and that government should keep citizens informed of what it is doing.
