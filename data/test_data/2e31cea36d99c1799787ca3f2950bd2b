  "content": "If you are one of the 53% of Britons now creating and sharing content online, you might, like me, see Facebook as your digital living room. In which case, if someone suddenly walked in and moved your sofa you wouldn't like it. No wonder, then, that angry Facebook users have united in protest. A lot of them. 1,175,000 Facebookers have joined the group \"Change Facebook back to normal!!\", and this is not the only discussion board. \"Please give us our old news feed back!\" boasts 530,000 member by now. And they still grow. Fast. On Friday, Facebook began rolling out changes to its news feed. Instead of the \"Live Feed\" with friends' status updates and activities, Facebook users suddenly found a \"News Feed\" for which Facebook curated the activity stream with the supposed highlights of their friends activities. \"News Feed picks stories that we think you'll enjoy based on a variety of factors including how many friends have liked and commented on it and how likely you are to interact with that story,\" explained Facebook's Raylene Yung in a blog post on Friday. Theoretically, you can easily change back to the Live Feed, except that it is much more cluttered now, since it includes a lot more detailed information. But the biggest mistake: Facebook didn't prepare the users. Previously, users have been warned of changes to the site by explanations on their homepages. This time the changes were revealed in a hard-to-find blogpost. The users didn't get involved. Facebook broke the unwritten internet rule of transparency. Moreover, tutorials on how to get back to the old Facebook are doing the rounds on YouTube. It will be interesting to see if the uproar has an effect. Facebook announced in spring that it was going to change its terms of use - and thousands of users criticised the site. Offering an olive branch, Facebook let them choose their own set of rules called the Facebook Principles and Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. Only 600,000 voted. What do you think of the new Facebook? Is it an improvement? Or did Facebook make a mistake? Have your say below."
