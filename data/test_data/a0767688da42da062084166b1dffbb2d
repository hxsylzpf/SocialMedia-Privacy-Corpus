  "content": "Parents who fret about the material that their teenage daughters post on the internet will sympathise with Florencia Kirchner's mother and father. Florencia, or 'florkey' as she calls herself on the net, is probably the only teenage user of a photo-weblog (fotologger) who can rightfully claim to be the daughter of two democratically elected Presidents. And Florencia, who has gained cult status, is a gossip columnist's dream. Fabulously indiscreet, her fotolog records her in the kind of sexy poses - many of them associated with different alcoholic drinks - that would be worrying enough for an ordinary mother. But Argentina's newly elected President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, is probably more alarmed by the photographs that Florencia posts of herself smiling on busy streets or riding anonymously on subway carriages with no presidential security in sight. 'K Girl in the Subway' ran a typical headline in Caras magazine after Florencia posted a picture of herself and a friend teasingly staring into the camera on the subway in short skirts on 16 December. With plenty of grammatical errors, poor vocabulary and full of colloquial expressions, Florencia is able to reveal secret images of the President's private life. For instance, one of the fotolog entries shows Florencia with her mother during her confirmation on 23 November last year. Nor is it lacking in embarrassing vulgarity. One of the first entries of her blog in 2006, when she joined fotolog, is a quote from artist Liz Phair's song 'Why can't I': 'Here we go, we're at the beginning, we haven't fucked yet, but my head's spinning!' While the blog delights fans, it is not a view shared by her father. Press reports in Buenos Aires claim that her father, Nestor Kirchner, the former President who steered Argentina out of its social debacle five years ago and handed over a happily humming economy and the presidential sash to his wife Cristina this month after her landslide victory, has begged Florencia to stop posting pictures of herself and friends and family, including pictures at her mother's inauguration and at other official events. Predictably, rather than complying to the presidential command, Florencia has instead simply swapped tags, mutating from 'bananarepublic' to 'coffeelove' to 'florkey'. Political opponents of her parents are more entertained with the first daughter's penchant for cyber exposure. Apart from the mild headache common to all parents of teenagers with fotologs, the attention that 'florkey' is generating is a welcome distraction from the darker trouble spots on the media horizon for her mother, such as a scandal that erupted following her inauguration regarding alleged illegal contributions to her electoral campaign by the Venezuelan President, Hugo Chavez, an energy shortage that threatens to affect industrial and home consumption at the start of the hot southern summer, and runaway price increases that look set to become an inflationary headache during 2008. Such worries are far from Florencia's latest fotolog, titled 'Perfume &amp; Violence' and interspersed with adoring exclamations from friends and self-proclaimed fans who call her 'goddess', beg to be included in her list of 'friends/favourites' and send best wishes to her 'family'."
