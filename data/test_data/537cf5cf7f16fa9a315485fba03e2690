  "content": "The father of Jade Goody's two children, Jeff Brazier, today appealed for the media to stop taking photographs of five-year-old Bobby and four-year-old Freddy until further notice. In a statement issued through Simon Cowell's company, Syco Music, Brazier expressed gratitude for the media's support but appealed for privacy to allow his sons to come to terms with the loss of their mother, who died on Sunday, aged 27, after losing her battle with cancer. The statement asked for photographers to stop taking pictures of the children from 8pm today until further notice. \"Whilst we appreciate the huge amount of support and well wishes that have been received through the media over the past few months and in particular the sensitive handling of the last few days, we feel it is important for the children to now have some time away from the media spotlight to allow them to come to terms with the loss of their mother and have some family time alone and privacy,\" said the statement on behalf of Brazier. \"We would now like to respectfully ask that following the children's visit to Jade's home this afternoon, that photographers refrain from taking pictures of the children from 8pm this evening [Tuesday] until further notice (or [from] publishing pictures taken after this time which may be supplied by third parties). \"Obviously we understand the enormous public support and interest in their wellbeing and will, in due course, be happy to allow some media access at such a point in time that we feel is appropriate.\" Syco has no formal arrangement with Brazier, but has stepped in to help out the TV presenter, who fronts the company's X Factor Live tour. A spokeswoman for Syco Music said: \"Everyone has been feeling their way through this \u2013 it has been an unknown area for everybody. Even the press have not always known what they should and should not do. We wanted to draw a line.\" The two children were pictured on the front pages of tabloids today, including the Sun and the Mirror. \"Jade's little fighters,\" said the headline on the Sun, next to a picture of Bobby wearing boxing gloves and football kit outside their Essex home. \"Jade Goody's two sons show they have inherited all their mum's fighting spirit yesterday,\" added the paper. Brazier was also pictured with his children. There is no suggestion the pictures were taken without the family's consent. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
