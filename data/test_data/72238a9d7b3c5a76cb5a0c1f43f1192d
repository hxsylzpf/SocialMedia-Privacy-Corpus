  "content": "The British Airline Pilots' Association represents more than 10,000 commercial pilots. Our members are overwhelmingly against the government's national ID card scheme trials for pilots and other airside workers, and we will resist the card with all legal means possible. Our members feel at home navigating the world, but a growing number are incensed at the stress and bureaucracy of having to navigate the UK's security system. A recent internal poll shows that inconsistent and petty-minded UK security arrangements at airports are leading flightcrew to experience delays and, more worryingly, stress, with 40% saying in this poll that the experience makes them less able to operate the aircraft. Not enough is being done to tackle this. For example, a UK pilot has to have a different pass for every airport they operate from. We have pressed for a national airside pass system, which would aid security and provide a more efficient and less stressful system, but the idea has been deemed \"too difficult\". Yet we are now being told to swallow a new national identity card scheme that will not do one thing to improve a pilot's daily experience. Our members believed the government promise that the national ID card would be voluntary, but they now know it is anything but. Our members must have an airside pass to operate aircraft and now discover that to get that pass they must have a national ID card. They are told, \"You don't actually have to one\" \u2013 but no card equals no pass, which equals no job. This is coercion and, by trialling the scheme in Manchester and London City airports, the government is clearly attempting to isolate pockets of resistance. Our members know that our industry is under economic threat. Capacity is being cut and so are jobs. Companies like XL have not survived and the livelihoods of many members have gone as well. And yet with so much the government could be doing they chose to spend huge amounts of time, finance and political goodwill on a white elephant that does not have cross-party support. Fiddling while Rome burns. Our members see the regular stories of government data going missing or falling into the wrong hands. Like every other citizen, they ask themselves what will happen to the data they are coerced into providing; whether it will it be safe, whose hands might it fall into, and what might they do with the data? Yes, there have been lots of reassuring noises, but frankly we don't believe them. Our members, who aim to be the ultimate professionals, increasingly have a sense that a line is being crossed in the relationship between state and citizen; a sense that Big Brother knows best. Our members are not alone in feeling all of this. Every airline CEO that I meet shares this view. The Trades Union Congress shares this view. The feedback we have had from the public suggests they share this view. And, judging by an early day motion, a growing number of MPs share this view. The government needs to wake up to this resistance. It, and we, won't go away."
