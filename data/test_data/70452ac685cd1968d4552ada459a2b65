  "content": "A special post-budget Q&amp;A on Monday night saw Joe Hockey inundated with questions from worried residents of western Sydney. Tweets using the #qanda hashtag broke records, according to the ABC, and resulted in servers crashing and the disappearance of curated tweets from the TV screen. The mood in the studio audience was incredulous and dismissive to begin with, and only got angrier from there. The host, Tony Jones, pre-empted any repeat of the student protests on Q&amp;A this month by warning the audience to behave. Online, the treasurer drew some respect for his willingness to appear solo and to answer people's concerns about the cuts announced last week, but despite his answers and assurances about Medicare co-payments, rising university fees and changes to Newstart and the pension, a sense remained among watchers that the treasurer was out of touch with ordinary Australians."
