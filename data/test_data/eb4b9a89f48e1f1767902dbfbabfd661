  "content": "Here's some advice to reporters that may not work too well in the digital age: \"Take well-ground Indian ink as much as suffices and a camel hairbrush proportionate to the intersperse of your lines. In an auspicious hour, read your final draft and consider faithfully every paragraph, sentence and word, blacking out where requisite. Let it lie by to drain as long as possible. At the end of that time, re-read and you should find that it will bear a second shortening. Finally, read it aloud alone and at leisure. May be a shade more brushwork will then indicate or impose itself. If not, praise Allah, and let it go and when thou hast done, repent not.\" The \"tutor\" was Rudyard Kipling, and the quote is taken from a feature in today's issue of the Indian newspaper, The Pioneer, to mark the 75th anniversary of the great man's death. In his early 20s, Kipling was an assistant editor at The Pioneer, and later worked as a (leisurely) correspondent for the paper. How would he have coped with Twitter? Source: The Pioneer"
