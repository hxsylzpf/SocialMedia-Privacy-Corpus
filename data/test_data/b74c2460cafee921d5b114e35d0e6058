  "content": "The editor of the Irish Daily Star responsible for publishing topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge (aka Kate Middleton) has resigned. Michael O'Kane had been suspended since September while an internal investigation was held into his decision to rerun pictures of the Duchess and Prince William sunbathing in a French villa. They were originally published in the French issue of the magazine Closer and the Star showed reproductions of the offending pages. In a statement issued yesterday, the Irish Daily Star said: \"As a result of the publication on 15 September 2012, issues arose with the shareholders of Independent Star Limited. \"Having considered those issues in tandem with Mr O'Kane, it is Mr O'Kane's decision to resign as editor of the Irish Daily Star, effective immediately.\" Among those issues was a threat by one of the key shareholders, Richard Desmond of Northern and Shell group, to shut down the operation or, at the least, to give up on the paper's co-ownership. It is unclear whether he has since changed his mind. Oddly, the other co-owners, the Irish-based publisher, Independent News &amp; Media (INM), said yesterday that O'Kane had followed the company's editorial policies and guidelines, and also acted in a professional manner. If so, why did he have to go? Sources: Irish Times/Irish Examiner/Irish Independent"
