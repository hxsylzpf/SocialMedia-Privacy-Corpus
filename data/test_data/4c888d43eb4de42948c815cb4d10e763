  "content": "Sony Pictures has demanded that news organisations stop reporting on the information stolen by hackers in the crippling attack on the studio. The demand was sent to media companies in a three-page letter written by Sony Pictures' lawyers Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner after a wave of highly embarrassing data releases by hackers. \"Sony Pictures Entertainment does not consent to your possession, review, copying, dissemination, publication, uploading, downloading or making any use of the stolen information,\" the letter read. 'No choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss' The company also asked recipients to \"destroy the stolen information\" and added: \"If you do not comply with this request, and the stolen information is used or disseminated by you in any manner, Sony Pictures Entertainment will have no choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss arising from such use or dissemination.\" The data was stolen as part of an attack by hacker group Guardians of Peace on Sony Pictures that crippled its entire computer network and forced employees back to using pen and paper. The data included film scripts, five movies, personal details including medical records of actors and past and present Sony employees, payment details, user names and passwords and email archives for a number of top studio executives. 'Sony Pictures into the worst state' The hackers have threatened to continue releasing data including a \"Christmas gift\" that \"will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting. The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state,\" they added. The group also sent a message to Sony Pictures employees saying that it would not release their private data if you \"tell us your name and business title\". The origin of the hackers is still unknown, although North Korea remains a possible culprit despite denying it was behind the sophisticated attack that would have challenged even government cyber-defences."
