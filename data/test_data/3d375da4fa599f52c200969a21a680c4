  "content": "If Simon Mayo does not appear entirely in the festive spirit today, then it's with good reason. Someone's only gone and stolen the Christmas wreath off his front door. \"To the hoolies who stole our Xmas wreath ... fancy a cup if tea? I've got something else for you,\" he tells his Twitter followers. Steady on, Simon. Revenge never got anyone nowhere. \"Let it go, let it go,\" advises his imminent BBC Radio 2 colleague, Chris Evans. \"I have let it go. It is gone. In a queue for a new one,\" replies Mayo. A new what? Baseball bat?"
