  "content": "Last night, the keywords \"xfactor\", \"simon\", \"cowell\", \"@joemcelderry91\" and \"jedward\" were all over the UK Twitter stream. Tweets in London increased to about three times their normal level with a peak after the final. A time-lapse film of Trendsmap shows that Arsenal's win played the most important role in the earlier evening, until around eight. However, the 15.5 million people watching the show left their marks once it finished, when Simon Cowell's name, among other X Factor-related keywords, took the lead over \"arsenal\" and the Sunday-specific \"roast\". Other Twitter tools such as Trendistic also indicate a growth in tweets during the show, with a peak after the end. Sending pictures from backstage and picking up the dialogue with other tweeters, The X Factor's official Twitter account tried its best to integrate and interact. But as much talk as there is about TV getting social and interactive with Twitter or providing possibilities to comment, the results here suggest that people prefer to watch TV first and get interactive later. \"The tweet rate that we obtained from Twitter for the London area peaked at about 1 per second at around 21:05 UTC\", said John Barratt of Trendsmap. As there are multiple attempts to connect the telly with social media and make the watching of shows more interactive, these figures might provide an important insight. Twitter already allows a parallel approach but is rather used after the show. So people are obviously happy using the telly to relax from multitasking leaving it to office hours or parenting time."
