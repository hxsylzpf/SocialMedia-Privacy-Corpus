  "content": "A Chicago lettings agency is suing a former tenant for at least $50,000 (\u00a330,000) after she complained on Twitter about mould in her apartment. Horizon Group Management filed the lawsuit against Amanda Bonnen on Monday in response to what it claimed was her \"false and defamatory\" message on the microblogging site. The tweet, posted on 12 May on Bonnen's since-discontinued account @abonnen, said: \"Who said sleeping in a mouldy apartment was bad for you? Horizon Realty thinks it's okay.\" In its suit filed in the Cook county circuit court, the company claimed her post \"maliciously and wrongfully\" condemned her apartment and their service. It said the tweet was published \"throughout the world\" and severely damaged its good name. Jeff Michael, whose family runs Horizon, told the Chicago Sun-Times: \"The statements are obviously false, and it's our intention to prove that.\" He said the company never had a conversation with Bonnen about the post and never asked her to take it down. \"We're a sue first, ask questions later kind of an organisation,\" he told the paper. The lawsuit has provoked a backlash against Horizon on Twitter and the wider blogosphere. Horizon Group management has become one of the most searched and discussed subjects on Twitter, with posters criticising the company for its legal action and arguing it had made a major PR blunder. Twitter user charlesthomas wrote: \"So Bravo to you, Horizon Group Management! You damaged your rep far more than @abonnen ever could.\" Another poster, jvandeboom, tweeted: \"What a PR failure by Horizon Group Management ... Makes me believe the mould claims even more.\" Many say that since Bonnen's Twitter account had just over 20 followers before it was deleted, Horizon has generated far more bad publicity for its service than her tweet ever could have done. The overwhelmingly critical response led the company to issue a statement defending its legal action. Michael denied that his comment about suing first and asking questions later was meant seriously. \"I would first like to take this opportunity to apologise for tongue in cheek comments that were made previously regarding our approach to litigation. This statement is not in line with our philosophy towards property management and was taken out of context.\" He said the company's legal action followed a class-action lawsuit filed against it by Bonnen for allegedly violating Chicago leasing rules by not paying tenants interest on security deposits and failing to provide warnings about overloading porches. Michael said Bonnen's lawsuit was \"completely baseless\". The statement acknowledged that her apartment \"was one of several that experienced an overnight leak during roof repairs in late March 2009 caused by an error made by an external contractor\". He said all tenant grievances in respect to the problem were \"quickly and amicably resolved, except Ms Bonnen's\"."
