  "content": "And so, as Westminster's stars of the great Strand show depart, mopping their brows, Sir Brian Leveson and his team go back to basics. They have to come up with a new template for press regulation this autumn. They, like almost everyone else these past nine months, have paid lugubrious homage to the ideals of press freedom (served up in mum's apple pie helpings). But now they need to cut mustard, not stir custard. At which point, the grilling of Messrs Cameron, Hunt and Co begins to seem what it mostly was: a headline-creating, wave-making distraction from the fundamental task. You can go mad trying to define what Robert Jay QC calls \"undue proximity\" between politicians and journalists \u2013 or trying to regulate who sips cocktails with whom. But unless you're going to require journalists and bloggers to embrace such a pettifogging regime too, you're pottering down the blindest of alleys, regulating human nature until your wig falls off. However, one political witness at least said something truly germane to the main event. There, for a while, sat a young chancellor of the exchequer arguing that history didn't begin with John Major or even a preternaturally calm Gordon Brown. It was left to George Osborne to instruct Leveson on the style and practices of our 18th-century freesheets when it came to mixing fact, comment and vibrant campaigning. No judge or silk, reaching for his dusty texts and tabs, would dream of thinking that legal history doesn't matter, so why on earth should they assume that press history is a closed, irrelevant book? Call Defoe, Hogarth, Gillray and William Hone to testify, in short order, that newspapermen and politicians aren't buddies under the skin, but fundamental adversaries. They're not supposed to co-operate in some judicially ordained steady state: we serve our publics \u2013 and democracy \u2013 in wholly different ways. Call Guido Fawkes and Ian Hislop again. History, once you start exploring it, offers vital lessons. Here come Northcliffe, Beaverbrook and Co, creating a press that sold many millions to ordinary working people \u2013 that is, newspapers made for voters outside the charmed circle of Britain's upper caste. The politicians didn't like that. They wooed, flattered and schemed (Lloyd George). They chomped and threatened (Stanley Baldwin). They turned manic proprietors into ministers (Churchill). They wanted regulation to cow the press as early as 1937. And, once Hitler was defeated, they started their own campaigns. List the commissions and inquiries that followed: Ross, Shawcross, Younger, McGregor, Calcutt 1, Calcutt 2, and now Leveson. What, from Ross's worries about the growth of \"sensational papers\" such as the Daily Mirror, did they mostly set out to achieve? A binding press code, an \"independent\" chairman, clear sanctions against transgression. We are, in sum, very much where Sir David Ross found himself in 1947. Nothing essential has changed. As Leveson continually looks back across 65 years of supposedly failed outcomes, doesn't he examine all these last-chance saloons and ask what was heinous enough to provoke them, case by case, in the first place? He's ready enough to say that this time, at last, the \"problem\" must be fixed. But the problem that began it all came long before phone hacking, Princess Diana or the rise of Rupert Murdoch. At root, it was a struggle for control, a generic process, not a reaction. The great and the good wanted their quieter lives back. And because this was Britain \u2013 not First Amendment America \u2013 they sought to build regulatory edifices fit to achieve that purpose. Some of those efforts collapsed under the weight of their own bureaucracy. The old Press Council perished amid the thickets of legal ritual, of hearings with lawyers representing their clients, of infinite delay. Complaint resolution seemed to drag on forever (even longer than Leveson). Third-party complaints from people or groups clogged the system still more. History says keep lawyers out of this game if at all possible. And then history opens a wider vista. Ask yourself where else in the globe has endured so many commissions and committees examining how to regulate the press more stringently? Answer, in our immediate democratic world: none \u2013 a finding confirmed by a new Reuters Institute survey of 11 relevant western countries, including Ireland. And not one of those 11 goes beyond complaint resolution to encompass broader standards and sanctions. We're absolutely alone, uniquely blessed or cursed. Does Leveson occasionally pause to wonder why? Are we alone because our press as a whole has been uniquely awful \u2013 or because our establishment has swallowed and continues instinctively to regurgitate its own instinctive agenda? One distinguished historian, Professor Richard Shannon, thinks that self-regulation of the kind that politicians and their appointed judges want has never succeeded \"because it was grudged\" by a press that wants to be free (and puts its own commercial survival in that same basket). Maybe this time around it will be different. Maybe, in a world of changing governments and rapidly changing press technology, there's a solid platform of wisdom that can endure. But don't bank on it. Leveson already has a proposal from Lord Hunt of the departing Press Complaints Commission blending contract law, internal audits, revised codes and standards investigation, plus fines in egregious cases. Any regulation warrior, back in 1947, would have seized that and hailed victory. But the control advocates are winning because some newspapers made ridiculous mistakes (of the kind David Cameron made when he hired Andy Coulson). How far do you ride that tide? There are some absolutely crucial questions left totally unresolved here. What does \"independence\" mean in a Britain (see the overtly political battle to find a new BBC director general) where the word is often a fig leaf for interference? Why cite as precedent bodies such as the Advertising Standards Authority, where one political chairman succeeds another? Ross's commission wanted Press Council lay members chosen by the lord chief justice, if you please. Is that what we mean by independence \u2013 that today's press must pay millions to support a regulatory body whose membership it cannot approve or influence? The Bar Council, the Law Society, the General Medical Council et al would rise in revolt at such a prospect. Andrew Neil, now Mr Politics for the BBC, once Mr Chairman of Murdoch's Sky, tweeted the other day that \"sometimes you wonder if Leveson understands the first thing about journalism\". Watching Sir Brian and David Cameron blithely wipe current editors from the panel of any PCC successor body, replacing them perhaps by \"former editors\" \u2013 who wouldn't, of course, know what was happening inside modern newspapers \u2013 you wonder whether politicians and judges understand the first thing about a system that can endure more than five minutes in this twittering, trolling, turbulent time. No one doubts that the hackings and bribings were criminal and demand criminal sentences. But when Leveson prescribes one public interest definition, long audit trails a-winding and more, then the whole thrust of the past nine months has been to make the newsrooms of the future more like subsidiary courtrooms. Inevitable, perhaps. Enduring, hardly. But as free and as flexible as a free press needs, to serve its public properly? Only someone who thinks history began last July would dream of believing that.",
