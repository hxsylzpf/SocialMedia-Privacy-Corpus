  "content": "A sign of the times at the London outpost of Sony Pictures. Plastered across the marble pillars and glass atrium in the Golden Square HQ, are instructions \u2013 nay, pleas \u2013 telling staff not to log-on or use company-issued electronic devices under any circumstances in the wake of the massive hack suffered by the Hollywood film and TV studio. Presumably printed off round the corner at the local newsagent after being written on someone's personal smartphone and emailed from a personal account, the signs are a reminder of the disruption caused by the hacking of the studio's computer systems by Guardians of Peace. Monkey hears that calling a halt to company communication has affected myriad activity across Sony's portfolio of business interests. These include its UK TV production subsidiaries Left Bank Pictures, birth place of Wallander and Cardinal Burns, Tough Young Teachers maker Victory Television and Silver River, home of The Big Allotment Challenge, temporarily delaying decisions and conversations about decisions. But Monkey hears that for everyone concerned it's business as usual now after executives switched to personal email addresses and mobile telephone numbers."
