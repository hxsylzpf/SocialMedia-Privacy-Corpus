  "content": "South Korean mobile social networking firm Kakao is quietly becoming a powerful platform for social games, judging by figures it has announced for the first half of 2013. Kakao, whose KakaoTalk messaging app has more than 100m users, launched its games service at the end of June 2012, providing a Facebook-esque social backbone for multiplayer mobile games. One year on, there are now 30m people playing Kakao's catalogue of 180 games. The company says that those games generated revenues of 348bn Korean Won (around \u00a3205.8m) in the first half of 2013, up from 118bn Won (\u00a369.8m) in the second half of 2012. That's a sharp 194% increase, and one that Kakao claims is benefitting independent mobile games developers, not just big firms. It says that six of the 10 top grossing games on its network were made by small or medium-sized firms. Eight games have been downloaded more than 10m times, while two \u2013 Anipang for Kakao and Dragon Flight for Kakao \u2013 are past the 20m mark. What's startling about Kakao's rise to gaming prominence is the amount of money being made, in contrast to what's still a relatively small number of players. That's a big opportunity for developers, but also a potential threat to bigger fish in the social gaming world, like Facebook. Earlier this year, Facebook said it had more than 250m people playing games on its platform, with more than $2bn paid out to developers in 2012 as a whole. Most of Kakao's 30m players are in South Korea, so any threat to Facebook depends on the platform growing elsewhere in the world. Kakao's announcement of its gaming growth includes plans to \"further strengthen the global competitiveness of its game platform based on the accumulated experience and know-how it has gained from the Korean market\". That may be easier said than done, though. While Korean mobile games publishers like Com2uS and Gamevil have had hits elsewhere in the world, Japanese firms DeNA and GREE \u2013 better comparisons because they also run mobile social games networks \u2013 have had mixed results with their global expansion ambitions. Kakao's most obvious competitor is another Japanese firm with its roots in mobile messaging: Line. In March, Line said that games on its network had been downloaded more than 100m times. Kakao is currently a moneymaking juggernaut for its developers, though. In mobile analytics firm App Annie's most recent chart of global iOS and Android games, for May 2013, seven of the 10 top grossing Android games in the world were running on Kakao. Finally, the growth of Kakao and Line is posing questions for big mobile and social games publishers in the West, in terms of what their strategy is for launching on these networks. Zynga, Rovio, King, Supercell and others may all have an opportunity to adopt them as complementary platforms to Facebook, although it remains to be seen how well their games translate to South Korea and Japan."
