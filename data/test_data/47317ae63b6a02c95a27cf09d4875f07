  "content": "Each nugget of data about the health of the American housing market or the mood of its consumers will be eagerly seized upon and carefully spun by Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in the coming weeks, as they fight to prove they should be trusted to run the world's largest economy. The US has shrugged off the after-effects of the sub-prime downturn more effectively than the eurozone, and is certainly in ruder health than the stagnating UK, expanding at an annual rate of 1.7% according to the latest numbers. Yet the background music for what promises to be a closely fought presidential campaign is of a country less certain than for many years of its place in the world \u2013 hamstrung by public and private debt; anxious about the disappearance of traditional jobs to low-cost markets overseas; worn down by a prolonged period in which living standards for middle America have moved sideways. If the latest analysis by the US economist Robert Gordon is correct, America's voters have every reason to be concerned \u2013 not just about whether the economy can weather the slowdown in China and Europe over the next 12 months, but about its growth prospects for decades to come. At the centre of his argument in a provocative new paper, \"Is US Economic Growth Over?\", is the insight that the latest wave of hi-tech innovation sweeping out from the US west coast may be less of a boon than its cheerleaders hope. As Silicon Valley twentysomethings waltz off with mega-billions, it's tempting to conclude that the internet has wrought the most radical transformation of the economy in modern history; and as Apple's big-bucks patent case against Samsung made clear, the corporate profits to be made and lost in what used to be called the \"new economy\" are immense. But Gordon warns that the growth dividend from the latest wave of innovations has actually been far smaller than that from what he calls the second industrial revolution, in the 19th century. In fact, he believes that the seemingly relentless expansion of the American economy could be about to run into the sand. Industrial revolution one, from about 1750 to 1830, brought steam and railways, Gordon argues; number two, from 1870 to 1900, gave us flushing toilets, electric light, the internal combustion engine and the telegraph, among a host of other benefits; and number three, from the 1970s onwards, computers. Gordon does not deny that there have been productivity gains from computers \u2013 serried ranks of secretaries in typing pools and filing cabinets full of punch-cards have been rendered obsolete; we can organise our lives with a barrage of text messages in the time it once took to pen a single note. And he acknowledges that productivity growth did improve, to 2.5% a year between 1996 and 2004, from 1.4% in the previous 15 years, as the benefits spread through companies and homes \u2013 but he argues that many of these were one-off changes, which cannot now be repeated. Instead of speeding up production lines and freeing workers for less menial tasks than typing or filing, he argues, today's major inventions are focused instead on ever more elaborate consumer gadgets. \"Attention in the past decade has focused not on labour-saving innovation, but rather on a succession of entertainment and communication devices that do the same things as we could do before, but now in smaller and more convenient packages.\" He asks his readers to carry out a thought experiment: would they rather keep 2002 electronic technology, but lose anything invented in the past decade; or keep the full package of post-2002 innovations, including Twitter, their MP3 player and their iPad \u2013 but give up running water and indoor toilets, just two of the key inventions that transformed the world in the late 19th century. In case you're wavering, he makes it clear that: \"You have to haul the water into your dwelling and carry out the waste. Even at 3am on a rainy night, your only toilet option is a wet and perhaps muddy walk to the outhouse.\" Surely, he insists, even the most hardened Twitter addict would choose a flushing loo over their smartphone. Not only has much of the gain from gadgetry already been banked, Gordon claims, but even if the productivity improvements that took place from 1987 to 2007 were maintained, the US economy will be hampered in the coming decades by powerful headwinds. These include the heavy weight of consumer debt accumulated in the runup to 2007, and the reversal of the demographic dividend that came as the postwar baby-boomer generation grew up, joined the workforce, and paid their taxes. Gordon estimates that once all these challenges are taken into account, GDP growth per capita could slow to just 0.2% a year. That's still economic progress, of a sort \u2013 but it does mean, as Gordon argues, that the 21st century, unlike the 20th, will not be an \"American century\"; and today's young Americans must confront a very different future to that of their parents. They will have to think harder about rationing scarce resources, and perhaps take a humbler stance in relation to their foreign rivals \u2013 something we Brits have become increasingly used to since our own dominance of the global economy gave way to US hegemony. Gordon cheekily points out that per capita growth of 0.2% a year is the same rate economists believe Britain achieved on average in the 600 years or so before the first industrial revolution, which are better remembered for feudalism, illiteracy and back-breaking toil than the onward march of economic progress. But as the star-spangled banner flutters behind a thousand presidential stump speeches between now and November, don't expect to hear too much about that."
