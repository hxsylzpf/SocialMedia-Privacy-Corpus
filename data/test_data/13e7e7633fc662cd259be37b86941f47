  "content": "Essena O'Neill has addressed the global conversation she started about the artifice of social media after her dramatic departure from Instagram \u2013 and flagged an interest in writing science fiction. The 19-year-old Australian made headlines when she recaptioned nearly 100 photos to expose their \"contrived perfection\" to her more than 612,000 followers, who she called to join her in a return to the \"3D world\". The rebrand coincided with the launch of her new website, Let's Be Game Changers, intended to \"inspire constant QUESTIONING\" and \"creative imagery with purpose\". \"I remember I obsessively checked the like count for a full week since uploading it,\" she wrote of her first-ever selfie, which had close to 2,500 likes when she recaptioned it in late October. \"It got five likes. This was when I was so hungry for social media validation ... Now marks the day I quit all social media and focus on real life projects.\" She later deleted her Instagram account, although impersonators abound on the platform. Let's Be Game Changers also appears to now be defunct, redirecting since December to a holding page that states O'Neill is writing her first book, How To Be Social Media Famous. In a lengthy email newsletter sent on Monday, the first to address the media storm she created, O'Neill reiterated what led her to apparently quit social media. \"I was getting more and more followers, thinner and thinner, better and more visually appealing pictures ... Online it looked like I had the perfect life ... yet I was so completely lonely and miserable inside. \"I was lost, with serious problems so beautifully hidden ... If anything my social media addiction, perfectionist personality and low self esteem made my career. Over-sexualisation, perfect food photos, perfect travel vlogs \u2013 it is textbook how I got famous. Sex sells, people listen to pretty blondes, I just happened to talk about veganism a trending thing on YouTube.\" O'Neill said that when she quit social media she had a \"$50,000 YouTube deal\" in the works and \"five or six\" photo shoots to do in Sydney, after having already paid for trips to Thailand and Los Angeles from sponsored posts and payments from YouTube. The first vlog she filmed after recaptioning her Instagram photos, again on the artifice of social media and deception of paid posts, was \"the most unfiltered I could ever have spoken\", she wrote. \"I was scared. I was throwing away such a big part of my life.\" But she said the response was positive, if \"insane\" in its scope: \"I couldn't believe so many resonated with the message ... so many YouTubers and Instagrammers saying this shit happens all too often and we should be aware ... Basically every single news channel and talk show imaginable was emailing, calling my friends, ex's, school, local library even.\" O'Neill writes of struggling with being \"the trend to talk about, make fun of and put in headlines\". An appearance on a \"major talk show in Australia\" \u2013 likely Channel Nine's Today program, one of the few interviews she gave last year \u2013 made her feel \"humiliated ... as if me crying was a catchy headline for them\". They didn't want to talk about the deeper stuff \u2013 deceptive paid posts, doing things just for social approval, or even just growing up a teen idle [sic] and realising ... maybe fame, a cute bikini selfie and a modelling contract doesn't equal happiness? That's all my message was. During the next 24 hours I was just shocked and honestly just confused \u2026 the way it all turned so negative just numbed me \u2026 As if I was making it all up? For what? Money? Fame? I had that before so that makes sense? That I was a genius manipulator and knew this would make world news? I was a hypocrite because I used social media to explain my story to the half a million people that once idolised me? That I was a fraud, a hoax, a brilliant actor just because I was smiling in the pictures and said those smiles weren't real? O'Neill did not regret posting the vlog that went viral, but said \"having it backfire like it did\", with strangers and friends alike debating her motivations, made her feel like \"dying\". \"I never in a million years thought these people would turn around and publicly 'hate' me ... As if being perfect, smiling and happy online was OK, even if you're hiding real pain and torment inside \u2013 the world loves that girl, celebrates and adores her. But the second you say something out of line, you're a hoax.\" She took down Let's Be Game Changers in December because being online \"felt toxic\". She says she donated the funds she raised from supporters to the \"Animal [Rights] Foundation of Florida\", the Megan Meier Foundation to raise awareness of cyberbullying, and the Fred Hollows Foundation for blindness prevention in Asia, Africa and the Pacific. O'Neill intends to balance \"a job at a local bar\" with writing full-time. She wrote that she is working on a \"satire/memoir\", presumably How To Be Famous On Social Media referred to on her website, but has aspirations towards fiction: \"Sci-fi novels have been my dream since I was 12.\" She concluded the lengthy email with an apology to \"anyone who personally felt hurt\" by her actions; a vow to \"enjoy [her] life\"; and a request: \"Please if I could say one last thing don't idolise me. Don't idolise anyone, especially personalities you view online.\""
