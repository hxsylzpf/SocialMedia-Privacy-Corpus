She said: \"In every area, women have steadily made progress\u2014except at the top. Where are we? Are we stalled?\" She also noted that, in 1962, the then-editor of the New York Times said: \"No woman will ever be editor of the New York Times.\" Enter Jill Abramson, executive editor of the Times and the first woman to hold that position, with a modest response: \"In our newsroom, nearly 40% of senior editors and managers are women, and then, of course, there's me.\" Source: Daily Beast Hat tip: Poynter"
