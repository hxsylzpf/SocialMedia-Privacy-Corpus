  "content": "It has been exactly three weeks since Spotify launched in the US, and the jury is still out on whether it will be a success or not. Initial signs are looking good, however - if social media is anything to go by. Brandwatch, which monitors trends and sentiment on networks, has picked up an overwhelmingly positive response so far. During the first week, 37% of mentions were positive and 4% negative, with the remainder neutral. Photo by Jay Kogami on Flickr. Some rights reserved Spotify fairly majorly tweaked its terms of use before the US launch and restricted free accounts somewhat - changes widely thought to be in response to record label demands. But its priority is to attract enough paying users that it can convincingly compete in the more competitive US market where Pandora, Rdio and Rhapsody are already established. Those essential paid subscriptions account for 16% of overall Spotify accounts, though there were also reports that 70,000 paid users had signed up during the first week of operation in the US, according to a Billboard report. Spotify wouldn't confirm the number at the time but said the response had exceeded expectation. Brandwatch assessed mentions of 'pay for Spotify' this and estimated that 47% of sentiment was positive, down from 60% in the first week after launch. Users are more positive about Spotify than its rivals in their online discussions, though more vocal about their opinions generally: \u2022 Spotify: 39% positive, 4% negative \u2022 Pandora: 26% positive, 1% negative \u2022 Rhapsody: 21% positive, 1% negative \u2022 Rdio: 29% positive, 3% negative"
