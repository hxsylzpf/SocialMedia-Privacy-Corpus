  "content": "Aaron Swartz, the 24-year-old co-founder of the website Reddit, has been indicted on charges of stealing more than 4m documents from JSTOR, a paid-for archive of scientific journals and papers, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The charges were filed in Boston on Tuesday by an attorney for the district of Massachusetts, and carry a penalty of up to 35 years in prison and a $1m fine. The prosecution alleges that Swartz broke into restricted areas of MIT starting on 24 September 2010 and continuing on and off until 6 January 2011, and downloaded \"a major portion\" of JSTOR's archive. It claimed that his purpose was to distribute the archive through one or more file-sharing sites. The person who broke into MIT's systems was spotted by the MIT system administrators, but repeatedly evaded them. At one point the laptop used to access the network accessed more than 2m downloads \u2013 more than 100 times the normal load from a typical user. The allegation is that Swartz stole 4.8m documents, of which 1.7m were normally paid-for. \"Stealing is stealing whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars,\" said Carmen Ortiz, the attorney filing the indictment, in a press release. Swartz, who is also a political activist, is well known online, and the news of his indictment - a preliminary step towards a trial - shocked colleagues and friends. Swartz has been indicted on four counts, of wire fraud, computer fraud, criminal forfeiture and obtaining information from a protected computer. The indictment has been copied to the MIT \"bitbucket\" storage site."
