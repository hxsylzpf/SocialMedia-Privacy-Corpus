  "content": "Last Saturday night was frantically busy here at the Observer. Just after 9pm, George Entwistle resigned as BBC director general, engulfed by the dual Newsnight scandals that had filled the headlines for days. Two editions had already gone to press but the first five news pages were cleared to make way for news and analysis and the Comment and Media pages rearranged and updated \u2013 a big effort in the best traditions of the newspaper trade. So you might imagine that the story would top the popularity league on our website. Far from it. \"Republican right weeps over Obama's victory\" attracted more than 213,000 page views, more than double George Entwistle's 101,000 and offering a valuable lesson to our newsroom in handling material online. The Republican piece was launched about midday on Saturday \u2013 hours before the paper went to press but, crucially, available to a vast US audience just waking up for a new day. Of course, the Entwistle story was instant news and was never going to interest a global audience in the way a US election might, but how many other pieces would have attracted more readers if they had been prepared differently for the web? Helping us answer this and many other online questions is Theresa Malone, an executive producer with theguardian.com, now stationed in our newsroom \u2013 \"a great and enthusiastic addition to the Observer\", as the editor told staff last week. Observer material is currently attracting more than 3.5 million page views a week. It sounds impressive but there are still more things we can do to enhance our online content, including greater use of video and graphics and by carefully considering when it is best to launch a story. The web is a perfect tool for breaking news and suits the ceaseless round of daily journalism but a subtler approach is required for a weekly paper. The Observer has been attempting to perfect the art of Sunday journalism for 220 years but today we have to rethink our tactics to match an age where, for instance, growing numbers are reading their news on their mobile phones. And while a print newspaper usually has only a few hours of life before the recycling bin beckons, a story online can carry on picking up momentum days and weeks after it is first published. For instance, a piece headlined \"Do online courses spell the end for the traditional university?\" steadily moved up the league table each day last week until it overtook George Entwistle into second place. Social media are key here; when I last looked it had been shared 2,901 times on Facebook and retweeted 1,102 times \u2013 and those figures are rising all the time. Theresa is keen to show the staff how they can better harness the vast reach of social media, both to promote their stories and to involve the audience in the preparation of future articles. She will be reminding writers that their pieces are the start, not the end, of a conversation and (as I was writing here last month) will be encouraging them to get involved in the comment threads that appear under their pieces \u2013 not always a popular notion with those who have been scarred by the experience in the past. Why all this effort? Well, it's fundamentally no different to selling as many papers as possible. The more people you can reach and the better a news organisation can target those people, the more attractive its website becomes to an advertiser. The greater the volume of advertising, the greater the chances of sustaining quality journalism. Most of our readers online find Observer material through Google and, excluding the 236,000 who hide their searches through their privacy settings, what people look for gives us a glimpse of their current preoccupations. Hard-bitten hacks probably hope that web users are searching for the latest news but an Observer table of search keywords compiled over the past seven days puts \"Skyfall review\" at the top, followed by \"Nigel Slater\", \"Manchester United\" and \"Leeds United\". \"George Entwistle\" comes way down the league at No 28, below \"green tomato chutney\" at No 8, \"coq au vin\" at No 20 and \"pea and ham soup\" at No 25. Clearly, readers are hungry \u2013 but not always for news. reader@observer.co.uk"
