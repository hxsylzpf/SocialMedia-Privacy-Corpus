  "content": "The charity Samaritans has suspended a new Twitter app which enables users to monitor the accounts of their friends for distressing messages, following a backlash from privacy campaigners. The Radar app, which launched just over a week ago, sends an alert to users when people they follow post messages that suggest depressed or suicidal thoughts. But critics, including the founder of a petition against the app which won more than 1,200 signatures, argued the tool breaches user's privacy by collecting, processing and sharing sensitive information about their emotional and mental health. In a statement, Samaritans said: \"Following the broad range of feedback and advice Samaritans has received since the launch of the Samaritans Radar app on 29 October, including the serious concerns raised by some people with mental health conditions using Twitter, we have made the decision to suspend the application at this time for further consideration.\" \"Our primary concern is for anyone who may be struggling to cope, including those with mental health conditions. We are very aware that the range of information and opinion which is circulating about Samaritans Radar has created concern and worry for some people and would like to apologise to anyone who has inadvertently been caused any distress. This was not our intention.\" The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the official independent data watchdog, confirmed earlier this week it was looking into complaints that the app may have privacy implications. The ICO said that while it had been produced with the best of intentions, they were aware of concerns and were speaking to the Samaritans to establish how the app works. Campaigner Adrian Short, who led a petition on Change.org to shut down the app, previously said: \"The Samaritans has no legitimate purpose to collect this information, let alone to share it with other unknown and untrusted people without the subject's knowledge or consent. \"While this could be used legitimately by a friend to offer help, it also gives stalkers and bullies an opportunity to increase their levels of abuse at a time when their targets are especially down.\" At the time of its launch Joe Ferns, executive director of policy, research and development at Samaritans, said the new tool would encourage people to look out for one another and help people in distress because friends could step in first. The app received the support of Patricia Cartes, Twitter's global head of trust and safety outreach, who said 18 to 35-year-olds were the key audience for the new online tool."
