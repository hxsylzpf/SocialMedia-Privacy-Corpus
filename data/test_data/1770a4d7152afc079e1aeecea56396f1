  "content": "\"Our mission is to change the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators,\" says the publisher Tim O'Reilly with typical northern California enthusiasm. \"I always put my faith in the hackers,\" he smiles. O'Reilly Media is synonymous with high-quality technical reference. It's not as dry as it sounds: it releases an impressive number of books and manuals a year, ranging from tech to travel, and the 54-year old so-called meme-peddler from Sebastopol, CA, has become the guru of technologists around the world. His successful balance of content and spin - and his ability to spot the communities that have crossover potential - means that he has become both spiritual father to alpha geeks worldwide and translator to the masses. Most people associate him with devising the \"iterate and iterate often\" manifesto of the web 2.0 philosophy, but that notch is just one of the web revolutions on his bedpost. Vibrant hackers Last week, his enthusiasm drew a vibrant community of hackers from across Europe to the first non-US O'Reilly Web 2.0 Expo in Berlin. The cosmopolitan capital's bullish optimism, reflected in the glass buildings of the new skyscrapers at Potsdamer Platz and the influx of creatives seeking cool and chic at affordable prices, is attractive to a community that itself was in the doldrums less than a decade ago. \"Our corporate mission for 2003 was to reignite enthusiasm in the computer industry,\" O'Reilly offers. \"Everyone was in the dumps after the dotcom bust, and we wanted to tell a story that made people see how much was actually still going on.\" The aim was to market the web rather than the books, and so its first release, The Whole Internet User's Guide and Manual, came with a free copy of the internet. \"We started the Global Network Navigator, the first commercial website, as a way of promoting the net.\" A few years later, he worked with another community to establish the open-source movement, again to promote his products. O'Reilly's latest contribution to the lexicon of the internet has captured the imaginations of creative, corporate and governmental industries. \"Web 2.0\" is a buzzword for the new medium, a constantly updating feedback system evolving at the speed of light. It's become the must-do-or-die killer app that's inspired a social media gold rush that many in the traditional corporate world admit they don't have a grip on. The biggest stumbling block, and that which O'Reilly is trying to overcome on his latest speaking tour, is that both the consumer and the company must sacrifice their control in order to succeed with web 2.0. For enterprise, this means accepting negative PR rather than controlling the brand image. For the customer, this means losing control of more and more personal data in order to get the most out of a service. O'Reilly is keen to point out the positives to both parties. He uses the example of Wasabi, which uses credit card data to identify consumer trends for social recommendations: \"Every swipe of a credit card is a vote. If you go to a restaurant once and never come back, it doesn't really tell you anything. But if your credit card data says that you go back two, three or four times, that tells you something about that restaurant that's way more powerful than you might get with an explicit review.\" Got your number While enthusiastic, his spin doesn't address the potential privacy infringements that leave many consumer rights activists concerned. He parries that blow: \"With web 2.0, how the application is using your personal data is front and centre in the interface versus something that's hidden behind the closed doors of your bank, where they figure out whether or not they'll give you a loan based on the results of the obscure algorithms that only they know,\" he argues. \"Because it's consumer-focused, the customer can see what's going on, can control it, can respond to it and can opt out.\" This assumes that the customer recognises that the data is being extracted and used, and is able realistically to assess its long-term value in light of the immediate benefits that are on offer. As others have noted, this isn't always the case, particularly when using opt-out paradigms. But O'Reilly is optimistic that attitudes towards data ownership will change. To him, evidence points to what consumers will do in future: \"When the Facebook feed was first launched, there was a lot of backlash about that from a privacy point of view. But that kind of lifestreaming now is a whole industry. People adjusted.\" He doesn't offer any more on how people adjust, or what implications there may be. He's focused on the bright lights of a technological future, and he will be guiding the way. \"Peddling a meme is really about helping people to see what's possible,\" he says. And for O'Reilly, to do it successfully means adding value where he sees something that really matters. He'll think about the cost later."
