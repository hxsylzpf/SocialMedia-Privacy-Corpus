  "content": "Last Saturday, the Guardian reported on Google's scary plans to psychologically profile online gamers and then hawk the information to advertisers. The search engine behemoth has filed patents for a technology that analyses the tactics we use in games like World of Warcraft and Quake, so that in-game ads can be individually doctored to the player. For example, if you're the sort of gamer who explores every inch of the environment, you might see ads for trekking holidays on in-game billboards. Alternatively, if you just shoot people, you could be offered psychological counselling. We shouldn't be shocked about this - corporations are desperate to know what we're thinking, and we're often more than happy to tell them. Ever used a reward card or signed up for an email newsletter? Congratulations, you've shared your personal life with a corporate spy monkey. In-game advertising is already a multi-million dollar business ; some expect it to be worth around $2bn (\u00a31bn) by 2010. If you've played Battlefield 2042, Anarchy Online or Splinter Cell Chaos Theory you will have been bombarded, not only by enemy fire, but also by ads for flashy trainers and the latest Akon album. The problem is, shoving billboards in a virtual space is a pretty clumsy solution - too obvious and gamers feel violated; too subtle and they don't notice. Google's patent is one answer, ensuring that the product is at least of interest to the individual gamer. But really, the sensible way forward for advertisers is to engage in the interactivity of gaming. This can be achieved explicitly, through dedicated \"advergames\" like last year's hugely successful Burger King titles. But up to the experience; in effect, you're preaching to the converted. How long before advertisers exploit the rudimentary social elements of online games? The adbots that spam blog comments sections could easily be modified and let loose in online game worlds, using advanced AI and voice synthesis to chat with real gamers. You could be talking to someone for hours before it suddenly dawns on you that they're channelling all your conversations toward herbal Viagra. After that, the developers of camera games like the dance title EyeToy Groove will work out a legal way to sell your upstreamed webcam footage to advertisers. Imagine it, you're dancing about in your living room when the level comes to a close and a grating robotic voice announces that your wallpaper has been unfashionable for 10 years and your jeans don't go with your head shape. If you think psychological profiling is invasive, just wait 'til they come for your living room.",
