  "content": "The London-listed company controlled by Russia's richest man, Alisher Usmanov, has taken advantage of the recent rise in Facebook's share price to sell its remaining stake in the social network. Mail.ru said on Thursday it had sold 14.2m Facebook shares for $528m (\u00a3338m). The firm first bought into Mark Zuckerberg's digital venture in 2009, spending $200m for a small stake when Facebook was valued at just $10bn. Facebook today has a stock market value of $102bn. The shares were sold in July and August after Facebook's stock had finally returned to its initial public offering (IPO) price. The gain brings to an estimated $1.7bn the revenues Mail.ru has netted from its holding. Facebook's stock has surged 57% this year and is now trading comfortably above its debut price of $38. Investors cold-shouldered Facebook after a rocky stock market listing in May 2012, but a strong performance on mobile phones and healthy advertising has lured them back. Mail.ru sold 20m shares at the time of the IPO, netting $745m, and divested a further 23m shares in October; the price was not disclosed but Facebook's shares then traded at around $20, which means Mail.ru could have netted around $460m. Its final holding was sold this summer after the relevant lock-up period, which dictates when portions of the stock can be sold by early investors in the company, expired in May. Usmanov has benefited many times over from Facebook's success. He also invested through the Russian tech investment fund Digital Sky Technologies, which sold a $1.7bn stake during the IPO last May. That disposal earned Usmanov about $1.4bn, according to Bloomberg. A spokesperson for Usmanov said his USM Holdings still holds its remaining stake in Facebook - but has not disclosed its size and value. With a \u00a348m mansion in north London, Usmanov was recently identified in the Sunday Times Rich List as Britain's richest man. He is now using some of those funds to bet on an Apple recovery: in April, following a crash in Apple's share price, he said he had invested $100m in the iPhone maker. \"I believe in the future of this company even after Steve Jobs,\" Usmanov told Bloomberg. \"When the company lost $100bn of its market value, it was a good time to buy its shares, as the capitalisation should rebound.\" \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 6 September 2013 to make clear that Mail.ru has sold its last shares, rather than Alisher Usmanov."
