  "content": "Despite what you might have heard, folk legend Gordon Lightfoot did not die yesterday. False reports of the 71-year-old singer's demise tweeted their way across the internet, fooling journalists and even Lightfoot's friends. Lightfoot is known around the world for songs such as If You Could Read My Mind and The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, both of which charted in the UK. But he is best known in his native Canada, and the country's national Canwest News Service was the first major outlet to pick up the \"story\" of his death. The network ran articles on the websites of the Ottawa Citizen, Vancouver Sun and Calgary Herald, all of which have since been retracted. As with similar hoaxes regarding Miley Cyrus and Jeff Goldblum, most of the buzz started on Twitter; 140-character obituaries don't have room for evidence or sources \u2013 and so even before the Canwest articles, the rumours had become \"news\". Eventually somebody finally got in touch with Lightfoot. \"I'm fine, everything is good. I'm in great health,\" he told CP24 News. \"I was quite surprised to hear [the news] myself ... I haven't had so much airplay on my music now for weeks.\" This will have come as a relief to Ronnie Hawkins, the musician whose backing band became the Band. A friend of Lightfoot's, he was quoted in the early Canwest story, confirming the news. Hawkins said he had received a call from his management in Minneapolis, who had in turn received a call from Lightfoot's grandson, telling them the singer had died. \"I don't know Gordon's grandson,\" Hawkins later told the Globe and Mail. \"I didn't even know if Gordon has a grandson. I called my wife in Florida and told her, and I guess she faxed some of her friends and now, all of a sudden, it's all over the world. It's terrible. I can't even get hold of Gordon. Holy smoke, it's unbelievable.\" According to a spokesperson for Lightfoot, the death report was \"a prank\" that began as \"a Twitter coming out of Ottawa\". The first reference to Lightfoot's death on Twitter seems to have been by Rebecca Fleming, username fleminski, whose account has now been removed. Hawkins suggested they trace the phonecall to Minneapolis. \"I think they can trace that phone call, maybe, and see who did that,\" he said. \"I'm glad it is a sick joke, but it's bad.\"",
