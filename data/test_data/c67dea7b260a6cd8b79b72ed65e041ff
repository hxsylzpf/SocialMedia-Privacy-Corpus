  "content": "Brian Blessed was a recurrent theme; so was Leonard Cohen. Space featured heavily as a location; the rise in 3D was well represented. The dizzying breadth of ambition of some of the films you dreamed up is truly startling. One of our judges, Frank Cottrell Boyce, said: \"I was expecting this to be mostly amusing casting and direction ideas (\"Schwarzenegger is Bach\") but was amazed and overexcited to find some ideas on this list that I really would like to see filmed.\" Indeed, should @jahaniman's Quiet! (\"An American aid worker and an Irish boxer enter a monastery but find it difficult to keep the vow of silence. Dir Lewis Milestone\") ever attract the eye of a Hollywood mogul, Cottrell Boyce has let it be known he'd be up for taking on writing duties. In the end it was a very close call between the top three choices. But the pitch that proved victorious, and will have a poster published in the Guide on Saturday 9 October is ... @johnbodkinadams's To the Manor Bourne: Jason Bourne retires to the countryside. With violent consequences. Congratulations to him, and many thanks to those who took part. Here's the full top 10. 1) @johnbodkinadams \u2013 \"To the Manor Bourne: Jason Bourne retires to the countryside. With violent consequences\" Our winner might be a pitch based on a pun but it still won over our judges, all but one of whom had this on their shortlist. \"Genius title, great pitch,\" reckoned Frank Cottrell Boyce. Jonathan Meades was so keen on the creative marriage of Paul Greengrass and Julian Fellowes he even extrapolated the plot: \"There's a memorable scene in which Damon is laughed at for using the wrong knife and fork and exacts a terrible retribution by flicking a lethal pat of organically sourced butter at Timothy Spall's sinister majordomo.\" 2) @mrWormold \u2013 \"Jean-Pierre Melville directs Borges's Death and the Compass. L\u00f6nnrot: Alain Delon. Scharlach: Klaus Kinski. Screenplay: Alain Robbe-Grillet\" A big hit with Richard Eyre, this won the top spot on Meades's shortlist: \"MrWormold has read my mind. Had the director and screenwriter been alive and the two leads 40 years younger this would have been a goer, even though Borges disliked L'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re \u00e0 Marienbad. Look out for Lino Ventura as the taxi driver and Timothy Spall as the widow.\" However, Cottrell Boyce felt that @mrWormold should check out the Alex Cox/Christopher Eccleston version of the film from 1992. 3) @bloatboy \u2013 \"Chas and Dave: The Movie. Nick Nolte as Chas, Paul Giamatti as Dave. Soundtrack by Jimi Hendrix. Directed by Alan Smithee\" Another strong contender. But why would @bloatboy's director require anonymity, Meades wondered: \"Who would not want to be acknowledged as the creator of this moving tribute to the Greg Wallace and John Torode of their day?\" 4) @Copthat \u2013 \"Bollywood remake of Watership Down \u2013 rabbits played by England footballers, score by Leonard Cohen, filmed on old Brookside set\" Inside the Guardian offices, at least, this was a big hit: both of our two internal judges featured it in their top three. Xan Brooks was \"intrigued by the wonderfully bizarre idea of a Bollywood Watership Down, with songs by Leonard Cohen. What a juxtaposition: it puts the mix in myxomatosis.\" This pitch topped the list of Malik Meer, who said: \"I liked it because it was pretty daft and surreal and it combined three of my favourite things: Bollywood, Leonard Cohen and Brookside ... what's not to like?\" 5) @MrWormold \u2013 \"Carry on Mein Kampfing. With the usual cast, screenwriter and director\" Richard Eyre's second choice was one of only three pitches he felt offered genuine allure (his top choice was @walnut's \"Orson Welles directs a Rod Serling adaptation of The Great Gatsby, score by Bernard Hermann\".) 6) @digit \u2013 \"Real-time film about a 24-hour Leonard Cohen vow of silence taken on Buddhist retreat. Starring Dustin Hoffman\" The masterstroke here, felt Jonathan Meades, \"is that the audience is not required to listen to droning Cohen's 'music'\". 7) @anonpoetry \u2013 \"There Will Be Time: Eliot's Prufrock directed by PT Anderson. Starring Robin Williams as Prufrock &amp; Daniel Day-Lewis as 'the sea'\" Cottrell Boyce: \"Day-Lewis as the sea! Can't wait.\" Nuff said. 8) @SonofTrev \u2013 \"All Played Out redux. England beat Argentina in 1990 World Cup final, with Herv\u00e9 Villechaize as a sobbing Maradona. Judi Dench narrates\" Another film so popular with Jonathan Meades he added details: \"Christopher Biggins's Gazza and Timothy Spall's Gary Lineker are overshadowed by Doon Mackichan's Stuart 'Psycho' Pearce. The moment when Psycho eats Chris Waddle's mullet after a botched throw-in is worthy of Wes Craven.\" 9) @seventh \u2013 \"Kramer vs Kramer vs Mothra. Hoffman and Streep team up to battle giant yet incredibly camp lepidopteran\" Says Frank Cottrell Boyce: \"I desperately want to see this. I think Hoffman should play Mr Kramer and the moth.\" Xan Brooks agreed: \"Puts the agonies of divorce into perspective and does so in a way that's tender, touching and true. One minute the Kramers are wrangling over custody rights; the next they're being dive-bombed by a giant, flesh-eating lepidopteran and there's not a family lawyer in the world who can save them.\" 10) @R042 \u2013 \"The Aeneid as a huge-budget movie trilogy. Featuring Brian Blessed, Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Patrick Stewart as various gods and music by Rick Wakeman\" Meades felt a role needed to be made for Norman Wisdom; this pitch also won the honour of being declared Richard Eyre's \"most nightmarishly unwatchable film\".",
