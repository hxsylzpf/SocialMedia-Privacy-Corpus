  "content": "Hunter Moore, the operator of revenge pornography website IsAnyoneUp.com, has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison, his defense lawyer, Robert Holley, has said. Moore founded IsAnyoneUp.com, a site where sexually explicit photos were posted without the subjects' consent, sometimes by former partners. Those photographed were often identified by name, contact information, and links to profiles on social networks. Images were also obtained by Charles Evens, who Moore paid to hack into Google email accounts, according to the US Department of Justice. Evens was sentenced to 25 months in prison and a $2,000 fine last month. The website was shut down in April 2012. In February, Moore pleaded guilty to one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information for the purposes of private financial gain, and one count of aggravated identity theft. Following his plea, Moore faced a minimum sentence of two years and a maximum sentence of seven in federal prison, according to the US Department of Justice. \"He hid behind his online persona and engaged in aberrant behavior,\" US district judge Dolly Gee said, according to the City News Service. \"Now you must face the consequences of your own actions. Your poor judgment has caused much pain to your victims and your family.\" Moore, who was dubbed the most hated man on the internet by Rolling Stone in a November 2012 profile, will also undergo a mental health evaluation, follow up his time in prison with three years of supervised release and pay a $2,000 fine. \"He has changed,\" Holley, told the judge, according to the City News Service. \"He's completely different than he was. He'll never do anything like this again.\" Holley had filed a motion to seal both the defense and prosecutors' sentencing positions, in order to protect Moore's privacy.",
