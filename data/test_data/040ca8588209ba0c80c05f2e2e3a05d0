  "content": "\"Merkel stop watching us\" screamed a banner above a noisy group of protesters which forced Angela Merkel to raise her voice as she launched her election campaign. Barely concealing her irritation, the German chancellor struggled to drown out honking vuvuzelas, and chants of \"hypocrite\" and \"liar\", with promises of more of the same from a third term at the helm of Europe's biggest economy \u2013 jobs, stability and stronger growth. But Germans want reassurance on a different front. Whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations have plunged privacy-conscious Germany into convulsive outrage. Distrust of the government's handling of the surveillance scandal is as high as ever \u2013 and threatens to damage Merkel's re-election bid. Despite dominating opinion polls, she knows voter anger may yet bring nasty surprises in September's poll which she warned could be \"very, very close\". Her government is mounting an effort to take back control and put a lid on the scandal. \"All suspicions which have been raised have been dispelled,\" the German interior minister, Hans-Peter Friedrich, told the Rheinische Post, referring to a government assertion this week that it had been reassured that Britain and US agencies \"had observed German laws in Germany\". But critics remained sceptical, pointing out that observing German laws on German soil would not stop foreign agencies accessing German online communication data transferred to the US-based servers of Google, Facebook or Microsoft. \"We're just at the beginning of the debate,\" Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the Social Democrats (SPD) said on Friday. \"The assurances ... do not refer to data taken from American servers.\" If Merkel's ruling Christian Democrats (CDU) performs well at the 22 September poll and she completes a third term as chancellor, she would become Europe's longest serving female head of government, moving ahead of Margaret Thatcher. But two months after Snowden's revelations about National Security Agency surveillance programmes sent ripples around the world, it is in Germany where the biggest backlash has been felt. The experience of two German dictatorships in the last 100 years has engendered a society with a visceral distrust of snooping, and there are meticulous checks in the constitution against state surveillance. Yet Germans know their data is being spied on, having seen \"clear evidence that UK and US international communications carriers ... are obliged to provide their intelligence agencies access\", said Andy Mueller-Maguhn of the Chaos Computer Club, a German-based hacking group, and founder of the blog buggedplanet.info. Snowden's documents showing how the NSA indiscriminately collects data, said Mueller-Maguhn, gave \"a clear picture of a totalitarian structure and mindset\" within the US agency\u2013 something that is anathema in Germany given the country's past. Under the German constitution, the police and intelligence agencies must be kept separate, and citizens are guaranteed the right to secrecy of communication. What has outraged Germans, said Patrick Breyer, a lawyer responsible for mounting legal challenges against EU data retention laws, is the total disregard for these rules shown by foreign powers \u2013 and the helplessness of the state to uphold those rules in the internet age. \"We've fought for our privacy rights in Germany,\" said Breyer. \"But after partially winning on the streets and in the courts in Europe it turns out that foreign intelligence services have been doing things that are illegal and unconstitutional in Germany all along.\" What is worse, Merkel's critics say, is the apparent complicity of the German intelligence agency the BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst) \u2013 and by extension the German state \u2013 in this betrayal. It says it has done nothing illegal in passing on security-relevant data to the NSA from its operations abroad. But rumours persist that it has also been illegally passing on information on data collected indiscriminately in Germany. \"The BND is not entitled by law to collect all or a large number of meta-data [from Germany],\" said Meinhard Starostik, a constitutional lawyer. \"If ... the disclosure of [this] information to foreign intelligence agencies were proven, I would feel the BND would have illegally encroached the constitutional rights of a large number of citizens.\" This week Merkel's government hoped to divert attention from speculation over the extent and legality of the BND's co-operation with an announcement: the agency had accepted an offer from the NSA to begin negotiating a \"no-spying agreement\" to reinforce the principle that allied governments did not spy on one another. Critics countered that such an agreement had no hope of addressing the concerns of ordinary Germans or uphold national laws guaranteeing the secrecy of their online communications. \"It's not enough for allied governments to promise not to spy on each other's ministries and embassies,\" said SPD's Thomas Oppermann, the head of the parliamentary control commission responsible for overseeing Germany's three intelligence agencies, in a statement. \"The protection of citizens against spying must be clearly laid down in the agreement,\" he said, advising Germans to maintain a \"healthy mistrust\" of any anti-spying deal between intelligence agencies. Yet in matters of trust the opposition is still not fairing much better than the government. Despite the SPD's best efforts to cash-in on voter anger, many are wary of the party, which is accused of having overseen the creation of a intelligence-sharing agreement with the Americans while in power in 2002. \"The SPD and the Greens thought they'd struck gold with the NSA scandal and that it would help them in the election campaign,\" said Wolfgang Bosbach of the CDU. \"But people aren't falling for it.\" Even Merkel's junior coalition partner and civil liberties champion the Free Democrats (FDP) have been strangely subdued during the scandal, merely supporting calls to strengthen parliamentary oversight of the intelligence agencies. \"People are disappointed that there are no concrete suggestions from any of the main parties of how to uphold civil liberties or enforce our data protection laws,\" said Bernd Schl\u00f6mer, head of the German Pirate party \u2013 which despite the spying scandal could still struggle to clear the 5% of the vote needed to enter parliament in September. And with few solutions being offered bar the government's vague promise of an international agreement with Germany's allies, Merkel is still widely expected to secure a comfortable win by distracting and wooing voters with promises of continued financial stability. \"There are lots of options to weigh up,\" said Breyer, \"It's unclear how far the NSA and the political situation surrounding [the scandal] will factor in voters' decisions.\"",
