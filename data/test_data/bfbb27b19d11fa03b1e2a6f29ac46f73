  "content": "Should parents have a legal right to protect their children from unwanted commercial exploitation? Hannah Weller presumed she had that right. Then she, her husband \u2013 the musician Paul Weller \u2013 and three of their children were photographed while shopping, against their wishes, and the photographs were sold to the Daily Mail, which published them on its website. Weller eventually won a court battle to ensure future protection for her children from that particular news organisation. But she is campaigning for a change in the law that will mean no child's privacy can be violated in this way. Weller is keen to emphasise that the privacy of children is not of concern only to celebrities. She cites Doreen Lawrence, who feared that the brother of her murdered son Stephen would be targeted by racists after his picture was published in the press. The point here is that anyone could one day find themselves and their families the object of unwanted media attention. The public is well known to be fairly unsympathetic to the tribulations of the rich and famous. The Daily Mail itself, in its long-running campaign against super-injunctions, exploited the idea that celebrities only want privacy when it suits them. Politicians, more than any other people in the public eye, all too often wheel out their children for photocalls when there's some advantage to their image in it. Plenty of other celebrities do that too. Parents sometimes exploit their own children. But that doesn't mean it's right to do so, or that parents shouldn't be able to protect their kids from the public gaze if they believe it's in their best interests. Guidelines for the press, under self-regulation, have always been a bit weird. Children cannot be photographed at school, unless they have the school's permission. But parents have never had that much power over their charges. It's always seemed odd to me, the idea that a child's education is too important to be interrupted by unwanted attention, but that a child's family life, outside the privacy of the four walls of their home, is not accorded similar respect. So, the press can publish shots of children as long as they don't \"involve the child's welfare\". That's astounding to me \u2013 the assumption that the press would know what's damaging to a child's welfare better than their parents would. How would the press know whether the child whose face they're shoving a camera into hasn't stepped out for the first time since she started having anxiety attacks? How would the press know whether the child whose face they're shoving a camera into isn't having all sorts of troubles coping with the fame of their family member already? God knows, parents don't always do what's right for their kids. But that the law should be on the side of professional gossip-mongers who don't care about the family they're pursuing, rather than the child's parents, is just creepy. When JK Rowling had a baby, a journalist put a letter in her older daughter's schoolbag requesting a photograph of the baby, which apparently the world was clamouring to see. Many journalists considered that Rowling was not behaving in a generous way by failing to provide views of her newborn. The argument is that people looking at a picture of a baby can't possibly do the baby any harm. But that's a deliberately narrow argument. Of course it's harmful to a family when the family is put under pressure to, from birth, be an aspect of one parent's professional life. Some parents may choose to treat their child as part of the family business \u2013 as Prince George is being treated now. Others may think it wiser to bring up their children to believe that they are not part of the family business, and must make their own way in life, when they are old enough to do so. Parents who choose that latter course shouldn't need a law to ensure that society respects that decision. (Especially when most people, I'm sure, believe it to be the more sensible way.) But, as ever, sections of the press damage their own freedom by insisting that it should come without responsibility. Hannah Weller's legal battle is indeed not about celebrities and their children. It's about respect for the right of all caring parents, even celebrity parents, to teach their children about the world in the way they believe will serve their children best."
