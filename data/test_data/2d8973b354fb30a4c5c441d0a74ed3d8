  "content": "Lawyers for the German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der will today face another court battle in an effort to suppress press reports about his private life. Mr Schr\u00f6der won a temporary injunction against the German regional newspaper the Maerkische Oderzeitung preventing it from repeating allegations made last month about the state of his marriage. But the regional newspaper is contesting the ban today in Berlin's state court. \"We won't accept the media's reporting being limited the way the chancellor wants,\" said the paper's lawyer, Johannes Weberling. Both Mr Schr\u00f6der and his wife have vehemently denied rumours of a marital spat. The German premier said that while the media have the right to report on politicians' private lives, they have \"no right to lie\", while his wife suggested there was a press \"campaign\" against her husband. The case comes just days after Mr Schr\u00f6der won an injunction against the Mail on Sunday, forbidding it to repeat claims about his private life. The newspaper blatantly defied the order and carried an editorial headlined \"Sorry, Herr Schr\u00f6der but you don't rule Britain... at least, not yet\". In it, the chancellor was described as a \"vain politician\" who \"cannot bear criticism\". A spokesman for the German court that issued the injunction admitted this week it was powerless to gag the Mail on Sunday, as its ruling was only valid in Germany. The Mail on Sunday's publisher, Associated Newspapers, had already taken the precaution of withdrawing the paper from sale in Germany on the two dates when it contained allegations concerning Mr Schr\u00f6der. \"We're pleased to note that the injunction from the German court only relates to publication in Germany, and our lawyers will be examining precisely what effect that will have and will take a decision in the future as to whether or not we'll publish in our foreign editions,\" said the paper's managing director, John Wellington. A spokeswoman for the Hamburg court has confirmed that the ruling only applies within Germany, so the Mail on Sunday is free to repeat its claims, as long as it is not distributed in Germany. If the newspaper breached the terms of the injunction it would face a fine of up to 250,000 euros (\u00a3164,000). The injunction is also being contested by S\u00fcdwestpresse, another German regional newspaper that shares a Berlin correspondent with the Maerkische Oderzeitung, and printed the same report. A court date has not yet been set for this case."
