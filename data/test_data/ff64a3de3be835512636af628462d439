  "content": "Now is a good time to be a social mobile games developer with a hit or two under your belt. Big companies cuh as Zynga and DeNA are snapping up talented indie studios as they position themselves to take advantage of the boom in revenues from freemium games on iOS and \u2013 soon \u2013 Android. Astro Ape remains independent, but it took investment from DeNA in September 2010 on the back of debut iOS hit Office Heroes, before launching another successful game \u2013 Dessert Heroes \u2013 in January 2011. Several million players later in early May 2011, the company's third title Monsterz Revenge was released. Chief executive Chieh Huang is bullish about the opportunity for mobile social games \u2013 an opportunity that he thinks is being missed by many competitors. \"No one's really trying to push the bar,\" he tells Apps Blog. \"There are so many companies content to make hits and make a lot of money, but not really push the industry forward. People are still putting the same old stuff out that we've seen for the last 18-24 months. It perplexes me a lot, and we're trying to change that.\" Huang claims there is a danger of mobile social games \u2013 and indeed social games more widely \u2013 getting stuck in a rut of games where you run your own farm, restaurant, shop and so on. Astro Ape's games don't completely buck that trend \u2013 Monsterz Revenge starts with the premise of a graveyard fast food franchise \u2013 but adds more elements with mini games and power-ups. \"We knew we had to go a completely different route,\" he says. \"It's a different kind of game, and one that isn't typical for social games these days. We're trying to punch above our weight, because if we go where everybody else is, we can't out-spend them, and that's the way you get apps up the charts. We're trying another way.\" When Office Heroes came out in July 2010, a promotion from Apple saw it attract half a million users within a few days, at a time when Astro Ape was still effectively \"two dudes in a garage \u2013 the quintessential startup story\". The New York company has since expanded to 20 people and moved out of the garage to an office in Manhattan. DeNA's investment has opened up new opportunities for Astro Ape, including developing a new game for the Japanese company's Mobage service, which is launching globally this year through a partnership with Samsung. Mobage is huge in Japan, generating revenues of $1.38bn for DeNA in 2010 alone. Last year, it acquired US mobile social games publisher ngmoco for $403m to help take the service global, but partnerships with developers such as Astro Ape are an important piece in that strategy too. \"I like working with them, because they have a good mix,\" says Huang. \"They recruit people who are considered as new thinkers in Japanese society, and they also have industry veterans. There are a lot of free thinkers in the company.\" Huang is not surprised that the big social gaming firms are buying or investing in indie mobile social studios, suggesting that there is a race against time for these companies to emerge as the clear leader in the space. \"If they're trying to grow their capabilities organically in mobile, within 24 months they can have an awesome team, but it will be too late. The big players know there's going to be a clear-cut winner probably within nine to 12 months. The only way to get critical mass is to snap up smaller developers.\" For now, Astro Ape is focusing on building its player community, and \u2013 like all its rivals \u2013 trying to cross-promote its games across that community, to save on marketing costs. The uncertainty around the so-called 'incentivised offers' model, where players are offered virtual currency in games if they install other games whose developers have paid for that promotion, makes that more urgent. Which brings us back to more original, innovative games, to pick up and keep a following. \"Mobile is a completely different beast to Facebook, and in terms of being social, there's so much more potential,\" says Huang. \"On a traditional PC, you don't have location-based technology, you can't access text messaging \u2026 they're not like a phone. The devices we're working with are inherently viral, but nobody has found that trick to leverage these features. That includes the companies with billions of dollars of revenue who haven't figured it out yet. Someone's going to unlock these channels one day though.\" For now, Astro Ape is focusing mainly on iOS, although the game it made for DeNA and Samsung was an Android title, so it already has a toe in the water there. Google's introduction of in-app payments make social games like Astro Ape's more potentially lucrative, but Huang remains measured in his views on Android. \"You can't ignore hundreds of thousands of new activations a day, but for now it's a different crowd,\" he says. \"From what I've seen, people with iOS devices generally spend more on apps than people with Android devices. On an aggregate level that will change because Android's global growth is so strong, but on a per-user level, it wouldn't shock me if they never outspend the iOS users.\""
