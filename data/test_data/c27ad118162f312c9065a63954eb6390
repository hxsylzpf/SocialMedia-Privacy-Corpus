  "content": "Few people have heard of the government organisation which has its headquarters on the eighth floor of a modern office block on the south bank of the Thames. For security reasons, access to the stairs between certain floors in the nondescript building requires a special security pass. Without a higher-level pass, these floors can be accessed only by lift, which makes it easier to monitor visitors. The offices are not an outpost of the security service MI5, which is based on the other side of the river. The occupants could not, ordinarily, be regarded as even distant relatives of Big Brother. The organisation has the friendly name of Pito (pronounced Pee-toe) the Police Information Technology Organisation. Its main job: to give UK police forces every possible technological tool with which to fight crime. It exists to help protect law-abiding people from criminals. It is not there to deluge law enforcement agencies with surveillance and other technologies so that government can oppress its citizens. So there is nothing remotely sinister about what it was set up to achieve. Or is there? Take these comments, uttered with the best of intentions by a senior executive at a technology company which supplies Pito: \"If only we could get the DNA of everyone in the UK on a database, the systems would be so much more effective. Then every time a check was run on someone, there would probably be a match.\" His view is shared by some senior Pito officials. Civil libertarians see the increasing number of centralised databases, surveillance systems and other intrusive technologies as proof of a Big Brother conspiracy by the state to spy on us. But there is no conspiracy. As Pito demonstrates, if Orwell's vision of Big Brother ever becomes reality, the driving force will have been the natural evolution of market forces. Major suppliers of advanced computer systems want to sell their products. Government wants ever more sophisticated surveillance technologies, mainly to fight terrorism and crime. The growth of the surveillance state is nothing but a classic example of the power of marketing. And the crucial relationship in this surveillance marketplace is not between ministers and the electorate. It is between suppliers and the senior Whitehall civil servants who put together new initiatives. Increasingly, elected politicians merely rubber stamp the process. Across Whitehall, senior officials want new technology to know what Mr Everyperson is up to. At the Home Office, Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise, and the Department of Work and Pensions, the hunt is on for innovative ways to prevent fraud, tax evasion or any other illegal activity. Some officials call it \"preventative spying\". These public interest policies dovetail perfectly with the work being carried out by teams of marketeers in the research departments of major computer companies. It is their job to identify problems in government to which their company's products will provide the solution. There may be no overarching plan to construct a Big Brother-style surveillance regime, but take a look at some of the individual schemes currently being discussed in Whitehall. At a private conference in London earlier this year, attended by delegates from a host of government agencies, a senior representative from a major technology company gave details of a multi- purpose system that could be used to authenticate credit and debit card transactions and could, if government desires, also monitor the movements of particular individuals in towns or the countryside. The idea was that digital code in credit and debit cards would be used to authenticate the cardholder's identity. This code could be used to enable the holder to draw welfare benefits and pay bills. Or it could be \"read\" by satellite or equipment mounted on street lights or telephone poles and the details matched with those held on government databases. The movements of every individual known to the system could then be tracked. Some may feel that the system has Big Brother written all over it, but suppliers know its use could be justified in the name of fighting terrorism, illegal immigration or organised crime, especially as the use of the code on credit or debit cards would make its use almost universal without the government forcing people to carry one. At the same time, suppliers and Whitehall are currently developing a range of centralised databases which, if linked, could provide the storage capacity for vast amounts of information on everyone in the UK. Everyone who holds a photocard driving licence has their face and some personal details held on a digital database managed by a US computer company for the driver and vehicle licensing agency. More recently, the passport agency has given details of what it calls a passport card, on which will be embedded biometric information such as iris or fingerprint data. On the agency's behalf, the German supplier Siemens has begun recording digitally, on a networked database, the faces of passport applicants. As a further step, civil servants in the Home Office have proposed that biometric information is captured on a central system and that all passport applicants are compelled to attend a government office to have their biological profiles recorded. If this proposal is approved - and there is no reason to suppose it will not - then eventually, and without a hint of any Big Brother conspiracy, around 47 million people will possess cards that identify their unique biological features to the state. The biometric cards can contain digital pointers so that when they are presented to state employees, say at a hospital or tax office, and inserted into a digital decoder or chip-reading machine, information held on that person by any number of other networked government databases can be called up on a screen or printed out. Data protection legislation currently guards against the unfettered use of networked government databases, but there are exemptions which allow departments to combine data when fighting crime, fraud and terrorism. It is inevitable, therefore, that computer companies will want to ride the wave of public concern about crime. Understandably, and partly for public interest reasons, they will continue to exploit the commercial possibilities that spring from the innate interest of government to know us better as individuals. Or as suppliers put it, as customers. Pito, for example, has been working with BT and Motorola to provide a \u00a35bn system, Airwave, that will equip all police forces with a digital communication system that will help officers to instantly identify someone they stop in a car or on the street. On a country lane, for example, information given by an individual to the police can be checked against data held on government databases via a handheld computer linked to Airwave transmitters and receivers. Never mind that rank and file police officers have repeatedly expressed concerns about the possible health effects of the radiation from Airwave handsets; the Home Office has ordered new research but both it and Pito deny any health risk. But this is a liberal democracy, so why should we worry? After all, the fate of all these projects will be decided by ministers accountable to parliament and, ultimately, to the public. In reality, though, it is not the elected politicians who are making the crucial decisions, it is their officials. Indeed, there is growing evidence that what used to be merely the influence of civil servants is fashioning itself into control. At the same time, the ability of parliament to hold the executive - both elected and permanent - to account has diminished dramatically. This is partly because the machine of government is growing technologically more complex. Add to this complexity the unbelievably labyrinthine rules, legislation, amendments and interconnected conventions governing the operations of departments and it becomes clear that ministers who are in post for a relatively short time cannot hope to understand the day-to-day running of their departments without the full cooperation of their officials. A new minister at the Treasury, for example, could spend the life of an entire parliament reading the shelves of books that explain one tiny portion of the department's business. In short, complexity has become a friend of Big Brother, because it delivers ministers who hold short-term tenures into the hands of the permanent executives who never need submit to the uncertainties of elections. As the 19th century philosopher John Stuart Mill observed of a Russian Czar: \"[He] is powerless against the bureaucratic body; he can send any one of them to Siberia but he cannot govern without them or against their will.\" In trying to the stop the nation edging towards a Big Brother state, civil libertarians face hurdles that seem insuperable. Their arguments against the use of surveillance technologies are weak compared to the arguments in favour of defeating terrorism, fraud, tax evasion and illegal immigration. More tellingly, departments win larger budgets and gain kudos in Whitehall by installing new centralised systems. Civil libertarian warnings about the loss of privacy will have a diminishing impact as the power of the executive over parliament becomes more indomitable. In an increasingly technological world, a Big Brother state may be inescapable, an inevitable consequence of the symbiotic relationships between commercial marketeers and the natural desire of bureaucracies to consolidate and expand their centralised power. Both can achieve their aims through the installation of new technology; and the interests of the libertarian come a very poor third. \u00b7 Tony Collins is executive editor of Computer Weekly."
