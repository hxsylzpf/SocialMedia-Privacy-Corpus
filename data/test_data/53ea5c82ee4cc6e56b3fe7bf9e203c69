  "content": "David Aaronovitch has been snooping on statistics. His mission: to get to the bottom of the dubious claim, often quoted as fact, that the average Briton is caught on 300 CCTV cameras a day. The statistic is fiction. Or at least was written as such when it first appeared in 1999 in the book The Maximum Surveillance Society. The author, Sheffield University's Professor Clive Norris stated clearly in the book that the \"contrived account\" of a day in the life of a man called Thomas Reams was \"a fictional construction\" designed to mirror the reality of routine surveillance. That important detail appears to have been lost when the estimate was referenced in a landmark study for the Office of the Information Commissioner. Neither was the fact that the number was made-up mentioned in any of the \"Big Brother\" media stories that have made reference to an \"average 300 cameras\" ever since. Aaronovitch's detective story is a useful fable for journalists who copy and paste stats. But does it say anything else? Evidence of paranoid fantasy about surveillance, perhaps? I assume he wants us to think so. Any estimate of the spread of CCTV will be flawed. Norris is also behind that other estimate often used to quantify the number of CCTV cameras: that there are 4.2m, or 4,285,000, or one for every 14 citizens. The methodology behind this claim is also dubious as it derives from a 2002 study that extrapolated from the number of cameras on Putney High Street in London. The 4.2m cameras \"fact\", or versions of it, seems to have infected almost every article or report mentioning CCTV since, including the House of Lords' heavyweight report into surveillance published last month. The Home Office and police, in their treatise on CCTV, claim that their \"evidence\" does not suggest \"such extensive coverage\". (It would be interesting, given they always claim to have no idea how many cameras there are, to know exactly what evidence they are quoting here.) But the numbers debate misses the point. There will never be an accurate figure. What is beyond dispute is that CCTV is, in cities and towns across Britain, ubiquitous. Full stop. We know this because we can see them. Second, the physical number of individual cameras is not the problem. It is their scope, their use and, of course, whether they are even needed in the first place that matters. The same joint Home Office and police report that claimed estimates for CCTV cameras were exaggerated conceded \u2013 as have senior officers since \u2013 that most CCTV footage is useless for detecting crime. Last week I visited Westminster CCTV's control room and watched as the operators use a relatively small number \u2013 160 \u2013 hi-tech cameras to monitor almost every corner of central London. They spin 360 degrees and can ID a person 75 metres away. I was told the control room has access to fewer cameras than many of the central London stores. By this measure, should Aaronovitch spend an afternoon perusing the aisles of Oxford Street's largest shops \u2013 and particularly if he arrives by public transport \u2013 he can expect to pass beneath substantially more than 300 cameras. We can overreact. Fears that police are seeking the widespread introduction of \"automated face recognition\" cameras or \"behaviourial matching\" software are probably over-hyped. The technology is not quite there yet and, besides, would be too expensive. Then again, the national network of roadside cameras are already recording the whereabouts of every driver on Britain's roads and storing that information on database for up to five years. If you drive, you are tracked. How many vehicle number plate sightings will the national police database have the capacity to store this year? Eighteen billion.",
