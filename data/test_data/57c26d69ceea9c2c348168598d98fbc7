  "content": "\u2022 The seemingly unstoppable Facebook has hit a new milestone, surpassing Yahoo to become America's second most popular website (after Google). That's partially the result of counting methods used by Compete.com (which mean that services such as Flickr don't count towards Yahoo's total) but even so, it's clear what direction the two companies are headed in. I'm not sure whether this marks a high point for The Church of Zuckerberg or a low for Yahoo - which, despite the heavy criticism over the years, has remained one of the biggest web properties around. \u2022 Thursday could see the end of the saga surrounding the Google book settlement, the never-ending, highly controversial plan to pay $125m to authors and publishers for the right to scan in-copyright books and make them available online. I've previewed the announcement here, but right now it's anyone's guess as to which direction Denny Chin - the judge who's examining the case - will go. \u2022 Perhaps one of the most surprising things about Windows Phone 7 series announcement earlier this week was that it looked nice - well-designed and visually appealing, two things that are very important to making an intuitive touch interface on a small screen. But if you want to get a better idea of how WP7 stacks up against the iPhone, you can run through this really nice side-by-side comparison of the two. We've still got to see how WP7 manages across lots of different hardware, but the basic feel - similar to the Zune HD - manages to make Windows Mobile feel modern again. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
