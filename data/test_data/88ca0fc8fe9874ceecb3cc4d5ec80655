  "content": "Lonely Planet guides this week named Kent as Europe's best destination for a family holiday, though last Sunday, walking along Deal's promenade, I would have judged such an accolade to be a deceit. Cloud lay low over the Channel as black as the sky in a Dutch marine painting, rain spat occasionally, and a grey sea lapped an empty pebble beach. On the way to the station we passed a bar named after Norman Wisdom. A newsagent's window displayed copies of the Railway Modeller. A greengrocer said her shop closed at 4pm. Not unpleasantly, these things combined to remind me of a country I used to know. What Kent has is history, especially military history: Roman forts, medieval castles, memorials to Dunkirk's little ships, preserved gun emplacements from the two world wars. No other place in Britain has the same feeling of borderland, of being on the way to somewhere else. In the bicentenary week of Waterloo, it is worth remembering that the news of Wellington's victory first touched British soil when two messengers jumped from a rowing boat in Broadstairs and not, as some Sussex people used to believe, when a wild-eyed man strode from the sea at Hastings crying \"Hurrah! Wellington has thrashed Boney!\" As Brian Cathcart says in his fascinating book, The News from Waterloo, it was the most momentous news to reach Britain in the 19th century. The victor himself eventually came to live here after he was made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, a sinecure that came (and still comes) with an official residence, Walmer Castle, where the rooms occupied by Wellington in the last 20-odd years of his life have just been reopened to the public after a careful refurbishment by English Heritage. His camp bed is here, and the chair he died in, and, of course, a pair of his boots. As a national celebrity \u2013 a new phenomenon then \u2013 he inspired statuettes and other ornaments that the Victorian middle class could stand on their mantelpieces and pianos, though (as the curator, Rowena Willard-Wright, pointed out) Napoleon was always the bigger seller, bust-wise, because his story was much the more dramatic and inspiring, even in Britain, to a class that liked to believe in the endless possibilities of upward mobility. Other rooms in the castle have other themes. Two are dedicated to Pitt the Younger, an earlier Lord Warden; two evoke the first year of the first world war, when Winston Churchill and field marshals Kitchener and French gathered here under the eye of prime minister HH Asquith to plan strategy. Henry James came calling (Churchill was rude to him) and Rupert Brooke, a friend of Asquith's daughter, wrote some of The Soldier here before he set off for the debacle at Dardanelles, a military adventure that been promoted within the castle walls. \"If I should die, think only this of me \u2026 \" Corner of a foreign field, for ever England, and so on \u2013 but it can safely be said that nowhere will be quite as English as Walmer. We did the customary thing in these circumstances \u2013 found the castle tearoom and ate a scone. The long goodbye An interesting feature of the big 19th-century British hero was his immediate afterlife (I mean terrestrially, rather than in worlds beyond our own). A remarkable length of time could occur between death and the funeral. Sometimes distance is the explanation. Nelson, for example, died at Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, but didn't reach his final resting place beneath the dome of St Paul's until 8 January 1806, having rested along the way at Gibraltar and the Painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, as well as inside the brandy cask that kept him from putrefaction during those 11 mournful weeks. Livingstone took much longer. After his death in the African interior in late April or early May 1873, his African attendants took the brave decision to eviscerate and embalm him and then carry him 1,000 miles to the coast. His sun-dried remains were eventually unloaded at Southampton docks on 15 April the next year, and from there taken by special train to London, where he lay in state at the offices of the Royal Geographical Society for a couple of days before his burial in the nave of Westminster Abbey. The more puzzling case is Wellington. He died on 14 September 1852, but spent two further months above ground, until 18 November, when he vanished under the floor of St Paul's to join Nelson. His funeral is unparalleled in British history for its vast crowds, frenzy and vulgarity. At least three people were killed in the crush at the week-long lying-in-state; Queen Victoria wept without restraint as she watched the procession from her balcony at Buckingham Palace, while the overweight and over-ornamented bronze hearse or \"funeral car\", drawn by 12 horses and juddering awkwardly into potholes, was reviled by people of taste as an aesthetic and mechanical nightmare. Dickens thought that \"there never was such a work achieved \u2026 for forms of ugliness, horrible combinations of colour, hideous motion and general failure.\" A million-and-a-half people lined the route to watch. But why had it taken so long to bury him? The duke hadn't died, after all, in a distant sea battle or a far-off jungle, but in his favourite wing chair at Walmer. Various morbid processes, typical of their day, ensued. His false teeth of walrus ivory were removed and given to his daughter-in-law as a memento, a death mask was made and every lock of his hair shorn to make souvenirs for his closest admirers, including the queen. Then he was laid into his lead coffin, was soldered down, and a wooden coffin built around it, and a second, more decorative wooden coffin built around that, until the duke lay like the final Russian doll in a series of four. All this took time. The family ceremony of farewell took a day. Local people queued on the beach for two days to be allowed into the house to pay their respects. But so much time? When the guns boomed on the evening of 10 November to signal the bier's journey from Walmer to Deal station and the London train, the duke had been dead for nearly eight weeks. Perhaps there has never been a greater demonstration of the truth that funerals are for the living. What had kept the duke waiting was Prince Albert's plan for a spectacular funeral. Fresh from the success of the Great Exhibition the year before, the Queen's consort had conceived a lavish ritual that needed time to arrange \u2013 not least the great hearse that had so appalled Dickens. Using at least 10 tons of bronze cannon captured at Waterloo, it had taken 100 men 18 days to cast and polish its parts in six foundries, only to achieve what Thomas Carlyle called an \"incoherent huddle\" of drapery, flags and emblems. The nation had been kept waiting for a flop. Today such a delay is hard to imagine. Tweeted outrage would see it off. \"Wait\" is a word that belongs to earlier times, when the news travelled no faster than the quickest horse or the swiftest boat, and Waterloo took three days to reach London. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 June 2015 to correct the date of Nelson's death."
