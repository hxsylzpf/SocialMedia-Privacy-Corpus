  "content": "The non-profit advocacy organization Women, Action, and the Media (Wam) has created an \"unprecdented\" partnership with Twitter to tackle online harassment of women. Following a Pew study that showed 26% of women aged between 18 and 24 have been stalked online and 25% have been targets of online sexual harassment, Wam has created a comprehensive but easy-to-use form, through which users can report harassments and threats that will then be \"escalated\" to Twitter. \"There are a lot of different ways that women are getting harassed and Twitter's current reporting system isn't catching all of them,\" said Jaclyn Friedman, executive director of Wam. The organization is aiming to cast a wider net when it comes to reporting harassment against women of color and from the LGBT community. The Wam form asks a more detailed set of questions than Twitter's own in such circumstances, including \"Do you fear for your personal safety because of this harassment?\" and \"How many times have you reported this harassment to Twitter?\" It also allows a person to list multiple harassing accounts at once. As an authorized reporter, Wam has been granted the ability to \"escalate\" complaints it receives to Twitter in \"24 hours max; hopefully much less than that\". \"You might report one tweet, but that may not rise to the level of harassment,\" said Freidman. \"But if you paint a picture of other harassment, you get a bigger story.\" The form has another purpose: gathering data about how harassers behave online, in the hope of helping Twitter to better understand the way trolls behave and perhaps take more concrete steps to stop them. In a statement, Twitter told the Guardian: \"We're always trying to improve the way we handle abuse issues, and Wam is one of many organizations we work with around the world on best practices for user safety.\" The responsibility of dealing with such complaints remains entirely in Twitter's hands. However, the involvement of Wam raises the question of why Twitter does not simply host the new and improved form on its own site, replacing its current reporting process, to devote some of its own resources to fixing the problem. Robinson Meyer wrote in the Atlantic: \"In other words, it's understood to be a major improvement to the current situation, that two people will now be devoting serious time and attention to Twitter's harassment problem \u2013 even though they work for a small non-profit that's effectively donating that time and attention to Twitter, a for-profit and publicly owned corporation.\" In the third quarter of this year, Twitter's revenues were $321m. Some feminists are concerned about how much reform will come from Twitter's involvement with Wam. \"This must be more than just a plan to appease those of us speaking up about harassment in the short term,\" said Emily Lindin of The UnSlut Project, who has experienced name-calling online and attacks by email and cell phone. \"Threats on social media are real threats, and if those making them knew there would be consequences, they might make different decisions. As it is, reporting Twitter harassment is fruitless and blocking a user just puts a bigger target on your back.\" Imani Gandy, senior legal analyst at RH Reality Check and a prolific tweeter told the Guardian she wanted to see fundamental changes made to Twitter itself, such as making rape threats an explicit violation of its terms of service and making sure that a single, tenacious harasser could not create multiple accounts to get around suspensions. \"The harassment can get so bad that it drives people to quit,\" Gandy said. \"And if Twitter wants to reach every single person on the planet, they're going to need to figure out a way to protect half of the planet from rancid abuse by the other half.\""
