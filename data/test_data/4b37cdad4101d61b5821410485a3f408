  "content": "A picture agency owner who was hauled before the Leveson inquiry after it was claimed that his company was offering money to public officials for information about prominent people has had a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission rejected. The PCC dismissed Matt Sprake's complaint about an article on the investigations website Exaro News that claimed he was targeting civil servants and other officials such as probation and prison officers with offers of cash for information about stories involving high profile officials and celebrities. Sprake, joint owner of NewsPics, a photographic and surveillance agency in Essex, offered four-figure sums for scoops through its website, Exaro reported. The investigative journalism website's expose led to Sprake being summoned before the Leveson inquiry, where he admitted following Kate and Gerry McCann to Canada when they took their first holiday since their three-year-old daughter Madeleine disappeared. Sprake complained to the PCC about Exaro and the Independent, which published an article based on the website's investigation. He claimed the information about him was both inaccurate and had been gained through subterfuge. But the press watchdog found that Exaro's investigative methods were in the public interest and no breach of its code had occurred. The PCC has not issued a public statement about the complaint as it was not upheld. However, a spokesman confirmed that \"the commission ruled that there had been no breach of the code of practice\". Exaro reported that in a section headed \"news exclusives\", the agency tried to tempt public officials to provide details of \"a scandal\" or, \"where a prominent person is living or what they get up to\", or \"a celebrity having an affair\". \"You can earn yourself good cash now by calling \u2026 24 hours a day and remember, nobody ever needs to know it was you that told us!\" At the time of Exaro's story in July, Sprake protested that he had never paid a police officer or \"anyone in authority\" and had wanted to remove the wording relating to cash payments but the website was broken. The wording about cash payments appears to have been subsequently removed from the NewsPics website. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
