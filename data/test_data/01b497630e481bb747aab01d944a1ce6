  "content": "Kevin Pietersen recently defended a foul-mouthed reaction to being dropped from the England cricket team on the grounds that he hadn't meant his comment to be public. He had, after all, only made it available to millions of people on Twitter. As Observer Sport reports this week, Mr Pietersen is not alone in failing to grasp the site's capacity to cause a stir. A moment's reflection, for example, might have led Australian swimmmer Stephanie Rice to refrain from inviting the South African rugby team to \"suck on that, faggots\". Politicians and pop stars have stumbled in this particular minefield. But sports stars seem especially prone to detonate. Perhaps they are used to sounding off in public without being heard. Rarely is sledging and profanity picked up by microphones. Or, maybe, they simply enjoy expressing themselves away from public relations minders. Their tweets certainly contain more insight than the usual cliches of the post-match interview, which, in under 140 characters, at the end of the day, to be fair, when all's said and done, is good for the fans and good for sport."
