  "content": "A serious security problem caused by advertising software installed on Lenovo laptops is more widespread than first thought, security researchers have warned. The 'Superfish' vulnerability affected dozens of laptops shipped between September and December 2014, exposing users to a hijacking technique that is also now thought to affect parental control tools and other adware programmes. The core of the vulnerability, which left owners of Lenovo laptops bought in late 2014 open to eavesdropping and \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks \u2013 even when using an encrypted connection \u2013 is a self-signed security certificate installed by the Superfish adware to let it inject adverts into search results and secure websites. But the technique, known as \"SSL hijacking\", appears to be a framework bought in from a third company, Komodia, according to Facebook's Matt Richard and independent researcher Marc Rogers. And Komodia's framework, sold as SSL Decoder, is present in numerous other products as well. Rogers cites products including parental control software and IP-cloaking technology as containing the weakness, while Richard says Facebook discovered the certificates being issued by a number of adware vendors disguised as games or search assistants. Rogers says: \"If you are a parent that has installed parental control software \u2026 I would check to see if your computer has been affected by this, as a matter of urgency.\" A free online check made by developer Filippo Valsorda is able to identify the presence of the certificates, and Rogers recommends concerned users visit it. Facebook's Richard says: \"What all of these applications have in common is that they make people less secure through their use of an easily obtained root CA, they provide little information about the risks of the technology, and in some cases they are difficult to remove. \"Furthermore, it is likely that these intercepting SSL proxies won't keep up with the HTTPS features in browsers (e.g., certificate pinning and forward secrecy), meaning they could potentially expose private data to network attackers. Some of these deficiencies can be detected by anti-virus products as malware or adware, though from our research, detection successes are sporadic.\" Facebook discovered the vulnerabilities as part of a wider project, started in 2012, to discover how prevalent SSL man-in-the-middle attacks are\u200b. The project, carried out in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University, found that 0.2% of SSL certificates, required to surf the web securely, had been tampered with, affecting 6,000 people in Facebook's sample. In the wake of the revelations, Komodia is experiencing website outages, which the company blames on a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on its servers. The company did not comment on Richard's and Rogers' allegations."
