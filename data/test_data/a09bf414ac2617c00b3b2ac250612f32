  "content": "The virtual reality headset market is suddenly booming. Samsung has shown off a new device that turns one of its smartphones into an Oculus Rift-style product that straps to the face, competing with Google's Cardboard and Sony's Project Morpheus. The accessory requires the just-launched Galaxy Note 4 for a screen, slotting in and using software developed by Oculus VR, the company bought by Facebook behind the Oculus Rift headset. It renders images on a split screen to simulate a stereoscopic view for the wearer, much like 3D TVs and 3D spectacles in cinemas. Virtual reality headsets immerse the wearer in a visual and, often, auditory environment by matching what is shown to the eyes with the movements of the head. Effective implementation requires rapid feedback between the sensors on the headset to the screens: studies have shown that lags of more than 50 milliseconds between head movement and screen updates can induce sickness. That is why only the Note 4, with its large screen and fast processor, is sufficient. In Samsung's system the Note 4 will provide the sensors, including a compass, accelerometer and gyroscope for detecting head moment to produce the virtual reality effect. A touchpad on the outside of the headset allows control of the device locked inside, while the smartphone's rear camera can be used to provide the wearer with a view of the normal world outside. That video passthrough enables augmented reality applications, overlaying a virtual image onto the real world \u2013 but could also improve the day-to-day use of the device, letting owners take a break from the virtual world without taking off the cumbersome headset. John Carmack, the former Doom developer, introduced the hardware at Berlin's IFA event, saying that \"it's been a secret project for too long\". He explained: \"I've dedicated the last year of my life to making the best mobile VR system, and I'm really proud of what we've accomplished. Mobile VR is a hard problem to do well, and we've had to use a lot of technology to solve this.\" Carmack cited the AMOLED screen of the Gear VR as one of the crucial leaps that made the problem solvable. A dedicated selection of apps built for the headset will be available including Theatre, 360 Player, and Gallery apps. A software development kit for the VR headset will be made available for third-party developers. The Gear VR will compete with Sony's highly anticipated Project Morpheus for PlayStation 4, as well as Google's Cardboard accessory for Android smartphones. Google's Cardboard performs the same function, turning a phone into a virtual reality headset, but can be made by the user following some detailed instructions with some sturdy cardboard and an elastic band, instead of having to buy anything. Samsung and Google are not the first companies to think of turning a smartphone into a wearable virtual reality headset. The Vrase headset does the same thing using iPhones and various Android smartphones, and was successfully funded on Kickstarter in October 2013.",
