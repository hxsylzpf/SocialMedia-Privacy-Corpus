  "content": "I did warn the Labour party that I generally lose elections. I wrote a whole book about it; losing elections is my unique selling point. But still there seemed to be some enthusiasm around the idea of me being the Labour candidate for the most important byelection since Birgitte Nyborg won Borgen South. When I was interviewed for the shortlist, Labour's NEC asked me if there was anything in my past that might come out and embarrass the party. I mentioned Things Can Only Get Better but the panel had all read it and seemed pretty relaxed about things that had been in the public domain for 15 years. Little did I know that at that very moment, top investigative reporters from the Daily Mail were busy uncovering dark secrets that I had cunningly hidden away in a bestselling memoir. I wanted to fly the flag for Labour in Eastleigh because I thought I might help the party avoid disappearing completely in a Swiftian battle between two coalition parties fighting tooth and nail to vote for identical policies. And for a second I fantasised that if enough disgruntled Liberal Democrats switched to Labour and a protest bandwagon began to roll, then maybe we could actually win it. Oh well, it's the taking part that counts. Actually no, in politics, it's the winning that counts but Labour winning in the south is a long game, and this full-on effort was part of that wider campaign. That's why the Conservative hierarchy realised halfway through they had to turn on the Labour candidate and ignore the Lib Dem. That's why the Tory whips in the Commons were planting questions about me for David Cameron and abusing their parliamentary privilege to say I supported terrorism. One of the more worrying aspects of the whole episode was just what slow readers they were over at the Daily Mail. After a week they attacked me for something I said on page 75 of my political memoir. By Sunday they had read another 40 pages. In this section I confessed that as an angry young man in the middle of the miners' strike, I had so despised Margaret Thatcher that when the Brighton bomb went off, I had felt regret that she had survived. Apparently none of the main parties encourage vulnerable byelection candidates to go around expressing support for terrorist murders of democratically elected prime ministers. Even in 1984, I had immediately castigated myself for this thought and in my novel I was trying to be honest to make a point about hatred being a terrible thing. Surely the Daily Mail would explain this if I read to the bottom of the article? Oh, apparently not. Five minutes later, the past tense had morphed into the present tense. When the local paper cut and pasted the Mail article onto their front page (without I might add, giving me the opportunity to comment), I learned that I had made a classic byelection gaffe of being personally responsible for every death caused by the IRA since 1921. Since I was also losing votes for supporting gay marriage, I might as well have got engaged to Martin McGuinness just to seal the deal. It is really cold in Eastleigh, but now that black balaclava was definitely staying at the back of the wardrobe. \"Is Ed's pal the sickest man in politics?\" asked the Mail. Shall I read the comments underneath that? No, maybe not. The poison was recycled in The Sun, by Andrew Neil and on BBC's Question Time and would you believe it, there are also some quite rude and immoderate people on Twitter. To be the subject of the \"Two-Minute Hate\" is an unnerving experience, but I suppose it's some sort of badge of honour that they think I was worth trying to destroy. I was even pilloried for something that had been said by one of my fictional characters, which is a new one on me. I don't doubt that constantly having to repeat that I never supported terrorism damaged me. And I worry about the Facebook generation going into politics, when every sick one-liner or embarrassing photo will be there in the archive for smears in later life. But it only made me more determined to keep making more noise on behalf of the causes that the Mail and the Conservative party despise. I have already decided that I won't be a Labour candidate in 2015, I think I can be more effective with the freedoms that not being a traditional politician provides. Also, I have a novella coming out next week in which, the narrator says, \"I love you, Mrs Thatcher. I love you.\" Once the tabloids start claiming those were my true feelings, I really would have to hang my head in shame."
