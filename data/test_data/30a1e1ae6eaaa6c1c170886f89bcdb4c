  "content": "In the land of Twitter, sex + race + a presidential primary = #Cainwreck. Which is an apt summation of the latest instalment of the Incredibly Bizarre But True, You-Can't-Make-This-Stuff-Up-Story of Herman Cain's presidential bid. We're watching a funhouse mirror-like distortion of American racial and gender politics, with our historically twisted and painful attitudes about interracial sex serving as the subtext. Any suggestion of interracial sex makes us squirm, particularly when it's black man/white woman sex. Particularly when it's dark black man/pale blonde white woman sex. So you've got Cain, a conservative black Republican, who has been accused by five women, three of them anonymously, of sexually harassing them while he was the president of the National Restaurant Association. He denies it, vehemently, though his recollection of said events seems to vary with each passing interview. White, rightwing pundits leapt to his defense, invoking US supreme court Justice Clarence Thomas's famous line, \"this is a high-tech lynching.\" Ann Coulter, conservative author/professional instigator, defended Cain with the declaration, \"our blacks are so much better than their [liberal] blacks.\" And then, on Monday, Sharon Bialek came forward \u2013 backed by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred \u2013 to give specific, graphic descriptions of Cain's alleged harassment. (Which, if true, would take Cain's alleged actions from beyond the purview of untoward comments into sexual assault territory.) And, as it turns out, Bialek is blonde, blue-eyed. White. This is the stuff that makes cable news producers' hearts sing: controversy. Scandalous allegations. A black man running for the highest office in the land. A black Republican man with a penchant for referring to himself in the third person running for the highest office in the land. Pretty accuser comes forward, prompting the candidate to call a press conference on Tuesday to defend himself from said said scandalous allegations. The press conference proves to be the ratings gift that keeps on giving as the candidate calls his accuser a liar, and declares that he's in it to win it and he won't be withdrawing from the race. \"Ain't going to happen,\" he intones. \"I will not be deterred by false, anonymous, incorrect accusations \u2026 The Democrat machine of America has brought forth a troubled woman to make false accusations.\" It's interesting to watch rightwingers rally to Cain's side. Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham tweeted, \"Gloria Allred 'stimulus pkg' ref 2 Cain is rife w/ racial overtone.\" Meanwhile, Rush Limbaugh described Bialek as \"the blonde bombshell\" and said that her name sounded like \"Buy A Lick\", as he smacked his lips. Conservative pundits pulling the race card is a flipping of the traditional script. Historically, Republicans have been the ones to raise the specter of the big, scary black man, as George HW Bush famously did with Willie Horton in the 1988 campaign against Mike Dukakis. In 2006, former Congressman Harold Ford Jr, who is black, ran for Senate in a bid to become the first black senator from the South since Reconstruction. The Republican party ran a commercial featuring an attractive white woman talking about how she met Ford at a \"Playboy party\". She winked as she cooed, \"Harold, call me.\" The ad was roundly criticised for playing into persistent racial stereotypes about black male sexuality. Ford lost the race. In the United States, we cling to this notion that pre-Loving v Virginia, no one ever crossed the color line until the US supreme court in 1967 ruled that states could no longer restrict interracial marriages. During the 2008 presidential campaign, the media fixated endlessly on Barack Obama's biracial parentage as if he were some newly-created creature never before found on these shores. Never mind that the vast majority of African Americans have a racially mixed ancestry, thanks to slavery and unscrupulous slaveowners who often took advantage of their female chattels. We don't like to acknowledge our mixed race roots and so, when confronted with the evidence, like Tiger Woods's multiple extramarital dalliances, we act all shocked. Would OJ Simpson's murder trial have garnered such endless attention if his ex-wife had not been a blonde beauty? I doubt it. Simpson's trial, with its Shakespearean overtones of sexual jealousy and domestic abuse, played out like a modern-day Othello, with every detail of the trial televised for all to see. Now, with Herman Cain, the Twitterverse is making a connection with the interracial meme. Shortly after Cain's press conference, @blackcanseco tweeted: \"Dear Herman Cain (@RealHermanCain): Leave them White Women alone! \u2013 Sincerely, Tiger Woods.\" #cainwreck.\" Will the drama kill Cain's candidacy? Perhaps. Perhaps not. As Danielle Belton, aka @blacksnob tweeted, \"I love how stunned the pundits are &amp; don't know what to do with #cainwreck. Enough scandal to kill any campaign. Yet IT LIVES ON!\""
