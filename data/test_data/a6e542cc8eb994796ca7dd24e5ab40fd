  "content": "A new low for the brains of tomorrow as children are more likely to recognise Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg than Albert Einstein, according to a survey. i reports that only 45% of 1,000 kids aged five to 16 were able to identify the man who discovered the theory of relativity, compared with 68% who recognised Zuck. The same survey, by electronics maker Haier, shows that almost a quarter of the eight-year-olds questioned mistook Stephen Hawking for a hairdresser. Did they not watch the Paralympics opening ceremony?"
