  "content": "Doctors are being warned not to befriend patients on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter because of the risk that this could breach rules on confidentiality. The British Medical Association said medical staff and students should reject any approaches by current and former patients to avoid the risk of blurring the boundaries of the doctor-patient relationship. Clearly concerned that doctors will repeat mistakes that have already landed numerous Facebook users in trouble, the new BMA guidance, published today, also cautions against posting \"informal, personal or derogatory comments\" about patients on social media sites. Tony Calland, chairman of the BMA's medical ethics committee, said that while most doctors would not accept Facebook friend requests from patients, \"a minority said they would consider doing so\". \"Yet accepting Facebook friends presents doctors with difficult ethical issues,\" he said. \"For example, doctors could become aware of information about their patients that has not been disclosed as part of a clinical consultation. \"It would also be wholly inappropriate for doctors to disclose information about their patients online.\" The BMA advice follows similar guidelines issued this week by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, which says a number of medical staff have been investigated and struck off for \"improper use\" of Facebook. In addition to rejecting friend requests from people they have treated, it said, nurses and midwives should avoid posting photos of patients, discussing work online and publishing sensitive information. Dickon Weir-Hughes, chief executive of the NMC, said: \"I would advise nurses and midwives to exercise caution when using social networking sites. They could risk their registration if they share sensitive information, make inappropriate comments, or befriend patients online.\" The nursing watchdog also warned that sites such as Facebook \"should not be used for whistle-blowing or raising concerns\". Andy Jaegar, who compiled the NMC social networking advice, said: \"If your profession is nursing or midwifery, it is particularly inadvisable to discuss work issues online. What you regard as just an amusing story could end up causing serious offence more easily than you think.\""
