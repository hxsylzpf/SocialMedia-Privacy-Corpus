  "content": "Apparently inspired by a sudden infatuation with the storytelling possibilities of Twitter, David Mitchell's The Right Sort is arguably the first work by a major novelist delivered entirely in tweets. Mitchell has described the process of writing an entire short story via 280 separate 140-character chunks as a \"diabolical treble-strapped textual straitjacket\". Of course, Mitchell isn't the first writer to embrace the challenges and opportunities that Twitter offers. Neil Gaiman, the much-loved author of Coraline, American Gods and and the comic book series The Sandman, took user-generated content to its logical conclusion with Hearts, Keys, and Puppetry, an his attempt to write a novel in collaboration with his followers. Gaiman offered an opening line: Gaiman then invited contributions from his followers on Twitter. The final result is available as an audiobook, credited to \"Neil Gaiman &amp; Twitterverse\". Of course, for some, 140 characters is all you need. Granta-listed author Dan Rhodes is an exponent of the art of the ultra-short story, with his debut book Anthropology, consisting of 101 stories, each 101 words in length. His recent follow-up, Marry Me containing 80-odd stories of marriage, none longer than a page and a half. But perhaps the best Twitter novelist was unaware of the appropriateness of his art to social media \u2013 given he was writing more than 100 years ago. The Parisian anarchist F\u00e9lix F\u00e9n\u00e9on wrote a series of small ads for Le Matin newspaper over a short period in 1906. Each was a self-contained story, consisting of just three lines, filled with intrigue but with no further explanation. (A sample, 133-character tale: \"Bones have been discovered in a villa on Ile Verte, near Grenoble, belonging \u2013 she admits it \u2013 to the clandestine offspring of Mme. P.\") Posthumously collected in the book Novels in Three Lines, F\u00e9n\u00e9on's tales can be read as a very Situationist in-joke (the title can be translated both as \"novels\" and \"novelties\"). They were saved for posterity by his mistress, who cut out all 1,220 examples and saved them in a scrapbook. And yet F\u00e9n\u00e9on's stories are perfect for Twitter \u2013 as proved by the account set up in his name, @novelsin3lines. It only took a century for him to find the right outlet. Perhaps that's his best punchline of all.",
