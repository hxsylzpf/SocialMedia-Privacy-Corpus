  "content": "Sharing photos on Instagram is quick and easy, using the smartphone in your pocket, but what would it have been like in the 1980s when pocket computers, let alone smartphones, were just a twinkle in inventors' eyes? Cameras with real film, a desktop PC and a paper form? Picking a filter would have never been such fun. And what choice: sepia, monochrome, ocean or blurry \u2013 the options would have been almost endless, and you would have been able to view them instantly (after they'd been shipped to you) thanks to the modern wonder of the data cassette. The anticipation of seeing your wondrous creations arrive would be all the more palpable given the lack of any digital previews, although I suspect the results would have been slightly disappointing most of the time. Instagram direct would be more like sending a postcard, which would probably have made it mean more to recipients than the firing off a quick snap as it is now. Or of course you could have held a coloured gel over the lens of a Polaroid camera and just used that. Maybe if the company had thought of that it wouldn't have gone bankrupt in 2001 (and exited the instant camera business in 2007).",
