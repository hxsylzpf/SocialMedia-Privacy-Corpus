  "content": "Bloomingdale's has apologized for an advertisement in its recent holiday catalog that appears to make light of date rape. \"Spike your best friend's eggnog when they're not looking,\" reads the ad copy, which surfaced on Imgur this week. The text appears between a sharply dressed man looking at a woman, who is laughing and appears not to notice him. The implications of the ad drew outrage from people online, prompting the department store chain to apologize. \"In reflection of recent feedback, the copy we used in our recent catalog was inappropriate and in poor taste. Bloomingdale's sincerely apologizes for this error in judgment,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. Many people were baffled the line ever made it to publication, and questioned the editorial process and decision. Others noted the ad's creepy implications, offering simpler suggestions. Bloomingdale's also issued a public apology via its Twitter account. \"We heard your feedback about our catalog copy, which was inappropriate and in poor taste. Bloomingdale's sincerely apologizes,\" the department store tweeted."
