  "content": "News Corp's Fox Interactive Media said last night that Google would provide search services for its MySpace social networking website, in a deal covering other Fox properties. Google is expected to pay Fox at least $900m (\u00a3470m) in 2007-10 after beating Yahoo! and Microsoft for the contract. Google also signed with Viacom to distribute clips from popular MTV shows. Ad-supported clips will use Google's AdSense network, which delivers targeted content to affiliated sites. One US report suggested Viacom would get more than two-thirds of the proceeds."
