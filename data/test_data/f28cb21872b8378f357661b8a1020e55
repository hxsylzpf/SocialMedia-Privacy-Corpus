  "content": "After lobbying unsuccessfully for a cameo on Coronation Street, Snoop Dogg now has his sights set on a different British institution: the royal wedding. The rapper is promoting his new single by proposing it for Prince William's stag do. Wet, Snoop says, \"is the perfect anthem for Prince William or any playa to get the club smokin'\". Last month, William announced plans to wed his long-term girlfriend Kate Middleton. Prince Harry, a hip-hop fan, has reportedly been put in charge of the engagement party. With the Mirror reporting a possible performance by Snoop or Tinie Tempah, the former is taking every advantage of the regal speculation, giving a shout out to the House of Windsor on Twitter. \"Made tha anthem 4 Prince William's bachelor party n all bachelor parties round tha wrld,\" Snoop declared, directing his message to @clarencehouse, the official residence of princes Charles, William and Harry. Later, Snoop boasted that \"this song is tha one for Prince William's stag do\", and suggested US president Barack Obama get in on the action. \"U know they need tha Top Doggs in USA to roll to [the] bachelor party,\" he wrote. \"@BarackObama, u in?\" The rapper said he \"had to give them a little something ... when I heard the royal family wanted to have me perform in celebration of Prince William's marriage\". Despite this, a source in Snoop's camp told E! News that the rapper hasn't been formally approached. But he's \"really interested\". If only his new song reflected this. Wet has no royal name-drops \u2013 just lewd insinuation, dirty rhymes and references to lubrication. . Wet will appear on Snoop Dogg's forthcoming album, Doggumentary Music."
