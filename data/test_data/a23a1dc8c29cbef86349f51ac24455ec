  "content": "New York magazine's cover photograph of 35 women who have accused comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault \u2013 the largest such picture of the dozens of women who have alleged that he drugged and raped them \u2013 has sparked a global conversation on rape and shame. But it was the women who were not pictured, embodied by a lone seat in the corner of the powerful photo, that spawned the #TheEmptyChair hashtag. The tag became a public discussion of who reports rape, who does not, who is believed and who isn't. Photographer Amanda Demme spent six months photographing dozens of the women, all in the same chair. But since 46 women have publicly accused Cosby of rape or assault, there are at least 11 more who didn't appear in the photograph. \"#TheEmptyChair isn't big enough to fit all the people who have been raped, unheard and shamed,\" tweeted the activist Charlene Carruthers. The chair \"signals the women who couldn't come forward mostly [because] we, as a culture, wouldn't believe them\", the activist and writer Janet Mock tweeted. Last week Cosby filed a motion in court against Andrea Constand, his first accuser who has alleged he tricked her into taking drugs before an assault. The case has been settled, but Cosby has called Constand's request to open the settlement to public scrutiny an \"obvious attempt to smear\". Cosby's motion, referring to a recently released deposition, said he had \"admitted to nothing more than being one of the many people who introduced Quaaludes into their consensual sex life in the 1970s\". Constand did not participate in the New York magazine cover story. Many of the women who repeated their Cosby allegations to New York magazine went public decades ago, but were derided by the media. A pattern of media reversal on the allegations against Cosby continued Monday after the accusers' stories were printed. Last fall, a wave of new accusers began to speak out. However, contrary to years prior, the allegations caused shock. Networks canceled Cosby appearances, he resigned from several charitable boards, and controversy has followed virtually any connection to the beleaguered comedian. At least three women sued Cosby for defamation in winter, alleging that he slandered them through statements by his representatives. New York's cover story was released online Sunday evening, though some may have difficulty accessing the story, as the magazine's website was experiencing technical difficulties throughout the morning. The outage was apparently unrelated the story's popularity and has been attributed to an anti-New York hacker who apparently had a bad trip to the city. (A version of the story is available here.) Social media's reaction to the photo essay harkened back to other uses of Twitter to discuss women's experiences, including #WhyIStayed, which served as a public forum for women to discuss experiences of domestic abuse."
