  "content": "When Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, recently whipped up a social media storm after calling a customer who had criticised his airline on Facebook \"an idiot\", he unwittingly demonstrated how an organisation's attitude to digital is led from the top. At Lasa we've been funded by Google to help charities engage with digital, and our goal is to get the key issues on decision makers' agendas. We asked leading figures in the voluntary sector across the globe to tell us, in bullet point form, what five things their peers needed to know about digital. The resulting crowdsourced Digital: what every charity leader should know report includes contributions from Martha Lane Fox, Beth Kanter, Unicef UK and JustGiving. Their views are a call to arms to charity leaders to maximise digital's potential for income generation, collaboration and reaching stakeholders, ultimately creating a more sustainable sector. We'll be debating the report's findings at a special Lasa event for charity chief executives and opinion leaders on 6 November hosted by commercial and charity law firm Bates Wells and Braithwaite. And we're inviting anyone in the sector to share their ideas on what every charity leader should know about digital by tweeting @Lasaict using the hashtag #Lasaleaders. The key insights from the report are: \u2022 Digital is vital for charity leadership. Beth Kanter, author of The Networked NonProfit, advised charity leaders to \"be present, authentic, and human on social networks, sharing a bit of yourself as well as your organisation's goals\". Meanwhile Graham Fisher from Toynbee Hall said that fellow chief executives should deploy digital to \"improve your service access, effectiveness, efficiency and quality, opening new markets for new products.\" Sam Matthews, acting chief executive of Charities Evaluation Services, warned that chief executives must own digital, \"driving the agenda forward\" and using it to monitor impact through tools such as databases. \u2022 Digital must be part of your organisational strategy. Martha Lane Fox, chair of Go ON UK, highlighted the growth of digital fundraising (in the last quarter of last year 15% of donations were made online), telling charity leaders that there was \"no time to waste\" in getting digital strategies in place. Doug Jacquier, strategy consultant, emphasised digital engagement as critical: \"A technology plan is core to your strategic survival \u2013 if you're not understanding and managing your organisation's technology, you shouldn't be in the job.\" Karl Wilding, head of foresight at NCVO, said that leaders also need to \"plan for the opportunities (outcomes measurement; better fundraising) and costs (data protection and management) that big data are going to bring.\" \u2022 Charity leaders should innovate and engage through digital. Digital tools can reinvigorate relationships with stakeholders and reach new audiences. Independent charity adviser Rosie Chapman discussed how the Hawk and Owl Trust's online webcam of nesting peregrines led to an increase in membership and donations. Marnie Webb, Co-head of Techsoup Global, described how technology can help a charity's supporters take immediate actions (eg post-disaster relief) using tools such as Ushahidi. Damien Austin-Walker, head of digital at vInspired, predicted that \"tablet will become the new desktop\" and that \"second screen usage is becoming the norm.\" As the choice of digital media expands, Rachel Beer, founder of Beautiful World, told charity leaders that their organisations must \"stand out and be interesting, not just worthy\" in an increasingly crowded marketplace. \u2022 Digital can improve the bottom line. Nigel Lewis, chief executive of AbilityNet, stated that digital can help charities save money and time, as \"solutions and service providers exist at very low or no cost.\" Danielle Atkinson, head of digital and individual giving at Merlin, said digital pays dividends in the long run: \"Income generation won't happen overnight and you can't expect any gains if you don't invest or resource digital properly.\" \u2022 Social media can help charity leaders connect directly with stakeholders. Lucy Caldicott, director of fundraising at Clic Sargent, said that social media is an \"invaluable way to keep your finger on the pulse.\" Ross McCulloch, founder of Thirdsectorlab, counselled against leaders posting \"a stream of organisational updates\", if they truly want to connect with supporters, who \"want to know about the opinions, work and passions of you as a chief executive/chair/director/.\" \u2022 Mobile is the future. Holly Ross, executive director of US non-profit Nten, thinks that mobile is the \"next big tech innovation,\", while Paul de Gregorio, head of mobile at Open Fundraising, went further, saying charity leaders should be aware that mobile is now mainstream: \"Thanks to high profile events like Comic Relief, the public are increasingly used to donating by text.\" The message from the report is clear. Digital won't just help build a more sustainable sector; it's a vital element of charity leadership. As Jonathan Waddingham of JustGiving put it: \"Understanding how people communicate, how to reach them and how to inspire them is more important than any tool.\" You can read Lasa's digital report here.
