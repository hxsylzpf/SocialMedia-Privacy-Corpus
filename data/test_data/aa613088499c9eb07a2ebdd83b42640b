  "content": "US tech industry groups have urged Barack Obama not to pursue policies which might weaken encryption as a new report suggests that fear of government surveillance costs the economy by more than $35bn in revenue each year. The request was made in an open letter sent jointly on Tuesday by the Information Technology Industry Council and the Software and Information Industry Association, industry groups which represent companies including Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Google. \"We are opposed to any policy actions or measures that would undermine encryption as an available and effective tool,\" the letter reads, adding that \"consumer trust in digital products and services is an essential component enabling continued economic growth of the online marketplace.\" Their statement was bolstered by a study also released on Tuesday by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which found that the US government's failure to reform many of the NSA's surveillance programs had damaged the competitiveness of the US tech sector and cost it a portion of the global market share that would \"likely far exceed\" $35bn. \"In the short term, US companies lose out on contracts, and over the long term, other countries create protectionist policies that lock US businesses out of foreign markets. This not only hurts US technology companies, but costs American jobs and weakens the US trade balance,\" the study found. Since the publication of the documents leaked by former defence contractor Edward Snowden in 2013, the Obama administration has been struggling to justify its bulk collection programs to an increasingly sceptical public. In May, a crucial senate vote to extend the program \u2013 which was authorised under Section 215 of the Patriot Act \u2013 failed, followed by the passing last week of the USA Freedom Act, effectively ending bulk data collection, at least for the time being. \"We appreciate that, where appropriate, law enforcement has the legitimate need for certain information to combat crime and threats,\" reads the ITIC letter. \"However, mandating the weakening of encryption or encryption 'work-arounds' is not the way to address this need.\" The letter was copied to US secretary of state John Kerry, attorney general Loretta Lynch and homeland security secretary Jeh Johnson, as well as the secretary of commerce, the director of the FBI, and the director of the National Economic Council. In a press briefing on 4 June, White House press secretary Josh Earnest addressed the problem obliquely when asked a question about the now-defunct Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which allowed the federal government's bulk collection of data. Describing what he saw as the \"tough challenge of balancing the privacy and civil liberties of law-abiding American citizens with the need for us to try to detect and apprehend terrorists before they commit an act of violence\", Earnest said the president saw an opportunity to work with the tech sector. \"As much as they value and champion the privacy and civil liberties rights of American citizens, we also know that those individuals do not want to be in a situation where their technology is responsible for allowing somebody who is seeking to carry out an act of violence to evade detection from the federal government,\" he added.",
