  "content": "Actor James Woods claims Hollywood will turn their back on him after ruffling political sensibilities with a stream of anti-Obama tweets. Woods, who recently appeared in White House Down and Jobs, was replying to a tweet that questioned the wisdom of his outspoken declarations. \"I don't expect to work again. I l think Barack Obama is a threat to the integrity and future of the Republic. My country first.\" Woods has spent the last few days railing against Obama and \"liberals\" in general during the government shutdown. Sample tweets include: \"Barack Obama's petty jihad against World War II heroes is simply the nadir of politics in America. He is just vile. A small, small man.\" and \"Sixteen tears of machine Democrats shredding the fabric of this Republic will toss the greatest democracy on the trash heap of world history\". Woods' Twitter oration culminated in proclaiming \"This President is a true abomination\", whereupon another user tweeted: \"dude, aren't u worried about...u know..ever working again??\" Woods replied he didn't \"expect to work again\". At least Woods is not alone in Hollywood. He said he received a message of support from fellow actor and CSI star Gary Sinise, another noted Republican."
