  "content": "As David Cameron unveiled the first Tory-only cabinet in 18 years yesterday, it was revealed that Grant Shapps \u2013 the former party chairman \u2013 has been \"demoted to the lesser role\" of minister of state at the Department for International Development (DfID). Many on Twitter were quick to make jokes about his re-appointment, referencing the pre-election revelations of Shapps \u2013 or someone acting on his behalf \u2013 editing his Wikipedia page along with the entries of Tory rivals and political opponents. Others mocked his business activities as Michael Green, the self-styled millionaire web marketer... ... and his track record ... ... or just mocked him in general. But what does the development community make of his appointment, or \"demotion\"? One NGO insider contacted us to ask why DfID was always used as some kind of government \"naughty step\", pointing out that Justine Greening's appointment back in 2012 was also seen as a \"demotion\". Here's what you said: \u2022 This article was amended on 13 May 2015. An earlier version misnamed the Department of International Development, rather than the Department for International Development. What do you think about Grant Shapps' new job?
