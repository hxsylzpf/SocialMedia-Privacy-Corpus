  "content": "Oh, Google+, we hardly knew you. Because we never used you. Even though your parent company systematically forced us all into signing up for accounts. You were the new odd kid in class nobody wanted to talk to, but we were all forced to. Now, in a blog post entitled \"Everything in its right place\", which may or may not be a Radiohead reference, the company has announced it is scaling back the reach of Google+, its underperforming social network. Google has until now made certain services, such as YouTube channels and accounts, inaccessible to those without Google+, ostensibly under the guise of providing users with a more seamless experience. This also allowed Google to report inflated numbers of users, few of whom were actually active. According to the company, Google+ has 540 million users but, as the New York Times reported in 2014, only around half of those actually used it. Google+ will remain, but changes will mean Google users will only need a basic account in future to access services, rather than having to sign up to the social network. Its popular photos tools already moved to the standalone Google Photos app in May. In the blogpost, Bradley Horowitz, vice president of Google streams, photos and sharing, wrote: \"People have told us that accessing all of their Google stuff with one account makes life a whole lot easier. But we've also heard that it doesn't make sense for your Google+ profile to be your identity in all the other Google products you use.\" He announced that a basic Google account will be all users need to \"share content, communicate with contacts and create a YouTube channel and more\", rather than a specific Plus account. Specifically on the issue of Google+ in search, he added: \"As always, your underlying Google account won't be searchable or followable, unlike public Google+ profiles. \"And for people who already created Google+ profiles but don't plan to use Google+ itself, we'll offer better options for managing and removing those public profiles.\" Google's new changes to Plus will be rolled out over the following months, and will not \"happen overnight\". But users are warned not to delete their Google+ accounts immediately, due to the delay in changes coming into effect."
