  "content": "Gary McKinnon, 40, an alleged computer hacker accused of accessing Pentagon, army, navy and Nasa computers, causing \u00a3350,000 of damage, could face detention in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Defence lawyers told Bow Street magistrates yesterday that the safety of Mr McKinnon, known online as Solo, was at risk despite assurances from a US government representative that a diplomatic note guaranteed his safety. Previously, a UK judge had asked for guarantees that Mr McKinnon, who is fighting extradition to the US, would not be tried under a US military order that could send him to the jail in Cuba."
