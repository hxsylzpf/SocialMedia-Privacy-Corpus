  "content": "Judges at the court of appeal have overturned an award of \u00a31,000 in damages given to Naomi Campbell after she was branded a \"chocolate soldier\" by Daily Mirror columnist Sue Carroll. The model won the damages in March when she successfully sued the Mirror for breach of confidence after the paper revealed details of her treatment for drug addiction. Arguments over use of the term \"chocolate soldier\" featured prominently in the case. The judge granted Ms Campbell \u00a31,000 in \"aggravated\" damages in addition to the \u00a32,500 in primary damages awarded when he ruled the Mirror had broken confidentiality laws. However, the award was thrown out today after the court of appeal said the Mirror was right to publish a photograph of Ms Campbell leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in February 2001 in an article headlined: \"Naomi: I'm a drug addict.\" When primary damages are overturned, the award for aggravated damages must also be struck off. When Ms Campbell threatened to take the Mirror to court, Carroll accused her of hypocrisy. Carroll attacked the model for courting the media when she wanted to promote products but turning on the press when they printed negative stories about her. Carroll used the controversial \"chocolate solder\" phrase when she argued Ms Campbell was an ineffectual campaigner for charities. \"As a campaigner, Naomi's about as effective as a chocolate soldier,\" wrote Carroll. Mr Justice Morland, in a high court ruling in March, said Carroll's choice of language could easily be construed as racist. \"I can well understand that Miss Campbell found the phrase hurtful and considered it racist,\" he said."
