  "content": "\u2022 Google has been slowly trying to improve its social web offerings - recently introducing search results from your contacts and real-time updates, for example. But the company's now planning to push even harder in this arena, with an event on Tuesday set to unveil some new features - reports suggest it's adding more feature to Gmail - but whatever it is, I'll be at the press conference in Mountain View tomorrow to see what they've got up their sleeve. \u2022 Another event on Tuesday is the start of this year's Macworld Expo, notable for being pushed back to February and the absence of an Apple product launch (remember when Apple said just before last year's event that it wasn't going to go any more?). It will be interesting to see what comes out of the event without the marquee performance from Jobs and co - and how long Macworld can survive without being able to bask in Apple's halo. \u2022 Meanwhile, the troubles continue at Electronic Arts, which announced its latest financial results on Monday and didn't leave much positive feeling. Although losses were cut at the company - which laid off 1500 workers last year - game sales were down and it expects to miss its next set of targets too. More job cuts could be in the offing. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
