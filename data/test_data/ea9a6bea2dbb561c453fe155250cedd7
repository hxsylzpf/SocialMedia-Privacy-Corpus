  "content": "In the midst of the usual snap crackle and pop of fireworks overhead, there have been more modern modes of celebrating Diwali this year, illuminating how technology might be used to spread a message of hope. It was barely one hour into the five-day Festival of Lights and already Twitter was aglow with celebration \u2013 everyone from politicians to popstars, regardless of their own religion, joined in to wish their followers a #HappyDiwali with such enthusiasm that soon it was trending. \"On this day of the Festival of Light, wishing everyone peace, joy and a Happy Diwali\", tweeted Sarah Brown (@SarahBrownUK), whilst singer Jay Sean (@JaySean) wished, \"Happy diwali to all my fans celebrating!!!! Love ur fam\u2026 never take em for granted!!!\". \"A very happy Diwali to all our followers! Spend some quality time with family and friends and be safe!\", tweeted Bollywood actress Kareena Kapoor. Thousands of wishes for peace warmed cyberspace. I was burning the midnight oil, feeling the cold and dark of winter encroaching, when I spotted #HappyDiwali trending and above it, #no2racism \u2013 scrolling through heartwarming comments I recalled that \"Diwali\" means \"row of lamps\", and each tweet seemed a modern version of those lights which traditionally mark the celebrations. Sentiments spread like wildfire on Twitter and when those 140 characters carry a message of peace, social media shows its efficacious side. I remember more traditional Diwali celebrations as a child: fireworks exploding into the night skies of Manchester (followed by the screeching of frightened cats); families gathering together; Indian sweets devoured along the Curry Mile in Rusholme. Something as simple as sweets shared between friends of disparate backgrounds and beliefs assuaged the bitterness of racial divisions. Indeed, this was a festival that could be celebrated by all religions and by the secular: Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Jewish and atheist friends joined together in the celebration of light triumphing over darkness, as likewise Christmas, Hanukah, and Eid would be enjoyed by all \u2013 a way of distilling the core humanitarian message. But as we get older and are more scattered from family and friends, perhaps Twitter is a place where we can communally celebrate festivals despite geographical divides, and the warm wishes are a good antidote to the flames of hate and vitriol that social networking can at times be guilty of igniting. Social media might indeed be a positive new space for celebrating or simply learning more about one another's beliefs. If traditional spaces \u2013 temple, church, mosque \u2013 seem off-putting for those not of the same religion, cyberspace is less off-bounds: there is no need to remove one's shoes first, or cover one's head, or for women and men to sit in segregated spaces. There is only a need to log-on to get a glimpse into another's world. There are also benefits of practical safety and environmental friendliness: one retweeted message advises having a \"#CrackerFree #HappyDiwali\" \u2013 avoiding injurious fireworks might be a cracking new form of celebration. That's not to say the Festival of Light isn't being commemorated by less technological methods, too: storytelling was at the heart of the celebrations I watched at the weekend as children of many races and religions chalked rangoli over the pavements outside the Dishoom Bombay Cafe in London after hearing of the adventures of Rama, Sita and Hanuman presented by storyteller Vayu Naidu as part of the DSC south Asian literature festival. The story tells how lamps were lit to light the way home for Rama and Sita, one dark, moonless night. A current hashtag is #innerfire \u2013 using the metaphor of light in variously playful and profane ways, or as a cynical marketing ploy. In spite of its vices, Twitter at its best shows that words might have the effect of candles lit in the darkness, a message in a bottle sent out and received by a stranger, sparking a sense of hope and community even during the darkest of hours. #HappyDiwali \u2013 wherever in the world you might be."
