They float in the blind spots of our web scrolls, drawn in MS Paint, drawn in Comic Sans. They are ghosts of regrettable clicks \u2013 cookies remaining long after the yearning for an orthopaedic pillow has gone. They offer us solutions we never wanted for problems we've never had.

Must have taken voluntary redundancy and bought eight thimbles in order to keep the internet free for the rest of us. Must be sitting with the curtains closed, 15 laptops open, clicking and clicking, and only occasionally believing it will help him get a flat stomach in only five minutes. But what if.
