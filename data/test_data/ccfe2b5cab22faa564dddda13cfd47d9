  "content": "The boss of SpinVox has blamed disgruntled former employees for allegations that the technology company, which lets people convert their answering machine messages into texts, has been using humans in overseas call centres rather than machines to do its work. Christina Domecq, its chief executive, a scion of the Domecq sherry dynasty, stressed that the \"vast majority\" of the voicemails it transcribes are done by its technology, but it does use human intervention to add words to its database when discrepancies arise. \"We seem to be under sustained attack by some former employees,\" a clearly frustrated Domecq told the Guardian after allegations that the company uses call centres in South Africa and the Philippines to deal with the majority of messages. \"The ratio of humans to messages and humans to number of users is very, very low.\" \"The majority of calls are fully automated, she stressed. She added that with almost 100 million customers worldwide it would also be utterly impractical for people to transcribe even a relatively small percentage of the messages. There has always been controversy about the loss-making company, founded in 2003, with analysts trying to calculate how much the service relies on computer technology \u2013 SpinVox says it feeds all its messages into a Voice Message Conversion System, known as D2 or \"the Brain\" \u2013 and how much it relies on human intervention. The company maintains that it uses call centre staff to ensure quality of service. The technology gives every text a \"confidence\" score and those texts with a very low score are pushed through to one of its five call centres across the world. They analyse the call, check the resultant text, and if new words appear that the database does not know, they will include them. The agents themselves have no knowledge of customer, individual or even from which market the voicemail has come. In Argentina, for instance, where SpinVox has 10 million customers through a deal with mobile phone network Telef\u00f3nica, it has fewer than 70 call centre staff. The system is by no means perfect, there are often glaring mistakes, usually as a result of background noise or homophones, in texts that have been passed with a high confidence score. Critics have pointed out that as SpinVox has expanded \u2013 grabbing new customers in a variety of markets \u2013its quality has declined, leading many to suggest that its human transcribers were being massively over-worked. But Domecq said as the technology has evolved since it was launched in late 2004, SpinVox has been using fewer and fewer call centre staff and some of those who have been \"let go\" seem to be at the root of accusations by the BBC that the company passes the majority of its voicemail messages through humans rather than a machine. \"Over the last four years we have worked with over 50 call centres, some of the call centres have been really small and some really big but some of the call centres mentioned [by the BBC] are people we engaged three years ago,\" she said. \"All my technologists have said to me 'this has nothing to do with where we are today, that was where we were three years ago'. \"We now have five [call centres] so I guess in some ways you could say we have moved on and some people are not happy with the fact that we have moved on and we are getting flak for it.\" The BBC investigation also raised concerns about SpinVox's compliance with privacy laws. Under the Data Protection Act, any organisation that processes personal information must notify the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's privacy watchdog, and failure to do so is a criminal offence. Most importantly for SpinVox the notification \"must indicate whether or not personal information is transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA)\". SpinVox has gone through the notification process, but a spokesman for the ICO said \"we will be contacting the company to ensure that its entry on the data protection register is both accurate and complete, especially with regards to the transfer of personal data outside the EEA.\" Domecq, however, stressed that its notification has been correctly filed, adding: \"We have invested too much into this to do it haphazardly.\" The spokesman for the ICO pointed out that the law does not prevent SpinVox from using people, rather than machines, to translate audio messages into text, but stressed that consumers need to be given a clearer indication of whether someone other than the intended recipient will listen to their message as they may wish to be more guarded about what they say. \"It may be helpful if the company is clearer about the likelihood that people will be used to translate messages,\" the spokesman added. \"This is particularly important if customers are using the service for transmitting sensitive or secure information.\" Any such change to the way that SpinVox publicises its service, however, is likely to seriously impact the company's image and standing with its important commercial partners at a time when it is still heavily loss-making. It has won numerous awards on the back of its technology, including innovation of the year in 2006 from the industry trade body the GSM Association, and has deals with a host of companies including Carphone Warehouse and Phones4U along with partnerships with a number of major mobile phone companies including Telef\u00f3nica, owner of O2. It has also raised $200m from investors including Goldman Sachs and is rumoured to have been considering a flotation in the spring, before the credit crunch slammed the world's stockmarkets shut. Just last year they pumped $100m into the firm in what was one of the biggest fundraisings in Europe. At the time, Domecq said the investment valued SpinVox at \"in excess of $500m\". Its results to date paint a slightly more embryonic picture. Its last set of published accounts, filed with Companies House, show the business had revenues of just \u00a32m in the year to end December 2007, up from \u00a3436,000 in the previous year, but made a loss of \u00a336m \u2013 after the \u00a36m cost of the company's employee and executive share option scheme \u2013 compared with a loss of \u00a311.6m in the previous year as the company spent more on research and development. The company has been forecasting a sharp increase in sales as a result of a flurry of deals with mobile phone networks. The recession also seems to have been taking its toll with news earlier this month that SpinVox has been trying to pay staff in shares instead of paying them a salary this summer to save money. The company said at the time: \"We are offering all of our employees the opportunity to exchange all, part or none of their salary in July and August for share options, according to their wishes ... It's part of reacting to the global credit crunch. We've seen other companies take other kinds of measures.\""
