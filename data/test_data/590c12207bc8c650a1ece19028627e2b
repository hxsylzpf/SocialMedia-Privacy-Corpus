  "content": "A film about a Viking enthusiast whose passion for all things Norse gets him dumped by his wife may not sound like your typical romantic comedy, but the plot of Faintheart is probably its most conventional aspect. The movie, launched today with a series of free screenings, was produced with contributions from users of the social networking website MySpace. While it features a number of seasoned actors, including Trainspotting's Ewen Bremner and Tim Healy from Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, MySpacers were invited to post short films to pitch for the job of director. The entries were scrutinised by a panel of judges including the actor Sienna Miller to produce a shortlist, from which MySpacers chose first-time director Vito Rocco. Site users were also asked to post videos auditioning for eight lead and supporting roles, and parts of the script were put up on the site for discussion and suggestions. The movie, which received \u00a3325,000 of lottery funding, is launched at 6.30 this evening with free simultaneous screenings at 46 cinemas around the country, and will be available to watch on the MySpace website (http://www.myspace.com/) for one day only. The free screenings have been financed by the UK Film Council. Sally Caplan, the head of the council's premiere fund, said: \"This whole project has been a great experiment for film in the digital age right from the very beginning so I am delighted to see this followed through with an exciting and novel distribution plan to reach out to audiences far and wide.\" Despite the film's laudably democratic aims, however, not all the critics have been won over. The Guardian's Xan Brooks described it as \"a middling sitcom that could have crawled fully formed from the head of a jaded TV executive\". Brooks added: \"This is not a bad movie exactly but it aims curiously low and is faintly pointless. While the actors cope well with the material, they are finally just cardboard characters in a balsa-wood plot.\" \u2022 For more information on where to see the film, and to download a voucher for a free ticket, go to http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org/faintheart."
