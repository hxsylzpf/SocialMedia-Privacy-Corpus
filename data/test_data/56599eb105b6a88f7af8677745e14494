  "content": "Sharon Stone is the latest in a growing list of celebrities to pick up a cheque for damages before their case gets to court. The Daily Mail admitted defeat over a story alleging Stone had dined out at The Ivy while leaving her child in a car. In a statement read out in the high court, the paper admitted it had got the story wrong but said it had published it on the basis of information it \"did not doubt\" at the time. While out of court settlements are nothing new, the first half of this year has seen a run of them with various papers offering \"substantial\" damages and apologies to end libel and privacy-related disputes. The Daily Mirror's robust attempt to see off Naomi Campbell's litigation was a costly affair that has cast a chill over the courtroom and left the press reluctant to see their stories translated into evidence that has to be backed up in court. And the reason? Conditional fee agreements, which Campbell used in her case against the Mirror and which allowed her lawyers to charge up to a 100% success fee. The \"uplift\" payable to her lawyers because Campbell litigated under a CFA saw the Mirror's legal costs soar by over half a million pounds. An appeal to the House of Lords to change the rules of engagement was met with sympathy but not success. So when challenged by Stone, it is likely the Mail may have thought twice before saying it would see her in court. The problem with cases such as this is that what may seem good enough grounds on which to publish will not necessarily amount to satisfactory evidence in court. While the law specifies offence and defence when it comes to libel and attempts to do so in relation to privacy, it does not offer any guarantees as to the outcome of applying objective criteria to subjective circumstances. The Mail said it did not doubt its information at the time of publishing its story on Stone. But several months down the line and with costs to consider, the prospect of letting a judge or jury decide whether it should have published becomes too risky an exercise. With the rules of engagement remaining the same after the Mirror tested the willingness of the House of Lords to do something about CFAs, the punitive power of the system has undoubtedly dampened enthusiasm for seeking to justify one story. Having settled its action with Francesca Annis over coverage of her relationship with Ralph Fiennes, the Mail is probably adopting the safe approach and capping its costs in order to cut the risk of losses. Meanwhile, over at the Sun, they are making out cheques to Teri Hatcher and Wayne Rooney, hoping to make litigation go away ahead of the World Cup. Recent statistics show that while libel actions may be on the increase, there is a decrease in the number of actions proceeding to trial. With the spectre of CFAs still looming and costs to consider, gone are the days of \"publish and be damned\". Defence lawyers in these cases seem to be joining national newspapers' shareholders and accountants in more prudent risk assessments that are seeing a shift to a 'publish and pay' approach to such actions. \u00b7 Edgar Forbes is senior lecturer in media law at Bournemouth Media School. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
