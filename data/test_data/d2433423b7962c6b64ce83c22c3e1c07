  "content": "Chelsea FC @chelseafc Has football gone mad? Hazard is sent off for kicking the ball under a ballboy attempting to smother the ball rather than return it. #CFC Tweet later deleted Apologies for earlier ballboy tweet. Hazard has now met with the ballboy and has said sorry. #CFC Didi Hamann @DietmarHamann What has the game come to if you tell your ballboys to slow the game down.... Football is watched all over the world #Rolemodel Michael Owen @themichaelowen I'm not saying Hazard isn't in the wrong but I hate to see a person who instigates a situation then cry foul for next to nothing. How people can claim Hazard assaulted a kid is embarrassing. He shouldn't of kicked the ball out of his grasp but he hardly booted the lad as some people were suggesting. The lads antics were scandalous and no wonder he isn't taking any further action Robbie Savage @RobbieSavage8 If the ballboy gives the ball straight back and does his job properly that doesn't happen! Glenn Hoddle Sky Sports \"As a management team in European games you will tell the people who are instructing the ballboys that if you are winning the game, don't get the ball back quickly. That's your home advantage, in a way.\" Steven Pienaar @therealstevenpi I'm not saying its the correct thing 2 do but when in the heat of the moment u just want the ball Stan Collymore @StanCollymore Hazard deserved red (violent conduct rule). Kid is a prat. Ballboy job is to give ball quickly. End of. Is that enough of an opinion? Gareth Bale @GarethBale11 Unbelievable decision by the referee to send Hazard off but congrats to Swansea. Who'd have predicted this final?! Joseph Barton @Joey7Barton After reviewing last nights footage, I've come to the conclusion that the games gone. Ballboys aged 17, time wasting, then rollin round like they've been shot. Games gone. He was actually claiming to be best time waster in the world on Twitter yesterday! WTF' that all about? ... Hazard only crime is he hasn't kicked him hard enough... Rio Ferdinand @rioferdy5 17 year old ball boy\u2026 is that a wind up!!? Is being a ball boy now a career move?? Pat Nevin Radio 5 Live I was very disappointed with the way that the ballboy acted. He must have been watching footballers with the way that he rolled around and pretended to be injured. He's only got one job and his job is to go and give the ball back. What does he do? He keeps the ball. I have to say I was absolutely amazed this morning to find he's 17. Not 12. Not 13. He should know what his actions should be in that situation. His behaviour was disgraceful. I would have kicked the ball out from underneath him if he was behaving like that, 100%.\""
