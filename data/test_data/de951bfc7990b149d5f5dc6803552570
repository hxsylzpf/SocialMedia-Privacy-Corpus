  "content": "Age: 127 years Appearance: Digity Mmm, I love a phone number. Do you remember when it was a sign of being really fond of someone, knowing their phone number off by heart? Now you have to be kind to them and stuff. Yeah. Ooh, and you had to dial numbers on an actual dial, remember? Round it went, thrrrrrrr-up, then tickatickaticka \u2026 Calling people with too many 0s and 9s in their number used to take for ever and be really annoying! Halcyon days. Not everyone is so nostalgic about them, though. Oh, really? Who could possibly have a different opinion? Facebook. The gigantic website owned by that billionaire child and full of all the annoying people whose phone numbers I can't remember? That's right. Or Facebook's Messenger app, anyway. The site has made its 2016 trend predictions, and top of the list is \"the disappearance of the phone number\". Eh? Why would phone numbers disappear this year? Other than because Facebook wants them to? \"Just like the flip phone is disappearing, old communication styles are disappearing, too,\" says David Marcus, VP of messaging products. \"With Messenger, we offer all the things that made texting so popular, but also so much more \u2026 You can make video and voice calls while at the same time not needing to know someone's phone number.\" But I do that already. My phone remembers it for me. What if you want to call someone whose number you don't know? I look it up, or they tell me. Ah, but imagine if you could use their email address or other contact details instead. What if I didn't know their email address or other contact details? You'd look it up, or they'd tell you. That doesn't sound like a radical step forward. I mean, maybe landlines will disappear and everything will converge eventually, but it's ridiculous to predict it for this year. What else do they say will happen? \"Threads are the new apps \u2026 We're all social beings \u2026 Innovation matters \u2026 It's all about delight \u2026\" Is that just gibberish or do they give some kind of explanation? \"We're seeing a paradigm shift in how people engage,\" it starts \u2026 Let's make it stop there, too. With pleasure. Do say: \"Facebook is the new astrology.\" Don't say: \"It's all about cash.\"",
