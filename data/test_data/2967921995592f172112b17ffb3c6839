  "content": "Today's Daily Mail splash is headlined \"Russians spy on UK families via their webcams\". It concerns a Russian-based website that is showing scenes from security cameras installed in British homes. The situation is troubling enough for the UK's information commissioner, Christopher Graham, to have called - on Radio 4's Today programme - for the Russian authorities \"to take immediate action to take down the site.\" He said he was \"very concerned\" about the intrusion into people's privacy and pointed out that it is \"a very obscure website, run by Russians, registered in an offshore territory administered by Australia.\" Fair enough. But I don't seem to recall the Mail splashing on the revelation by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden that the US and UK governments were responsible for a massive intrusion into people's privacy. Nor did it do so when information commissioner Graham announced in September 2013 that his expert advisers were investigating the impact of Snowden's disclosures concerning mass internet surveillance on the privacy of UK citizens. Can anyone explain why the Mail would rather splash on the activities of an obscure Russian website rather than the fact that all our phone calls, emails and internet use are subject to systematic surveillance?"
