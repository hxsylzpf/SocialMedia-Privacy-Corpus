  "content": "A scam that tries to steal people's Facebook password details \u2013 using a website that mimics Facebook's login page \u2013 is spreading rapidly through the social networking site. The scam's emergence comes as a report shows that Facebook was the seventh most popular target of such \"phishing\" scams in March \u2013 although it is some distance behind PayPal and eBay, the two most popular targets, and banks such as Bank of America, HSBC and Alliance Bank. In the latest attack, messages that link to the website fbstarter.com or fbaction.net are \"phishing scams\", which take the user to a credible-looking website that is in fact a facade: like the buildings in a Western film, there's nothing behind them but a system recording the details that are supplied, enabling criminals to use them. Given a user's name and password, anyone can log in as that person, change their password and send on the same phishing message to the victim's friends. Taking control of the Facebook profile is a staging post. The overall purpose is to eventually send out links to malicious software that can take control of people's computers and compromise bank accounts and credit card details. \"I suspect that the initial attack vector was purely through forged email, but once accounts had been compromised, the attacks were launched through Facebook itself,\" said Adam Engst, who runs the news website TidBITS.com. He received one of the Facebook invites earlier today from \"someone ... I haven't otherwise spoken to in 25 years\". The message said \"Look at this!\" and linked to the fbstarter.com site. Facebook said today that it has blocked the fbaction.net link from being shared on its site, that it is removing messages that refer to the content, and that it is resetting the passwords of people whose accounts are sending links to that site on the basis that they have clearly been compromised. Facebook, which has more than 200 million users worldwide, has come under repeated attack from gangs trying to spread viruses and phishing scams through the network, taking advantage of the fact that people are more likely to click on links in on-site emails or messages that appear to come from their \"friends\" than they might with conventional email. The site was warned in March that it should vet potentially dangerous programs for malicious intent but Mark Zuckerberg, its founder, declined, saying that \"an open system anyone can participate in is generally better\". However, Facebook has had to struggle with the continued resurgence of the so-called \"Koobface\" virus, which has popped up repeatedly since last July. It sends out intriguing-sounding links to the friends of infected users; they are then tempted to a \"video\" page which instead infects their computer. With Koobface, only PCs running Microsoft Windows are at risk. However, the fbstarter websites can capture usernames and passwords from users of any sort of computer, because they rely on users themselves entering details.",
