  "content": "George Michael has led reaction to the closure of the News of the World among his pop star peers on Twitter. The singer tweeted yesterday: \"Hey boyz and girls, a message to my english fans in particular. Today is a fantastic day for Britain.\" In a series of tweets, he added: \"These beliefs are in no way an excuse for any of my behavior in recent times. I was happy to do my time, because I was so ashamed.But... I believe every individual, whether privileged or the average citizen, deserves the law. And many of us rich or poor have been denied it by News International.\" Later, the singer, 48, reiterated his earlier point by saying: \"Like I said, today is a FANTASTIC day for Britain.... XXX\" Other performers to react to News International's to bring the curtain down on the Sunday tabloid included Lily Allen, who tweeting under her married name, said yesterday: \"Rebekah Brooks must have something on the Murdochs, or she gave them a really nice christmas present.\" Mark Ronson compared News International's chief executive to the creative director of US Vogue, noting: \"Rebekah Brooks comes off a bit like grace coddington's amoral bizarro twin.\" Example, who has just enjoyed a No 1 UK hit with Changed the Way You Kiss Me, joked: \"The News of the World is being shut down?? How is Kerry Katona gonna feed her kids!?\" Similarly, CocknBullKid tweeted: \"Has #newsoftheworld really shut down? Dang. Really gonna miss the 'Fake Sheikh'. He was a personal fave.\" Emmy the Great told her folllowers she had called Tesco car insurance to ask about their advertising in the News of the World. \"The guy said, 'I don't know I'll Google it ...'\" she tweeted. \"Then he said, 'Oh it looks like we're doing nothing'. I asked him to raise a complaint on my behalf ... He did and 15 minutes later news broke about #NOTW closing down. So ... I guess he must have texted his bosses or something?\" Geoff Barrow of Portishead initially told his 3,212 followers: \"Ha James Murdoch // what a lying tit\" but then offered an apology (of sorts) to the chairman of News Corporation in Europe, adding: \"Sorry I meant that James Murdoch seems like a lovely well spoken young man, a credit to his father.\" Billy Bragg opined: \"Don't worry about NotW journalists. Everyone knows the unemployed get 5 room houses from council and \u00a350k a year in benefits.\" The singer subsequently reacted to one of his follower's complaints that he should be sticking up for workers who have lost their jobs with the comment \"just making a point about the tabloids constant lies about how cushy it is to be unemployed\"."
