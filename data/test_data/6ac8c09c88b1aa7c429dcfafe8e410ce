  "content": "How about this for a way to while away Friday afternoon? The top trending topic on Twitter at the moment is #lesserbooks \u2013 reworkings of titles that don't quite cut the mustard. And the tweeting masses are coming up with some properly comic suggestions. There are many variations on To Kill a Mockingbird (\"To Slightly Maim\", \"To Injure\") and The Great Gatsby (\"The Not-as-shite-as-you-think\", \"The Fairly Good\", \"The Pretty OK\") but I particularly liked: @johncarneyau's Zen and the Art of Unicycle Maintenance @HarryReginald's Things Stay Together @AdGilmour's If on a Winter's Night a Quiche And @yayforhome's Mr Correlli's Mandolin. There's a lot of Lord of the Earrings, but I think the best ones I've spotted, for sheer simplicity, are @Sonofalink's Of Mice, and @robertoallen's 1983. I've just been to scan my bookshelves and they've inspired me with A Hitchhiker's Guide to north London, As I Lay Slightly Unwell, The Year of the Leak, and The Golden Twig, but I'm hopeless at this kind of thing \u2013 if you're trying to distract yourself from the fact that the end of the day is still a couple of hours away, can you do any better?"
