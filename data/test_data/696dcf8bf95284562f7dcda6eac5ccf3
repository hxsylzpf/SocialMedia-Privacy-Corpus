  "content": "\u2022 A week after Facebook announced new privacy settings, it got more traction by urging its 350m users to actually, you know, set their privacy levels. But it got more than it bargained for in the process, since it turns out that the new default options give users no privacy to speak of. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has said the changes are clearly intended to push Facebook users to publicly share even more information that before, while ReadWriteWeb calls the language \"Orwellian\". \u2022 Remember when AOL and Time Warner got hitched back in 2000? It was a $350bn merger that left everybody agog - but after nearly 10 years locked in a difficult marriage, the two finally split yesterday. \u2022 It's the penultimate Technology Guardian ever, and we've got plenty of goodies for you. Our annual list of the 100 most useful websites is back, a column from Bruce Schneier, as well as an interview with Microsoft researcher Danah Boyd about the about the fallacy of the \"digital native\". Much more, as usual, with the Guardian today or online here. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
