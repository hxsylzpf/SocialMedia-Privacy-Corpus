  "content": "Media law specialists Carter-Ruck has obtained a legal injunction from the high court to protect popstar Lily Allen from harassment by two paparazzi agencies, Big Pictures and Matrix Photos. The move, under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, was made at the high court on Friday and followed an incident outside the singer's London home on Thursday in which a photographer's vehicle collided with her car. After the collision, photographers continued to follow Allen. At Friday's hearing in front of Mr Justice Eady, Carter-Ruck obtained undertakings from two photographic agencies, Big Pictures and Matrix Photos, and one photographer. Carter-Ruck also obtained an injunction \"restraining further harassment\" by other paparazzi photographers. Photographers covered by the order must not pursue or follow Allen by any means or approach her within 100 metres of her home. They are also forbidden from taking pictures of her in her home or the home of any members of her family or friends. Allen's lawyer, Mark Thomson, said: \"My client, Lily Allen has faced constant harassment over the last few months from the paparazzi. As a result of this and various incidents of harassment that took place in London on Thursday, my client has now been forced to take legal action. \"In a court hearing that took place on Friday afternoon, my client, Lily Allen, has resolved issues with two picture agencies and a photographer. She has also obtained from the high Court an injunction restraining further harassment of her by other unnamed paparazzi photographers. My client, Lily Allen, is delighted with the outcome of the hearing on Friday .\" In September last year, Carter-Ruck used the Press Complaints Commission to obtain an agreement from UK newspapers not to use photos of the actress Sienna Miller. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
