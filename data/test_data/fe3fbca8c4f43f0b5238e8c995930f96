  "content": "Age: Five. Appearance: A bottomless pit. A great, big sucking vacuum. A place of wailing and gnashing of teeth. One of those internet thingies, isn't it? Like Spacebook and Ends Reunited? A social networking site? Got it in one. To quote Rachel from Scarborough, \"Bebo is amazing, i love it! you can contact freinds, look at pictures, join groups, comment polls, do peoples blogss... i love bebo, im addictted!\" Spelling is so 20th century. But who's Rachel from Scarborough? One of the many young users on Bebo's testimonials page. Like ARi from Nyuu Jiirando (\"If Bebo was a girl, she'd be hot\") or Paigee from Southampton (\"omg im in lovee with bebo x\"). So who's doing the wailing and gnashing? Wall Street. Bebo used to be an internet success story: set up by two bright young things who met in a pub, blah. Tens of millions of users, blah blah. Web 2.0, blah blah blah. Then Michael and Xochi Birch sold up and it all went pear-shaped. That might be good enough for the FT, but could you be more specific? AOL, one of the oldest and stuffiest internet companies, paid $850m for Bebo in 2008. It has just offloaded it for an undisclosed amount. Undisclosed as in embarrassing? As in less than $10m, according to experts. The BBC calls the original purchase \"one of the worst deals ever made in the dotcom era\". What's the competition? News Corp paid $580m for MySpace in 2005, and recorded a $450m \"impairment charge\" in 2009. ITV bought Friends Reunited for \u00a3175m and sold it for just \u00a325m. Who owns Bebo now? An investment firm, Criterion Capital Partners. Did they get much for their money? Depends how you look at it. Bebo had more than 12 million visitors in April, but Facebook had almost 520 million. Still, as Bebo told its users: \"They are really cool people and what's more they are brilliant at taking companies like Bebo and making them even better!\" Do say: \"omg i lovee capitalism!\" Don't say: \"wtf?! MORE old fartz in suitsss?\""
