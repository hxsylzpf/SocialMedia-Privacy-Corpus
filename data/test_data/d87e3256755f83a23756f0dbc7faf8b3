  "content": "Homewares firm Habitat this summer provoked Twitter outrage when it used the #iranelection hashtag - which would normally alert users of the micro-blogging site to a message about the elections in Iran - to try to drum up interest in its wares. After apologising for the ruse, the company blamed it on an \"over-enthusiatic intern\". But how should brands use Twitter? And why is it so hard for them to understand the new medium? George Nimeh, managing director of marketing firm Iris Digital, said: \"Twitter is challenging for brands, because it is made for talks and chats, and their public relation language is very different. If they want to use Twitter, they have to learn to act different and sound human. \"There are some, who just use a popular hashtag and fire their message, and brands have to learn that this doesn't work. So the do is, be nice and talk to people like they are human beings. The don't, don't be an asshole.\" Steve Barton, a founding member of the Word of Mouth Marketing Association UK, said: \"The do is be honest and transparent. Don't lie and don't fake it. Make it, for example, transparent by whom your Twitter feed is managed on a certain day.\" Lloyd Davis, the founder of The Tuttle Club, a \"social media cafe\", said: \"The problem with Twitter is, if you make a mistake, you are fucked. Outrage happens overnight.\" Daren Forsyth, founder of community soclia media advisors 140 Characters, said: \"Twitter is a place where amazing things happen. But companies just pump their tweets out there, most of them don't engage. But you have to engage to build up trust \u2013 and trust is really important.\" Daljit Bhurji, the managing director of PR firm Diffusion, said: \"PR traditionally acted as the voice of clients. Now PR is a content generator. I think the Reuters rules for journalists are a good orientation to understand how you behave on social media.\" Ciaran Norris, the head of social media marketing at global media network Mindshare, said: \"The growth in Twitter has been exponential. It is a media zone. Twitter turns the ladder sideways - it made it so much easier to communicate with each other and with brands and to spread news. \"To understand what is going on, search is really important. In fact, the Google homepage is the homepage of your brand, because people use Google as a browser, now.\" There are some tools to help you learn what people are saying about your brand: \u2022 Cymfony is very good to search what people say about your brand. \u2022 ViralTracker is for tracking the viral spreading of video. \u2022 Delicious is good to find the tags of your brands. \u2022 Tweetdeck allows you to have a quick view of what is going on in Twitter on an individual level. \u2022 TweetFunnel allows multiple users to manage a simple Twitter account. \u2022 Tweetmeme tracks the links that were spread around Twitter. \u2022 Twitterfall is good to follow a certain topic. It is set up on the huge screen in the Daily Telegraph's office now."
