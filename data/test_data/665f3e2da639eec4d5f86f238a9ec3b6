  "content": "The al-Qaida terrorist network has been making preparations for potentially devastating attacks on America by hacking into computer networks to look for ways to disrupt electricity and telephone systems, dams and nuclear power stations, it was claimed yesterday. Government officials said the terrorist group appeared to be far more sophisticated than initially thought in its use of the internet as a weapon to disrupt America's web-based economy and cause potentially catastrophic physical damage by opening dam floodgates or blacking out air traffic control systems. US investigators tracing the footprints of al-Qaida members on the internet told yesterday's Washington Post that they have spent time on sites that not only provide hacking tips but offer software that helps users access supposedly secure networks and take over control of specialised digital switches used for remote control of public utilities. After September 11, US cyber-warfare experts also found that users on Saudi, Indonesian and Pakistani servers had been studying US computer systems governing emergency phone systems, power stations, dams, reservoirs, water pipelines, nuclear power plants and gas storage facilities. \"We were underestimating the amount of attention [al-Qaida was] paying to the internet,\" Roger Cressey, the chief of staff of the White House critical infrastructure protection board, told the Post. \"Al-Qaida spent more time mapping our vulnerabilities in cyberspace than we previously thought. The question is a question of when, not if.\" A computer found by American forces in one of al-Qaida's Kabul offices contained a virtual model of a dam, based on engineering software which allows the programmer to simulate a catastrophic breach. There was also software which could predict the course of floodwaters if a dam collapsed. Government officials did not say whether the al-Qaida programmers appeared to have a specific dam in mind. Dams have already been shown to be vulnerable to cyber attack. In 1998, a 12-year-old hacked into the computer system of the huge Roosevelt Dam on the Salt River in Arizona, apparently unaware that he could have opened the dam's floodgates. Any resulting flood would have swept through the cities of Mesa and Tempe, with a combined population of nearly a million, and threatened Phoenix. The defence of the country's civil internet networks is the task of the FBI's national infrastructure protection centre, set up in 1998. The Pentagon's cyber-defences are controlled by its space command, which established a computer network defence joint taskforce four years ago. The principal threats then were seen as China and Russia. But a CIA directorate of intelligence memorandum issued in February identified al-Qaida as a significant cyber-threat, saying that Osama bin Laden's organisation had shown \"far more interest\" in cyber-terrorism than previously thought."
