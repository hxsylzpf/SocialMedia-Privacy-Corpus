  "content": "Channel 4 News has crowned 17-year-old Louise Jones as Britain's best young blogger. Louise's Teen:Dreaming blog, was highly commended by a panel including Jon Snow, Krishnan Guru Murthy, Benjamin Cohen, Richard Bacon, Iain Dale, Vicky Taylor and yours truly. Essex-born Louise grabbed the attention of judges with her blogpost on how 9/11 and subsequent atrocities have affected her generation. Importantly, Louise blogged from the perspective of a 17-year-old \u2013 she didn't strive or struggle to be anything else, much to her credit. Here's the moment Louise found out \u2013 on the phone to Jon Snow: The engagement with news topics from teenagers often maligned as The Disinterested was inspiring, to be sure, as was the initiative of the entrants. Channel 4 News will host a week-long blog by Louise on how issues in the news affect young people. Her first post on the site, titled 9/11 and me, is now live. Hear what the judges thought of Louise's blog: Jon Snow said: \"Louise captured the world through a 17 year old's eyes. Her blog was funny, topical \u2013 but most importantly, it felt like her immediate reflections on the world around her \u2013 not an essay or a print article. I know she will be a brilliant addition to our site\u2013 and I look forward to asking her more tonight.\" Blogs by Reni Eddo-Lodge, Cory Hazelhurst and Jack Losh were also commended."
