  "content": "Social media use has exploded in recent years. While the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram might be overflowing with trivia, they can also be a rich resource for charities to tap into in order to raise funds and generate awareness. We are hosting a live debate on how charities can best use social media to reach out to the public. Whether it is by using Twitter to talk directly to your supporters like Stephen Sutton, sharing your insights by blogging, or by engaging with campaigns like #nomakeupselfie \u2013 there are so many ways charities can capitalise on social media. So how can charities best make use of the array of social media resources out there? Our live Q&amp;A will consider the following topics: \u2022 What the dos and don'ts of social media are. \u2022 How to decide which social media channel is right for your charity. \u2022 Top tips for social media success. \u2022 How best to engage with your audience and followers. \u2022 Tricks charities can use to maximise their impact. Join us on Friday 11 July from 12:00 \u2013 1.30pm to discuss these questions and more.
