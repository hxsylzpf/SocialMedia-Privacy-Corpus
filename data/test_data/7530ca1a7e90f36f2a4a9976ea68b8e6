  "content": "The New York Times extended the TimesPeople social networking features across the site last night, adding a layer of Digg-esque recommendation and rating to its news stories. It's a free service designed to encourage users to spend more time on the site and drive up the number of ad page views. Perhaps better for advertisers (particularly locally) is the review feature that shows user's ratings and reviews for restaurants, theatre, films and so on. Users can follow other NYTimes readers and add their updates and reviews to their network, very much in the manner of aggregated Twitter conversations. Each user has their own profile page. This as first launched as a Firefox browser plugin in June but now extends across the whole site; you'll see it in a 'share and discover tab on pages plus recommended articles are listed in the navigation bar. It will be interesting to see how that pans out. I'm not convinced there are really enough friends or contacts for any one person within one news brand, and perhaps not enough willing to use this kind of service. And any Twitter-style conversation aggregator needs volume to work - at least that way you can filter out all but the most useful information. There is some integration with Facebook though, and even more interestingly there's an RSS feed for each user's recommendations. An API is on the way, they say."
