  "content": "The French television series Hard, about a woman who inherits her husband's failing porn company, is to be remade by US network HBO. Hard, available in the UK on demand via Sky Arts, centres around a Catholic housewife who discovers her husband's secret life as a porn mogul after he dies \u2013 and has to carry it on when she faces financial difficulties. It ran from 2008-2011 with two series, starring Natacha Lindinger. Now HBO, the network behind hits like Game of Thrones and Boardwalk Empire, is shifting the action to Brentwood in California. Jenny Bicks, showrunner on hit Laura Linney cancer drama The Big C, is to head up the adaptation. She was also previously one of the writers of another big HBO hit, Sex and the City. Meanwhile HBO's current hit Girls is gearing up for its next series by joining social network du jour Snapchat, where users share images that disappear after a few seconds. Fans can subscribe to get sent images from the hit show, and have been sharing them via screengrabs on Twitter \u2013 in-jokes abound, such as Shoshanna's obscure use of emojis. The show returns to the UK on January 20 on Sky Atlantic."
