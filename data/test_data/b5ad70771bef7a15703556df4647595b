They can do no wrong, they can do no evil, and they have a large pile of cash,\" says the We Hate Technology site. Terminator fans already know where this one is going, and won't be disappointed: For a mere $300 million Google will be able to effectively purchase the infrastructure of the US internet and create the next network that the US will run on. After that I am sure they will move on to Europe and other counties. Everyone take the time to bow down to your new overlords and sign into the Google Skynet. OK, so you can worry about what Google might do, if it were technically possible, and if it showed a real inclination to do it. But if it comes down to a choice between Google and the control freaks running Hollywood studios, cable TV and telcos like SBC (below), then I'll take Google, thanks."
