  "content": "The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) has just launched a \u00a3544,000 advertising campaign telling businesses to get ready to use ID cards as a tool for vetting employees and customers. Sometime soon \u2013 we don't know how soon \u2013 a few actual cards might be issued to naive volunteers. You are unlikely to see one. But the object is to try and create an impression of inevitability, if not quite utility, for something no-one outside Whitehall wants or needs. Meanwhile a collection of organisations that know about information management, the public library services, create the perfect example of accreditation without tears. The Association of Chief Librarians (ACL) wishes you to know that you can take your current library card into any library in the country and it will lend you a book. No megalomaniac monitoring system. In fact no new computers at all. If your local library is happy to lend to you, and has given you a token to show it, then that is good enough for the others. This is laudably un-clever. We all do similar things every day. An introduction (tens of thousands of years usage), a cheque (centuries), and a credit card (decades), all use the same mechanism \u2013 transferred trust. We trust another person we don't yet know, on the recommendation of somebody we do. The idea of exchange of trust is so fundamental to human social interaction that most of the time we scarcely notice it. Fraudsters abuse it. But it is resilient, constantly renewed and is equally vital to markets, mutual aid and personal life. Because the exchange is limited to the context, we can control what we give away. The strange library gets only an assurance you are a reader, not a key to any other part of your life. In comparison to such simplicity, we have the ideas at the heart of the database state: that we cannot be trusted to trust each other; and that the best judge of who to trust is a hugely complicated administrative system that screens all information, watches everybody, and compulsorily mediates every relationship. Suspect everyone; trust only the system. The ACL are to be congratulated for not reinventing something older than the wheel. The IPS should be despised for trying to destroy it."
