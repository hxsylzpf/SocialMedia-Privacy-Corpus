  "content": "If Mario Savio, the student who led the freedom of speech movement at Berkeley in 1964, could see how years later his proteges at NYU and Harvard would come to test the very fabric of his argument with Facebook and Twitter, he might well have wondered if it was going to be worth the bother. Once again Twitter has made the headlines for all the wrong reasons after a student at Swansea University, Liam Stacey, was jailed for 56 days for posting racially aggravated comments relating to Fabrice Muamba. The prosecutor in the case said: \"We hope this case will serve as a warning to anyone who may think that comments made online are somehow beyond the law.\" If he'd have posted that on Twitter he may well have got through to his target audience. When Twitter really came to the fore a few years ago, I thought this new form of social media might go some way to bridging the divide between the players and supporters that I felt had been damaged after football went \"corporate\". To some extent it has but, like any new medium, there were always going to be problems, and it took a long time for our governing bodies to get their swollen heads around social media. I got the impression that the Football Association saw it, and still do, as a chance to cash in by imposing heavy fines, rather than offering any guidance. Eventually, the Professional Footballers' Association produced a booklet that was handed to players at the start of this season. As is often the case, it read like a man with a side parting had tried to \"get down\" with the kids. Personally, I enjoy using Twitter but my circumstances, for obvious reasons, are a little different. If I lose a football match, the abuse will stop the moment I get on the team bus and that's the way I like it. I am perfectly capable of feeling like shit without the help of others. But for those team-mates who enjoy having their egos stroked by the fans, the journey home gives them the unwelcome chance to feel the other edge of the sword. What I enjoy about my Twitter account is that people generally want to engage about football as a generic thing, rather than about my performance, my club or a specific team-mate. I don't mind criticism, of course, but I'm uncomfortable with people sending it to my home, via my laptop, whenever they like. Earlier this season, Ishmael Miller, the Nottingham Forest striker, tweeted: \"Listen, I don't wanna here anything bout I didn't look interested! Everyone can fuck off in [sic] don't like it don't follow me!\" which came in reply to some fans that had questioned his application in the previous match. When Steve Cotterill became Forest manager, his solution to Miller's tweet was simple: \"I had a rule at Portsmouth, that anyone using Twitter or Facebook was not allowed to talk about the football club, their team-mates or the supporters, otherwise they got fined \u00a31,000 a word. If someone wants to write a nice paragraph with 20 words in it, then it'll cost them about \u00a320,000 so I don't anticipate it happening again.\" Cotterill's comments are a prime example of a person who overreacts to something that they haven't the first clue about. What is wrong with talking about the club? And what is wrong with talking about the fans or your team\u2011mates? Just because Miller struck the wrong note doesn't mean everyone should be treated the same. Most of the derogatory comments made by players about their club are described as \"damaging\" but, in truth, are simply pointless. When Joey Barton was waging his own war against Newcastle through Twitter before his acrimonious departure, plenty of players, including me, were quietly hoping he would stop. Especially when he began to quote Nietzsche, a man who ended up talking to his dog (Nietzsche not Barton). But then Google, like Twitter, can be a dangerous tool in the wrong hands. Roger Johnson can attest to that, after his wife, Melissa Johnson (a self-proclaimed Wag) recently tweeted: \"Trying to understand why my hubbys on the bench right now #ridiculous.\" While that tweet will have been a source of embarrassment to Johnson, other players have found themselves in hot water because of their own stupidity. The Manchester United forward Federico Macheda, Newcastle's Nile Ranger, West Ham's Ravel Morrison and the Walsall player Manny Smith have all recently been fined after making homophobic comments on Twitter. It is this sort of behaviour that will prompt some clubs to believe that the best way to deal with Twitter is to take Cotterill's line and all but ban players from going on it in the first place. The reality is that policing social media is a struggle for many clubs who not so long ago felt they could control almost every word that came out of a player's mouth. Managers often vet interview requests and I've sat down with journalists with a press officer on my shoulder, vetting everything that is asked. Twitter has changed those rules and opened the floodgates. Savio did not live long enough to witness how the flaws in his vision for free speech would play out many years later. In his landmark speech he said: \"There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious \u2013 makes you so sick at heart \u2013 that you can't take part \u2026 And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all.\" Where Twitter is concerned, it's probably too late now.
