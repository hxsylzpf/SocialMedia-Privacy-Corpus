  "content": "Following last week's warnings about a serious security vulnerability in Flash, Adobe has posted version 10.1 of its player - which seems to fix the vulnerability. If you're using Flash (and that's pretty much everyone except you iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad users), then you should update. There's some explanation of how to do that too at Microsoft's Clubhouse (\"the place to have some fun by showing others what you know about Windows and to learn new tricks and tips every day\" - no exclamation mark included, apparently). There we note some of the sneakier stuff involved in getting you to update your system: \"If you use the Adobe Flash Player Download Center, be careful to UNCHECK the box shown below. It is not needed for the Flash Player update!\" Sneaky, that - trying to get you to install McAfee Security Scan Plus when all you actually want is an update of Flash.",
  "lead": "Last week's security warnings are obviated by the new download - but mind you don't get saddled with unwanted anti-virus on the way"
