  "content": "The Scotland Yard team investigating allegations that newspaper journalists bribed police officers to obtain information is to be expanded by half after four past and present Sun journalists were arrested just over a week ago. Sue Akers, a Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner, told the Leveson inquiry on Monday that the Operation Elveden team will increase from 40 police officers to 61 to deal with the extended scope of the investigation. It is running in parallel with the Met's phone-hacking investigation, Operation Weeting. Akers said the Elveden inquiry into alleged illegal payments by newspapers was important because \"if the public think that information is being leaked by police officers to journalists then it is inevitable that public confidence is eroded\". She added that there was \"very legitimate public interest in investigating this\". Updating Lord Justice Leveson on the status of the various Met investigations into alleged newspaper malpractice, Akers said that between June and December, the Elveden team had focused only on former News of the World journalists. She said the journalists that Elveden had focused on were \"reasonably senior\". However, that changed after News Corporation's inhouse management and standards committee handed over email information relating to journalists on the Sun, which the police then further analysed. That led to the arrest of four past and present Sun journalists on 28 January. The four were not named at the inquiry but are understood to be Mike Sullivan, the crime editor of the Sun; Chris Pharo, the head of news; Fergus Shanahan, the former deputy editor; and Graham Dudman, the former managing editor. Akers said the police also wanted to question a fifth unnamed journalist who is currently abroad. Operation Elveden has seen 14 people arrested, including three police officers, and a single arrest conducted by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Akers said it had proved harder to identify police officers as suspects because journalists did not reveal the names of their contacts in internal emails that the Elveden team had examined. Akers, who is overseeing all the Met's investigations into alleged illegal activity by newspapers, said her teams were progressing on the basis of \"voluntary disclosure\" by News Corp's management and standards committee. The police are not entitled to seek a warrant under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, compelling News Corp to supply certain specified evidence, because the company is assisting the police with their investigations. Akers also spoke of the progress of the Weeting phone-hacking inquiry, agreeing with the characterisation put to her by Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, that she was \"closer to the finishing line than the starting gun\". She said there were 829 likely phone-hacking victims as identified primarily from notes seized from Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator who was paid by News of the World between September 2001 and January 2007, the month he was first jailed for hacking offences. Of those, 581 individuals could be identified by name. A further 17 had not been contacted for \"operational reasons\". Akers also said there were a total of 6,349 potential victims in various evidence collated by the Weeting team, although only a small proportion of these could be identified as likely phone-hacking victims. The police had also dealt with 2,900 individuals who were either hacked or who had written to the Met thinking they may have been a victim of phone hacking. A total of 90 police are working on Operation Weeting, with 35 focused on dealing with victims. A third inquiry, Operation Tuleta, is examining allegations of computer hacking conducted by newspapers, and has 20 officers looking at 57 separate allegations of \"data intrusion\" going back to the late 1980s. Akers also provided a written witness statment to the Leveson inquiry, that revealed that names cropping up in Mulcaire's notes included one former Met police Commissioner, other News of the World journalists, as well as the politicians, members of the royal household, sports personalities and actors. She noted that Mulcaire noted the name of the News of the World contact who gave him tasks and his notes identify \"nine potential suspects\" according to the detective. Mulcaire was paid weekly by the News of the World at a rate that amounted to \u00a392,000 in 2001 and rose to \u00a3104,988 until he was dropped in January 2007 at the time he went to jail. Bonus payments were made on top. Akers added that while Mulcaire's contractual relationship with the News of the World was known, \"the part played by current suspects in making these arrangements was not\". The detective also said in her statement, dated 11 November, that Operation Weeting was investigating \"whether there may be evidence that some of the suspects engaged in similar phone hacking conduct while employed by other newspapers\" - although she added that at point, the inquiry was \"at a relatively early stage\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
