  "content": "A survey published by BDO shows that 98% of councils use some form of social media. But what is the best way to connect with residents online? Tom Hoy, senior policy officer at Lambeth council, argued that community engagement is most successful when combining the best features of the offline and online worlds. He says: Without an offline dimension to engagement you will often end up with a talking shop where nothing gets done. And with no online dimension you can find it difficult to connect, sustain and scale a community in a meaningful way. This workshop aims to debunk some of the myths around online engagement and look at the innovative ways councils can build strong relationships: \u2022 What are the different ways councils can get online? \u2022 How can we let residents know what's going on through social media? \u2022 How can technology improve service delivery? \u2022 What can we do to make sure residents who are not online don't feel excluded? Join our experts from 12pm-2pm June 12 to explore how to get your council connected. Our expert panel includes social media consultants and local government officers. Post your questions now or take part on the day. Expert panel: Jacob Leverett is from Surrey county council's shift team, which is looking for innovative ways to provide better services.
