  "content": "The pressure on the Obama administration's top intelligence official, James Clapper, increased Tuesday when a popular libertarian US senator said he had lied to Congress and suggested he consider his postion. \"The director of national intelligence, in March, did directly lie to Congress, which is against the law,\" said Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who is considering a 2016 run for president, on CNN Tuesday. On CNN, Paul came close to saying that Clapper, the director of national intelligence, should step down after Clapper misleadingly told the Senate intelligence committee in March that the National Security Agency did \"not wittingly\" collect data on Americans' communications. Paul said Clapper would not serve in any administration led by him. After the Guardian's disclosures that the NSA collects and stores for five years the phone records of millions of Americans, Clapper conceded he provided the \"least untruthful\" answer he could in a public forum. A US congressman, Justin Amash, has already urged Clapper to resign. Paul questioned whether Clapper could continue in his post, saying that he could not \"imagine how he would regain his credibility, when you lie\". The White House is standing by its intelligence director. Paul is one of the Senate's leading civil libertarians. He led a futile 2011 fight to scale back the Patriot Act and famously spoke for 13 straight hours on the Senate floor in March to protest the Obama administration's drone strikes on American citizens. After the Guardian published word of the phone-records collection this month, justified by the NSA under a section of the Patriot Act, Paul introduced a bill that would prevent the NSA from searching through Americans' phone data without a warrant based on probable cause. \"That I have to keep reintroducing the fourth amendment \u2013 and that a majority of senators keep voting against it \u2013 is a good reflection of the arrogance that dominates Washington,\" Paul wrote in a Guardian column on June 6. Paul has another effort to check the NSA surveillance in the works, one that is not reliant on legislation. He is actively recruiting Verizon, Sprint and AT&amp;T customers to join a class-action lawsuit against the carriers for delivering their data to the NSA. Paul claimed last week that he had 250,000 signatures for the lawsuit. At a Tuesday hearing before the House intelligence committee, General Keith Alexander, the NSA director, repeatedly pointed out that the telecommunications companies and internet service providers are \"compelled by the [Fisa] court\" to cooperate with the NSA, a likely line of defense for the companies in a prospective class-action lawsuit.",
