  "content": "A man entering an adult video store, his arms tucked behind his back; two women sunbathing in their front garden at Stanford University; a girl bending over the front seat of her van to reveal a black thong. All these and more have been captured by Street View, Google's most recent addition to its growing mapping application empire. So far launched in 27 American cities including New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, Street View allows users to swoop down to pedestrian level and view a 360-degree photographic panorama of the buildings, roads and unfortunate passers-by caught in the eye of Google's vans. The site has inspired hundreds of thousands of \"Street View Tourists\" who participate in scavenger hunts, \"celebrity crib spotting\" and post advice on where to spot the vans that take the pictures for it. Househunters, too, have been able to explore potential neighbourhoods for local restaurants, supermarkets and schools. But as bloggers trawl the site for the newest and most bizarre stills caught by Google's roving photographers, hundreds of Americans have complained, seeking to have more than just their faces removed. One couple, Aaron and Christine Boring of Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania, have sued, claiming that the panoramic pictures of their residence, on a private road, have caused them \"mental suffering\" and diminished the property's value. While Google does not preannounce its mapping strategy, it told the Guardian it will be focusing on \"major metropolitan areas\" and that it will \"leave it to the imagination\" whether London will be one of them. But although London has the dubious title of the most surveilled city in the world, and with more than 4.2m CCTV cameras in Britain, not everyone will welcome the Street View vans. Simon Davies, director of surveillance watchdog Privacy International, confirmed it would be taking legal action as soon as Google began any Street View operations in the UK. \"Google shouldn't be cavalier about that,\" Davies said. \"I would predict we could stop Street View with one complaint. But Google has a messiah complex.\" It's a strange embodiment for a messiah. Each Street View van has a roof camera, and photos - taken by 16 lenses - are stitched together to produce a 360-degree image. Immersive, the Canadian company that makes the Street Map cameras, says that while \"spherical video\" currently only collects photographic stills, its full-motion video capabilities could, in time, stream live footage. The latest version of Microsoft's Live Search Maps, a real-time satellite view, was launched last October, although it currently does not zoom close enough to capture people. Mapping the cost The vans map for five hours each day around noon; outside those times, the sun is too low in the sky to generate useful photos. (This may naturally limit how far into northern and southern latitudes at which Street View can be used.) At $45,000 (\u00a322,000) per camera, and anything between $125 and $700 per mile of video footage, Google's mapping venture does not come cheap. With such a huge investment already under way, Google has been keen to quieten its critics. \"Street View only features imagery taken on public property and is not real time,\" it said in a statement. \"This imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street.\" Both American and British privacy laws state that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in a public place. But recent CCTV guidelines, published by the Information Commissioner - which could apply to Street View - state that \"signs should be placed so that the public are aware that they are entering a zone which is covered by surveillance equipment\". This could prove impossible for Google's unmarked vans as they go about their task. Legal forecast: stormy In addition, under UK law, permission must be obtained before broadcasting images of private citizens. Google does have a service which allows unwitting \"Street View celebrities\", as they have become known in the blogosphere, to email requests to have themselves removed or their faces blurred. But Davies warns that publishing the images in the first place could be illegal. Worried pedestrians may also not know where to look for themselves. \"You don't think of where you walk to work every day or where you were Friday night,\" says Rebecca Jescke, spokesperson for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an internet civil rights group based in San Francisco. \"Under US law what Google is doing is legal, but it doesn't mean it is very polite.\" Street View has also raised national security concerns in the US. Last month, the Pentagon banned Google from making close-up images of military bases after it was revealed that pictures of the Fort Sam Houston army base in Texas included access control points and other potentially risky details. But other sorts of security may be at risk. After what appeared to be a drug deal in central Chicago was broadcast over several blogs, the offending images were immediately removed. Last year, Californian Mary Kalin-Casey caused disquiet when she commented to technology site Boing Boing that she could spy her own cat, Monty, through her apartment window: she said she could even tell it was a tabby. If American audiences are anything to go by, the complaints will be louder than the compliments. One result may be telling, though. The pictures of Aaron and Christine Borings' house have been removed from Street View. But will Britons choose to go down the same road?",
  "lead": "Is the latest addition to the search giant's mapping empire an infringement of our privacy or a public service?"
