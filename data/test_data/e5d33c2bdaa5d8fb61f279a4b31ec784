  "content": "This morning at the Convention on Modern Liberty, I launched NO2ID's request that everyone at the convention \u2013 and around the UK \u2013 tells their MP *right now* that they refuse their consent to having their information shared under any \"information sharing order\", a power currently being slipped onto the statute books in clause 152 of the coroners and justice bill . Please tell yours too. It's important, and urgent \u2013 and something that only YOU can do. If you never have before, now's the time to write to your MP \u2013 in a letter, or via www.WriteToThem.com. Jack Straw has been making noises that could signal a U-turn, but the only acceptable action is to remove clause 152 entirely from the bill. It is not linked to any other clause, despite being sandwiched between other powers and so-called safeguards offered to the information commissioner. It cannot be improved, and Straw can't be allowed to merely \"dilute\" it. Clause 152 just has to go. It's imperative that in coming days every MP hears from his or her constituents. Please tell them you refuse consent to having your information, taken for one purpose, arbitrarily used for any other purpose. And ask them to vote clause 152 off the bill. \u2022 Phil Booth is the national coordinator of NO2ID. See more on the convention and civil liberties at liberty central"
