  "content": "\"He leaves this court with not a single stain on his character.\" That was the judge's parting shot as John Leslie was cleared of sexual assault, signalling the end of yet another shambolic frolic by the police's self-styled \"celebrity squad\". Before stressing Leslie's innocence, the judge fired a few more shots across their bow, making clear his distaste towards some of the wider aspects in this case, criticising those that run to newspapers rather than report allegations and admonishing leaks by the police to newspapers. Not surprisingly, this case has reinvigorated those campaigning for reciprocal anonymity for defendants as well as victims. When one considers the terrible media frenzy that has attacked John's character over the last 10 months, it is easy to use his case as justification for a change in the law and a return to how it was in 1976, when victims and defendants had an equal right to anonymity. It is true that those sex crime \"defendants\" later proven to be innocent have grave difficulty in ridding their reputation of the ghost of the alleged offence, however unfair that is. As John knows, regardless of being proven innocent, he will still need the support of public opinion to get his life back on track. It is heartening, therefore, to see that three separate opinion polls found over 90% in favour of his return to our TV screens. Regardless of this, would anonymity have made things better? In John's case, I am not sure it would. The Ulrika Jonsson story broke, and was followed by newspaper hotlines \"touting\" for girls that had been a \"victim\" of Leslie. It was actually weeks before John was approached by the police and subsequently arrested. Hence, whatever happened thereafter, anonymity would not necessarily helped. His reputation was already in the spotlight and under attack. At present, the rules require the police not to name the defendant until he is charged. But even though the venue of John's first questioning with the police was a secret (certainly only John and his legal team knew from his side), when he emerged from the station he was swamped by media. Clearly, there had been a leak to the papers. Even if the initial stories had not been published, the press would have known his identity. Due to his \"celebrity\" it would only have been a matter of time before a similar Wrightesque slip occurred and John would have been identified with the case. The other route to unofficial identification is when the police do not name the suspect, but the words chosen and the way they are contextualised in the papers make it crystal clear who they are talking about. If the person is famous, the system breaks down and all pretence of anonymity goes. The proposed amendment to the law seeks anonymity for life for the defendant. In my world, any anonymity must stop once a jury pronounces guilt. Not just for reasons of \"open\" justice, but also for something deep down within me that requires \"a pound of flesh\", I find I could never advocate a guilty sex offender having anonymity for life. Baroness Helena Kennedy QC has suggested, like so many others, that the only acceptable movement on the present law would be to legally protect the defendant from being identified until charge. It is hard not to agree with this, but what happens if, as with John, literally one month after being charged, he was pronounced innocent? Within those few weeks the damage would have been done. So what about a medium ground, where all defendants receive anonymity from the outset - i.e. from arrest - until they are charged, but after that some discretion would be built into the system. Under my proposal, the anonymity would normally be dropped at first appearance in court, but the defendant could apply for it to continue due to \"special circumstances\". Certainly the courts, on a case-by-case basis, would be better placed to consider this question rather than a generic parliamentarian decision. Indeed, perhaps the very fact that the law on defendant anonymity has changed so much indicates the need for a flexible approach. Those who are staunch proponents of \"open justice\" would at least have their concerns waylaid in the event the defendant was later found guilty, if at that stage a \"special circumstance\" anonymity order would automatically expire. One should not forget that there are contempt laws which, if breached, could lead to an abuse of process and a cessation of the case for fear that the defendant could not get a fair trial. The laws are there, but they are not always used as stringently as they might. One hopes that as a result of EU human rights case law - which provides for a more \"objective\" approach and stresses that article six should not be subordinated to public policy - that a more fairer criminal process will be afforded to those who need it most. What ever happens with the bill before parliament, no amendment could have prevented the harm done to John Leslie. The present criminal system has failed to provide him the justice he deserves; that an innocent man should leave court without a blemish on his character. It seems that celebrity somehow intoxicates the criminal system; the problem is that we are getting all too used to its hangovers and its apologies for the night before.
