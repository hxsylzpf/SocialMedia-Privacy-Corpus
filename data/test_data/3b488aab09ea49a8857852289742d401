  "content": "After denouncing a lewd photograph sent through his Twitter account as the work of a hacker, Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner now says he \"maybe\" was the source of the bulging underpants. With Washington entranced by the mysterious case of \"Weiner's weiner\", quickly dubbed \"Weinergate\", the talkative New York City politician attempted to zip up the underwear affair. But a series of ill-tempered and evasive interviews left Weiner in an even more uncomfortable position. While Weiner maintains that the photograph was sent through his Twitter and Yfrog photo-sharing account to a young woman by unknown hackers, he stopped short of denying his involvement as the subject or creator of the crotch-shot. Asked if the photograph was of him, in an interview with NBC News, Weiner merely replied: \"You know, I can't say with certitude.\" Pressed for a denial, in the course of a rambling answer Weiner said: I will say that we're trying to figure out exactly what happened here. Whether a photograph was manipulated that was found in my account, whether something was dropped into my account, whether a photograph was partially my account, you know. Weiner previously had a verbal tussle with CNN when it asked a similar question, eventually calling one CNN journalist a \"jackass\" on camera. Later, talking to the New York Times, Weiner suggested \"there were elements of this photograph that might have been doctored,\" while in a later appearance on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show the congressman admitted: \"Maybe it started out being a photograph of mine,\" claiming that \"stuff gets manipulated\". The women sent the distasteful image \u2013 a 21-year-old student who had followed Weiner on Twitter \u2013 has denied any knowledge or other connection to Weiner. Weiner, one of New York's most high profile politicians and a possible contender for the city's mayoralty, is married to an aide to secretary of state Hillary Clinton. The Brooklyn and Queens representative says he has hired lawyers and private investigators to look at possible legal action but as yet has not contacted police. The affair of the well-filled underwear \u2013 first reported by the conservative news site Big Government \u2013 has been fodder for grateful comedians. Jon Stewart \u2013 a friend and former housemate of Weiner's \u2013 told his Daily Show audience: Seriously. No way! No way! In real life my memory is this cat had a lot more Anthony and a lot less Weiner. This is not what I remember. At this rate the scandal is becoming more than just a bad joke for Weiner. As NBC's Luke Russert told Weiner after one lengthy non-answer: \"But Congressman, you would remember if you were to take a photograph of yourself like that.\"",
