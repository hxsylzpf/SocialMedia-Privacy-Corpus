  "content": "Downing Street today backed away from a second complaint in as many months against the Spectator magazine, after it claimed that Tony Blair's children had been receiving private tuition. In an article in this week's edition of the rightwing weekly magazine, writer Rachel Johnson claims that Euan and Nicky Blair receive private \"cramming\" tuition in history and other subjects for their A-levels. Mr Blair's official spokesman this morning added fuel to the row, saying the prime minister would not give the magazine \"the satisfaction\" of another complaint to the press complaints commission. Last month Downing Street embarrassingly withdrew its complaints against the Spectator, the Mail on Sunday and the Evening Standard over claims that the prime minister's office had attempted to \"muscle in\" on the funeral of the Queen Mother. That backing-down was rumoured to be fuelled by fear of a \"smoking gun\" memo from Black Rod, the funeral's organiser, detailing calls from Downing Street discussing the prime minister's role. Today's row focuses on the even more sensitive subject of the Blair's children - already subject to several complaints in the past from Downing Street, over stories speculating on the children's choice of universities and careers. The Spectator details a \"private arrangement\" had seen the prime minister's sons getting extra help with A-level history and \"other subjects\". The disclosure that Mr Blair's children were having extra tuition even though their school, the London Oratory in Fulham is one of the best state schools in England was bound to provoke fury in Downing Street, which jealously guards the privacy of Mr Blair's family. The Spectator's Rachel Johnson wrote: \"It is perhaps no surprise to learn that I am one of the many, many parents who have resorted to top-up private lessons. \"But I know that it will come as more of a surprise to hear that the Blair boys have received private tuition in A-level history and other subjects to supplement their full-time education at the London Oratory, a selective Catholic comprehensive in Fulham. \"One or possibly more young male teachers at league-table-busting Westminster School in Dean's Yard, a cricket ball's throw away from Downing Street, have been traipsing in and out of the family flat, where Cherie keeps them supplied with attention-stimulating cups of coffee.\" She added: \"It is a private arrangement between the handful of tutors concerned and the family.\" A Downing Street spokesman issued the Spectator with a statement: \"The Blairs' children are entitled to carry out their schooling free from intrusion, and any issues relating to their education are entirely a matter for the family.\" This morning the the prime minister's offical spokesman said Mr Blair would not be referring the article to the PCC. \"Irrespective of what we say or do people will be looking to inflate this into some great story and we have no intention of doing that. \"In this particular instance I'm sure the Spectator would love it were we to do that and we don't plan to give them that satisfaction. We have been to the PCC in the past but you have got to make a judgment about these things.\" The spokesman said: \"It is for you and your editors to decide whether you wish to pursue a story about the children, about which we are making no comment. \"It is worth saying on behalf of the prime minister and Mrs Blair that they have valued the sensitivity which very large parts of the media have shown in relation to the children.\" Conservatives may fight shy of seizing on the claim, despite the fact that the Commons leader, Robin Cook, last week at prime minister's questions lambasted the Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, for sending one of his sons to Eton. Challenged about Mr Cook's comments the spokesman said: \"The leader of the house made his comments, standing in for the prime minister at prime minister's questions and in a political context he said what he said.\""
