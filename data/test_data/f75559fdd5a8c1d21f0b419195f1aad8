  "content": "\u2022 File this one under \"so ridiculous it sounds like it's made up\": two Australian girls trapped in a storm drain decided to call for help by changing their Facebook status, rather than phoning the police, reports ABC News. A fire service spokesman in Adelaide said he was concerned about \"relying on someone being online and replying to them and eventually having to call us via 000 anyway\". Too right. \u2022 With Apple's latest secret launch taking place tomorrow, AppleInsider is reporting that technical issues could delay the possible addition of a camera to many iPod models. A similar report by Hardmac, which it categorised as a rumour, suggests early iPod touch units with problems have been put aside. \u2022 Sad news, if you hadn't heard it, that O'Reilly Publishing's always-interesting Emerging Technology conference is no more. At this year's event, I noted things were unusually quiet - but it was actually a pretty interesting, varied program. I'm disappointed to see it go.
