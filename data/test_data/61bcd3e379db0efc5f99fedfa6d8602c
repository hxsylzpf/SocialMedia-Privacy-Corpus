  "content": "William Shatner An abiding rule of celebrity Twitter departure is that it's very rarely permanent. It's usually a little more permanent than Shatner's swearing-off, however. Quoting Lewis Carroll and the story of the Walrus and the Carpenter, the Star Trek star announced in March that \"after much deliberation\" he'd decided to retire his Twitter account. That was in the afternoon, UK time. Fans of the actor protested. (\"We need you here to light our lives,\" wrote one.) Then shortly after midnight: \"Boy did I make a mistake.\" Bill was back. Total time away: 10 hours. Lee Ryan \"Sorry I will never be on Twitter again,\" wrote the former boy-band singer in October 2012. \"I think this sight is actually wrong.\" Well, something there was wrong. But wonky spelling aside, Ryan had been pushed to breaking point. Going by his tweets at the time, Ryan got wobbly on a bottle of pinot, heard a rumour that his ex-girlfriend was about to sell him out to the tabloids, vented online and took flak from Twitter followers in return. \"No I've had enough of it!!!! I'm only a person!!!!... Fuck all of u wankers on here!!! This sight should be banned!!!\" Jonathan Agnew Aggers! Twitter lost the popular cricket commentator only last month, after a mucky tweet-based argument broke out when Agnew criticised Kevin Pietersen, and the cricketer's wife, Jessica Taylor, took Agnew to task online. People piled in from the sidelines. At one point, Agnew told Taylor to \"lose the attitude\". Then he signed off for good. \"This is not what Twitter was when I joined,\" wrote Agnew. \"I will now leave it to the bullies and trolls. Shame.\" The commentator had quit Twitter once before, in 2012, after squabbling online with one of the writers from The Thick of It, and it was a shame then too. Nicki Minaj Now this was an impressively worded exit. Minaj, in spring 2012: \"Deleting my Twitter... Don't cry for me Argentina. Like seriously, only so much a person can take. Good fucking bye!\" The US singer was initially thought to be upset about the leaking of tracks from her second album Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded. Minaj later explained that the reasons were more mystical and that \"a voice in my head\" told her to do it. In another interview she clarified: \"I just needed a moment to myself.\" The hiatus lasted about nine days. \"I'm here 2 stay,\" she wrote and so far that's proved true. Alec Baldwin A funeral, James Gandolfini's, prompted Baldwin's withdrawal from Twitter last summer. Baldwin later explained in an interview with Vanity Fair: \"I went to Jimmy Gandolfini's funeral, and when I was there I realised [he] didn't have Twitter\u2026 Gandolfini was so admired as a person, and as an actor, and he didn't give a fuck about social media.\" So, he says, he quit, calling Twitter \"a waste of time\". There was also the matter of a Twitter-based argument with the Daily Mail over said funeral \u2013 Baldwin furious the paper reported his wife had been tweeting during the service, and threatened to beat up the relevant journalist. Trent Reznor My favourite. The thoughtful Pennsylvanian musician (a one-man recording industry responsible for eight albums as Nine Inch Nails as well as several acclaimed film soundtracks, winning an Oscar for The Social Network) was just a bit too thoughtful for life on Twitter. He left, in 2009, with a damning farewell: \"The experiment seems to have yielded a result. Idiots rule.\" Was the impact of this social-media indictment undermined by Reznor's return to the service a week later? Maybe. \"I'll tweet if I feel like it,\" he wrote, when followers hassled him about it. Reznor remains active to this day. Miley Cyrus Which of Miley's de-Twitters to choose? The first, from October 2009, was one for connoisseurs, an inventive departure-by-rap in which the then-teenager explained her reasons for removing herself from social media. \"Yeah the rumours are true/ I deleted my Twitter,\" she rapped in a short video. \"Everything that I type/ and everything that I do/ All those lame gossip sites take it and they make it news/ I want my private life private.\" You probably recall Miley had a pretty busy few years after that, the private life not always private, and that somewhere along the line she took up tweeting again. Jeff Stelling The beloved Sky Sports presenter only had to go and do the decent thing and fall on his sword, last month, after getting involved in a Twitter-based ding-dong with the parent of a boy his son played football against. An argument broke out after a match. Was Stelling's boy a \"shit\" goalkeeper? Was it fair to criticise a 14-year-old online? The tweets quickly got angry after which Stelling, contrite, thought it best to abandon the service. \"Thanks for your support over last couple of years,\" he wrote to followers. \"Am closing account as I don't trust myself to respond to some people in the correct way.\" Chris Brown Brown didn't know who to blame, in 2009, when he couldn't find a copy of his new album Graffiti on the shelves of a Walmart supermarket in Connecticut. Assuming he'd been boycotted by the retailer due to his appalling public profile, he lashed out on Twitter. \"I'm tired of this shit. Major stores [are] blackballing my CD.\" When Walmart responded that it was stocking the record, and had simply sold out, there can't have seemed much else for it. Brown deleted his Twitter account. (He came back, of course, and has since quit on at least one more occasion, after a row with a standup comedian about how old he looked.) Deadmau5 Last year, the Canadian DJ decided to \"personally unplug myself from the very thing that's making me upset\": Twitter. In an online statement about his departure, Deadmau5, real name Joel Zimmerman, directed an oblique attack at \"Lady Gaga's infinite legion of braindead fans\" who he'd previously clashed with on Twitter, but insisted he was leaving for \"reasons of my own\". The DJ went on: \"Time to start [...] living in the studio making music without having to be force-fed stupid shit that annoys me when all I'm trying to do is connect with fans.\" The account lingered on under the control of his management for a few months before being abandoned.",
