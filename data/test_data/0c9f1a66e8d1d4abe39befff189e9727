  "content": "I find social media utterly invigorating. I've become slightly obsessed about it because I sit there when a show is on and watch Twitter because it is such an instant feedback about how audiences, and particularly young audiences, are engaging with what we're doing at Channel 4. It's become an incredibly important part of what we're doing, particularly with shows that are skewed towards a younger audience. I think we should regard it as a tool, particularly for younger people to see what they are passionate about, that gives us an idea of what things are going to cut through.  And social media is fantastically useful to get a steer on the direction of travel for particular shows. So we're talking about a lot of social media in Hollyoaks, for the fairly obvious reason that it is popular among a younger audience familiar with social media. I think it adds a whole new layer to the viewer experience and we are using it in different ways, partly to get viewer feedback and partly to build viewer loyalty.   I think there has been a tipping point where people said this is not future media, this is now. Using multiplatform and social media for a programme is about a better viewing experience. Something like the Embarrassing Bodies Health Checker was an extraordinary (online) tool for a whole variety of individuals (700,000 registered). Coming up, we have an ambition with (new show) The Food Hospital of having a huge database that looks at how someone can change common medical conditions based on diet. That is about using the web as a massive scientific resource out of which we hope we can have a piece of data that could actually change the way people deal with common complaints. That is a colossal target and we start from the position of being very ambitious for the web stage of the project. This article was produced in association with Crossover Labs and Sheffield Doc/Fest",
