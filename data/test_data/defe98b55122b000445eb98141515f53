  "content": "Why has News UK suddenly become so shy? For 17 years a website called Paperboy.com has provided an excellent service each day by showing the front pages of newspapers across the world. Suddenly, however, three British titles have vanished because Rupert Murdoch's News UK has served the site with take-down notice, demanding that it no longer carries the front pages of the Times, Sunday Times and the Sun. The Australian-based newspaper directory website has responded by posting a notice saying: \"It sucks. Please complain to Rupert.\" I understand why the publisher may feel it breaches its copyright. But it also reduces its papers' visibility and, with declining sales, that doesn't seem such a good wheeze. It's free publicity, after all. I also note that the pages do feature regularly on other sites, such as the BBC and Sky News, as well as being shown each night on screen on both broadcasters' paper preview programmes. I understand that News UK took action because Paperboy.com lacks a commercial licence (which the BBC and Sky do have). But why now after so many years? I have asked News UK why and await a reply. Meanwhile, note something else: the Sun has stopped putting its full front page up on its website. I couldn't find tweets of its front page either, but I was mistaken (see here). And they are also shown on the paper's Facebook page. I have also been told of problems subscribers are having with the Sun's iPad edition, which requires users to sign in every time they want to look at the paper. A user told me: \"When I do sign in, it invariably brings up a note that says, 'You are still logged in on another device [which I'm not] and have now reached the maximum number of logins. One of your previous sessions will now be closed.'\" Worse still, she says, there are other functional problems. I imagine these are teething troubles and I'll pass on her problems to News UK, which may be unaware of them. It still doesn't explain why the company should be so protective of the best adverts they have - their front pages."
