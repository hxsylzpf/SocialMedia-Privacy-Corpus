  "content": "When two penniless environmental activists, David Morris and Helen Steel, were sued for libel by the fast-food giant McDonald's, the 313-day trial turned into the longest court case in English legal history. Yesterday, seven years after the action ended in 1997, they took their case to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg to argue that English libel law and the lack of legal aid for defamation cases - which forced them to represent themselves against a global corporation - denied them the right to free speech and a fair hearing. This time, though, their case, brought against the UK government for breaching the European convention on human rights, was over in little more than two hours, though they will have to wait several months for judgment. For this battle, they had legal aid from the Strasbourg court and a lawyer to put their case. Keir Starmer QC, representing the McLibel Two, told the Strasbourg judges: \"This case is about the rights of two ordinary people without power or wealth to engage in a public campaign on matters of public interest and importance.\" He said English libel law breached the human rights convention because of the stark inequality between ordinary individuals and a massive corporation. McDonald's employed the most expensive lawyers and deployed all the resources of a multinational, while Ms Steel and Mr Morris struggled to argue their case without legal aid or the money to buy the legal expertise they required. Ms Steel, 39, and Mr Morris, 50, were sued by McDonald's for handing out leaflets, which they did not write, titled: \"What's wrong with Mc-Donald's?\" The high court in London ruled that McDonald's had been libelled, and awarded the company \u00a360,000 in damages, later reduced to \u00a340,000 on appeal, which was never paid. The case turned into an expensive public relations disaster for McDonald's when the judge also ruled that the leaflet had correctly accused the corporation of paying low wages, being responsible for cruelty to some of the animals used in its products and exploiting children in advertising campaigns. Mr Starmer told the Strasbourg judges that English defamation law was heavily weighted against the defendants, who had to establish the truth of every statement in the leaflet. This differed from libel law elsewhere. The inequality between the opponents \"could not have been starker\", he said. When the McLibel trial began in 1994, global McDonald's sales were valued at about $18.75bn (\u00a310bn), rising to about $30bn (\u00a316bn) by the end of 1995. \"By way of contrast, during the same period, Ms Steel's maximum income was \u00a365 a week when she was employed as a part-time bar worker, and Mr Morris, a single parent, was unwaged and entirely dependent on income support. The result was that, without legal assistance, the case was under-prepared, unready for trial and was advanced by two inexperienced, untrained and exhausted individuals who were pushed to their physical and mental limits. In short, it was patently unfair.\" Mr Starmer said that to require strict proof of anything contained in social campaign literature \"strikes at the very heart of pluralism, which is the hallmark of democracy\". Philip Sales, for the government, told the judges that the fact that the pair lost their libel battle was not evidence that they had been let down by English libel law or by rules on assistance and access to justice. \"They were given every possible latitude in the presentation of their case.\" he said. \"Indeed, the trial judge went out of his way to a quite extraordinary degree.\" He said campaigning organisations should not be permitted to engage in \"one-sided campaigns of vilification\" beyond the limits of the libel laws which applied to others. Afterwards Mr Morris said he was satisfied with the hearing, claiming the government had been forced to acknowledge that legal aid could be made available for libel cases in exceptional circumstances."
