  "content": "According to the Sun, One Direction is to go their separate ways in March after the release of their fifth album. Sources told the paper the band would break for a year to work on lucrative solo projects. In the grand tradition of band breakups, countless people have predicted a social media meltdown when One Direction eventually go their separate ways. Naturally, the fans had plenty to say about it. Often belittled as hysterical teenage schoolgirls with nothing better to do, anyone who spends enough time on Twitter knows One Direction have some of the wittiest and most internet-savvy fans around. Harry falls over onstage? They make it a trending topic with a plethora of photoshops within hours. Erstwhile member Zayn Malik has some Twitter beef? The jokes about framing the exchange are up within minutes. Of course, there were fans who were disappointed: But some pointed out perhaps the boys do need a breather: Others were confused: Some saw the funny side: But many of them don't seem to be taking the reports seriously \u2013 at least until one of the band members tweets about it. In fact, some of the strongest reactions seem to come from people who hate One Direction for one reason or another. The hashtag #OneDirectionIsBreakingUpParty began to gain traction as the reports were published, started by an account which seemed to be authored by a Justin Bieber fan. But it was soon flooded with fans either mocking the reports: Or pointing out the band is reportedly taking a break rather than breaking up for good. Fortunately for those who were feeling devastated by the news, there were those with advice on hand, from people who dealt with 90s boyband breakups. Or those who managed to bring Jeremy Corbyn into it, pointing out they featured in a Daily Mail piece about an apocalyptic Britain under his leadership. There's always a silver lining! So far, there has been no word from the band over whether the reports are true or not. A 1D spokesman said: \"We don't comment on speculation.\""
