  "content": "Jonathan Freedland is wrong to refer interchangeably to the NHS and doctors, not least because of the general loss of public trust in institutions he describes. The headline on his article (We trust no one with our data \u2013 not even our doctors, 1 February) is ironically inaccurate. Hitherto the public could trust their GPs to look after the personal information they hold about them. The leaflet that Freedland says explains to the public the new care.data project doesn't even refer to it by name. Nor is NHS England mentioned, despite it being the organisation responsible for the programme and the leaflet. The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), the body actually harvesting patient information from GPs, isn't even identified. With the NHS logo at the start and finish, the leaflet explains what \"we\" will do with patient health records \u2013 without saying anywhere who \"we\" are. The woeful lack of clarity does not engender confidence and trust. It's not enough to hide behind the NHS logo. Dr Alex May Manchester \u2022\u2008Better collective population health data for research purposes is commendable. The sale of identifiable individual confidential information is not. Some people may want to support the first and opt out of the second being used for purposes for which they have not given explicit consent. Whatever the assurances in the NHS leaflet, in the details available online (www.hscic.gov.uk), the government makes no secret of its intentions to sell whatever data the commercial market wants to buy. The table of HSCIC data linkage and extract service charges 2013/14 includes prices for selling identifiable personal data, specifically a \"one-off extract tailored to the customer's requirements of specified data fields containing patient identifiable data, sensitive data items or both\". This has nothing to do with sharing medical information about ourselves so that we can be treated wherever we are in the NHS, which will continue. Human fallibility being well evidenced and in spite of political assurances about data security (trustworthy after Snowden?), many of us will want to opt out of allowing our personal information to be offered for sale in this way. John Veit-Wilson Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022\u2008The day after your front-page lead (Patient records to be sold from NHS database, 20 January) I received the NHS leaflet on the subject. This simultaneously declares that \"Information that we publish will never identify a particular person\" and, on the next page, \"If you do not want information that identifies you to be shared outside your GP practice, ask the practice to make a note of this.\" Why do I not find this reassuring? Edwina Rowling Ditchling Sussex \u2022\u2008Following the Guardian's coverage, I checked the NHS leaflet for details on opting out. As there was no reference to deadlines on it, I rang the patient information line and was told that I had four weeks from the time I received the leaflet. Records would be included in the system on a postcode basis from spring. I wonder what possible reasons there may have been for omitting this? Christine Saunders Hampton, London \u2022\u2008While data extracted under the clinical practice research datalink (CPRD) might well be completely anonymised, the data extracted and uploaded to the HSCIC by the care.\u200cdata project is most certainly not (Sharing NHS medical records will be vital for improving healthcare, 24 January, theguardian.com). It is identifiable data, is kept by the HSCIC as such, and can therefore be disseminated to organisations, both research and non-research, in anonymised, pseudonymised and clearly identifiable formats. Patients have no say in which aspects of their uploaded data, when, to whom or for what reason their data will be given to organisations. Dr John Parkinson talks about needing \"every GP to allow their practice to join the system\". CPRD is voluntary. The care.\u200cdata project is compulsory \u2013 practices cannot refuse to upload patients' sensitive data, because the Health and Social Care Act compels them to. Choice, either for the surgery or for their patients, plays no part in care.data \u2013 the decision has been made for them. All patients have is the right to object and to reverse that decision \u2013 to take back control of their medical records. Dr Neil Bhatia GP in Hampshire and author of the website www.care-data.info"
