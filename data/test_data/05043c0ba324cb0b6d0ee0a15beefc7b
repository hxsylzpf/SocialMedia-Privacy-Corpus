  "content": "Catching up with friends on Facebook. Photographer: Chris Jackson/Getty Images Be honest, is Facebook open on your desktop right now? Have you checked your wall today? Added any new friends? If so, you are one of 49 million regular users who have helped to make the social networking site into one of the most expensive internet start-ups in history, with a valuation of $15bn. The valuation was made alongside Microsoft's purchase of a $240m minority stake, which will entitle the company to exclusive advertising sales rights on Facebook. Most users have only been able to use the site for a year and it currently has little revenue-raising content, so is it really worth so much money? A wisely declined takeover bid from Yahoo! valued the company at just $1bn a year ago and its closest social networking rival, MySpace sold to News Corporation for a - relatively speaking - puny $580m. But with social networking thought to be in its infancy, and a bright future promised ahead, Microsoft's estimate might not be overly optimistic. Facebook may be invaluable to many of us, as we while away the hours tagging embarrassing photos and poking our chums, but is it really worth $15bn?"
