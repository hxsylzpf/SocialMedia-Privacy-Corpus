  "content": "Press watchdogs have ruled that the Daily Mirror did not breach the PCC's code of conduct by printing the office phone number of Steve Bing, the millionaire who has denied paternity of Elizabeth Hurley's baby. The Mirror's decision to publish Bing's office number could not have breached his privacy, because it was already in the public domain, the commission said. And, in what is bound to be interpreted as a rebuke to Bing, the commission pointedly added that press interest in the film producer - who was vilified when he denied paternity of Hurley's son - was \"inevitable\". The PCC said it \"could not ignore the fact that [Bing's phone number] had been published in relevant telephone directories and was therefore widely available to the public.\" \"While there may be circumstances in which the publication of a telephone number might be considered to be a breach of the code,\" the statement said, \"the commission noted that in this case the telephone number was for the general switchboard at the complainant's company and not for his personal office, mobile or home telephone.\" \"He had been involved in a high-profile relationship with a famous actress and had subsequently publicly argued with her about the paternity of her child,\" the statement said. \"In the commission's view, scrutiny by the press in these circumstances was inevitable.\""
