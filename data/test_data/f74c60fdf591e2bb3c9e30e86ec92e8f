  "content": "A \"talking\" dog has topped the list of the most-watched YouTube videos of the year in a top 10 that also includes a spoof of Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding, a Britain's Got Talent audition and two babies talking gibberish to each other. The dog clip, in which the animal appears to tell his owner \"You're kidding me!\" after he is told his dinner has been fed to the cat, was the most watched YouTube clip in the UK in 2011. It beat a viral ad by mobile phone operator T-Mobile, in which guests at a spoof royal wedding dance their way down the aisle, into second place, followed by a mash-up of interviews by Hollywood actor Charlie Sheen talking about his troubled departure from hit sitcom Two and a Half Men. IT engineer Michael Collings's memorable audition on ITV1's Britain's Got Talent in which he sang Tracey Chapman's Fast Car, makes it to number five on the list. Another TV programme, MasterChef, makes it into the top 10, with a musical compilation of comments by presenters Gregg Wallace and John Torode which makes an unlikely chorus out of \"I like buttery biscuit base\". Also in the top 10 is a spoof of teenage singer Rebecca Black's video for Friday, Nyan Cat, an animation of a cat flying through the air, and \"Talking Twin Babies\" in which 18-month-old twins do exactly that. But only they appear to know what they are saying to each other. YouTube trends manager Kevin Allocca said: \"The 10 most-watched YouTube videos of 2011 show that around the world, whatever language we speak, there are certain things that bring us all together around a computer screen or mobile phone \u2013 adorable babies, talented performers and clever advertising.\" Plus, he omitted to add, a universal desire to waste five minutes online when in all probability we really should be doing something else.
