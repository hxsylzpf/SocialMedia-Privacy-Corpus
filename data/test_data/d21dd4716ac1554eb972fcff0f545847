  "content": "Yesterday the European court of justice (pdf) ruled that the EU directive on the mandatory retention of communications data had been adopted on the correct legal basis under mainstream community law and not \"third pillar\" justice and home affairs rules, which the Irish government had argued. The court said the measure affected the internal market as it makes it obligatory for communication service providers to hold communication data (on all landline phone calls, emails, faxes, mobile calls \u2013 including location \u2013 and internet usage) for up to two years and to make it available to law-enforcement agencies. Interestingly the court made a point of noting that the Irish case only covered the legal basis of the directive, not fundamental rights and privacy. Bearing in mind the recent scathing judgment of the European court of human rights on the keeping of DNA and fingerprints (pdf) of people not charged with any offence, a measure involving the keeping of records of all the communications of everyone living in the EU might get equally short shrift. People may be aware of the debate in the UK over access to communications data under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, but are less familiar with the role the UK government has played in the EU, where it first proposed mandatory data retention, backed by France, Ireland and Sweden, in April 2004. The final stages of its passage through the EU came under the UK presidency of the council, and their officials crawled all over the European parliament to get it passed. Despite widespread opposition from more than 200 civil society groups, the EU data protection commissioners and many in the parliament organised an alliance of the PSE (Socialist group, of which they are part) and the centre-right PPE (Conservative group) to steamroller it through in December 2005. The mandatory retention of all communications data \u2013 together with mandatory finger-printing (biometrics) for EU travel documents \u2013 were two of the 43 demands put to the EU by the former US president, George W Bush, in the weeks following 11 September 2001. On both counts, the EU has complied even though Bush never dared to put forward the same proposals in the US. We have good reason to be very critical of the authoritarian direction the government has taken at home, but we should be equally vigilant of what the UK government gets up to in the EU \u2013 and at the same time wake up to the fact that many of the threats to our freedoms and liberties now originate from the EU. Indeed, the surveillance society, which makes suspects of us all, is to be the centrepiece of the next five-year plan for EU justice and home affairs to be adopted later this year (pdf)."
