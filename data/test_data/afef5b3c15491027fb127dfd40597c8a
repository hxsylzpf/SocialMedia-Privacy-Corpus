  "content": "Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas have won \u00a314,600 in damages from Hello! magazine, which published unauthorised pictures of their wedding. Its rival OK! magazine, which had an exclusive deal to cover the Hollywood couple's marriage in November 2000 in New York,was awarded \u00a31,033,156 in damages by the judge, Mr Justice Lindsay. Northern &amp; Shell, the owner of OK!, was seeking \u00a31.75m damages, while Douglas and Zeta Jones asked for \u00a3500,000 in commercial damages plus \u00a350,000 each for personal distress. At a hearing in July Alastair Wilson QC, representing the Douglases and OK!, argued his clients should be awarded a \"very substantial figure\" to demonstrate that Hello! was in the wrong when it published sneaked paparazzi shots of the wedding ceremony at the New York Plaza hotel. During a six-week hearing at the high court earlier this year, which cost more than \u00a33m in legal fees, Zeta Jones said she felt \"devastated, shocked and appalled\" when she learned that, despite careful security precautions, a paparazzi photographer had infiltrated her wedding. Zeta Jones and Douglas claimed victory when Mr Justice Lindsay ruled in April that Hello! had breached their right of confidence. The Douglases had sold the rights to their wedding pictures to OK! for \u00a31m but before the celebrity magazine came out blurred, snatched pictures from inside the Plaza hotel emerged in the rival title. British photographer Rupert Thorpe gained access to the event and took photographs he later sold via an intermediary to Hello! for \u00a3125,000. In his judgment in April, Mr Justice Lindsay said he had no doubt the couple suffered \"real personal distress\" and said the Hello! snaps constituted an unjustified intrusion into the private lives of individuals. The fact the couple were famous had no bearing on the case, the judge said. He made it clear, however, his decision was not made on the grounds of privacy, but was based on commercial confidentiality. Mr Justice Lindsay dismissed nine other claims against Hello!, including the charge the magazine had conspired or commissioned the snatched photos, or had intended to damage the Douglases. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"
