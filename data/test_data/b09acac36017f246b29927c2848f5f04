  "content": "Groupon has set a price for its long-awaited initial public offering, valuing itself at $11.4bn (\u00a37.2bn), in what will be the largest social media float since professional networking site LinkedIn's May debut. A prospectus filed with the securities and exchange commission shows the Chicago company will offer 30m shares on Nasdaq, representing 4.7% of its total equity, at between $16 and $18. At the higher price, the float should raise $540m. Groupon will meet investors next week to gauge demand, and the offer price should be finalised on 3 November following a two-week roadshow. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse are lead underwriters. The price has been revised down from the $750m Groupon said it hoped to raise in a June prospectus . The company, which sends subscribers a daily email detailing discounted goods and services based on their location and personal preferences, postponed plans for a summer listing after the European debt crisis triggered stock market crashes. The company reported revenue of $430.2m in the three months to the end of September, according to information published on Friday, with quarter-on-quarter revenue growth slowing from 33% in June to 9.6% in the past three months. However operating losses have narrowed, from $101m in the three months to June, to $239,000 in the most recent quarter. The improvement was due to lower marketing expenses in North America, the company said. The last time Groupon reported a quarterly operating profit was in March 2010. The listing will be closely watched by Facebook and games network Zynga, which are considering when to tap the capital markets. Max Wolff at adviser Greencrest Capital said Groupon had become a \"battleground\" for social media fans and critics: \"We still believe the decision to price the offering and start the roadshow will not do much to push back the voices saying they are running out of money.\" Professional networking site LinkedIn raised $353m when it became the first major social media company to list on Wall Street. The float of less than 10% of its total stock valued the company at $4.25bn. LinkedIn shares are currently trading at $86, well above their $45 offer price."
