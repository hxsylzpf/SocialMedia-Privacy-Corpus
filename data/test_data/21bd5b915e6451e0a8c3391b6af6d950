  "content": "A lot of blather is talked about the web, some of which will soon look as foolish as a 60s hippy in a Himalayan ashram moaning \"don't get heavy, man\". The web is not a higher plane of consciousness liberated from exhausted old morality. It's just another life-changing invention that will take time to develop civilised rules of its own. We haven't got them yet, but we cannot stop them coming. All human creations become part of a culture in which we know right from wrong. It happened with another device for rapid communication: motorways. When the first stretch of the M6 opened in 1958 there weren't any speed limits. Hooray! \u2013 for a bit. You could drive as you liked. Cyclists were spotted using the inside lane. Drivers stopped for picnics. People turned around by crossing the central reservation. It seemed to be freedom: a form of travel unrestrained by tradition and the law. This wonderful pretence of liberty lasted for just as long as it took motorways to become important. They could either be quirky and unregulated or they could be essential, but not both. The current fuss over the microblogging site Twitter is a small reminder that the internet is nearing its speed limit stage. Last week a Tory councillor in Birmingham was arrested for declaring that he wanted the columnist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown stoned to death. Another man appealed and lost after being convicted under a 1930s law governing telephone abuse for declaring to his 600 followers that he wanted to blow up his local airport. These people were muttering empty absurdities, but not to themselves. They have been caught in the half-light between the personal and the public. The law comes out of this looking foolish, and Alibhai-Brown excessively upset, but that can't mean anything is acceptable on Twitter. A civil servant found herself exposed for posting messages, some bad-mouthing ministers: she felt secure in doing something online that she'd never do in print. The very word Twitter suggests inconsequentiality. But the majority of people who have not gone near the site \u2013 police officers and lawyers included \u2013 will have no idea at all of the unspoken assumptions that already surround it; the idea that short comments are part of a casual collective opinion, not profound individual expression. Twitter is made up of transient chatter. The attraction is its claim to informality. Stripped of authority and hierarchy, Ed Balls feels able to tell people he had pizza last weekend and every MP I follow seemed moved both by their local remembrance day service and their constituency football team's results. Just like comments I have made online, on a Twitter screen they seemed to fit in. But rereading them out of context, they mostly look trite. The inordinate ease of communication is breaking down barriers that may be valuable, and leading to a sometimes false sense of access to knowledge. Our culture of reserve is a delicate and intricate structure, containing chinese walls set up by custom. Tearing them down is not necessarily good. It might be compared with a scientific advance that, overnight, allowed humans to know what other humans were thinking. This would undeniably be a huge step forward for knowledge and communication. It would also devastate civilisation. Civilisation emerges through the suppression of immediate instincts. We don't just blurt out our first thoughts in any context. We say and do different things in different places. What we may publish in society about others is not constrained by statute alone. Our general sense of what's within and what's beyond bounds acts to constrain writing, and to inform editors. It also informs the law, where courts have to interpret the ordinary meaning of phrases such as \"fair comment\", \"public interest\" and \"gratuitous\". This general sense of appropriateness has built up over centuries, and to some extent we take it in with our mother's milk. It's a subtle thing, offering varying degrees of strictness according to the circumstances. A book, a daily newspaper, a live broadcast, a prerecorded broadcast, a shock-jock and his callers \u2013 all attract different levels of constraint. But the internet has arrived so suddenly and blogging built up so fast that we are all at sea. People genuinely don't know the rules, there being none. We can't guess where this will end, only that the skirmishes have only just begun. Twitter, Facebook, Google: none of these will exist for long in their current form. Until some settled outcome is arrived at, we won't agree codes of behaviour: but the internet is already ossifying. Companies such as Apple are building barriers around their online worlds. The police are bamboozled by Twitter. Private firms will seek to impose order where the state cannot: but we must impose it on ourselves. There will a place for law in all this, but it will have to follow rather than precede the development of a general consensus on what's acceptable. Cultural norms come first, and the state follows, backing them. Like blogging itself, these norms will have to be established bottom-up, rather than top-down. Alibhai-Brown and her abuser, or that airport-threat miscreant and his critics, are all, in a sense, pioneers in the establishment of unspoken codes, fighting it out along a disputed frontier."
