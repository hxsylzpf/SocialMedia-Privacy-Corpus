  "content": "The Leader of the House of Lords, a former senior judge, has moved to allay press fears about curbs on freedom of speech under the Human Rights Act. Judges are much more alert to the needs of the press and the importance of free speech than ever, Lord Mostyn said during a press lunch in the House of Lords. \"If you look at decisions now, you will find that Article 10 [the clause of the act that focuses on freedom of speech] is firmly in the forefront of judicial thinking,\" said Lord Mostyn. Lord Williams said the Human Rights Act had been described as a \"subtle, elegant and typically British solution\" because it was capable of bestowing rights and responsibilities. \"Article 10 is interesting because it's not just your life that matters, it's mine as well... it's not just the press's right to publish, it's the citizen's right to be informed and misinformed, with opinions the citizen may or may not agree with,\" he said. \"I don't believe there is anything other than a creative tension between the different rights which are placed in our law for our judges to decide on.\" \"It is possible to conclude that the press is sometimes its own worst enemy with its over-concentration on trivia.\" Lord Mostyn also said he believed libel cases had declined since their zenith in the late 80s, when huge damages were paid out as a result of newspaper articles. This was because the press complaints commission offered an alternative solution that was quicker, cheaper and perhaps more suitable, he said. It was also because judges put a cap on damages, Lord Mostyn added. \"I appeared for Mr Graham Souness [manager of Blackburn Rovers] who was awarded \u00a3750,000 against a newspaper,\" said Lord Williams. \"Those awards have disappeared and if a cap on damages is a realistic figure of \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3150,000, the game isn't quite worth the candle.\"",
