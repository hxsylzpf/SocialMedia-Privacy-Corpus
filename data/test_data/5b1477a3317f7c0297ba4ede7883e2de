  "content": "The Telegraph group is to review its internet security procedures following an attack that forced its news website offline for more than a day earlier this week. Ed Roussel, the Telegraph's digital editor, said the news group had not received any communication from the hackers behind the denial of service attack, but described it as a \"wake-up call\". \"Like any crime, it makes you think about the balance between the measures you can take and the perceived extent of risk to which you are exposed,\" he said. \"We will be stepping up our level of protection.\" Specialists were brought in to resolve the problem on Monday lunchtime, adding filters to identify and deflect the problem traffic. The formal procedure is to report major attacks to the police. \"Any disruption of business of this type is a serious criminal offence and we will be taking the appropriate steps to deal with this,\" said a Telegraph spokesperson. The Association of Online Publishers advises that this kind of attack is a criminal offence and should be reported to the police or, if criminal elements are thought to be involved, the Serious Organised Crime Agency. \"Any large or business-critical website should invest in DoS [denial of service] protection,\" said a spokesperson for Pinsent Masons, the AOP's partner law firm. \"As with any such preventative investment it's often only those who have suffered such attacks that see the need to do it. \"Site owners should speak to their ISP as these often offer services to protect against DoS attacks, or look at specialist services that offer such protection.\" Up to several hundred thousand computers can be hacked for this type of DoS attack, where multiple computers flood web servers with requests for a certain site. Mr Roussel said that the Telegraph had suffered a DoS attack before but it was not substantial enough to bring down the site. Full access to Telegraph.co.uk was resumed only after several days, when the UK's internet service providers had updated cached versions of the site. Based on the site's ABCe audited traffic figures for March, the Telegraph would typically generate around 2.2m page views in one day. The collapse of the site is unlikely to affect the Telegraph's digital advertising deals. Web advertisers typically pay for campaigns on the basis of views, rather than time. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
