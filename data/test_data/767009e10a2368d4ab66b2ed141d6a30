  "content": "Kerry Katona's Cash Lady payday loan adverts are back on screens this week, having been amended to sidestep an ASA ban, but there's a new logic-defying celebrity endorsement on the block thanks to DateWithChantelle.com, a new joint venture between unlucky-in-love Chantelle Houghton and 23-year-old entrepreneur Jack Knowles. If you don't think you've heard of Jack Knowles, or perhaps feel alienated by his offputtingly long-winded name, please bear in mind that according to his own website he is \"well-known as 'JK'\". Still none the wiser? Notes JK's biography: \"He is often known as the 'Sean Parker' of the UK, after the character played by Justin Timberlake in the hit movie The Social Network.\" And what a well-rounded, almost lifelike character that was, but let's not get bogged down in the ongoing debate over whether The Social Network was or was not based on true events because what we need to discuss today is, of course, DateWithChantelle.com. Unlike JK's other ventures, such as Laid.co.uk or ServicePals.com, this new site does not trade on the romantic notion that you will \"get yourself Laid tonight for free\" or offer social networking to the armed forces. Instead, with this Cilla of the post-Big Brother era as its figurehead, the site offers to find love for single parents. You may scoff but the testimonials on the site \u2013 launched this week \u2013 are already excellent. There are only three, but they're very positive. \"Met my husband-to-be on DatewithChantelle.com! Thankyou so much!\" screams the first. \"Fantastic website, simple and easy to use,\" notes the second. \"Going by your name, it started with a flirt while I was out on tour!\" exclaims a slightly mystifying third. It's hard to know which aspect of these recommendations is most extraordinary: that all respondents \u2013 billed as John Doe, John Doe and Elena Doe respectively \u2013 seem to be related? That, despite the website's very recent launch, one user has already found marriage material? Or that the John Doe in the first quote, this user with wedding bells already in his ears, has already found his \"husband-to-be\"? Could he be referring to the second John Doe, and does the second John Doe know of his fate? It could be time for Chantelle to buy a hat."
