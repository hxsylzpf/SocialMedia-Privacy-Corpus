  "content": "Paparazzi were today accused of driving like \"dodgems\" as they pursued actress Sienna Miller after last year's Bafta awards. Otis Ferry told West London magistrates court that the photographers were driving \"like lunatics\" and he feared they would cause a crash. Frustrated by the absence of police, he removed the keys from two of the photographers' cars and threw them on to the ground to stop the pursuit. Ferry, the son of Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry, denies two charges of criminal damage. The chase happened after Miller, at the time the girlfriend of Ferry's brother Isaac, left Boujis nightclub in west London on February 12 last year. Miller had been at a private party after the Bafta ceremony, at which she presented an award. Ferry told the court he got in his brother's Land Rover intending to follow Miller back to her home. He said: \"It then became very clear that there were quite a few vehicles and they were absolutely stopping at nothing to get after us. \"These cars were driving at us incredibly aggressively, initially trying to get between Isaac's car and Sienna's car.\" Miller telephoned Ferry's brother shortly after leaving the club to say she feared the photographers would follow her home. Ferry told the court: \"From what I understand from what Sienna had said, they were desperate to find out where she lived. They seemed to want to stop at nothing to find her house. \"She said her last house had been staked out 24/7 by photographers and she had had to move houses as a consequence.\" He said he was \"shaken\" by the \"very scary\" driving of the photographers, adding: \"It was like dodgems driving.\" The convoy of vehicles stopped at traffic lights and Ferry got out to ask the photographer in the car behind him what he was doing, the court heard. Ferry said: \"I just thought, this is the only way I'm going to stop these guys. So I put my hand into the car, pulled the key out then threw it in front of his car.\" The trial continues. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
