  "content": "Reading on mobile? Click here to see the video One Direction are possibly the biggest boyband on the planet right now. Their phenomenal success is down to one thing: how easily we can relate to their story. After all, deep down, haven't we all been cynically thrown together from a pool of rejected solo singers by a scheming record industry impresario during the audition stages of a televised singing competition? Of course we have. And now, three years after first appearing on X Factor, comes One Direction's crowning glory. It's One Direction: This Is Us \u2013 a behind the scenes documentary brought to us by noted auteur Morgan Spurlock and presented in pin-sharp digital 3D. It's thought that One Direction: This Is Us will be the Don't Look Back for the generation that's had its attention span obliterated by Snapchat, so let's confirm this by looking at its latest trailer. 1) We open with a glimpse into the madness that the members of One Direction must deal with every day. Thousands of fans packed outside every hotel they stay in, all screaming and waving their phones in the air and, in the case of the poor sap in the bottom left, picking the very worst time imaginable to welcome their friend John home. 2) We're then treated to a brief illustrated recap of how One Direction became such a worldwide sensation. It is, admittedly, a lot like the sort of diagram you'd see in the event of a global pandemic, but that just shows how popular One Direction are. Everyone loves them. Apart from, apparently, the people on the east coast of Greenland, who much prefer the work of Justin Bieber. 3) After that, we rattle through the childhoods of the various One Direction members. There's Liam, who grew up blighted by a rare medical condition requiring him to wear headphones around his neck like a pretty necklace at all times. 4) Then there's Louis, whose parents forced him to sleep in a coffin in a deranged bid to turn him into a full-blown vampire. 5) And there's Zayn, who turned to music when his dream of becoming the world's first child model to exclusively wear garments containing both the word \"helicopter\" and the word \"romance\" tragically fell apart. 6) However, One Direction have had the last laugh by overcoming these difficulties and becoming genuine pop megastars. Apart from Liam, whose life is still compromised by his compulsive need to still wear those headphones around his neck, obviously. 7) However, One Direction: This Is Us isn't just the first ever 3D movie to largely revolve around a series of two-dimensional maps and static shots of childhood photographs. No. It also contains a bit where someone's nan explains why they're so successful. 8) Still not exciting enough for you? Fine, here's a bit where the parent of a One Direction member vandalises a telephone box with a message of love for her son. 9) Still not exciting enough for you? Fine, here's Harry Styles in a bakery. He's wearing a hat. There's bread behind him. Look. 10) Still not exciting enough for you? Fine, here's a scene where two of One Direction have a muted conversation about their confusion over what miso soup is. In digital 3D. This is going to be the best film ever."
