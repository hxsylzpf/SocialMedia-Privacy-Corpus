  "content": "The judge in Naomi Campbell's privacy suit against the Mirror newspaper today accused the supermodel of lying under oath as he delivered his judgment. Mr Justice Michael Morland cast doubt on the accuracy of Ms Campbell's evidence to the court about her rushed admission to hospital in Gran Canaria and about her relationship with the publicist, Matthew Freud. \"I am satisfied that she lied on oath about the reasons for her rushed admission to hospital in Gran Canaria and I have doubts about the accuracy of her accounts of the assault on her assistant and her dealings with Mr Matthew Freud, the publicist,\" he said in his judgment today. The Streatham-born model told the court she had been hospitalised because she had reacted badly to a combination of champagne and antibiotics. In fact, the Mirror argued, she had suffered a drugs overdose. Ms Campbell also denied under oath she had asked Mr Freud to set up an interview with the Sunday Times on her behalf after the Mirror published details of her treatment for drug addiction. She told the court she had been led to believe that the Sunday Times interview would also feature singers Robbie Williams and Geri Halliwell. In a highly critical judgement, Mr Justice Morland said he had felt obliged to consider Ms Campbell's evidence \"with caution\". He said: \"She has shown herself to be over the years lacking in frankness and veracity with the media and manipulative and selective in what she has chosen to reveal about herself.\" Awarding Ms Campbell damages of \u00a33,500, Mr Justice Morland described the Mirror's decision to publish stories about her drug addiction as \"extremely legitimate\". But he made it clear that publishing the details of Ms Campbell's therapy had not been justified. \"I am satisfied that Miss Naomi Campbell has established that she has suffered a significant amount of distress and injury to feelings caused specifically by the unjustified revelation of the details of her therapy with Narcotics Anonymous,\" he said."
