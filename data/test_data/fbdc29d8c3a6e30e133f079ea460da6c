  "content": "Americans are concerned about internet privacy, but they're far less worried about government snooping than they are about their online activity being monitored by hackers and advertisers. That's according to a survey of 792 internet and smartphone users in the US by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, conducted in July. 86% of respondents said they had taken steps to remove or mask their digital footprints, including clearing cookies and browsing history (64%), deleting or editing something they had posted online (41%) and asking someone else to remove something posted about them (21%). \"Users clearly want the option of being anonymous online and increasingly worry that this is not possible,\" said Lee Rainie, Director of the Pew Research Center's Internet Project. \"Their concerns apply to an entire ecosystem of surveillance. In fact, they are more intent on trying to mask their personal information from hackers, advertisers, friends and family members than they are trying to avoid observation by the government.\" Deeper measures to protect privacy are still used by a relative niche of the US online population. Pew found that 14% of respondents had encrypted their communications online, while 14% had used a service that allowed them to browse the web anonymously. Who are people worried about? 33% of people who'd taken measures to protect their privacy said they were trying to hide their activities from hackers or criminals, while 28% said they were concerned about advertisers. 19% said they were hiding from \"people in their past\" or \"certain friends\"; 17% from \"people who might criticise, harass or target them\"; 14% from family members or a romantic partner; and 11% from employers, supervisors or workmates. Interestingly, given the debates around anti-piracy legislation, only 6% of Pew's respondents said they were trying to avoid their online activity being observed by \"companies or people who might want payment for files you download\". Meanwhile, the government and law enforcement authorities were well down the list at 5% and 4% respectively. The survey was conducted between 11 July and 14 July, well after the first revelations about the US National Security Agency's surveillance activities broke. Some of Pew's respondents' online privacy measures were taken based on experience. 21% said they'd had an email or social networking profile \"compromised or taken over\" by someone else without permission, while 12% said they had been stalked or harassed online. 11% said they'd had important personal information stolen like social security numbers, credit card or bank account details; 6% had fallen victim to an online scam and lost money; and 6% said they'd had their reputation damaged because of something that happened online. Pew also found that 68% of internet users think current laws are not protecting their privacy enough online, while 50% are worried about the amount of personal information about them that's online \u2013 up from 33% in a similar survey in 2009. It may be tempting to see teenagers as the generation least concerned by online privacy, but previous research from Pew has suggested this is not the case. A survey conducted last year found that 70% of 12-17 year-old Americans have sought outside advice about how to manage some aspect of online privacy, including 42% from friends or peers, and 41% from parents. This applies to mobile apps too. A separate Pew study found that 51% of teenage app users have avoided certain apps due to privacy concerns, while 26% have uninstalled an app after learning it was collecting personal information that they didn't wish to share. Pew's are not the only studies finding increased concerns about online privacy. Internet security company AVG \u2013 yes, it has a vested interest here \u2013 released its own study of 4,927 people across eight countries yesterday too. It found that 46% of respondents said they have increased concerns about their privacy and a higher distrust of companies and their ability to protect people's personal data. The survey also found that 69% of people felt technology would become more intrusive over the next five years, almost as many as the 72% who expect it to become more helpful. The trend can also be seen in the growth for anonymous search engines like DuckDuckGo, which said in July that its traffic had spiked sharply after the NSA revelations, moving from serving 1.7m searches a day at the start of June to 3m a fortnight later. Finally, research commissioned by civil liberties campaigner Big Brother Watch earlier this year, based on a ComRes survey of 10,354 people in nine countries, found that 79% of respondents were concerned about their privacy online."
