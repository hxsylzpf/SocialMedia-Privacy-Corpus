  "content": "For anyone sceptical about the government's growing addiction to surveillance, the House of Lords provided an answer last week. The cross-party constitutional affairs committee warned, in a surprisingly frank and damning report, that the collection of data in Britain \"risks undermining the fundamental relationship between the state and citizens\". One egregious example from the report is the behaviour of local councils that use terror laws to spy on innocent people. It makes clear that our society must devise a means of protecting individual privacy. The Lords suggest a privacy impact assessment that would examine proposed laws at an early stage. Over the last three years, that point has been made time and again in the pages of this newspaper, chiefly by Henry Porter. The erosion of liberties, rights and privacy, he argues, amounts to a consistent campaign against the enduring qualities of British democracy. This report represents a vindication of the Observer's opposition to that process - critics of the creeping advance of state surveillance can no longer be dismissed as paranoid fantasists. It is also a reminder of the particular forms of scrutiny and clarity that the Lords can bring to bear on our politics, at a time when the upper chamber has been mired in scandal. It is a poignant and chastening moment for parliament when elected lawmakers must take lessons from appointed and hereditary officials on essential rights and freedoms in a democracy."
