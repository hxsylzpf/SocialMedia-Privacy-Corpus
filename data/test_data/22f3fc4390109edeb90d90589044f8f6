  "content": "Check out the paywall-busting Fuck Yeah Caitlin Moran before the Times copyright wallahs close it down. According to its Twitter feed, @fuckyeahmoran, this is where \"Caitlin Moran's words finally escape the paywall. Follow our tumblr for her columns\". The link of course is here (don't ya love tumblr), although, of course, all articles are apparently (c) the author (not the Times) and were originally published on Times Online, which is copyright of the Times. No doubt Moran herself is outraged by this abuse of her work, which is why she is a follower of the aforementioned writer we shall call \"Fuck Yeah\". Unless, that is that the Times's Berlin sex club-visiting journalist (read the Lady Gaga interview and night out in the German capital here) actually has some unusual copyright deal which allows her content to bust the Times's paywall, in which case, one wonders why the rest of that fine newspaper's columnists aren't at it. This free online publishing thing can be catching."
