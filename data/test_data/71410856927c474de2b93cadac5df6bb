  "content": "Naomi Campbell has accused the PR supremo Matthew Freud of deception when he brokered an interview with her for the Sunday Times. Campbell, who is suing the Mirror for invasion of her privacy, denied in court today she had knowingly paid Mr Freud to set up an interview with the paper on her behalf. Under cross-examination from the Mirror's prosecution , Desmond Browne QC, Campbell denied she had hired Mr Freud to handle PR for her after the Mirror published details of her treatment for drug addiction. In the Sunday Times article - published after the Mirror's exposure of her attendance at Narcotics Anonymous sessions - Campbell was quoted as having said the Mirror's story had worried her \"for about five minutes\". \"He called me first, the day after the article appeared,\" said Campbell of Mr Freud, whose company promotes celebrity including Chris Evans and Geri Halliwell. \"He spoke to my boyfriend of the time and said, 'I'm coming round in 10 minutes'. His words were, 'I'm going to help you',\" said Campbell. She said Mr Freud had warned her following the publication of the Mirror article that the paper would \"make her life hell\" and advised her to co-operate with Mirror journalists. The supermodel said she had been led to believe that the Sunday Times interview would also feature singers Robbie Williams and Geri Halliwell. \"I understood Geri Halliwell and Robbie Williams were also going to be part of it. I was misled,\" she told the court. \"I only agreed to do it because I thought Robbie Williams and Geri Halliwell were doing it,\" she added. She claimed to have no knowledge of the \u00a315,000 Mr Browne claimed had been charged by Mr Freud to her management company, Massima. She believed Mr Freud had offered help becasue he was a friend. \"I go through all my accounts month by month\" said Campbell. \"I would have found this.\" When asked by Mr Browne whether she believed Mr Freud had deceived her, Campbell replied: \"Yes he did\". On day two of Campbell's lawsuit against the Mirror, Mr Browne cross-examined her on the presentation of her image in the media. Campbell is suing the paper for breach of confidence and unlawful invasion of privacy after it published a photograph of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting on the King's Road in London a year ago. The Mirror wrote that she had been receiving regular counselling in a \"courageous bid to beat her addiction to drink and drugs\". In her evidence, Campbell said: \"I felt shocked, angry, betrayed and violated by the article.\" The Mirror has argued in its defence that Campbell has deceived the public over the years by boasting to the media that she avoided illegal drugs when others in the modelling world had succumbed.",
