  "content": "BBC Radio 1 is planning to play Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead, the Wizard of Oz track being bought by anti-Thatcher protesters in the wake of the former prime minister's death, on its chart show on Sunday. However, in what is thought to be a first for the BBC chart show, the corporation is considering having a Newsbeat reporter explain why a song from the 30s is charting to Radio 1's target audience of 16- to 24-year-olds \u2013 none of whom will remember Margaret Thatcher's controversial premiership. In what could be seen as the first major test for the new director general, Tony Hall, BBC insiders said the track is likely to be played if it makes it into the top of the charts in defiance of criticism from Tory supporters. The Official Charts Company said on Thursday morning that Ding Dong! The Witch Is Deadwas on course to reach number four, up from 10 the previous day. The Daily Mail has been leading the charge against Facebook and Twitter campaigners trying to push the song, which has become the anthem of anti-Thatcher protesters. In Thursday's Daily Mail, the paper branded Romany Blythe, the woman who set up the Facebook page \"The Witch is Dead\" as a \"teacher of hatred\", quoting critics who condemned plans for Thatcher \"death parties\" as \"revolting\" and \"offensive\". Radio 1 insiders said if the song does make it to the top five, there would be no reason not to play the track. However, it is understood The Official Chart Show presenter Jameela Jamil might have to invite a reporter from Radio 1's Newsbeat to explain to listeners why a track they are unlikely to be familiar with has charted. \"Among the 16- to 24-year-olds, a lot of people are saying they are not 100% sure who Thatcher is. Even though this seems extraordinary, they may not understand who that song would chart,\" said a BBC source. The BBC does not always play every song in the top 10 \u2013 a track that had been ranked for weeks or months may not be aired under normal circumstances, but it is unlikely to shy away from playing a track that has just charted, even if it is effectively a novelty song. A decision about what will be played on Sunday's Radio 1 chart show will not be made until Sunday morning when the final sales data comes in. A BBC spokesman said it would not make a decision on the grounds of taste or politics and pointed out that the song was not on the Radio 1 playlist, which is compiled by staff according to the tastes of the youth audience. \"The Official Chart Show on Sunday is a historical and factual account of what the British public has been buying and we will make a decision about playing it when the final chart positions are clear,\" the spokesman added. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
