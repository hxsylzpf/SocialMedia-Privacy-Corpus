  "content": "\u2022 We must have gone at least a day or two without mentioning Twitter, but they broke the drought by announcing that the service is now receiving some 50m messages a day. That means it's delivering many, many times more, of course. The numbers aren't always so positive, however. Despite all the hullaballoo about last year's Iranian protests being fuelled by Twittering, senior executives at al-Jazeera say they could only find 60 verified accounts in Tehran. That's a far cry from the hype, but also ignores the fact that the real impact of Twitter (and other web services) was not in Iran itself, but in spreading news of what was happening there around to other parts of the world. That sense of connectedness - and the responsibility that comes with it - is something I've written about before. \u2022 The public is warming up to the idea of electronic books and reading devices - *cough* iPad *cough* - but it turns out there are other benefits, too. An examination by Princeton University, which is running a pilot scheme where students are given Amazon Kindles, found that those using an ebook printed half as much material as those without. However, it wasn't all cheery news for Jeff Bezos and friends - 65% of those on the pilot said they wouldn't buy another Kindle if theirs broke. \u2022 And it looks like Microsoft's Project Natal - that's the motion-sensitive control system for the Xbox - is starting to get pimped out for testing with high-profile fans. Gadget Show presenter Jason Bradbury got hs hands on it, while there's a little YouTube video of Jonathan Ross trying it at home. Not sure it seems a remarkable advance on Sony's EyeToy, though I haven't used it myself.
