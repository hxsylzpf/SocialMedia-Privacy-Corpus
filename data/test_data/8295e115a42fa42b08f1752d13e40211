  "content": "Formula one boss Max Mosley said in court today that the word \"Aryan\" should not be equated with Nazism. Mosley, speaking under cross-examination in the high court in London during his invasion of privacy case against the News of the World, said he could not recall the word \"Aryan\" being used in a sadomasochistic sex orgy at a flat in Chelsea. However, he denied the word was meaningful in the context and said the role play had no Nazi overtones, either implicitly or explicitly. \"I wouldn't automatically assume that was Nazi,\" Mosley said. \"The fact that someone mentioned they're Aryan doesn't ipso facto mean Nazi.\" Mosley is suing the News of the World for breach of privacy over claims he was involved in a \"sick Nazi orgy\". He argued his sexual activities were a private matter, with no element of public interest or bearing on his ability to perform his job, and the allegations there were Nazi overtones were false and especially hurtful. Mark Warby QC, the counsel for News of the World, played the audio track to the first of two sex orgies involving Mosley caught on video by the newspaper. The courtroom and public viewing balcony was completely packed and gasps were audible as a woman, identified as Woman A and Mosley's main S&amp;M contact, clearly said \"but we are the Aryan race, the blondes\". Mosley told the court he could not hear the tape properly because at 68 he was quite deaf and his hearing aid did not pick up things like that - all he could hear properly was the background noise of someone being slapped. Warby argued the use of the word \"Aryan\", the fact that it was a prison scenario, and that Mosley and Woman B were speaking German as the dominant players in the scene, and the fact that two of the five women wore German military jackets, contributed to the impression of Nazi roleplay. Warby and Mosley exchanged tense words on several occasions, with both men accusing the other of arrogance. When Mosley said he did not watch the video of the orgy until he checked to see if he had it to give to his solicitors, Warby interrupted with \"that's a lie\". \"How dare you accuse me of lying,\" Mosley said. Warby said he dared because Mosley had earlier given evidence that he had pulled out clips from the video to email to the other participants. Mosley responded that he did not need to watch the video in its entirety in order to do that. Both Woman A and Mosley have deleted all the emails leading up to the March 8 party and only some have been retrieved, the court heard. Warby said deleting emails and wiping the hard drive suggested Mosley thought he had something to hide. The hearing continues. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
