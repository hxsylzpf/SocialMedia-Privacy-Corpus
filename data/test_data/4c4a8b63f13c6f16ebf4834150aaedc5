  "content": "Newspaper and magazine publishers are seeking an injunction to prevent the government's plan for a new press regulation regime getting the royal seal of approval this week. Industry bodies representing publishers said they would be seeking the injunction to stop the press regulation royal charter \u2013 backed by the three main parties and Hacked Off campaigners \u2013 going before the privy council for sealing by the Queen on Wednesday. They also filed their case for a judicial review of the government's rejection of the industry's rival plan for a new press regulator on Monday. The case filed at the high court in London argues that the decision by a privy council sub-committee to reject the industry's proposed regulatory system underpinned by a royal charter was \"wholly unfair, irrational and unlawful\". \"The statement of facts and grounds lodged with the high court today contends that the decision by the privy council committee was wholly unfair, irrational and unlawful,\" the publishers said in a joint statement. \"It argues that the failure of the privy council committee to carry out a fair and transparent consultation on the industry's royal charter application was made even more significant by the fact that the possible involvement of the state in the regulation of the press raised very serious constitutional issues. \"Given the gravity of these constitutional issues, the industry's lawyers asked the privy council on Friday to give an undertaking that the rival cross-party royal charter, written by politicians and the Hacked Off lobby group, would not be presented to the Queen for sealing on Wednesday. That request has been refused and an injunction will now be sought.\" Earlier this month the culture secretary, Maria Miller, announced that ministers were not going to consider the industry's royal charter, sticking instead with the charter agreed by the three main political parties and Hacked Off, which campaigns on behalf of victims of press intrusion, in March. This charter is due to be ratified by the privy council on Wednesday. Miller has offered some concessions aimed at addressing publishers' concerns with the cross-party royal charter, but these have been dismissed as inadequate by the industry, which is also moving ahead with setting up its own new press self-regulator. John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons media committee, said he thought the most likely outcome is a new body set up by the press that does not comply with the royal charter. He told Total Politics magazine the newspaper industry's proposals should be \"hugely welcomed, firstly because they represented an enormous step forward from the Press Complaints Commission\". He also called on Lord Leveson, who oversaw the inquiry into media ethics in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, to help \"unlock the door\" by saying what he thought would be acceptable in terms of regulation. \"I'd like him to express a view,\" he told the magazine. Last week, newspaper and magazine publishers presented their final plans for their own regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which would include a contract binding publishers to the watchdog's decisions. They said the new watchdog would have greater powers of investigation, enforcement and sanction than the discredited Press Complaints Commission, which it will replace. Those supporting the judicial review and the creation of Ipso include the publishers of the Daily Mail, the Telegraph, the Mirror and Rupert Murdoch's News UK, publisher of the Sun and the Times. A spokesperson for Miller's Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: \"We welcome the progress the industry has made on setting up a self-regulator but we're disappointed the press are undertaking legal action.\" \"The industry royal charter was considered in an entirely proper and fair way by the privy council committee and the reasons they were unable to recommend its grant are in the public domain.\" Whilst they found acceptable areas, they identified fundamental issues that were not compatible with the Leveson principles such as a lack of independence around appointments and funding and no requirement to provide an arbitration scheme. \"The government is working to bring in a system of independent press self-regulation that will protect press freedom while offering real redress when mistakes are made. The culture secretary pushed hard for recent changes on arbitration and the standards code to be made, which will ensure the system is workable and legal action is particularly disappointing in light of these changes.\" The case is being brought by four trade organisations representing newspapers and magazines \u2013 the Newspaper Publishers Association, the Newspaper Society, the Scottish Newspaper Society, and the Professional Publishers Association \u2013 through the Press Standards Board of Finance (PresBof), the funding body for the existing industry regulator, the PCC. PresBof made the industry's original royal charter application. Some newspapers have taken a neutral position on the legal challenge. The Guardian is part of the NPA, in common with all other national newspapers, but is neither supporting nor rejecting it.",
