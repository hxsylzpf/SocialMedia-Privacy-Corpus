  "content": "As far as mishaps involving Twitter and pop stars go, we didn't think anything could top the infamous #susanalbumparty hashtag \u2013 that's Susan Album Party \u2013 which befell Susan Boyle's PR team a couple of years ago. All they wanted was to let people know they would be celebrating Boyle's new CD with some cake and ice cream, but their hashtag looked like it belonged in an adult entertainment store (Su's Anal Bum Party, in case you're still wondering). One of Robin Thicke's social media advisers, however, seemed to think it was a good idea to allow the singer \u2013 who has been at the centre of a barrage of online criticism and accusations of misogyny ever since the release of his Blurred Lines video last summer \u2013 to participate in a Q&amp;A session on Twitter with VH1, using the hashtag #AskThicke. Given that Thicke has no limited number of online detractors, this seemed a foolhardy decision; and especially given the increase in vitriol towards Thicke since he released a stalker-y, awkward video for Get Her Back last week. The song is dedicated to his estranged wife, Paula, taken from the album....er, Paula. We're not sure quite what Thicke and his people expected, but as every other person in the world anticipated when this Q&amp;A was announced last month, Thicke got absolutely slayed. People either just entirely took the piss, or they used the opportunity as a means of calling Thicke out on his treatment of women. And by his \"treatment\" of women, we mean his assumption that women enjoy being hit on by sleazy guys like him who have at least 90% more nose-cartilage than is normal and who don't take no for an answer. Here's some of what has been tweeted so far, and it is still going on..."
