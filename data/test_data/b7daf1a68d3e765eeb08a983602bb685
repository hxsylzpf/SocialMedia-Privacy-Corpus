  "content": "Anti-abortion activists described the ruling as 'a moral and constitutional outrage'. They were protesting against the $70 million fine imposed on them by a federal jury in Oregon for publishing names and photographs of abortion doctors on the World Wide Web. They are only the latest in a long line of unsuccessful defendants with a selective approach to fundamental rights. The Internet did not create the difficult challenge of balancing free speech against the right to privacy, but it has intensified the problems. Even the American Civil Liberties Union, while welcoming the verdict as 'a clarion call\" for the removal of violence from the US debate on abortion, remains worried by 'the chilling effect on free speech that this case could have.' This was not the UK, where until the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law next year, free speech remains a legal left-over - what is left over after the laws of confidentiality, contempt and official secrets have had their say. This was the United States, where free speech has been defended down the years by its written constitution, Bill of Rights and First Amendment. The argument of the anti-abortion activists is not an empty one. It is a landmark case testing the limits of free speech. Ostensibly, the web site and associated posters, involve no physical threats or calls for violent confrontations. Instead they list the names and addresses of doctors who perform abortions and invite readers to send in other names to be added to the list. Hence the concern of civil liberty lawyers. But it is not that simple, as three weeks of legal arguments and five days of deliberations by the jury demonstrate. Sensibly, the jury cut through the specious presentation of the anti-abortionists and looked at the reality: the arson attacks, bombings and shootings targeted on abortion clinics over the last few years. The National Abortion Federation has logged 39 bombings, 99 acid attacks, and 16 attempted murders. Three doctors have been killed. Many have been forced to wear bullet proof vests and suffer intimidatory phone calls. The anti-abortion web site is not as neutral as its defenders pretend. Called 'The Nuremberg Files', the site features foetal blood dripping down the screen. The doctors are accused of 'crimes against humanity' and branded as 'baby butchers'. The details on the web include their phone numbers, car licence numbers, routes to work and even the names of their children. Three doctors on the list have already been killed, their names crossed off like items on a grocery list. Accompanying fliers in the form of Old West 'wanted' posters, offer cash prizes for the names of doctors carrying out abortions. Free speech is a hallowed principle, but even the US courts have rightly set limits. The jury has followed that lead. The punitive fine sends out a clear message: the violence perpetrated by anti-abortionists is unacceptable. The web lists and 'wanted posters' were seen for what they were: hit lists for anti-abortion fanatics. Undoubtedly there will be an appeal, but the appeal courts should take a robust approach. Free speech is not absolute and has to be placed in context. As a famous US judgment noted, no one has the right to falsely shout fire in a crowded theatre. The Press Complaints Commission is currently studying a similar case in the UK: an appeal against a weekly newspaper for the black community seeking the personal addresses of the five men suspected of killing Stephen Lawrence. Deeply unattractive though all five are, they have the right to be defended from lynch law. The reason the criminal justice system was set up was to avoid the injustices which lynch mobs perpetrate."
