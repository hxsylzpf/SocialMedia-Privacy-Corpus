  "content": "Chatham Town's website has been hacked by extremists referring to the Charlie Hebdo massacre. The Ryman League One North club was forced to take the site down for around 12 hours at the weekend after the homepage was replaced by an image of a machine-gun wielding man wearing a gas-mask. The image contained messages including \"Where is the security?\", \"A little respect for other relegions[sic]\" and \"I'm not Charlie\", in reference to the Paris terror attacks and the \"Je suis Charlie\" campaign that followed. Steve Archer, one of the site's administrators, told The Medway Messenger: \"It made no sense \u2026 we're a part-time football club so I'm pretty sure it's just a random attack. Someone told me about 11pm. It must have been quite late as I had been working on it that evening. \"I'm just hoping I've not lost too much information. It's taken me two years to put it together, and I've spent a lot of time on the history section. I've got results on there going back to 1990.\" Those concerns were allayed though as the data remained intact, and the site was back up by 1pm. Following the attacks in Paris, the hacking collective Anonymous began an attempt to eliminate terrorist Twitter accounts, which led to a counter-campaign targeting 19,000 French websites, including pizza shops and a gardening page. Arnaud Coustilliere, head of cyber-defence for the French military, said the attacks were carried out by \"more or less structured\" groups including well-known Islamist organisations. \"What's new, what's important, is that this is 19,000 sites \u2013 that's never been seen before.\""
