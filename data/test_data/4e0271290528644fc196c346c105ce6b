  "content": "A leading media lawyer has described proposals for a new privacy law in Ireland as \"repugnant\" and a threat to freedom of the press on both sides of the Irish Sea. Simon McAleese, a legal consultant to Tony O'Reilly's Independent News &amp; Media, said he was \"not impressed\" by the government's surprise announcement that a privacy law would be introduced, given that the justice minister had recently agreed that none was needed. \"This is a charter for people who have a lot to hide. I think there is great scope for abuse of this legislation,\" said Mr McAleese. \"People who have got away with wrongdoing in the past are now being told they can no longer use the libel laws. So those in the business of dodgy libel laws are always going to use the next action available to them, which is this privacy law. \"This is what happened in the UK - judges became less tolerant of libel actions and juries became more astute about the size of the awards, so people have started using privacy and European law.\" Mr McAleese said the body of common law in Ireland, like the UK, already amounts to a privacy law and there was no need to introduce new proposals. The proposed new privacy legislation, which has taken editors by surprise, was announced late on Tuesday night in conjunction with proposals to introduce a statutory press council and reforms to the 1961 libel and slander laws. Proposed changes to Irish libel laws have been welcomed by the newspaper industry, but there are fears that the privacy legislation is flawed. \"The notion that this is being brought in as a quid pro quo for reforming libel law is slightly repugnant,\" said Mr McAleese. \"If you look at the cabinet, there are very few who haven't resorted to litigation in their time. The idea that there can only be reforms to the libel law if there is a privacy law raises questions.\" He added that the proposed privacy legislation was draconian and will enable individuals to launch privacy actions if they are suffering distress as a result of phone calls, general inquiries and robust questioning by journalists. \"Incredibly, they can also apply for this to be heard in private,\" he said. Seamus Dooley, the Irish secretary of the National Union of Journalists, has called on the government to delay the introduction of any privacy legislation until the new statutory press council beds down. \"That this was published without any consultation whatsoever is amazing. There needs to be a public debate on what privacy is and what the full implications for the press are,\" Mr Dooley said. \"There is a danger that the benefits from new libel laws will be nullified by the injunctive powers of the privacy law.\" Actions that will be deemed to be breach of privacy include any form of surveillance, disclosure of material obtained by surveillance, the use of a person's likeness for financial gain without consent, the disclosure of letters, diaries, medical records or other personal documents and harassment. Even material already in the public domain or information passed on to a third party without a person's consent could be deemed a breach of privacy under the new proposals. The new libel law, also announced on Tuesday, is designed to stop court cases similar to those brought by Jeffrey Archer or Jonathan Aitken, who ended up in prison after the bases for their libel actions were found to be untrue. Under the proposals, litigants will have to submit a sworn affidavit and verifiable evidence to support it to demonstrate the offending article is not true. The press council will also be available to give redress in a similar fashion to the UK's Press Complaints Commission, but its sanctions will be legally binding and its board dominated by representatives of the public. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
