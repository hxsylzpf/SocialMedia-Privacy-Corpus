  "content": "James Arthur's Twitter imbroglio has plumbed new depths after the iTunes store approved a refund request from a buyer of the X Factor winner's new album, who was offended by lyrics on the self-released track Hey Mickey. Arthur's rap song Hey Mickey was criticised last weekend for lyrics that many listeners, not least comedians Matt Lucas and Frankie Boyle, deemed homophobic. The furore intensified when former X Factor contestant Lucy Spraggan tweeted her disapproval. Though Arthur has insisted that the lyrics do not refer to homosexuality, several of those who bought Arthur's LP have since asked retailers for their money back. The refund offered by iTunes was revealed by a Twitter user called @Louieloodle74, who shared part of an email from a customer service rep at Apple. \"I understand that you would like to cancel the album you have purchased because of the comments made by the artist which you didn't like,\" wrote the rep. \"After reviewing the circumstances of your case, we have determined that issuing you a refund for your purchase of [the album] James Arthur is an appropriate exception to the iTunes store terms and conditions, which state that all sales are final.\" Other angry fans have now announced plans to apply for a refund. This comes after Spraggan posted text messages she allegedly exchanged with Arthur, who contacted her after she called out the lyrics on Hey Mickey. Conceived as a \"diss track\", the song features invective against the rapper Micky Worthless. \"You probably want to put your stinky dick in me,\" Arthur rapped, \"you fucking queer.\" Arthur, who has ceded control of his Twitter account to his management since the controversy erupted, has moved to quell the controversy. On 16 November, he tweeted: \"I understand why it could cause offence and that definitely wasn't my intention\". He also apologised to Lucas, saying he would \"remove the song from the internet\" \u2013 a gesture welcomed by the comedian. Sales of Arthur's album, which was at No 9 on last week's chart, have nonetheless fallen.",
