  "content": "As if it's not enough that this is the week that the forces of early 21st-century capitalism conspire to drive us into performing ersatz displays of synthetic emotion in order to best show our compliance to the great god consumerism under the admittedly thin guise of pretending to celebrate an obscure Roman saint's feast day, it also transpires that we are expected to witness the intimate communications of a balding former cricketer and an ageing model-turned-actress. Forget Tristan and Isolde and Anthony and Cleopatra, whose stories were told by poets and philosophers. We have brand new romantic heroes for this brand new age of transparency: Shane Warne and Liz Hurley, in whose courtship we are forced to participate. In November, shortly before the News of the World exposed their affair, Hurley tweeted Warne: \"Sammy sends you a special lick and says he'd like to put his silky head on your shoulder.\" The Daily Telegraph explained that this \"is thought to be a reference to her spaniel\". Hurley used the same medium to announce that her marriage to Arun Nayar was over and, as she prepared to touch down in Melbourne, Warne asked his Twitter followers: \"Where is the sexiest place to take Elizabeth for lunch? Suggestions please? Chapel St? Crown? And no \u2013 not for spaghetti on toast!!!\" It is a measure of Warne's sophistication as a lover that his answer to this question was his golf club, but that is not the point here. The point is that where celebrities lead, civilians follow and if we allow this to go unremarked we are opening ourselves up to a future in which we, as innocent bystanders, will be drawn into foreplay so faked that Piers Morgan could slap a headline on it and put it on the front page of the Daily Mirror. This is not love, or romance, or even sex, it's just PR. Anybody who feels the need to tell you how much they're doing it in all probability isn't. Whenever Brad and Angelina regale the press with stories of sexual athletics in the grotto of their waterfall (it's like a bath, from what I can work out, only for rich folk), one can't help but suspect trouble in the Pitt-Jolie boudoir; and when Gordon Ramsay crows about his and his wife's \"very active sex life\", you suspect it's just a matter of minutes before he's found knocking on his mistress's door with three bottles of poppers in his hands. So, when Warne says he's looking for the \"sexiest\" place to take his new mistress for lunch near his home, a woman whose wedding celebrations involved an English stately home, a Rajasthani fort, a Chopard tiara, several elephants, Trinny Woodall, and the most famous gay millionaire on the planet, one can't help concur that there might be something in the so-called science of self-deception, the theory that the best way to fool the world is first to fool yourself. Shane and Liz are to romance what Valentine's Day is to love: shallow, vain, insincere and about as subtle as a platter of lamb chops in a butcher's window, or its sartorial equivalent, one of Hurley's frocks. It's like posting a hot photo of yourself with your hot lover on your Facebook page; it is, like Valentine's Day itself, couples' corporate PR. Ignore the tweets. Resist the spin. Experience real emotion on any other day of the year."
