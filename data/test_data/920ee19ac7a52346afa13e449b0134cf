  "content": "One of the great books covering the internet and what it means is the Cluetrain Manifesto, written in 1999. It describes a revolution in business happening because a more open and public style of communication has become possible and proclaims: \"markets are conversations\". Now that messaging apps are soaring these ideas couldn't be more relevant. The growth of the platforms is truly remarkable. What is particularly interesting to media and technology companies is that they are also creating marketplaces, some with a deep commitment to embrace partners and some that still want to control everything. WeChat, Telegram, LINE, Slack and Facebook all encourage developers to create apps that send and receive messages via their platforms. WeChat is probably the most advanced with, it is claimed, more than 10m official accounts. Slack officially opened its APIs in December 2015 and reinforced its strategy by creating a fund for supporting new \"Slackbots\". Telegram and LINE both have advanced APIs. And the big daddy of them all shared its new APIs for Facebook Messenger a year ago and unveiled its own bots with the introduction of M in September 2015. We can expect to learn more at Facebook's upcoming F8 developer conference in April. From an industry wide perspective, the new world of chat bots is a great reminder that before the iPhone there was a time when launching a new thing on the internet simply meant Google knew where it was. Everyone had a computer. Computers all had web browsers. If your new thing worked in a web browser, anyone could be a customer. In many ways we've gone back to that. Messaging is the new web browser. Everyone has a phone. Everyone has a favourite messaging app on their phone. If your new thing can message people via those apps, then anyone can engage with you. From a business perspective, your customers aren't on web browsers any more unless something entices them to open a web page. They are on messaging apps. And they are using them all the time. Most companies can take comfort in the knowledge that email is basically a messaging app that is here to stay. It's on every phone. Phones are a good environment for it. And it's great for two-way communication, which is the key to relevance on a network. If you have a good email strategy you may be able to reapply a lot of it in the new world. What kinds of businesses work well as a \"conversation?\" It may seem counterintuitive, but intermediaries are probably really useful now. Many really successful web businesses became breakthroughs by eliminating the middleman in the 1990s and early 2000s. But now, in a reversal of that trend, a lot of people are looking at virtual assistants. Strangely, I wouldn't be surprised to see the rebirth of travel agents. The growth in messaging is so dramatic that part of me wonders if the web will appear as a little blip in history, a wild west moment that came and went. If that happens it won't be because of mobile apps; it will be because we outgrew it. Too many people published too much information and the flat structure of the web became too overwhelming even for Google to keep organised. The human filter was always going to happen. The good news is that even as big as Facebook has become, it isn't the internet to everyone. There is real competition out there. And the competition is embracing partnership wholesale in a way Facebook and Twitter have failed to do in the past. The messaging services need businesses to have conversations with customers via their platforms. They have an incentive for you to be successful there. It's conceivable the most open and inviting platform will be the winner because that's where everyone will go. The introduction of APIs on those platforms is the Cluetrain Manifesto incarnate, as markets really do become conversations. I suspect the combination of the open web and APIs on messaging platforms is precisely the antidote to the command-and-control ethos we've suffered for the last 10 years. If that plays out successfully, then the wild west we thought we knew is about to take on unimagined new proportions.
