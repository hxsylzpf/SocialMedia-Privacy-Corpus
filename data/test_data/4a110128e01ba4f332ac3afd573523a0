  "content": "\u2022 It's been a tough couple of years for MySpace, hit by job losses, falling user numbers and changes at the top. But can anything save the troubled social network - which is still, after all, the world's second largest? I spent several hours with new bosses Jason Hirschhorn and Mike Jones last week, grilling them about their plans to push the site back into the limelight. Want to know what they said? Read on. \u2022 It's pretty clear that things are getting nasty between Apple and Google, not least because of Steve Jobs's decision to sue HTC. A big New York Times piece reheats most of the conflict between the two, but there's some interesting detail in there. One unnamed Silicon Valley investor calls it \"world war three\", while the piece also reveals that Google deliberately stepped in and spent $750m to lure mobile advertising company AdMob away from under Apple's nose. That stuff's a little buried in the article, but Business Insider drags it out into the limelight. Reporters love a good fight, so expect plenty of coverage to roll through on this one in coming months. \u2022 And just in case you missed it over the weekend, the Observer ran a number on the 10th anniversary of the dotcom crash, featuring an overview of the landscape a decade on, while I spoke to some veterans about the state of the US internet industry.
