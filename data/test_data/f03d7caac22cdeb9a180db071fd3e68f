  "content": "Nicolas S has 17 online friends, among them the glamorous Rachida D and debonair Bernard K. His religion is listed as \"all of them \u2014 as long as they love me,\" and favourite quotes include \"How much is that Rolex?\" and \"Can I borrow your yacht?\" Facebook fans have no fear: President Sarkozy has not decided to bare all on the ever-growing social networking site. But he has fallen victim to the latest internet craze in France: a satirical website that harnesses the collective clout of the internet and takes aim at the political elite. The brainchild of two students who wanted to create an irreverent portrait of the country's leaders and their opponents, Failbook is a spoof networking site which allows members of the public to create politicians' profiles. Although still in its early days \u2014 the site only launched last week \u2014 thousands of visitors are already logging on and delighting in the opportunity to poke fun at their chosen target. For its creators, who want to remain anonymous, the similarity between forensic media coverage and obsessive social networking was too tempting to ignore. \"We live in a world where the slightest development is covered in the media, and, at the same time, we have Facebook, where people have killed off their private lives and build up reputations by putting everything up in public,\" said one. \"We wanted to use this analogy for a lighter treatment of politics. We're so used to seeing the same analyses day in, day out that we wanted to dramatise it a bit \u2014 and send it up.\" Yesterday on Failbook the understated prime minister, Francois Fillon, joined a group called: \"I don't like Carla Bruni's new album and I don't mind admitting it.\" Marine LP (Le Pen) writes excitedly on her father's wall about a film she has just seen portraying an all-white Paris \"with no Arabs and no blacks\". The spoof of Jean Sarkozy \u2014 the president's son, who himself was recently elected to political office, describes his religion as \"ambition\", while Justice Minister Rachida Dati's interests are listed succinctly as: \"Dior tailoring, Chanel shirts and Stalinist authoritarianism.\" According to Pierre Brechon, professor at the prestigious Sciences Po university in Grenoble, the younger generation in France is less idealistic and more critical of its political leaders than those before it. That tendency, combined with the new platform of the internet, has led to new forms of parody, he said. \"French satire has always existed, long before the web did, and it has often been extremely ferocious,\" he said. \"Nowadays, through the web, it can reach a public which is much larger and much more varied than before.\"",
