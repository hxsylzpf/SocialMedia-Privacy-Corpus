  "content": "The Guardian yesterday won a landmark legal victory when two senior judges upheld its unprecedented challenge to a blanket rule dictating that every hearing of the government's surveillance watchdog be held in secret. Meeting in public yesterday for the first time, the investigatory powers tribunal quashed rules made by the home secretary that prevented any public access to or reporting of the tribunal's business, even when there was no threat to national security. The tribunal is responsible for hearing complaints from members of the public who believe they have been the target of unlawful surveillance by police, MI5, MI6, GCHQ, customs or the Inland Revenue. Since 1985, every case has been held entirely in secret and no complaint has been upheld. But in their 85-page judgment, the judges ruled that parts of cases where no sensitive information would be disclosed should be held in public. They said the challenge to the rules was \"the most significant case ever to come before the tribunal\", and their ruling would have important consequences for future complaints. Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, said: \"Today's ruling is a significant victory for those who campaign for open justice, freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial.\" The Guardian's challenge related to two cases brought by the human rights group Liberty, which also challenged the secrecy rule. One case involves an east London businessman, Malcolm Kennedy, who said police had continually interfered with his communications after he complained about them during a criminal case in 1984 in which he was convicted of manslaughter. In the second case, Liberty, British-Irish Rights Watch and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties allege that telephone calls between them in the UK and Ireland were routinely intercepted by GCHQ. In the Guardian's submission to the tribunal last July, Michael Tugendhat QC argued that the absolute blanket ban on any public access or reporting was incompatible with the principles of open justice and freedom of expression enshrined in common law and the Human Rights Act. The tribunal agreed. The judges also voiced anxiety that the tribunal's rulings could not be appealed. Despite yesterday's decision, much of the tribunal's work will remain secret. Only procedural issues will be public. Complainants will still have no automatic right to hear or see the evidence or allegations against them from the agency they are complaining about."
