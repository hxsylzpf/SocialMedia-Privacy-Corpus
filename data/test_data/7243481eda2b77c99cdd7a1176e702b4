  "content": "Much was made of the Ofcom research into the way we Brits use our smartphones. The main focus has been on the \"shocking\" use of BlackBerrys, iPhones and Android phones by naughty teenagers in places such as libraries, theatres, cinemas and even in the bathroom. Surely this is missing the point, clearly stated by Ofcom's director of research, James Thickett, who said that rather than pointing the finger at teenagers' overuse we should look at the way smartphones are changing modern manners and social etiquette. \"It's not just about adults and teenagers having different values,\" he said. \"But it is about technology changing the way you behave in social situations.\" It may not be, as he said, an issue of a generation gap but a question of the different technologies each uses. In truth, middle-aged smartphone users have always seemed to be much more seriously addicted than teens and it is highly likely that adults who took part in the Ofcom survey were far less willing to admit tweeting, texting, surfing and emailing when they were meant to be watching Chekhov or in a terribly important meeting. By contrast, teenagers wouldn't see any reason to be ashamed of admitting that they use them an awful lot and that they watch telly with their laptop and smartphones. They might also happily tell you that they instant message under the table during a long family meal or in the library when they are meant to be revising for their GCSEs. Having grown up alongside technology they are less enchanted by it. My kids definitely take for granted the technological magic all around us because they have evolved with it, unlike oldies for whom the smartphone seemed to arrive all in a sudden rush of hand-held possibilities for work and play on the move. Last week, a woman of similar age to me (mid-forties) swapped apps with me for an hour at work. We also showed each other how great our holiday photos were now we could edit them on our iPhones. There was a flushed and excited look on both our faces not only at this amazing new technology but at the fact that at our age we were able to master and enjoy it. Somehow it seems to mean that we are not \"past it\", and that our own potential is somehow linked in with the sparkly potential of the thing we keep in a special place in our handbags. I have got used to the swooping eye-movement of middle-aged friends who will talk to me at the same time as constantly checking their phone for news tweets and Google notifications. They tell themselves (and everyone else) that it is important for their professional life but networks such as Twitter are blurring the definitions between social linking and information, just as smartphones are making it possible to socialise during work and to work when you are meant to be socialising. In our household it is not the teenagers that lie in bed last thing at night and first thing in the morning with their smartphone held over their face so they can catch up on the latest on tweetdeck or see if they got that important email. Don't worry about the teenagers, they take technology in their stride. But, as for me and my peers, we need to seriously think about the way that our giddy infatuation with the smartphone is affecting our relationships and the way we live and work.",
