  "content": "In just a week, the Obama campaign has released two ads using Mitt Romney's time at Bain Capital to paint the self-described \"very successful\" businessman as a money-grubbing, family-destroying, heartless sweatshop slave-driver. In the first of the two, about what happened after Bain took over the parent company of a Kansas City steel plant, one of the former employees says Bain was \"like a vampire. They came in and sucked the life out of us.\" As metaphors go, it's not original but it's pretty accurate: private equity firms exist to squeeze liquidity out of companies, then syphon off that profit to investors. The metaphor works on a deeper level as well. Just as with vampires, Americans are morbidly fascinated by hyperbolic success. We have an uneasy relationship with late, post-bailout capitalism: it's sexy, it's parasitical, it's dangerous, it's the product of unseen forces, it carries the promise of immortality at the cost of one's soul. Of course, I can talk that way about private equity firms because I don't have to work with anyone involved in private equity firms. On Sunday, Newark Mayor Cory Booker, an Obama surrogate, legitimate folk hero, and a municipal in-law client of just such a firm, tried to walk a line between his allegiances \u2013 and found himself the target of a slew of wooden stakes. The headline out of his Meet the Press appearance popped because Booker criticized the direction of the Obama ad \u2013 which was only a more heavily produced example of the kind of attacks Romney has suffered since he entered politics. Booker opined: \"To me, it's just we're getting to a ridiculous point in America. Especially that I know I live in a state where pension funds, unions and other people invest in companies like Bain Capital. If you look at the totality of Bain Capital's record, they've done a lot to support businesses, to grow businesses.\" This is a little like saying vampires have done a lot to support the coffin industry; it's not wrong but it misses the point. Booker went on to condemn the Bain-based salvos on uniform terms with attacks stemming from Obama's relationship with Jeremiah Wright. He said he finds them both \"nauseating\", which shows the kind of facility in false equivalences that gets you booked on Meet the Press. Still, that caveat should have given Booker some protection against what wound up happening: a gleeful social media campaign by the GOP, who tried to use the comments to shame the Obama campaign; and a stern series of scoldings by the Obama campaign. As the Washington Post's Fix bloggers have pointed out, Booker's response of mad-dash tweeting and a \"hostage video\" (Wonkette's piquant term) did not \"walk back\" the gist of his initial statement. Although he has tried his best to say Romney's record at Bain, in particular, is fair game, mostly Booker has kept fortifying that false equivalence, talking about his tender stomach's reaction to the negative campaigning on both sides \u2013 his gastrointestinal tract apparently functioning as the nation's canary in a toxic-rhetoric coal mine. Negative campaigning is bad for us. \"I'll always prioritize my nation over a political party,\" he wrote. \"[And] right now crass divisive partisan politics is not serving the citizens of my city.\" I, for one, don't think that the vilification of private equity firms really qualifies as \"divisive partisan politics\" on the same level as the race-baiting Wright attacks sketched out for Joe Rickett's consideration. Trying to shoehorn them into the same rationalization suggests that Booker is prioritizing his career \u2013 which has been almost uniquely promising until now \u2013 over party. But it's fitting that Booker turned to the instant-amnesia medium of Twitter and YouTube to mitigate the damage to his reputation as a Democratic party rising star and/or his relationship with Obama. Booker wants to have the vampire over to dinner but ignore what it had for lunch."
