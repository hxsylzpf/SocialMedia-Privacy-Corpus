  "content": "News Corporation is considering a spin-off print magazine for fans of its social networking website MySpace. MySpace, which was acquired by Rupert Murdoch's company for \u00a3332m last year, has held talks with music and fashion magazine Nylon about the initiative, according to a report in Advertising Age. Nylon and MySpace have worked together before. In May, they joined up for the magazine's seventh annual online \"music issue\". According to Adage.com, the potential MySpace magazine is likely to feature interesting MySpace members and their hobbies, from their taste in music to their social scene. While a poor execution or lukewarm response could undermine the site's reputation, the financial risk to MySpace would be low if Nylon published the new magazine under a licensing arrangement. However, MySpace has not confirmed any plans to launch a title. Meanwhile, the social networking site has hit the pages of another magazine in the UK - Emap's new-look FHM magazine. The cover story of its internet special issue is dedicated to \"The girls of MySpace\", featuring articles on women who use the site. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
