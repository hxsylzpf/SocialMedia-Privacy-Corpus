  "content": "Uber has raised $1.2bn in new funding. One point two billion dollars. The taxi-app startup is now valued at $40bn. 40 billion dol... Well, you get the idea. Huge amounts of money. A blog post by chief executive Travis Kalanick outlined the growth that has brought the company to this point. \"It was just a year ago that Uber was operating in 60 cities and 21 countries \u2013 today we are in over 250 cities in 50 countries. We are 6 times bigger today than 12 months ago \u2013 and grew faster this year than last,\" he wrote. \"In 2015 alone, Uber will generate over 1mm jobs in cities around the world and with that millions of people may decide that they no longer need to own a car because using Uber will be cheaper than owning one.\" The company is growing fast, but is it maturing in terms of its corporate culture? The recent controversy sparked by an Uber executive's suggestion that it might spend money investigating the personal lives of journalists who've criticised the company suggested there was work to do. Kalanick agrees: \"The events of the recent weeks have shown us that we also need to invest in internal growth and change. Acknowledging mistakes and learning from them are the first steps. We are collaborating across the company and seeking counsel from those who have gone through similar challenges to allow us to refine and change where needed. Fortunately, taking swift action is where Uber shines, and we will be making changes in the months ahead. Done right, it will lead to a smarter and more humble company that sets new standards in data privacy, gives back more to the cities we serve and defines and refines our company culture effectively.\" Do you think the criticism of Uber over data privacy has hit home? Or is it still an example of what Observer writer John Naughton recently called \"digital capitalism\", suggesting that \"the billionaire geeks who currently run the giant internet companies may look and talk like a new species of entrepreneur but it would be more prudent to view them as John D Rockefellers in hoodies\"? The comments section is open for your thoughts. As well as for opinions on some of the other stories bubbling in tech today: Mark Zuckerberg's plan to 'wire the world' Time has a profile piece on the Facebook chief executive's plans to bring the internet to remote parts of the world. \"What we figured out was that in order to get everyone in the world to have basic access to the Internet, that's a problem that's probably billions of dollars...\" Street Fighter II creator talks mobile vs consoles The \"mobile games will crush consoles\" headline seems designed to provoke, but this interview with Yoshiki Okamoto is much more nuanced than that. Not just in his contrasting of mobile and console games, but in his views on free-to-play gaming, and why paying to win isn't the best way forward. Benedict Evans' latest mobile questions Mobile industry analyst Benedict Evans has been blogging about some \"new questions in mobile\", with Android his focus, but also thoughts about Facebook, Amazon, wearables and more. \"For the first time ever, the tech industry is selling not just to big corporations or middle-class families but to four fifths of all the adults on earth...\" Russia's 'favourite dark web drug lord' speaks Darkside runs RAMP (the Russian Anonymous Marketplace) and has given an interview to Wired. \"We never mess with the CIA, we work only for Russians and this keeps us safe. You can't rape the whole world and remain safe...\" Black Mirror is coming back Charlie Brooker writes for the Guardian, yes, so prepare the \"you're a nepotistic biasmonkey\" comments now. But CRIPES I'm excited about the return of Black Mirror this Christmas. Here's the trailer: What else? Post your thoughts on the stories above, and also your links to other stories of interest today.",
