  "content": "Hours after Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre's attack on Mr Justice Eady for bringing a law on privacy in \"through the back door\", the Sun and the News of the World were publicly apologising to Sienna Miller for what they accepted was an unjustifiable invasion of privacy. It was another sign that privacy is gaining strength under the Human Rights Act, the law that guarantees those in the UK protection under the European convention on human rights. In apologising to Miller, the Sun and News of the World would undoubtedly have been guided by Eady's decision to award Max Mosley \u00a360,000 in damages against the News of the World. Eady, the high court's specialist judge on libel and privacy, has presided over almost all of the most high-profile cases in recent years, making him an obvious target for tabloids reeling from the effects of these decisions. Alongside the \"wretched Human Rights Act\", Dacre described Eady as a frightening example of what \"one judge with a subjective and highly relativist moral sense can do ... with a stroke of his pen\". However the actual law on privacy was not created by Judge Eady or any other judge, but by parliament when it introduced the Human Rights Act. The act affords special protection for freedom of the press but also requires invasions of privacy to be justified, for example by showing that the information is in the public interest. Had there been sufficient evidence to support the claim that Mosley's orgy did have a Nazi theme, for example, the News of the World might have passed this test. This essentially creates a balancing act between the interests of the press and the public at large, and the interests of individuals. If the press, and the tabloids in particular, reveal information that is in the public interest and responsibly reported, they will be in a strong position. Nor is this a new exercise for the courts. As far back as 1849, Prince Albert and Queen Victoria were able to use the common law of \"breach of confidence\" to prevent a publisher who had got hold of their private etchings from turning them into catalogues and prints on a similar basis. This is not to say that the courts, and judges such as Eady, do not get the exercise wrong. When they do, parties frequently appeal to the court of appeal, the House of Lords, and the European court of human rights, whose decisions are capable of prompting parliament to act if legislative change is needed. No one judge is capable of accruing the power under the English legal system to make the law with a \"stroke of his pen\", as Dacre put it. Dacre described Mosley's behaviour, which the News of the World was in effect fined for reporting, as the \"very abrogation of civilised behaviour of which the law is supposed to be the safeguard\". In fact the role of the civil law is not to decide what amounts to acceptable behaviour, sexual or otherwise, but to balance competing rights on a case-by-case basis. The last time parliament seriously considered creating a statutory scheme to deal with privacy was in the 1970s, when a committee chaired by Kenneth Younger took 40 meetings and two years to decide that to do so would be unpalatably complex. Which is why parliament has so far left it to judges like Eady to implement the legal principles instead, one case at a time."
