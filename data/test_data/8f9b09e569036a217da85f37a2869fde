  "content": "A Sunday newspaper went to the court of appeal yesterday to try to lift a ban on exposing the sexual affairs of a top Premiership footballer, in a landmark case on the right to privacy. The case, presided over by England's top judge, the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, is expected to clarify the extent to which the Human Rights Act has created a new right, apart from the existing law of confidence, to keep the details of one's private life secret. The married footballer, who won a high court injunction last September barring \"kiss and tell\" stories by two women, claims he has a right under the longstanding law of confidence to keep his sex secrets under wraps. Under that law, certain relationships, such as marriage and long-term sexual relationships, carry a duty of confidentiality - but it is unclear how far transient relationships are protected. His lawyers also argue that article 8 of the European convention on human rights, incorporated into English law by the Human Rights Act, gives him a right to privacy. The Sunday People, which wants to publish details of the footballer's casual affairs with two women - a lapdancer and a nursery nurse - is asking the court of appeal to lift the ban. Richard Spearman QC, representing the Sunday People, said there was \"widespread public concern\" over where the line should be drawn over publishing details of people's private lives. He told the three appeal judges: \"It is now and has been for many, many years the position that people who engage in sexual affairs are entitled to communicate their participation in these affairs not only to friends and relatives but also to biographers, in autobiographies and diaries\". He said the exploits of footballers often found their way into the newspapers. \"We ask the question what is the difference, if someone goes to a bar, club and restaurant, between engaging in unpleasant, loutish behaviour and engaging in sexual behaviour. The answer we would give is none at all.\" He went on: \"A footballer who goes to a lapdancing club - a club which is engaged in providing sexual services - and is seen there night after night and then takes one of the girls out clubbing, dancing and drinking into the small hours, all that is reportable. \"So where is the press to draw the line between reporting that and reporting that these two are engaged in a sexual relationship?\" He said the footballer was not an ordinary private individual but a public figure and role model. \"We say it is a matter for the public who ought to be told about it. \"This was not a love affair but a case where people came together on a highly transient basis for simple sexual gratification and then separated.\" Mr Spearman said the footballer had admitted that the relationships were no more than \"a simple case of casual philandering.\" He had told one of the women he was married and she was \"not bothered\". Alastair Wilson QC, representing the footballer, said that when two people entered a sexual relationship, both parties were \"put on notice that this is something which is confidential\". Both had a duty to remain silent \"once the bedroom door is closed and the rest of the world is shut out\". The hearing continues."
