  "content": "88% of community organisations admit they're not doing enough to make technology work for them and the communities they serve, research gathered by the Online Centres Foundation has shown. While 92% of respondents believed technology could help them do more, 68% said that they don't make full use of digital tools because they don't have time. Another reason given for not making the most of technology was lack of staffing, with 42% of the more than 100 community organisations surveyed saying that they did not make the most of technology because of limited staffing levels. Of all the respondents, 23% said that they were not using digital tools because they didn't know where to start. The top platforms used by community organisations surveyed were Facebook and Linkedin, while tools for fundraising online were less often used. Conference Chair Lord Knight says: \"Technology has the power to changes lives - but it can be most effective when it enables people and communities to change the way they work.\" What do you think? Is your grassroots organisation using technology in an innovative way? Let us know. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. To join the voluntary sector network, click here."
