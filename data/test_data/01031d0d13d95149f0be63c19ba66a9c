  "content": "Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler on Wednesday hopped on Reddit while eating chips and salsa to answer questions in its Ask Me Anything (AMA) section. She was on the site to promote her new memoir Yes Please, which was released on Tuesday. Her message to those on the internet whose questions she couldn't answer: \"Live long and prosper. Battlestations at the ready. Don't believe the hype. And surfboard.\" The full transcript is here. 1. She would like to play a suffragette \u2026 who likes to party If she was on the Comedy Central show Drunk History and had to play a character from history, she said: \"Oh, I guess, I feel I don't know anyone's history well enough, but I would pick \u2026 maybe a suffragette who liked to party?\" 2. And Penelope Cruz, if she could play only one character for the rest of her life \"You know, I think, one time I had to play some, some foolish writer cast me as Penelope Cruz, even though she and I have very little in common. I would like to say I wouldn't mind staying as Penelope Cruz and I think America would agree.\" 3. Don't use pickup lines on her. Poehler said the one that would work every time is: \"Are you tired? You should leave this party and go to sleep.\" \"Oh, you're right! Thanks! Bye!\" 4. Her karoake song \"Um \u2026 my go-to karaoke song is We Didn't Start the Fire by Billy Joel. Sung in Spanish. And in a very high key.\" 5. She is more cynical than her Parks and Recreation character Leslie Knope \"She's like me, but she works \u2026 we're like each other, I should say, but I think I've become a little bit more cynical than her. I think she reminds me to keep an open mind and to go big or go home.\" 6. How rapping shaped her career \"Well, you know, look \u2013 do I think I'm the best in the game? No. But do I think I'm one of the best? Absolutely. Do I consider myself better than Nas? Totally. Am I a better MC than Jay-Z? We. Shall. See. At the end of the day, I'm just \u2026 trying to keep it real. From the heart, and spit like a master.\" 7. The most rewarding piece of advice she's received \"Maybe 'pay attention to what people do, not what they say.'\" 8. She is probably not a sociopath She had this to say in response to someone asking if she would choose a necklace made of grapes or shoes made of onion: \"A necklace made out of grapes or shoes made out of onions? Oh, I'm gonna have to go with the grapes. Is this some kind of personality test to find out if I'm a sociopath? Who would pick shoes made out of onions? Somebody who's angry at their mom.\" 9. What she does to relax \"Haha! Um \u2026 I relax by running marathons. And I get my energy by base jumping.\" 10. She doesn't mind having a controversial opinion about orange tic-tacs When asked whether she likes or loves them, she said: \"I'm indifferent about that question and those tic-tacs. And I'm sorry if that causes a stir.\""
