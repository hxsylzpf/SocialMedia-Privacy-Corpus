  "content": "Cyber crime is rising fast according to the government, and millions of TalkTalk customers have been left vulnerable after a huge attack. Making matters worse, many people leave themselves open to theft by doing some quite exceptionally daft things on social media sites. Showing off your new bank card You are a teenager and have just been given your very first debit card. Or maybe you have just become a dad and have decided to mark the moment by personalising your bank card with an image of your baby (Barclays is just one of the banks that offers a personalised debit card service). You are so delighted that you can't resist sharing a photo of it on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram. There for everyone to see is your 16-digit number, expiry date, cardholder name, account number and sort code. Congratulations \u2013 you have given fraudsters much of the information they need, whether they're attempting to raid your bank account or commit ID fraud. You might think no one would be daft enough to share a photo of their bank card, but it seems a fair few do. There is even a Twitter account \u2013 with more than 17,000 followers \u2013 that retweets posts that include them, seemingly to name and shame these people for their stupidity. This information on its own may not be enough to ensure you are ripped off \u2013 after all, the scammer hasn't got your pin or the three-digit security code printed on the back of your card. But it's a pretty good start. If your name is unusual and/or there is other information on social media about where you live, it may not be tricky to track down your address. Perhaps the next stage will be a phone call or email from someone pretending to be from your bank or card company informing you of suspicious card activity, where the aim is to get you to disclose your three-digit code. \"Sharing a picture online of your credit/debit card is a surefire way to have your details hacked. You're practically handing your personal information over to a fraudster,\" says John Cannon, fraud and ID director at credit report provider Noddle. Hey everyone, I'm going to the gig! Don't share images of event tickets on social media sites, no matter how ecstatic you are to have snagged a seat for the upcoming Madonna/Libertines/Barry Manilow gig \u2013 particularly if the ticket includes a barcode. Scammers search sites for such posts and are able to create fake tickets by copying the barcode. It means that when you arrive at the gig, you may find that someone who bought one of the fakes has already used it to get in, leaving you stuck outside. AXS, the in-house booking service for London's O2 arena, has even started including a warning in emails: \"Please be aware of how much information is shown on your ticket including the barcode used to gain entry to the venue. Sharing images of your tickets via social media can lead to others being able to gain access with your ticket.\" This issue was highlighted last month when a man claimed he blagged his way into the London premiere of the latest James Bond movie Spectre by creating a fake ticket from an image of a real one posted on Instagram \u2013 though, somewhat confusingly, it was later reported that he had actually bought his ticket from the venue's box office. If you really want to post a photo to let everyone know you're going to an event, cover up the barcode and any identifying information, says Luke Evetts, a legal adviser at law firm DAS Law. Flashing the cash A lot of the advice on avoiding being scammed can probably be boiled down to three words: beware of oversharing. That particularly applies to anything that might suggest you've got a lot of loot. Take the case of the Australian 17-year-old who, in 2012, posted a picture on her Facebook page of a \"large sum of cash\" she had helped count at her grandmother's home in Sydney. A few hours later, masked robbers broke in to the family's home and demanded to know where the money was being kept, before making off with cash and some personal property. Sharing every tiny detail of your life Many people have their date of birth on their social media profile, even though identity fraud experts say you shouldn't. Also, don't big up your birthday in posts or tweets (though it's not clear what you can do about other people wishing you many happy returns). If your Facebook/Twitter/Instagram is stuffed to the gills with references to your kids, pets, favourite sports team etc, it's probably not a good idea to use these for passwords and \"memorable words\". And be vague about where you went to school, avoiding specific dates. \"People looking at your social footprint might not always be a curious ex-partner, an old colleague or someone you met at uni. They could be someone much more sinister,\" Cannon adds. \"Most social media platforms offer straightforward instructions on making your page secure, so make sure you check them. Don't assume your account is protected.\""
