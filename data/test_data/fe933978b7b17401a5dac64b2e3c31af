  "content": "Solicitors acting for Hugh Grant and Jemima Khan are taking legal action against the Daily Mail over an article about their relationship printed at the weekend. The Four Weddings and a Funeral actor and his heiress girlfriend have instructed London solicitors Schillings to begin legal proceedings against the Mail over an article on Saturday May 3 headlined \"I never knew he was such a good actor.\" The pair claim the article is \"false and defamatory\" of each of them and have filed a libel complaint with the Daily Mail accordingly. Today, the Daily Mail has run an article by columnist Richard Kay - flagged up on the front page - that Grant and Khan have been engaged for six months. In a letter warning other newspapers of the alleged libel, Schillings said the as central allegation in the article about Grant and Khan \"constitutes the entire, specious, basis for the remainder of the article it follows that the numerous allegations including supposed quotes from sources are false and indeed fabricated\". The newspaper was contacted by MediaGuardian.co.uk about the complaint but had not responded by the time of publication. Schillings represented Wayne Rooney in his libel action against the Sun and the News of the World, which saw the two papers pay the footballer \u00a3100,000 in damages, as well as Teri Hatcher in her successful claim against the Sun newspaper and Heat magazine over false claims about her private life. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
