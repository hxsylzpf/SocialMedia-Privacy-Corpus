  "content": "The Channel 4 and Facebook websites made significant gains in users during May, according to a report. However, the Weather Channel's website posted the largest proportional increase in user numbers - 36% - between April and May. Internet research firm comScore found that Channel 4 posted the second largest month-on-month increase in unique users among UK media websites in May, thanks to the launch of Big Brother 8. Social networking site Facebook continued its inexorable rise in UK popularity with a 30% growth in visitor numbers from April to May. The website, which was the third biggest gainer in terms of the percentage increase in UK unique users, has now grown by more than 30% for three months in a row. Hearst Digital Network UK, which operates sites for Cosmopolitan, Men's Health and Esquire, grew by 21% between April and May. Trinity Mirror Group posted a 15% rise in visitor traffic from April to May. The Guardian Unlimited network of websites ranked 17th in the top 20 UK online media operations in terms of month-on-month growth in May. GU's unique user figure grew by 14%. ComScore said this was probably driven \"by its recent site redesign as well as the news of Tony Blair's departure from office\". BSkyB and Bebo were the two largest websites - in terms of the overall number of unique users - to make the list of top 20 sites for percentage visitor growth. Sky's unique user base increased by 17% while Bebo boosted its numbers by 13%. The launch of the Kate Moss fashion line for TopShop accounted for a surge in traffic to parent company Arcadia Group's website, which enjoyed a 17% boost in unique users. ComScore's figures are based on a panel of users aged 15-plus who access the web at home or work. It excludes traffic from public computers - including those in internet cafes or schools - mobile phones or personal digital assistants such as BlackBerrys. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
