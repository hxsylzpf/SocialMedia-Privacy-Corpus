  "content": "Downing Street was last night embroiled in a new row with sections of the British press over coverage of the prime minister's summer holiday after the publication yesterday of photographs of his family attending church. There was confusion over whether or not Downing Street had given permission for newspapers to publish pictures of Tony and Cherie Blair and their children after they arrived in France for the second leg of their summer holiday. Some newspapers claimed they had been given \"guidance\" about publishing the pictures of the family in St Martin-d'Oydes, a village near Toulouse, but a No 10 spokesman yesterday denied that permission had been given. He then added to the confusion when he said the prime minister acknowledged French media interest in the Blairs' arrival in France and that there was nothing the prime minister could do when dozens of French photographers arrived outside the church. And, contradicting Downing Street pronouncements last week, criticising British newspapers for following up reports in the Italian press about Euan Blair's alleged holiday antics, the spokesman acknowledged that it would have been \"absurd\" for the pictures to appear in the French press and across Europe but not in Britain. Yesterday, the spokesman did, however, appeal to newspaper editors to respect the family's privacy and not to use any further unauthorised pictures taken by freelance photographers who continued to follow the Blairs. He said: \"All we ask is that if you receive more pictures from France, that you do not use them. That would not be in the spirit or the letter of the agreement with Lord Wakeham [the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission].\" The more conciliatory approach taken by Downing Street yesterday appears to be timed ahead of the release on Thursday of Euan's GCSE results. The grades will be sent to the London Oratory school 24 hours before they are published, but a Downing Street spokesman said yesterday that the 16-year-old's grades would not be released by No 10. The latest row over the holiday followed a bruising weekend confrontation between the Blairs and the media. Mr and Mrs Blair are understood to be considering making a formal complaint over newspaper claims that Euan and two friends woke hotel guests on the island of Ponza with their rowdy behaviour. The dispute between the Blairs and the press over what constitutes legitimate coverage of the prime minister's family has intensified following Euan's arrest for being \"drunk and incapable\" in Leicester Square, London, and unauthorised pictures of baby Leo's christening, despite pleas for it to be treated as a private occasion. Lord Wakeham is looking into a complaint about press coverage of the christening."
