  "content": "A committee of MPs has called for junk food ads to be banned from running in popular shows such as The X Factor as part of a tightening of UK ad rules to tackle the growing issue of childhood obesity. A House of Commons select committee has published a report into child obesity that makes a range of recommendations including extending a junk food ad ban across social media, the internet, cinemas, in print, 'advergames' and posters. The 57-page report calls on the government to take \"brave and bold action\" to tackle the growing issue of obesity in the UK, particularly among children, which is estimated to cost the NHS \u00a35.1bn each year. \"One third of children leaving primary school are overweight or obese, and the most deprived children are twice as likely to be obese than the least deprived,\" said Dr Sarah Wollaston MP, the chair of the health committee. \"There are many causes and no one single or simplistic approach will provide the answer. We therefore urge the prime minister to make a positive and lasting difference to children's health and life chances through bold and wide ranging measures within his childhood obesity strategy.\" The committee called for TV ad restrictions on products high in fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) to be extended to a complete ban before 9pm. Current restrictions stop advertisers running commercials in programmes that are likely to have more than a certain proportion of young people watching them. \"The argument for such an extension is that the current restrictions miss much of the TV children watch outside specific children's programming, but during 'family' viewing time \u2013 for example programmes such as The X-Factor \u2013 which are shown early on a Saturday and Sunday evening,\" said the report. The report also said that the current public consultation on junk food advertising being carried out by CAP, the body responsible for setting UK ad rules outside of TV and radio, should result in a wider junk food ad ban. \"The scope of the CAP's forthcoming consultation should not be on whether it should be done, but on how it should be implemented following clear direction from the government within the childhood obesity strategy,\" the report said. The report identified nine areas where there could be tougher measures to help tackle obesity, including introducing a 20% tax on full-sugar drinks, stopping \"buy-one-get-one-free\" deals on unhealthy food, and tightening loopholes surrounding the use of unlicensed but commonly recognised cartoon characters and celebrities in children's advertising. The Advertising Association criticised the health committee for not taking evidence from the industry saying that the report reflected a \"narrow\" perspective. \"The bigger picture is that food advertising in the UK is amongst the most strictly regulated in the world, children see far fewer HFSS ads on TV today than ever before and new rules already being considered would mean no advertising targeted at children in any media,\" said Ian Barber, director of communications at the Advertising Association. \"A 9pm watershed is an analogue measure for a digital age that would hit programme budgets hard, even on channels with few or no children watching.\"",
