  "content": "Google's new head of social media, David Besbris, has denied rumours that the tech giant's Google+ social network is to bow out quietly any time soon, after the surprise exit of longtime social boss Vic Gundotra in April. In an interview with Re/code's Kurt Wagner, Besbris said that people underestimated the connection Google+ has with its users, and put Google+ at the top of his priority list after photos and Google Hangouts. Underlining a long-term commitment to the social network, he said: I don't think of it as an end game, I think we're in social \u2014 like we're in everything at Google \u2014 for the long haul. We said this at the beginning of the company, we make long-term bets, we make long-term decisions. Social is a whole aspect of computing, much like any other area you would imagine at Google. Behind every one of these screens is a user, it's an actual person. People are social creatures, they want to share things, they want to learn from each other, they want to ask questions. That's really important for us as a company \u2026 Google+, unveiled in June 2011, is currently ad-free. Besbris said he would not rule out introducing adverts to Google+ in the future, though he expressed doubts about how helpful they are to users: You want to show an ad when it's most relevant, when it's valuable. If you don't, the ads won't be great ads. They won't convert well, they won't be beneficial and it kind of just pollutes the space. I think for a social place that tends to be very intimate, where you're having conversations with people, you're sharing pictures, you're exploring things you're really into, you don't want to be \u2026 bombarded with noise. Asked how his leadership style would differ from Gundotra's, Besbris joked that he wore jackets, while Gundotra favoured sweaters. He also stonewalled when asked about the number of active Google+ users. \"I don't want to talk about numbers\", he responded. It has been almost a year since the company last disclosed monthly active user (MAU) figures for its social network, claiming in October that it had 540 million worldwide. This figure, however, incorporated anybody who had commented on YouTube, or a website or blog with Google+ comments embedded. The number of actual \"in-stream\" MAUs \u2013 those who visited the direct content stream of Google+ \u2013 was significantly lower, at 300 million."
