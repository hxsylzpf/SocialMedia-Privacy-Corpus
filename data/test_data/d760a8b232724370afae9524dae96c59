  "content": "Former Manus Island guards employed by the security company G4S have designed a \"survivor\" T-shirt to commemorate the February unrest at the asylum seeker detention centre. Comments posted on Facebook discussing the proposed design reveal the former guards have considered placing the emblem \"rock fest 16/17 Feb\" on the shirts, a reference to the fact rocks were thrown during the unrest in February at the Papua New Guinea centre, which left the asylum seeker Reza Barati dead. Grant Potter, a former G4S supervisor on Manus Island, created the design posted on Facebook. It says: \"Survivor MIRPC \u2013 outsmart, outlaugh, outfun.\" MIRPC stands for Manus Island Regional Processing Centre. In a comment under the post, which now appears to have been removed, Potter continues: \"I like Rommi's 'Rock fest 16 / 17 FEB 2014' across the bottom wot u think ... ?\", and later describes the caption as a \"play on words\". Other commenters on the thread then interject, describing the caption as poor taste, but another former Manus Island guard, Shane Fisher, responds, \"Rock fest works lol\", and later describes criticism of the caption as \"THAT CANCER CALLED POLITICAL CORRECTNESS ??\". Fisher, who Guardian Australia understands is still employed by G4S in Victoria, then suggests \"a cross hairs running through the O for affect [apparently in the word survivor]\". Potter then responds to the criticism of political correctness by suggesting \"we all get 'CUNT' t-shirts\", and continues, \"not like I'd wear it into a mosque (or would I ?)\". The comments appear to have been removed from Facebook. It is unclear whether the T-shirts have been made. In January Guardian Australia revealed three G4S guards on Manus Island used Facebook to ridicule an asylum seeker who had harmed himself. Darren Powell, a G4S supervisor, published a status update that read: \"Merry Christmas all. One of these jokers just swallowed a pair of nail clippers on Christmas Day.\" Powell was subsequently sacked by G4S, which also vowed to strengthen training of staff for dealing with asylum seekers experiencing mental health problems. A spokesman for G4S said the company was reviewing the posts on Facebook and \"takes matters of inappropriate use of social media by our staff very seriously\". \"While we cannot take action against those who no longer work for G4S, we will take appropriate action against current G4S employees that have breached our policies\". The comments underneath the T-shirt design also reveal the exasperation some of the guards felt during their stints on Manus Island. Potter writes: \"we survived malaria, gastro, g4, air nuigea, accomodations, the food, digicel,. Let's make this [the T-shirt] about US and not THEM [asylum seekers].\" He continues, in reference to the unrest on 16 and 17 February, that \"the whole experience was more than two days\". Another former guard responds: \"That's right as a team we went thru months of this stuff and came out still laughing.\" Part of the G4S report into the incident reveals how G4S managers \"lost control\" of local security staff during the rioting. According to reports, two G4S expat guards are wanted for questioning by the PNG police over the violence. The immigration minister Scott Morrison has been contacted for a response. Neither Potter nor Fisher responded to a request for comment."
