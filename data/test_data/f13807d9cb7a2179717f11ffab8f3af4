  "content": "Barry Levinson's 1991 film Bugsy uses powerful cinematography by Allen Daviau to transform a moment of inspiration in the empty desert into a stylish and vibrant Las Vegas hotel several years later. While the historical accuracies of the film have been challenged there can be no doubt that the creation of what we now know as the City of Light required a lot of vision, commitment and leadership. The Flamingo hotel was the spark that lit the desert skies. Comparisons between the growth of Slack and a 1940s Las Vegas hotel should probably stop there. But have no doubt that a fast-growing digital city in the form of the corporate operating system is coming and this week's announcements, the new Slack API and VC fund for apps that use the software, may very well be what lights it up. I've worked on projects using a range of team chat apps over the years. ICQ and Google Talk were adopted from the ground up. Yammer and others were pushed from the top down. But they were usually ancillary to the job and dropped at some point. Slack's ridiculous adoption rate is a signal that this time it's different. It went viral, and it just keeps going. In its first six months its daily active users went from zero to 15,000. Over the following 12 months it brought in over 100,000 paid accounts and hit a $12m annual run rate. Only 10 months later Slack just reported it serves 2 million daily active users and now collects from half a million paid accounts on the platform. The word platform has taken on many meanings. According to a famous 2007 blogpost by Marc Andreessen a platform is \"a system that can be programmed and therefore customised by outside developers \u2013 users \u2013 and in that way, adapted to countless needs and niches that the platform's original developers could not have possibly contemplated, much less had time to accommodate\". The context for Andreessen's post then was the launch of Facebook's similarly explosive plug-in style API. In the first month after Facebook released its API 10 of the applications created for it had been adopted by 1 million people. Facebook had about 30 million users at the time. The new Slack API is very similar. In Andreessen's language, it is a level two platform, an environment that lets third-party developers tap into Slack resources to offer services to Slack users. Whereas a developer selling software to organisations normally requires a big budget to gain any kind of traction, Slack's sizeable install base means customer acquisition could grow faster and come at a fraction of the price. It's very attractive to developers. For Slack it means that with every app released the platform gets more interesting. Maybe something as simple as a task management app like Acktodo becomes the reason to sign up for Slack (disclaimer: I'm advising Acktodo). And then customisations using Slack's own Botkit tools become the reason an organisation stays. By opening up access this deep into the platform and its user experience Slack has exponentially expanded the number of features it can offer users and the size of its workforce. Of course the past successes of open internet platforms are varied. Many have disappeared. And many that are still around closed down their platforms and turned away the developers that helped make the platforms successful. Facebook and Twitter have both struggled to get this right, infuriating developers when they close down access. None of the Facebook apps released in 2007 are around anymore because Facebook changed their strategy. Indeed Slack leaves the door open to shut things down in the future, too. Their otherwise clever and very progressive terms of service state: \"We reserve the right to deactivate and delete your account and terminate this TOS at any time for any reason, or no reason, with or without notice.\" But Slack makes money as more customers sign up for it. More tools means more reasons to pay. Will they still feel that way when Slack gets really huge? A Slack spokesperson said: \"Slack is focused on the enterprise and our business model is paid licensing. So, unlike most consumer platforms, we don't have to rely on advertising, which can cause conflicts of interest. And, just as important, we're deeply committed to supporting developers who are building for Slack, because the more rich and diverse our [app] ecosystem is, the better it is for our customers.\" Slack made a very smart move by launching an investment fund to support new third-party apps along with the new app directory announcement. Rather than commission apps or provide marketing support that can easily be written off in the future they have decided to invest in businesses to the tune of $80m. And they have named the fund \"Slack Fund I\" suggesting there will be more money in the future. Investing in businesses creates deeper level incentives to support an ecosystem of partners in a way that the advertising-based social networks have been unable to commit to. If I were a betting man I would put money on a future where Slack becomes like a utility provider for the world's distributed workforces. They've been consistently bold and visionary in an area that seemed really dry and boring until now. If users keep arriving at this pace and if the company stays committed to developers then Slack could become more than a fancy hotel that inspires a new kind of city. Slack could become a city at the centre of a new economy. Matt McAlister is co-founder of Publish.org.
