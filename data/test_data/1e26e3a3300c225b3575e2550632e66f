  "content": "Like many people of a certain age, I recently began using Snapchat, after years of shunning it in favor of social media apps designed for people who still type with all their fingers and not just their thumbs. And I'm not alone. Of the 150 million people who use Snapchat each day, the number of US users over 35 has increased from 2% in 2013 to 14% today, we learned this week from ComScore. After years of wondering what all the fuss was about, the over-35s have finally found a good reason to use the now-you-see-it, now-you-don't photo service: it annoys the hell out of our teens. Revenge, as they say, is sweet. Take Chris Martin (not the lead singer of Coldplay), for example. He decided to mock his daughter's \"sexy\" Snapchat photos with a few of his own, right down to the inevitable duck-faced pout and starburst tattoo. The comedian's snaps went viral, winning him thousands of fans in the process, though it's unlikely any are below the age of 35. To her credit, daughter Cassie (AKA Bambi) Martin used one of her dad's Snapmocks as her cover photo on Facebook \u2013 most likely because she wanted to make sure her grandparents saw it. A slightly researched investigative study by the Guardian conducted mostly on Facebook revealed a quiet conspiracy of quasi-oldsters who use Snapchat for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is tormenting their children. Tishin Donkersley, director of audience engagement at the media events company Tech.co, uses Snapchat to communicate with her son and daughter, aged 15 and 14 respectively. Donkersley, who admits to being north of 40, says her kids are OK with this most of the time. Still, she caught a fair amount of grief when she used Snapchat's face swap tool to trade mugs with Anslee, her three-year-old Jack Russell. \"My kids thought that was really embarrassing,\" she says. \"That, and when I use Snapchat filters. They shake their heads and say: 'Really, mom?' But my daughter's friends think I'm the coolest mom alive.\" Then there is Maureen Tricario, 56, who describes herself as a \"former slave\" at Verizon, used Snapchat to insert herself into a slice of wheat toast and shared it with her son (who at age 30 is no spring chicken himself). \"This is why we're not Facebook friends,\" he replied. Thirty-eight-year-old video performance artist Davison (who goes simply by Davison, kind of like Beyonc\u00e9) uses Snapchat to help promote her \"sexy comedy\" YouTube channel, LOLpervs. The height (or possibly depth) of her Snapchat career has been using Snapchat's animation tools to cause a rainbow to cascade from her hindquarters: Davison claims her 15-year-old son doesn't care what she does on Snapchat. I would imagine when your mom runs a racy YouTube channel called LOLpervs, being constantly mortified just comes with the territory. Barak Kassar, 50, who runs his own digital branding company, is another fan of Snapchat's face-transmogrifying technology. As an example, he combined his visage with mine. \"I have teens,\" he says. \"I use Snapchat to talk with them sometimes. Sometimes they are amused. Sometimes they think I'm the lamest thing ever. The face-swapping is probably the coolest thing in tech since Wi-Fi on planes.\" The natural teen reaction to this is to either block mom and/or dad or abandon the service entirely \u2013 as so many of their older siblings did when their parents finally discovered The Facebook. And Snapchat itself claims to welcome the growing demographic, no doubt welcoming its spending power too. I asked my son, who turns 20 this month, if he's OK with me and members of my generation moving in on his Snapchat territory. His response: \"Well, I suppose I'm fine with it. We young people need to have another social media migration anyway.\" When I asked him where he'd go next, he demurred. \"I don't really keep up with what's new in social media,\" he says. But he can't fool me. He's just afraid if he tells me, I'll follow him \u2013 and bring all my electronic elders with me."
