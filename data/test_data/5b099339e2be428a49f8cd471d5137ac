  "content": "Searching for a hairdresser? An affordable restaurant? A quality massage? You've probably used Yelp \u2013 or some other online review site. But it was only a matter of time before some of these reviewers got caught out being economical with the truth. In order to highlight the growing prevalence of fake reviews, usually called 'astroturfing', the attorney general in New York set up a fake yoghurt shop in a sting called Operation Clean Turf. Eric Schneiderman announced on Monday that 19 companies had commissioned fake reviews on popular online sites. They were fined a total of $350,000.  But this just scratches the surface, so you'll still need to search with caution; there are 42 million reviews to sift through on Yelp alone, and as many as 90% of consumers rely on online reviews before purchasing online. Here's our guide to what a shady internet review looks like:  Avoid the hyperbolic review  Spare us the flowery description \u2013 if you can't see someone saying it in a normal conversation, chances are it's bogus. Here are a couple of examples from La Pomme nightclub, one of the places listed in the sting:  Avoid the cliches and search for detail \u2013 that's what reviews are for. Here's another gem from La Pomme's page, which, by the way, still only manages to net two and a half stars.  Watch for crazy spelling \u2013 and punctuation Did your mother ever tell you not to trust people who can't spell? (If she didn't, she meant to.)  Which brings us to punctuation. There's no need to get trigger-happy with your exclamation points. The following are from the Medical Massage Clinic in Flushing \u2013 also on the attorney general's naughty list:  The nonsense factor Is this next one really necessary? This one's from Metamorphosis Day Spa:  More foolproof tips: Read through the review. The more reliable reviews are often not the first ones you see \u2013 like this example of US Coachways, one of the companies caught in the sting. If there are comments that express confusion or bewilderment, look elsewhere. Also, on Yelp, check out the filtered tab, where companies can bump reviews from the main reviews listing. Check the reviewer's account history. A quick check on the reviewer's account can't hurt. If they only have one review up or if every one of their reviews has five stars, you might want to get a second opinion.  Make IRL friends. That way, if you lose an eyebrow or if the gurney is not up to your standards, you have someone to blame. "
