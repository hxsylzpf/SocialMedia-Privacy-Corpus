  "content": "The Home Office has questioned the decision by Scotland Yard's assistant commissioner, John Yates, not to reopen his phone-hacking investigation, an exchange of letters placed in the House of Commons library today reveals. Stephen Rimmer, the Home Office's director general of crime and policing, wrote to Yates asking what the Met was doing about the allegations about the involvement of 27 other journalists and whether the police would be informing all those allegedly targeted, and not just those whose phones were sucessfully tapped. Yates's reply, sent the same day, said he had not conducted a review and that he had only been asked by the Met Commissioner to establish the facts in the light of the Guardian's articles in connection with the 2005 police investigation that led to the conviction of News of the World journalist Clive Goodman and private investigator Glen Mulcaire. \"In relation to any wider issues, I have not been asked to consider any other cases. I wish to also make clear that the MPS [the Met] has not received any specific allegations in relation to the activities of any other journalists.\" Yates's confirmation that the original investigation did not cover any other journalists has fuelled demands at Westminster for Scotland Yard to reopen its investigation. It is understood the Commons home affairs select committee is also likely to open its own investigation into the police failure to look into the wider allegations unless it receives a satisfactory explanation by the end of this week. The home secretary, Alan Johnson, told MPs that he believed the review being carried out by the Director of Public Prosecutions into all evidence and individuals involved in the original 2005/06 investigation would be completed quickly. He resisted calls from Labour MP Martin Salter for a full public inquiry to take over all the current investigations into the phone-hacking allegations. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
