  "content": "The confidentiality of medical records is threatened by government plans to relax laws on data protection, doctors' leaders told the Guardian yesterday. Dr Hamish Meldrum, chairman of the British Medical Association, said the profession was \"extremely concerned\" about legislation tabled by Jack Straw, the justice secretary, which would allow the Department of Health to share information on NHS databases with other ministries and private companies. Health ministers have no immediate plan to make use of the power, which would give all Whitehall departments a fast-track procedure for getting permission to share data without parliamentary debate. The NHS is proceeding slowly with a scheme to upload the medical records of everyone in England on to a national database known as the Spine. Ministers have given frequent assurances to patients that the information would only be accessed by healthcare staff who need it. But Meldrum said patients could not know whether future ministers would abide by this undertaking. According to the BMA, the trust between doctors and patients would be destroyed if Straw's bill, as it stands, became law. In an interview with the Guardian, Meldrum said: \"The bill gives any minister the right to access patient-identifiable information - and give others access to it. There appears to be no limit to what could be done with this information as long as the minister can make a vague ... justification, claiming that sharing the information is in line with government policy at the time. \"The doctor-patient relationship is built primarily on trust that information is given confidentially and will not normally be shared without the patient's consent. Once we go down the road where that principle can be breached, widespread possibilities could flow.\" The BMA's intervention came as the Royal Free Hospital in north London revealed a \u00a310m hole in its accounts, caused when the NHS provided an untested upgrade of computerised medical records. Andrew Way, the chief executive, said it was unable to bill other parts of the NHS for work done until staff had spent months struggling with the system. The data-sharing power is included in clause 152 of the coroners and justice bill, which is mainly concerned with reform of coroners' courts and death certificates. It would let any minister sign an \"information sharing order\" permitting the passing of data to another department, individual or company if it were \"necessary to secure a relevant policy objective\" and if the order \"strikes a fair balance between the public interest and the interests of any person affected by it\". But doctors fear that in future ministers may see a public interest in making medical records available to vet recruits or check people seeking benefits. Until now public bodies have not been allowed to pass on personal data - or let information collected for one purpose be used for another- without fresh primary legislation. Meldrum said he was not satisfied by safeguards in the bill that would give the information commissioner three weeks to comment on a data-sharing proposal, giving MPs an opportunity to vote it down. \"I have not seen an argument why they need this general power,\" he said. The Information Commissioner's Office, the independent authority for data protection, called for \"much stronger safeguards in the bill to protect sensitive data, such as health records\". The Ministry of Justice said data would be shared only \"in circumstances where the sharing of the information is in the public interest and proportionate to the impact on any person adversely affected by it\". The Department of Health added it was \"important to ensure that patient confidentiality is preserved and that patients consent to how their records are used\"."
