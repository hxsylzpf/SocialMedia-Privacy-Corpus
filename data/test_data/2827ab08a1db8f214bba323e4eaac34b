  "content": "Mashable has struck a deal with France 24, the international news and current affairs public service broadcaster, to launch a French-language version of the social media news site. The new website, which will be called Mashable avec France 24, will be equally financially backed by the two companies as well as receiving support from Google's innovation fund set up as part of its Digital News Initiative to support publishers. The site aims to combine Mashable's content with the broadcaster's in-depth local coverage, existing digital audience and video distribution capability. \"Launching in France is a big moment for Mashable as we continue to expand globally and form strategic partnerships that can accelerate our growth in new markets,\" said Adam Ostrow, chief strategy officer at Mashable. \"France 24's long track record of excellence in both video and news makes them the perfect partner.\" France 24 broadcasts three channels globally \u2013 French, Arabic and English \u2013 with a weekly audience of 50 million viewers across 180 countries. The new site will have a dedicated editorial team formed from Mashable and France 24 staff to create original text and video stories in French as well as translating and adapting selected other Mashable stories. \"Mashable avec France 24 is a marriage of complementary skills, knowhow and strengths,\" said Marie-Christine Saragosse, chief executive at France 24's parent company France Medias Monde. \"This original digital partnership with players in a new generation of websites is a positive initiative for the French public service. [It is also] a guarantee for the future which brings us closer to young audiences to whom we will deliver a new approach to news.\" The deal marks Mashable's third partnership with an international media company to enter a new market. It follows deals with Telemundo to create ElPulso for the Hispanic community in the US, and mThai to bring Mashable content to the Thai-language audience. In 2014, Mashable opened an office in the UK, its largest market by audience outside the US, its first international office."
