  "content": "Yahoo's admission that the personal data of half a billion users has been stolen by \"state-sponsored\" hackers leaves pressing questions unanswered, according to security researchers. Details, including names, email addresses, phone numbers and security questions were taken from the company's network in late 2014. Passwords were also taken, but in a \"hashed\" form, which prevents them from being immediately re-used, and the company believes that financial information held with it remains safe. The company confirmed the breach in a statement on Thursday night, but its statement, and a follow-up notification sent out to customers on Friday morning, raised as many questions as it answered. Chief among them was why disclosure took so long, both from the date of the hack, almost two years ago, and from the first appearance of the dumped data on the dark web almost two months ago where it was being sold by a user named \"Peace of Mind\", who had also sold dumps of data from MySpace and LinkedIn. Jeremiah Grossman, head of security strategy at infosec firm SentinelOne, said: \"While we know the information was stolen in late 2014, we don't have any indication as to when Yahoo first learned about this breach. This is an important detail in the story.\" Grossman, who ran information security for Yahoo's engineering department until 2001, added that the company's claims that the attacker was \"state-sponsored\" also need additional scrutiny. \"State-sponsored adversaries don't typically publicly share stolen data or sell it, like profiteer hacker 'Peace of Mind'. Peace of Mind was all about selling stolen Yahoo account data, so it's unlikely he was state-sponsored. And if so, this means it's possible we're looking at two different Yahoo breaches with two different hacking groups in their system.\" Chris Hodson, EMEA chief information security officer at enterprise security firm Zscaler, agrees. \"With no technical details included in Yahoo's report about how the data was exfiltrated, just that it was, it's impossible to assess credibility of the 'state sponsored' claim. \"It might well be that Yahoo has had support from government departments and that attribution has been possible but equally, 'state-sponsored' is often prefixed to 'actor' in an effort to suggest sophisticated and surreptitious means of data exfiltration. We simply do not know.\" Equally unclear is the extent to which passwords were protected. Yahoo has confirmed the passwords were hashed, a one-way transformation which allows the site to check that an entered password is correct without needing to store the actual password. The company added that \"the vast majority\" were hashed with bcrypt, a particularly secure method which incorporates a \"salt\" ensuring that two identical passwords still have different entries in the database. That's important for protecting the hundreds of thousands of users who will all have picked \"password\" as a password, since it ensures that they don't all stand out \u2013 but it's unclear whether the minority of users whose passwords weren't hashed in this way have similar protections. The breach also highlights a strong problem with \"security questions\", the common practice of letting users reset passwords by answering questions about their first house or mother's maiden name. Yahoo did not encrypt all the security questions it stored, and so some are readable in plaintext. While it may be irritating to have to change a stolen password, it is somewhat worse to have to change a stolen mother's maiden name. One other question raised by the breach is also unanswered: what happens to the company's multi-billion dollar merger with Verizon now? Kevin Cunningham, president and founder at identity company SailPoint, argues that the breach should already be priced in \u2013 but only if Verizon's due diligence was thorough enough. \"Mergers are complicated endeavors, and the scrutiny under which both companies will reside during the course of the transaction only increases the stress to keep what should be sensitive information protected. Verizon certainly took on a calculated level of risk in acquiring Yahoo!, particularly because of its massive user base. \"The question of whether this breach will affect the sale price depends on how extensively it performed due diligence on Yahoo's security controls. It's a perfect illustration of the fact that this due diligence should include not just network security controls, but also identity governance controls, because as we've seen with LinkedIn, Dropbox and countless others, breaches very often result from compromised employee credentials.\" For users with Yahoo accounts, though, many of these questions are moot. The advice remains the same either way: they need to change their Yahoo password and security questions as soon as possible, and also change the password anywhere else they may have re-used that information. Ideally, they should stop re-using passwords altogether. Since Yahoo is a major webmail provider, there's one extra problem: any further service which has password reset emails sent to a Yahoo Mail account should also be considered compromised, and passwords accordingly changed."
