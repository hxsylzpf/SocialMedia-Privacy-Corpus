  "content": "So the #TwitterJokeTrial finally ends. Two and a half years of anxiety for 27-year-old Paul Chambers. The lord chief justice, Lord Judge (yes, really) read passages in court from a result that entirely cleared Chambers, that said the crown court should not reasonably have upheld his conviction; and that \"mens rea\", or a guilty mind, was not present. If there was no intent to be menacing, then no menace was committed. That seems important. Do terrorists normally announce their intentions by stating \"Crap!\" at the beginning of a tweet, and then jokily threatening to blow up an airport? It is as though successive groups of public authority figures completely abandoned common sense, forgetting entirely about context. It was not only the original conviction, or the hard-to-understand finding of the crown court. There was also the heavy police response to a clear joke \u2013 showing up at Chambers' workplace to arrest him; the airport authorities who noted the tweet and called the police in the first place; and lastly and most importantly, the actions of the Crown Prosecution Service in prosecuting the case to the bitter end. All happening throughout in an atmosphere of complete disbelief from the general public and users of social media. In a way, it wasn't that helpful that this was known as the Twitter joke trial. It might better have been called the obvious joke trial. \"The more one reflects on it,\" the justices state dryly, \"the clearer it becomes that this message did not represent a terrorist threat, or indeed any other form of threat \u2026 the language and punctuation are inconsistent with the writer intending it to be a serious warning.\" Crap! You don't say? For law, the judgment makes clear that Twitter is indeed a public communications network. And threats can be, and are, made over it, as are racist, menacing and obscene communications. But Chambers' complaint was not one of them. Furthermore, he had no evil intent. In court, Lord Judge chose to read out some portions of this judgment, to emphasise them. One part he read out concerns free speech. \"The 2003 [Communications] Act [under which Chambers was initially convicted] did not create interference with the \u2026 essential freedoms of speech and expression.\" Satire, humour, rudeness, even offensive rudeness \"should and no doubt will continue quite undiminished\" by the law. This was a major victory for freedom of expression, and will help to protect us all against future vexatious prosecutions. While Twitter has been agog on the trial and free speech, consider the human cost. A young man stressed out for more than two years over an innocent joke. Arrests at work. Actual conviction. Denial of appeal. Most of all, however, it could not have come to this had the CPS not decided to fight to the very end. At every stage, it was open to the CPS to drop this shameful prosecution. The order for costs was made in favour of Chambers; the CPS should immediately put out a statement explaining exactly how much public money, and how many hours, have been spent pursuing the case. There appears to be an unwelcome Americanisation of prosecutions of late: first, televised press conferences, such as that regarding Chris Huhne, when a person is charged with a criminal offence; and now an illiberal and fundamentally un-British attitude to \"homeland security\", where a light-hearted joke is turned into a two-year ordeal. Our sardonic sense of humour is part of our national character \u2013 the CPS appeared to have wholly lost sight of this. When parliament resumes, I hope the justice select committee will investigate this colossal waste of public money and attack on free speech. They will not, however, be able to give Chambers back two and a half years of his life, embroiled in extraordinary stress over nothing."
