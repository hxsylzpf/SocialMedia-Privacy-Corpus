  "content": "Nigerians have welcomed Facebook's move to switch on its Safety Check feature for people affected in the country's north-east after a string of suicide bombings by Islamist group Boko Haram. \"After the Paris attacks last week, we made the decision to use safety check for more tragic events like this going forward,\" founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a post on his Facebook page. The move comes after criticism of the social network for choosing to activate the feature after last week's Paris attacks, but ignoring other recent atrocities in countries such as Kenya, Nigeria and Somalia. Tahir Sherriff, an Abuja-based journalist, said Nigerians had been asking questions of the world's media: \"People are being killed everywhere so what's special about France? Who is the judge on what gets a larger coverage and what doesn't?... Are some human beings more important than others?\" Reacting to the news, Memunat Ibrahim, a student at the University of Jos, eight hours away from the city of Yola, praised the decision. \"Finally, Facebook decides to empathise with us,\" he said. Ibrahim's brother, Samaila, who is based in Lagos, logged on to his desktop on Wednesday morning to find three notifications from friends in Yola who had been \"marked safe\" after the attacks, and described it as a relief. \"It seems insignificant but it was good to hear from them, and let's give Facebook credit for that.\" More than 30 people were killed and dozens wounded when a bomb ripped through a busy marketplace. Last month, 27 people were killed by the Islamist group when a bomb targeted a mosque in Jambutu, a district of Yola. Positive reception The security check feature, which allows any user of the site present in an area affected by a disaster or attack to mark that they are safe, has been greeted as a show of respect from the social networking site. \"It doesn't help locate most people but it is a sign of respect for our people. It's Facebook's attempt to listen and show solidarity,\" said Ndi Kato, an Abuja-based activist. \"With the increase of the use of cheap smartphones across the country, who knows what other features could arise in the future to help save people's lives,\" he said. Uwem Uwemakpan, a Lagos-based systems analyst, said switching on the feature was \"the most logical thing to do from a security point of view\". \"[It's good] they are trying to calm frayed nerves by starting with Paris, giving users the confidence that someone is looking out for them.\" But others have voiced criticism. Asauten Anderibom, a banker in Jimeta, the part of Yola where Tuesday's bombings occurred, saw that he had been ticked safe but sees no benefits to the feature. \"What is the implication? How did Facebook know I was [really] safe?\" he asks. Other users have complained that the function isn't accurate. After half a dozen calls from friends who saw that she had been \"marked safe\" on Facebook, Mya Muhammad, a recent graduate of the American University of Yola, logged on to the site. \"I was shocked to get calls from friends who asked what I was doing in Yola again, even though I'm in Abuja. \"Apparently Facebook just marked me 'safe' because my location was still showing Yola, even though I left months ago,\" she explained. Nigeria's north-east has been terrorised by attacks from the militant group in recent years. In 2014, the group were reported to have killed 6,644 in the country.",
