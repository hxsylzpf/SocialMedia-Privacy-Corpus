  "content": "We start this week with a stonker of a video that has had nearly 30m views. Look Up's gentle love story might aim to persuade you to stop concentrating on your mobile phone, but it has taken the online world by storm and has been shared widely across social media. Sharing opinions \u2013 or trading insults \u2013 is the theme of our second clip, which shows The Walking Dead's Rick Grimes going head to head with Breaking Bad's Walter White for an epic rap battle. We've got a couple of big names letting their hair down this week: Kevin Spacey joins Jimmy Fallon and the Ragtime Gals for a rendition of Jason Derulo's hit song Talk Dirty and Andrew Garfield makes his public performance as a singer/guitarist with the theme from The Amazing Spider-man 2. It's the final of Eurovision on Saturday, so we end on a flashback to the 2009 winner, Alexander Rybak from Norway, a video that has been watched more than 56m times. Enjoy!
