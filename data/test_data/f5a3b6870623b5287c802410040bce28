  "content": "The Times has launched a standalone Tumblr blog for free-to-view opinion pieces from star columnists including Daniel Finkelstein and David Aaronovitch. The paper started posting material on its Times Opinion Tumblr blog on Monday in what one insider described as an experiment. Times Opinion will feature teasers for comment pieces that appear on thetimes.co.uk behind the paywall, as well as additional material from selected columnists such as Hugo Rifkind and Oliver Kamm. The move is likely to be seen as a further withdrawal from News International's \u00a32-a-week digital paywall for Times and Sunday Times content, which was taken down over the jubilee weekend and will be removed on key dates during the London Olympics. James Dean, the online opinion editor at the Times and curator of its new Tumblr page, said the idea was to give anyone interested a flavour of what we do for subscribers. He said that the new site \u2013 available at TimesOpinion.Tumblr.com \u2013 did not feature the whole Times Opinion section, which has exclusive cartoons, columns and leader columns. The new site features links to news articles elsewhere on the web and tweets from its big-name writers. Rifkind suggested on Twitter that the Tumblr site was to be used for quick-fire material, rather than full columns: \"Time taken to write a column = 1 day. Time taken to have thought and tumblr about it = 5 mins.\" A spokeswoman for the Times said: \"Like many other publishers we have created a page on the blogging site Tumblr to promote some of our journalism. \"No material that was previously paid has been made free. Our writers will simply give a short taster of what is in the Opinion section and link to other interesting opinion writing on the web.\" News International charges \u00a32 a week for web-only access to the Times and up to \u00a36 per week for seven days of newspapers combined with internet and tablet access. The Times has about 120,000 digital subscribers, with 114,000 people subscribing to the Sunday Times, according to figures published in February. Dominic Carter, commercial director at News International, said in May that the Times and Sunday Times' had 297,000 total print and digital subscribers. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
