Anyway, fab Frost is busy starring in an BBC2 adaptation of Martin Amis's Money. And he's so busy he's not even got time to tweet. Well, almost. \"I'm not on tweet strike!\" he tells his 55,610 followers. \"I'm in every scene so I'm up at 6 home at 9. It leaves little time for anything else. Sorry.\" Up at 6? Home at 9? Who'd be an actor?",
