  "content": "It's been one of the biggest annual fixtures of the year since 1837 for Yorkshire's farming community with this year's due to be the biggest yet as Farming UK reports a record 12,713 entries. And for the first time, the event will also play host to a Social Media Surgery giving practical help and advice on using digital tools and technologies such as blogs and Twitter. So what has farming got to gain from the internet? Guest blogger John Popham explains how he got the event started. \"On July 12th (for one day only), myself and 4 colleagues will be ensconced in the corner of a marquee at the Great Yorkshire Show delivering a Social Media Surgery. I've done lots of Social Media Surgeries, but this one is extra special. \"Social Media Surgeries are a phenomenon which has swept the country over the past two years. Spawned from a very simple idea by ex-BBC journalist Nick Booth in Birmingham, they have now spread to many towns and cities in the country, and are spilling overseas too, including Ireland, South Africa, the Netherlands, and the United States. \"Like all good ideas that spread, the Social Media Surgery is a very basic concept. They are about people who understand social media (Facebook, Twitter, blogs, youtube, etc.) sitting down, on a one-to-one basis if possible, with someone who needs to find out how to use it to communicate their message as a voluntary or community organisation. They are relaxed, friendly sessions, and, when I am running one, I always say to the Advisers (or \"Surgeons\") that they have two eyes and one mouth, and thus should listen twice as much as they talk. \"And, most importantly, the \"geek-speak\" is kept to a minimum, the Surgeries are about helping people who are often making first nervous forays into the world of social media to find a voice with which to communicate with the people they aim to serve. \"The spread of Social Media Surgeries has to date been largely an urban phenomenon. This is probably a question of scale as much as anything. There have been a few successful rural forays, including a very busy event held in the community-owned pub in Hudswell, near Richmond, but, by and large, it has proved difficult to get enough people together in the countryside for a viable Surgery. \"But, the one time of the year when large numbers of people from rural Yorkshire gather in one place is for the Great Yorkshire Show, held over three days in Harrogate every July. So, I had the idea a couple of years ago to try to run a Surgery at the Show. It has only become possible this year due to the support of the Country Land Owners and Business Association (CLA). The CLA provided some sponsorship for Twicket - the first ever live broadcast of a village cricket match, which I organised in Wray in Lancashire on Easter Monday. This led to a conversation during which an offer was made of a corner of the CLA marquee (Stand 193) at the Show in which to run a Social Media Surgery. World's First \"This is another world's first. I am really looking forward to talking Twitter among the tractors, cows and animal feeds. I believe it is one of life's supreme ironies that rural communities, which probably have most need of modern technology to keep in touch and break down the barriers of distance, are, with a very few exceptions, the least likely to be able to use them due to poor internet connectivity. \"People in rural communities often try online social networks but give up as poor rural broadband makes it a very frustrating experience. This is one of the factors we will have to take into account when giving advice at the Show, but there are ways in which people can make use of social media on slow connections. One of the joys of this way of working is that you don't necessarily expect a reply straight away. While it is unfair to restrict people from experiencing the true potential of the social web because of where they live, at least you can make a start by showing people how they might make the best use of the limited bandwidth they have available. \"And, increasing use of the social web in rural communities is one of the factors that will drive up demand for next generation connectivity solutions. Rural businesses need to embrace and use social media to survive and thrive, but one of the really big frustrations in rural communities is the numbers of young people who are excluded from joining in with the culture of their peers, which is now dominated by the likes of Facebook and Youtube. \"Being at the Great Yorkshire Show is just a small contribution to helping rural communities participate in the 21st Century online world on something like an equal basis. This may be the first time that social media has featured at a County Show, but it's the future and rural communities mustn't be allowed to miss out. Join us on stand 193 on Tuesday between 10am and 6pm.\" The Great Yorkshire Show runs from Tuesday 12 to Thursday 14 July. Full details and further information is available at the website.
