  "content": "News Corp, the parent company of social networking site MySpace.com, is devoting millions of dollars in television air time and online ad space for a campaign on internet safety for children. The campaign, announced yesterday, includes a commercial featuring Kiefer Sutherland, who plays Jack Bauer on the Fox action drama 24. The campaign comes as parents, schools and law-enforcement officials increasingly warn about the dangers of sexual predators at social-networking sites. MySpace, the biggest, has about 92 million registered users, about 20% of them young people.",
