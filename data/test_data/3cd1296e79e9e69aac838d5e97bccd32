  "content": "If you are intending to sue someone for millions of pounds, you will need the best lawyers money can buy. And if someone slaps a writ on you demanding millions in damages, make sure you have the most competent defence team the legal profession has to offer. In this case Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas wanted \u00a3500,000 and OK! were claiming \u00a31.75m. But the lawyers who argued the case have put their own price on their professional services - a grand total estimated to be in excess of \u00a33m. Both the leading barristers in the case were from the same chambers in London. Michael Tugendhat QC, who represented the Douglases and OK!, is perhaps the leading authority on privacy and media law. He was called to the bar in 1969 after a university education which took in Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and the Yale Law School. He has been a Queen's Counsel since 1986 and since 1995 a deputy high court judge. Among his areas of practice he lists media law - defamation, confidence, privacy and data protection, copyright and contempt of court. He unsuccessfully acted for television personality Jamie Theakston in his attempt to stop newspapers publishing pictures of him leaving a brothel. He is the joint editor of The Law of Privacy and the Media and married with four sons. Oxford-educated James Price QC, who defended Hello!, was called to the bar in 1974 and appointed Queen's Counsel in 1995. His areas of speciality include defamation, breach of confidence, contempt, human rights and media copyrights. He defended both the Guardian newspaper and Mohamed al-Fayed in cases brought by Neil Hamilton over the cash-for-questions \"sleaze\" scandal. He was also part of the Guardian defence team against Jonathan Aitken, who withdrew his case mid-trial when he was found to have lied on oath - and ended up in jail.",
