  "content": "Before Christmas, Lord Justice Leveson told his inquiry that he was sure \"there has been a lot of reflection\" in the newspaper industry on the methods used to secure certain stories. As proof, he cited my suggestion that front-page scoops were going unpublished by the tabloids for fear of a public outcry or censure at the inquiry. \"The real question,\" he added, \"is, will it last?\" I hope and pray it doesn't. Right now, I'm either involved with or know of at least half a dozen stories that, pre-Leveson, would have dominated the front pages for days. But tabloid editors are on the back foot now, worried about upsetting their readers and causing more adverse comment at the inquiry, even if a story has been generated by legitimate means. We've gone from one extreme to the other: for years, virtually all that has mattered to these editors is whether a story is going to sell papers and not cost them heavy legal bills. But the Leveson accusations, be it from the Dowlers and McCanns or Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, have created an atmosphere of fear in which the tabloids are scared of breaking big scoops \u2013 and that's not healthy in any democracy. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad the British public is more aware of the activities of some journalists, just as they became aware of how some MPs were abusing their expenses claims. The Leveson inquiry has raised questions I've never heard publicly debated in the 49 years I've been in the media business. But as I've been saying for many years, we've got to find a halfway house: a middle way between the indisputable need for a free press and the need to protect everybody's privacy \u2013 not just the rich and famous \u2013 when it's justified. To me that's common sense, although defining justification is going to be far from easy. Speaking as a PR man, I'm surprised and disappointed the tabloids haven't come out fighting their corner harder and more effectively. I'd advise them to be more open with their readers: when they land a big story, they should explain exactly how they got it. They need to win back the trust of the British public, but they won't do that by stopping going after big stories. Investigative reporting is crucial to our democracy and the tabloids' future prospects. They should be reminding readers of the many, many stories they have broken that can be totally justified on public interest grounds \u2013 just as, this week, the Daily Mail has talked up the very significant role it played in the campaign for justice for Stephen Lawrence. I practise what I preach: when I had a problem with the News of the World \u2013 or, more accurately, with the paper's then editor, Andy Coulson \u2013 I fought my corner. I got as much information as possible about the hacking of my phone, then challenged them legally. Everybody told me it was the wrong thing to do \u2013 at the time, no one else was following this path. But I got to the bottom of what had happened, sorted it out, and moved on. There was no malice: throughout my battle with the News of the World I was still dealing with other Murdoch papers and Sky TV on a regular basis. The settlement I made was in complete confidence and I've kept to that until recently, when the settlement, which was close to \u00a31m including legal bills, became generally known. From the start, everything I learned about phone hacking I passed on to the Metropolitan police. In the early days it was obvious the Met weren't interested in pursuing the matter, which is not surprising given the close relationship they had with some of the Murdoch papers. But thanks to the Guardian, and particularly Nick Davies, the story wouldn't go away, and eventually the police had to initiate a proper and thorough investigation. From more recent conversations I've had, they estimate something like a dozen people could go to prison in 2013. As for Leveson's question, I doubt the excessive caution being shown by the tabloids will last. Not when you combine the unrelenting battle for newspaper circulation with the British public's obsession with the private lives of the rich, famous and anybody else caught up in controversy. And the stories are still out there \u2013 it's just not necessary to hack people's phones to discover them. In the last 30 years, I've probably broken as many front-page stories as anyone else in the country \u2013 and I've never had the desire, let alone the ability, to hack into anyone's phone. But what we urgently need is a strong, independent and proactive press complaints body to oversee newspapers' behaviour \u2013 and Leveson would, I believe, be an excellent person to take charge of it."
