  "content": "I'm looking forward to tonight's screening of a Dispatches special: Celebs, brands and fake fans, not least because ITV threatened to sue Channel 4 should it be broadcast. ITV was upset that some Coronation Street actors were the victims of a sting operation in which they evidently ended up promoting fake products. It accused Dispatches of \"shoddy journalism.\" Andrew Garard, ITV's group legal director, wrote to Channel 4: \"As a public service broadcaster, I am amazed you would consider broadcasting these allegations\u2026 I am astounded that this programme would be broadcast by you on Dispatches at all.\" Garard accused Matchlight, the production firm responsible for the programme, of attempting to entice young Coronation Street actors into tweeting about fake products by sending them messages on social networks. He said ITV's lawyers, Olswang, had made it clear to Matchlight that if such allegations were broadcast then ITV would sue for libel. This smelled to me of bluster and it's no wonder that Channel 4 responded by saying it would go to air as planned. So what has happened to that libel threat? Has ITV yet had second thoughts? Several attempts to get an answer from ITV throughout the morning got nowhere. I couldn't reach Garard, no-one else in the legal department was prepared to talk about it and the designated press officer didn't call back. Channel 4 was a little more forthcoming, repeating that it stood by its journalism and would defend it. I'm not too surprised at ITV's reticence. It's always embarrassing to see one freedom-loving media organisation issuing legal threats against another freedom-loving media organisation. And it will be even more embarrassing if, having made the threat, it then proves its hollowness by not proceeding with it. Anyway, lest you forget to tune in (or need reminding to set the recorder), Celebs, brands and fake fans starts at 8pm. Its main target is social media dishonesty. The one-hour documentary is produced and directed by Chris Atkins (of Starsuckers fame) who tells me he has investigated brands using \"click farms\" in Bangladesh. In addition, he says of the Coronation Street actors: \"Little did they know they were promoting a fake spiritual health brand called Puttana Aziendale (Italian for 'corporate whore').\""
