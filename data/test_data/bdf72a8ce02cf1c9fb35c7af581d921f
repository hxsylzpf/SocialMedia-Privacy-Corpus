  "content": "Some people take to the streets when they're angry; I take to Facebook. The social network can be a cesspool for talking about race, but I was so incensed over the grand jury decision not to indict Darren Wilson this week and I needed to know: Why did my white friends avoid talking about race? They will express an opinion and offer support when it comes to LGBT issues, women's issues, immigration, indigenous rights Aids, Ebola ... anything to do with Africa fills up my feed. But when it comes to discussing the systemic racism right here in this country, where are my white Facebook friends? I don't just need them to talk about the injustice of learning that Michael Brown's killer will never face a jury of his peers, though: this kind of situation will happen again. There will be another Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Jordan Davis, Akai Gurley. Talking about race can't bring them back, but silence about it won't save the next black child. Where will my white friends be the next time? But it's not just the Facebook hive-mind that so often stay silent when faced with difficult discussions of race. Some time after the 2008 elections, I tried to talk to my father about the snide, racially-charged comments and outright racist statements I'd read on social media about President Obama. I wanted him to tell me how he handled it \u2013 would handle it. So I asked this man from Birmingham, Alabama, who had been sprayed by a firehoses while protesting Jim Crow and had encounters with Bull Connor himself. He shrugged: \"We never talked about that stuff.\" \"We lived it and it simply happened. It was. But it was never a topic of discussion.\" Talking about racism \u2013 about white people's racism \u2013 was and is a taboo topic, somewhere on the spectrum of impolite conversations, which has politics and religion at one end and whether a woman's diamonds or breasts are \"real\" at the other. Still, it's important to go there, to refuse to ignore or laugh nervously at racism, to start and finish authentic, constructive conversation. So, when I demanded to know why my white friends weren't posting en masse about Ferguson, they told me they fear dipping a toe into any conversation on race. They admitted that when they do speak up, they're told to back down; that they're told they don't know what they're talking about; that they're accused of tone-policing; that they cannot comprehend the black experience. My white Facebook friends said that they're told they know nothing, that they're reluctant because of the potential backlash from their white friends. Avoidance has always been the easy option. But sometimes when the question is staring you right in the face \u2013 \"What's on your mind?\" \u2013 the answer isn't easy. Just as my white friends fear being told to sit down, log off and shut up, I fear being told that racism is just some made-up bullshit; that my lived reality isn't the reality; that I am misunderstanding someone's \"joke\"; that they don't know why I'm so angry. I've been told that, by talking about racism \u2013 on social media or in person, over Thanksgiving dinner or a glass of wine \u2013 that I'm playing the \"race card\". White people have explained to me how they \"don't see color\" \u2013 even after Stephen Colbert made that phrase a punchline. And I've even heard white people's experiences of being stopped by the police and how everything was just hunky dory. But racism is real \u2013 and the first step to having a practical conversation is to admit that it's real and that it can be terrifying. It's not easy to talk about an unfair social system in which you are found complicit even if you are trying to do the right thing. There are substantive differences in how people of color are treated versus our white peers \u2013 so simply saying \"it happened to me!\" isn't the same as listening and understanding how it's different when \"it\" happens to a black person. Failing to appreciate experiences that aren't exactly like your own \u2013 that is what will stall any discussion, or make you afraid to hit the share button. If you ask a black person honestly about race, be prepared to be answered honestly. Don't ask to be assured that you're \"one of the good ones\", or in the hopes that I can make you so. No one knows all of the answer, anyway, and, though I'm black, I don't arrive prepared with a syllabus on 400 years of race relations in the United States. I don't know everything there is to know about all black people everywhere; I can only share with you my experiences. And, while I might be willing to answer your questions \u2013 even the supposed \"stupid\" ones, if they're well-intentioned \u2013 not every black person is like me. We're unique individuals \u2013 and the unwillingness of some white people to accept that is part of how racism manifests in our daily interactions. I don't need my white friends to write dissertations on race relations in America if they choose to post about Michael Brown on Facebook. But I do need them to think about what they're saying before they say it, to listen to me and other black people about why we're angry and why we're protesting, to be willing to absorb what they hear and and then \u2013 yes \u2013 change. And then my white friends need to be willing to step out of their comfort zone and start speaking about race \u2013 but not just for me. They need to do it to educate other white people \u2013 for when I get tired, and so they're being decent people. Share your Ferguson solutions: No justice, no peace, what now?
