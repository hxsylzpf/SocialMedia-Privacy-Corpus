  "content": "Last week I wrote about the picture of the murdered girl Victoria Climbi\u00e9 that appeared on the front page of the Guardian, upon the publication of the report of the inquiry into her death conducted by Lord Laming. I supported the decision to publish the picture - a picture calculated to shock - because I felt the context and content of Lord Laming's report justified it. Some of you wrote to agree: \"I did not see [Victoria's] picture because I only read your reports on the internet, but even if I had I wouldn't have criticised it. The crime of child abuse must be exposed in all its gruesomeness and horror. I was an abused child myself (no broken bones but a lot of lashes with a whip). Later I found out that the neighbours had been thinking of reporting my mother but didn't. What a pity! To this day at the age of 68 I cannot forget the tears, the impotence and sense of injustice that I felt then.\" Another wrote: \"I was only shocked that the picture did not appear on the front page of any other paper. Instead, they all chose pictures depicting Victoria as smiling and pretty and healthy... thanks for showing something of her suffering, and by implication the suffering of all other seriously abused children.\" Others wrote to disagree: \"To print the photo was misjudged and perhaps a little prurient... I think it breached the child's dignity and privacy.\" One accused the Guardian of racism, saying the paper had used the picture of Victoria in a way it would not have done had she been white. I said I felt that in similar circumstances the paper would have acted in the same way. The writer of the complaint that prompted last week's column wrote again to say that to some extent I had misrepresented her position. Her main purpose had been to caution strongly against what she felt was, or could be, \"a creeping appropriation of the image of a battered Victoria... a worry that the very society which had failed her in life would eventually prove careless in the use of her battered image in death.\" (I told this reader that there was no evidence that pictures such as this increased circulation. Since then I have received figures which show that on the day Victoria's photograph appeared sales of the Guardian did actually increase.) On Thursday last week the Guardian devoted the whole of the front page of G2, its tabloid second section, to the CCTV frame showing the abduction of James Bulger by the boys who killed him. It marked the 10th anniversary of James's death and was accompanied by articles and interviews asking, in effect, what lessons had been learned from the case. The two pictures - Victoria Climbi\u00e9 as she was seven months before her death, and James Bulger being led away among the shoppers - have one thing in common. They represent moments when intervention would have saved their lives. Was it a legitimate use of this excruciatingly painful image of James? Was the argument in favour of using the picture strong enough to override the sensitivities of those most closely involved, notably James's mother, Denise Fergus (with whom there was no contact - she did not respond to a request to be interviewed put to her through her solicitor)? How does the use of this picture square with the reader's anxieties about appropriated images? My opinion is that again in this case the context did justify the use of the picture. I did not feel that was so with a picture used on the Parents pages of G2 just before Christmas last year to illustrate an article reporting growing paranoia about paedophilia. It showed four small children dressed for a nativity play. It was captioned, \"Little angels... but are these children at risk from paedophiles?\" The headline on the text also addressed the picture: Is this a pornographic photograph? This was a library picture taken by a Guardian photographer and showing his own daughter among the children. It was used in this context - perhaps by association an unsavoury rather than a dangerous one - without consulting the photographer, the school or any of the parents. I thought this was an error of judgment and we carried a note in the corrections column to that effect. This photograph had been taken for one purpose, with the full cooperation of the school, and then re-used in a controversial context on a later occasion. A moment's consideration might have suggested that approval, had it been sought, would not have been given. Was the argument in favour of using the picture strong enough to prevail against likely objections? In this case it was not. \u00b7 Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 0845 451 9589 between 11am and 5pm Monday to Friday (all calls are charged at local rate).
