  "content": "Francis Aldhouse The former deputy commissioner at the Information Commissioner's Office, it was Aldhouse who allegedly said the press were \"too big\" to take on when former police officer Alex Owens, investigating data theft, uncovered a cache of documents he claimed showed that a number of national newspapers were paying for confidential records such as criminal records, ex-directory telephone numbers and vehicle registration checks. Owens, who led the Operation Motorman investigation for the ICO, told Leveson that he went to Aldhouse and told him they had enough paperwork to prosecute journalists and newspapers, but he said he was told to back off. Aldhouse is a specialist in developing data protection and privacy policy in the UK and overseas and was involved in the working groups establishing privacy protection laws and codes at the European Council and the OECD. He now runs his own information policy and rights company in Warrington. Alex Owens This is the second appearance for Alex Owens. A retired policeman, he came forward to the Leveson inquiry on the basis that he had some \"valuable information\" to share. He ran the Information Commissioner's Office's investigation into press payments for confidential information nearly a decade ago but told the Leveson inquiry in his first testimony last week that he was told by the deputy head of the ICO the press were \"too big\" to take on. He told Leveson he had uncovered a cache of paperwork linking newspapers and named journalists to requests for information from police databases, the vehicle registration office and telephone companies. However, he was told not to contact any press and the investigation did not proceed as he wished. Last week he said: \"I was so frustrated that I basically said to myself, 'To hell with it: if I have to get the full truth out in the public domain then I will do so and face the consequences.'\" Peter Burden A writer and entrepreneur for 20 years, Peter Burden's 2008 book, News of the World? Fake Sheikhs and Royal Trappings, stirred up controversy by exposing the methods of those, including former News of the World undercover investigations specialist Mahzer Mahmood, who make a living exposing others. Material from the 2009 edition of the book is being examined in evidence to the Leveson inquiry. Burden has also written what he describes as eight \"race-track thrillers\" and one \"quality potboiler\" for Bloomsbury's Soldier of Fortune series.",
