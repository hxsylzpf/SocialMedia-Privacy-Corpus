  "content": "We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage of today's congressional outing by NSA director Keith Alexander and friends. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Alexander argued against limits on surveillance programs, saying the programs secure the nation and operate within the law. \"From my perspective, the threats are growing,\" Alexander said. \u2022 Alexander gave the NSA top grades for self-policing. \"This agency in every case reports on itself, tells you what we did wrong...\" Alexander said. He was echoed by Robert Litt, general counsel for the office of the director of national intelligence: \"Everybody is singularly focused on ensuring that we comply with the Constitution and the law.\" \u2022 The sparsely attended hearing saw minimal discussion of relatively recently disclosed NSA programs such as the collection of billions of cell phone records worldwide or of Internet metadata abroad. Instead the hearing focused once again on the collection of phone metadata under section 215 of the Patriot Act, a program the witnesses continued to defend. \u2022 Committee chairman Patrick Leahy said the latest NSA disclosures \"raise significant questions about the scope\"of surveillance and show more oversight is \"clearly needed\" \u2013 \"a lot more.\" But the questions about the new programs didn't much come. Many committee members had conflicts and failed to attend. \u2022 Draft legislation to reform the NSA to be debated in Congress next month, known as the USA FREEDOM Act, may be read here. Litt said new rules could be hard to live with, warning of \"practical or operational\" compliance concerns. \u2022 Reforms in the law include the addition of a public advocate to Fisa court proceedings; added transparency including the release of numbers of Americans swept up in spying dragnets; new requirements for court orders to use Americans' information; and some limits on bulk collection of Americans' records. The ACLU supports the bill. Whitehouse adjourns the hearing.  Senator Richard Blumenthal is asking about including a public advocate on the Fisa court. Sanchez recommends a constitutional advocate, and a \"technical advisory capacity of some kind\" to sort out overlapping surveillance programs.  Cordero, the Georgetown adjunct, sees no need for an adversarial Fisa court process. \"I think that the current process is sufficient... facts from the other side are presented to the court...\" she says. However, between the completing legislative proposals now on the table \u2013a public advocate or the establishment of an amicus capacity to advise the court where needed \u2013 Cordero supports the amicus process. The second witness of the second panel, Julian Sanchez of the Cato Institute, aka @normative, goes after what he describes as the illusion of oversight: We learned that for months, or years, the actual technical details of how these programs operated were misrepresented to the Fisa court...  and the illusion of security through surveillance: From many dozens of foiled terror plots we've gotten down to, in the case of telephony metadata ... one instance where it plays a uniquely valuable role. Read Sanchez's full testimony: \"It was hard to get Bob Litt out of here,\" Franken, Whitehouse, who is chairing the hearing during the second panel, is heard to say. \"He loves it.\"  Alexander, Litt and Cole are dimissed. A second panel is to begin shortly. The witnesses are: Edward Black President &amp; CEO Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association Washington, DC Julian Sanchez Research Fellow Cato Institute Washington, DC Carrie F. Cordero Adjunct Professor of Law, Georgetown Law Director, National Security Studies at Georgetown University Law Center Washington, DC Alexander shares Litt's rosy assessment of intelligence community conduct.  \"This agency in every case reports on itself, tells you what we did wrong and does everything we can to correct it,\" Alexander says.  \"Everybody is singularly focused on ensuring that we comply with the Constitution and the law... Nobody's been out there attempting to illegally spy on Americans or anyone else.\" \u2013 Robert Litt, general counsel, office of the director of national security In the absence of many attendees, the hearing is moving toward a long \u2013 welcome \u2013 conversation between Leahy and Alexander.  Leahy is currently sharing his memories of 9/11. Then he says, \"I also think of the J Edgar Hoover-type thing.\"  \"We give up a lot of our privacy in this country,\" he says. \"And frankly I worry about giving up too much. Could we be totally secure? Of course we're not. You can't be totally secure going out for dinner in the evening from some random shooter, who isn't even aiming for you.\" Chairman Leahy: \"Has anyone been disciplined at NSA for dropping the ball so badly?\" Alexander says NSA has a multi-step program to assess its procedures for security. Then he talks about why Snowden was able to get so much. \"His job was to move data... He was the share-point web server administrator. His job was in fact to do what he did. Therein lies the problem.\" \"We believed that they would execute that duty faithfully.\" \"Prior to this event, it was standard to have one person\" doing that job, Alexander says. \"In this case... we've input a two-person rule.\" Curios: How does Alexander's description of Snowden's job square with the administration leaks a month ago accusing Snowden of tricking colleagues out of their passwords? By Alexander's telling, Snowden seemingly had access to everything.  Senator Al Franken turns to metadata collection under section 702 of the Fisa amendments act. Alexander says once again that the program is designed to collect foreign intelligence, and the NSA does its best to avoid surveilling Americans. Franken asks, How many Americans have gotten caught up in that? He wants a range, not a precise number. \"I don't mean to hedge,\" Alexander says. \"..When we are tracking a terrorist, if they are talking to five people, and one of them is an American, our chances of knowing that are very small.\" Franken wants to know why it's so hard to get a number. He says his bill calls for the NSA to give a tally of how many Americans' records have been searched. He says he's not looking for a precise number. \"When there is a lack of transparency, [Americans] tend to be very skeptical and expect abuse,\" Franken says. \"The number isn't that big,\" Alexander says.  Leahy asks whether the NSA could re-start a program for the bulk collection of email and other Internet metadata that was shut down in 2011. Under current law would the NSA be able to restart the bulk collection of metadata? Leahy asks. Litt, the DNI counsel, says the NSA could go to Fisa court and gain consent to restart the program, which he says collects \"a category of information not protected by the fourth amendment.\" Leahy presses: but would you have to go to the court? Or could you just restart the program? \"I believe we would,\" Litt says. Cole agrees: \"I think you would have to get court authority, just like you would under 215.\" The question on the table is whether a public advocate should be added to the Fisa court. Cole, the deputy AG, opposes the idea, saying a public advocate \"might impede that process some.\" Which is kind of the idea.  Here's a copy of the NSA reform legislation to be debated next month, the USA FREEDOM Act, co-authored by senator Leahy and Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a Republican and one of the authors of the original USA PATRIOT Act. These are all acronyms; that's why we're capitalizing; we're not yelling at you. The long name for the new legislation is the Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet-collection, and Online Monitoring Act.  Robert S. Litt, general council for the office of the director of national intelligence, reads his opening statement.  Litt says certain disclosures that would be required by the reform legislation present \"practical or operational\" compliance concerns for the intelligence community. \"We're opening to considering any proposals so long as they are feasible and don't compromise our ability\" to gather information, Litt says. Or they might simply be required by law to make changes. Spencer notes a poor turnout. It's a busy day on Capitol Hill, with a lot of business to get done before the holiday break.  Deputy attorney general James Cole begins his opening statement. He says the justice department has gone to \"great lengths\" to explain to the public how and why its programs are legal.  Then he quotes from a Fisa court opinion about the collection of bulk metadata. \"The court found that the entire collection of bulk metadata is relevant to a terrorism investigation,\" he says. If everything's relevant, collecting everything is legal.  Note that Cole \u2013 and Alexander \u2013 both have been talking about the collection of phone metadata under section 215 of the Patriot Act, which we have known about since the Guardian first published a relevant Fisa order on 6 June. This is deeply frustrating for some informed viewers: Alexander defends metadata collection. \"That is the least intrusive way that we could do this,\" he says. Then he embarks on a library analogy. \"Metadata is a way of knowing where those books are in the library, and a way of focusing our collection... to knowing, where are the bad books,\" Alexander says. He holds up an index card \u2013 it's meant to be an old-style card-catalog card (sorry, millennials) \u2013 on which are listed the categories of information encompassed by \"metadata\": time, date, duration, contact numbers.  Then he returns to the 9/11 attacks and says, as he always does, that the attack might have been stopped by a metadata collection program like the USA has now.  Leahy jumps in and says the failure to prevent the 9/11 attacks also has been put down to a failure to communicate within the intelligence community. US agents had the info they needed, they just failed to share it with one another.  The first time Alexander has been interrupted when he has played the 9/11 card.  Alexander begins. He dives right in on how surveillance in his opinion keeps Americans safe. \"From my perspective, the threats are growing,\" Alexander says. As evidence he gives stats for terror attacks inside Iraq and Syria. Many of those would of course be casualties in a foreign civil war.  Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman is at the hearing.  Alexander has announced his retirement and is expected to depart by March 2014.  Chairman Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, begins his statement. As usual, he says, there are new, recent, disturbing revelations about NSA surveillance. \"The latest disclosures raise significant questions about the scope\" of surveillance programs, Leahy says. More oversight is clearly needed, he says \u2013 \"a lot more.\" The \"latest disclosures\" Leahy names are NSA surveillance of live video games such as World of Warcraft and Second Life; NSA collection of cell phone records; and an program to collect internet metadata, in which \"the NSA exceeded the scope of collection, not just once or twice but repeatedly.\" Leahy says better oversight is needed to rebuild confidence in American tech companies. Leahy calls the \"bipartisan and bicameral\" reform legislation he has co-authored \"common-sense legislation.\" Members to watch at today's hearing, via national security journalist Marcy Wheeler. A full list of committee members is here. Good afternoon and welcome to our live blog coverage of testimony by General Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency, before the Senate judiciary committee. Alexander is expected to take questions about various surveillance programs and to argue against pending legislation designed to curtail those programs. The NSA reform legislation, which is expected to come up for debate next month, has 120 bipartisan co-sponsors in both chambers. One of the bill's co-authors, Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, chairs today's committee. The vaguely wishful, vaguely self-congratulatory title of the hearing is Continued Oversight of US Government Surveillance Authorities. Alexander's many appearances on Capitol Hill since details of NSA programs first came out in June have hewed to well-worn themes: surveillance keep Americans more safe, Alexander says, and the exposure of the programs has made Americans less so. It has proven difficult to assess the director's claims because the details remain classified. Some of the early headline claims, however, have shown signs of unraveling. Chief among these is Alexander's claim that NSA spying has averted more than 50 terror threats worldwide, a figure that upon closer examination seems to include such a grab-bag of activity as to represent a tally of nothing. As usual, Alexander's appearance on the Hill comes amid new, damning revelations about potential overreach by NSA. The world has recently discovered that the agency collects 5bn records a day on cell phones around the world and that it infers relationships based on mobile location data, in seeming \u2013 but perhaps not technical \u2013 contradiction of testimony by intelligence officials that the agency does not collect so-called \"geolocation\" data. On Monday, the world's biggest tech companies published an open letter saying that NSA surveillance undermined basic rights and freedoms and calling for reform. Also scheduled to testify today are deputy attorney general James Cole and Robert S. Litt, general council for the office of the director of national intelligence. The hearing is to begin at 2pm ET. While we wait, you might read Ryan Lizza's huge piece in this week's New Yorker, \"State of Deception: Why won't the president rein in the intelligence community?\" Or dive into the Guardian's complete NSA files."
