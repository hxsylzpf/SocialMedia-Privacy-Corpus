  "content": "Naomi Campbell has lied consistently about her drug problem both in and out of the court, the high court heard today. Desmond Browne QC, for Mirror Group Newspapers, accused the model of misleading the public and deliberately lying to the court about her addiction. Summing up his case for the defence on the third day of Campbell's law suit against the paper, Mr Browne accused her of trying to deceive the public about her \"anger management\" treatment at the Cottonwood Clinic. \"The truth is, it's all down to drugs,\" he said. \"When she goes to Cottonwood it's to deal with that problem and not - as she calls it - 'anger management'.\" Mr Browne said Campbell had also lied to the court about the damage done to her by a Mirror article that revealed her battle against drug addiction. \"It seems the experience of taking the oath in no way curbs Ms Campbell's tendency to lie and to exaggerate the damage and the stress caused to her by the article,\" he said. Mr Browne referred to the remarks made Cosmo Landesman, the Sunday Times writer who interviewed Campbell shortly after the Mirror article was published. \"The truth is, she didn't seem that upset by it,\" he quoted Landesman as saying. The Streatham-born model is suing Mirror Group Newspapers for breach of confidence, invasion of privacy and breaching the Data Protection Act. The case continues."
