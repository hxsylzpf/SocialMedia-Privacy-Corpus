  "content": "During its development, the creators of Dear Evan Hansen, a fantastically poignant Broadway musical that opened Sunday, had one rule: no lockers. \"We never wanted lockers onstage,\" says the playwright Steven Levenson (Core Values, The Language of Trees). \"That was always our thing. We never wanted any lockers onstage, people dancing with lockers.\" Dear Evan Hansen is a high school musical unrelated to the chirpy, toothy likes of High School Musical or more anodyne Broadway fare such as School of Rock or Wicked. The first original musical by the composers Ben Pasek and Justin Paul (Christmas Story, Dogfight, La La Land), it has a book by Levenson and direction by Michael Greif, who has had his greatest successes with unflinching portrayals of youth (Rent, Next to Normal). A story of isolation in a hyperlinked world, it is written and performed with an emotional acuity that defies hashtag simplifications and 140-character limits. Its plot revolves around Evan (Ben Platt), a teenager with crippling social anxiety. Through a couple of mishaps established in the show's first minutes, a letter that Evan has written falls into the hands of a troubled classmate. The classmate kills himself and Evan is wrongly identified as that boy's friend, conferring brief celebrity. Social media spreads this fiction and soon awkward Evan, besieged by friends and followers, goes viral. On a weekday morning, Levenson, 32, and Greif, 57, sit in a waiting room at the Music Box Theatre, ready to discuss the show's origins and impact. The waiting room has been outfitted by Bloomingdale's, with debatably modish furniture and a \"Twitter mirror\" ready for selfies. There are also a pile of teddy bears, dressed like the show's lead and sold by Bloomingdale's to benefit the Child Mind Institute, a charity devoted to children with mental health issues. The bears themselves looked fairly stable, as do Levenson and Greif. As Levenson tells it, the show was sparked by the overdose of Pasek's high school classmate. After the boy's death, kids who hadn't really known him claimed close bonds. \"People wanted to have a piece of the tragedy,\" he says. That memory twined with a desire to explore the internet's role in people's lives, especially those of teenagers. Both Greif and Levenson exited adolescence long before the social media heyday. \"Twitter and Instagram are still kind of mysterious to me,\" says Levenson. Greif doesn't use them much either. Online \"no one can find me\", he says. But Levenson argues that such platforms make adolescents of us all. \"Being part of social media makes you a teenager in a weird way,\" he says, \"wondering what everybody else is doing, wondering if you've been invited.\" Yet both acknowledge that the omnipresence of the online world poses particular challenges for today's teenagers. \"I have the advantage of having some teenagers, so I've been able to see some of that,\" says Greif. \"Everything that you hear is true in terms of the increased scrutiny.\" Seemingly gone are the days when you could figure out who you were without the world watching, when you could make mistakes without them being preserved. \"Nothing is private any more and nothing is sacred, I guess,\" says Levenson. \"Everything is for public consumption.\" He also worries that Snapchat and its ilk might increase feelings of alienation. \"It does feel like the more connected we are, the more alone we feel,\" he says. \"I was always so acutely aware of feeling alone.\" Being able to monitor the limits of your likes, the numbers of your friends must make that worse, he thinks. If Dear Evan Hansen addresses these problems and anxieties, it also explores, presciently, how easily experience can be faked online and how persuasive those fakes can be. In the aftermath of the presidential election and its proliferation of fake news, this aspect has come to seem more urgent and upsetting, though Levenson argues that the show \"ultimately lands in a very human place ... with two people on a couch having to face one another\". Broadway has often sat two people on a couch before, but Dear Evan Hansen, with its multiscreen set and comprehensive projection design, has finally found a way to make time on the internet seem theatrically and visually interesting. It has also found a way, while using traditional Broadway structures and styles, to offer depth of character and a psychological complexity not usually witnessed in a Broadway musical. This has to do, in part, with the somewhat unusual way in which the musical was written. After Paul and Pasek discussed a tentative outline, they sent Levenson away and told him to write it as a play, with monologues where songs, which came later, might go. \"So the character feels less like the character in a musical in some sense because he's not,\" says Levenson. \"We're not taking him from song to song.\" Pasek and Paul, says Greif, \"had incredibly great instincts of what things you sing about and what things you don't sing about and there was a lot of sensitivity to that\". \"They were always willing to not write a song,\" says Levenson. But many of the songs they did write effectively communicate the intensified, overexposed feelings of adolescence. \"The stakes are never as high again as it feels when you're at that age,\" says Levenson. And teenagers have felt that, too. Many have written letters to the show's creators, as have parents who have lost children. \"That's obviously the most gratifying thing possible,\" says Levenson. \"It is such a strange time in the world, to feel like what you're working on can actually help people in a small way makes it feel not just completely insane to be doing a musical in such a terrible time.\" Let's hope #NotJustCompletelyInsane catches on.",
