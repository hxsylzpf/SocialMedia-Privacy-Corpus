  "content": "The phone-hacking issue has helped bring to the fore the extent to which private investigators can operate outside regulation, and in the fringes of criminality (Hain, hacking and terrorism, 30 November). There are many reputable private investigators who provide a valuable service, but when individuals can hide behind trees with long lenses without even a licence, we should act decisively. The home affairs committee this week announced an inquiry into this issue. We hope to discover the full extent of private investigators' activities and to decide whether the public, as well as the reputable side of the industry, should be protected by a regime of statutory regulation. Phone hacking has highlighted the need for greater press regulation. Ten years on since the Security Industry Act established a statutory framework to regulate private investigators, it is time we took an equally serious approach and brought this industry out of the shadows. Keith Vaz MP Chair, home affairs select committee"
