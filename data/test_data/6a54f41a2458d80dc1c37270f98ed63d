  "content": "A group of senior BBC executives are campaigning to introduce a BBC-wide ban on actors, writers and other talent involved in its productions using social networking sites such as Twitter to disclose details of their work. According to senior sources, the need for a ban \"was a widely held view\" and \"conversations have started\" regarding a change to contracts to forbid talent from using Twitter and other public internet forums to discuss details of their involvement in BBC productions if the information is confidential or sensitive. The campaign follows a spate of revelations on Twitter which, the executives claim, have disrupted press and marketing campaigns. They hope a ban will prevent storyline spoilers, casting news or press announcements from leaking out. Recent examples which are understood to have caused consternation include the singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor's disclosure on Twitter that she was to appear in Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant's new comedy Life's Too Short alongside Sting. Her seemingly innocent tweet is understood to have undermined a carefully crafted BBC announcement of the rock star's appearance. Other examples of inadvertent indiscretions include actor Stephen Mangan's revelation on Twitter that the drama Dirk Gently had been recommissioned \u2013 where he unknowingly pipped a BBC press release after it had been delayed \u2013 and Armando Iannucci's announcement of a return of the comedy The Thick of It before the BBC was ready to make it public. One executive, who holds a high profile job in BBC Vision, the department that oversees and produces television content, told MediaGuardian the ban was already being discussed. The executive, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"There's no doubt that Twitter is a popular communications phenomenon but it can also be quite disruptive if artists tweet about an appearance on a show or announce a new commission before the broadcaster is ready to go with the story. \"Broadcasters can have a number of reasons for wanting to delay press announcements, such as the deal not being done or contracts not being signed or, indeed, the broadcaster wanting to make a big splash with a great story at a particularly opportune moment. A random tweet can rob an artist of his or her potentially much louder fanfare.\" The BBC said it already had guidelines on the use of Twitter and social media when writing in a BBC capacity. But as most usage is personal, the BBC's position is that the talent must be advised by their agents on how to conduct themselves. A spokesman said: \"Most talent tweeting fall under the personal usage bracket, and are advised by their agents/producers and we encourage them to read our guidelines.\" The spokesman declined to comment on a series of questions from MediaGuardian about the move by the executives. Three years ago, the BBC launched formal guidelines governing what staff could put on their profile pages on social networking websites such as Facebook. BBC News director Helen Boaden introduced the measure in order to protect the corporation's brand. \"The public and private space is complicated. People don't know when they put it [pictures] up that it could be used [in the media],\" she said at the time. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 July 2011 to clarify the circumstances under which a tweet revealed that Dirk Gently was being recommissioned."
