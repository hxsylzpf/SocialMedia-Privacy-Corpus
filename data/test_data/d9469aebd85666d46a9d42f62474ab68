Break up the ice with a fork and serve in shallow bowls. Top with lemon balm sprigs and a few raspberries and/or blueberries. From Better Homes And Gardens magazine Bite-sized brie Makes 24 squares 2 sheets puff pastry, thawed but still cold 1 large egg, beaten A splash of milk \u00bd round of brie, cold 80ml cherry jam (or any other flavour you fancy) Sea salt Cut the first puff pastry sheet into thirds, then cut each panel into four pieces. One sheet of puff pastry will yield 12 rectangles. Cut each rectangle in half. These 24 little rectangles will create 12 pockets, so repeat this method with the second sheet of pastry. Combine the beaten egg and a splash of milk, and brush on to 12 of the small pastry rectangles. Place a lolly stick halfway up the pastry and press in gently. Place a small sliver of brie (rind and all) on top of the pastry piece, then top it with about half a teaspoon of cherry jam. Take another pastry piece and press between your fingers to make the rectangle slightly larger. Place this on top of the piece holding the cheese and jam, and use a fork to press the edges together. The egg wash will act as a glue. Seal the edges well by crimping with the fork. Preheat your oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5 and put a rack in the centre. Place the prepared brie bites on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with a touch of coarsely ground sea salt. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving. Brie bites are best served warm, but are also delicious at room temperature. From joythebaker.com Pressed Italian sandwiches Serves six 3 red peppers Olive oil Salt and pepper 6 small ciabatta rolls (or large buns) 2-3 tbsp butter Around 250g-300g assorted Italian cold meats 200g mozzarella bocconcini, sliced Balsamic vinegar 1 large bunch of rocket, rinsed and patted dry Top, tail, de-seed and slice the peppers, then place, skin-side up, on a baking sheet, pressing gently so they lie as flat as possible. Cook them under the grill until charred, about 10 minutes. Remove and pop them into a sealable plastic bag and put in the fridge for 30-40 minutes. Once cooled, peel off and discard the blackened skin. Place the peppers in a small bowl, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper, then set aside. To prepare the sandwiches, cut your ciabatta in half and butter each piece (you could brush with olive oil, if you prefer, but butter will help prevent moisture getting into the bread). Place a layer of red pepper on the bottom slice and top with a generous layer of cold meat (five or six slices). Pat dry your mozzarella slices with a piece of paper towel, then add to the sandwich. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top with a generous layer of rocket, followed by your top slice of ciabatta. Wrap each sandwich tightly in clingfilm and place on a platter or baking tray. When all the sandwiches are prepared, move them to the fridge and place a heavy frying pan (or another baking tray, plus some large cans) on top to compress. Refrigerate for at least six hours or, ideally, overnight. When ready to serve, remove the clingfilm and, if you want to, trim the edges of the sandwiches to enjoy the wonderful colours inside.

Discard any limp radicchio and chicory leaves, then cut into thin strips. Rinse under cold water, together with the arugula (cut off thick stems beforehand), then spin dry and put in a huge bowl. Quarter the fennel, trim and shave as thin as possible (if the fennel has some nice-looking green attached, chop that and add it, too). Quarter the apple (no need to peel it), remove the core and stem, then shave thinly. Cut the radishes into thin slices (or shave them, too). Peel the carrots and cut into julienne strips. Peel the oranges and fillet them (hold them above a bowl to catch the dripping juice, additionally squeeze the remaining parts and reserve for the salad dressing), then cut into smaller chunks. Use your hands to gently mix all the ingredients together. Now dress the salad with the reserved orange juice, vinegar (if desired), plenty of olive oil, salt, pepper and sugar. Mix well and arrange on a huge plate. Coarsely chop the nuts and sprinkle all over the salad. If you have fresh ricotta or soft goat's cheese to hand, you can crumble some over the salad, too.
