  "content": "Men! Don't you just hate it when you search for a manly male man-watch online, and get presented with a screen full of female-focused timepieces for delicate lady-wrists? But thankfully, this 21st-century problem will soon be just a bad memory. Enough snark: Pinterest's announcement that men searching for watches will now only see watches for men is actually a useful indicator of how the image-focused social site is evolving. Most of its users are still women, but with men its fastest-growing demographic, Pinterest is trying to ensure it serves up relevant results to both those genders \u2013 especially for products (like watches) that may help fuel its ambitions to become a key player in the online shopping world. Pinterest engineer Pei Yin explained the changes that the company has been making to its \"guided search\" technology, in a blog post: \"If you do a lot of searching on Pinterest, you may already have noticed the results you're seeing are better than ever. For example, say you're looking for a new watch. Before when you searched Pinterest for \"watches,\" your results would include mostly women's timepieces. But now, men will see Pins and guides inspired by what other guys have Pinned, and everybody's results should feel a lot closer to what they're looking for. Of course if you ever want results for another gender, like if you're shopping for a gift for someone else, you can always use the guides to fine-tune your search.\" According to Yin, similar filters can now be used for searches in areas including hair, shoes and health, as long as people have told Pinterest their gender in its settings pages \u2013 a choice of Male, Female and Unspecified, so it's unclear how much the new filters will improve search relevancy for people identifying within the latter, extremely broad group. The changes are about making Pinterest searches more relevant for everyone, not just men, but Yin's stress on the latter group illustrates Pinterest's wider priorities as it tries to prove that it's not just for women. TechCrunch notes that 71% of Pinterest's US visitors are women, but points to recent claims by the company that a third of its new signups are men, with that growing to around half outside the US. Even in the latter country, Pinterest says that its number of male users grew by 73% in 2014. More relevant searches should help Pinterest continue to grow. The company was valued at $3.8bn in October 2013, when it raised a $225m funding round \u2013 despite its revenues being miniscule at the time. It raised another $200m in May 2014, valuing it at $5bn. However, it has since been pressing on with a strategy of making money from selling advertisements \u2013 \"promoted pins\" which appear within users' feeds of other images and products, and which stimulate online shopping."
