  "content": "The Google/Digg deal is off, or so says TechCrunch. Last week things were in full swing, but Digg were told on Thursday or Friday that after combing through the paperwork Google backed away. Photo by Night Star Romanus on Flickr. Some rights reserved. Digg founder Kevin Rose told Leo Laporte that the firm would keep mum about any pending deals, but also said that regular meetings with big firms over partnerships could be misconstrued. Acquisition rumours have surrounded Digg since early 2006 when Yahoo reportedly discussed a deal for around $20m. That was followed by a string of others, including CurrentTV, but no-one actually made an offer. What did we think of a Google acquisition? It's almost too obvious for Google. Digg has become something of a preoccupation among traditional news organisations, but none of them will be forking out $200-300m when the advertising market is just starting to look very wobbly.",
