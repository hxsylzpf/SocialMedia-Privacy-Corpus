  "content": "The following apology was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday November 2 2008 Contrary to claims in the article below, the National Council for Civil Liberties (Liberty) has not been approached by any phone company seeking endorsement. Liberty has asked us to make it clear that it never endorses private products. Apologies. Mobile phone companies are seeking an endorsement from Liberty, the civil rights group, to assuage consumer concerns over possible misuse of the private data they hold on file. The campaign group has been approached by several firms seeking its seal of approval, a reflection of growing customer unease about the practice of selling on personal information to third parties and the risk that companies could be forced to hand over sensitive data to the government. No deals have been signed, but if industry players could secure Liberty's endorsement, it would be a coup for those attempting to persuade users that they can be trusted with such private data. Brands including Orange have been found guilty of breaches of the Data Protection Act by the Information Commissioner's Office and the loss of computer disks containing names, addresses and bank account details by government agencies and departments in recent months has undermined public confidence in organisations' ability to hold on to confidential data. Research carried out by polling company YouGov earlier this year, after several high profile security breaches had taken place, showed gambling companies were the least trusted sector, with only 4 per cent of people saying they had faith in such companies protecting their data. But mobile phone companies scored just 9 per cent, some way below the 25 per cent of respondents who said they trusted central government."
