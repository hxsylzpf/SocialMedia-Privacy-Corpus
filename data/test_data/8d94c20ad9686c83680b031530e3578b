  "content": "HM Revenue and Customs became embroiled in another data scandal today after it emerged that it lost personal details of 6,000 private pension holders. In the latest lapse to be revealed, HMRC admitted that it lost a computer cartridge containing the names, postcodes and National Insurance numbers of customers of a private pensions firm after signing for the package at a centre in Wales. HMRC said there was only a remote risk that it could lead to identity fraud due to the nature of the cartridge, but coming on the back of a string of recent security breaches the news is a further embarrassment to the government. The case, first reported by Independent Radio News (IRN), occurred in September at Ty Glas in Llanishen, Wales. The Preston-based life and pensions firm Countrywide Assured sent the cartridge by courier to HMRC, but it was lost after someone at the centre signed for it. A thorough search of the premises failed to locate the missing cartridge. The cartridge held the names, postcodes and National Insurance numbers of people with private pensions at the firm. The value of their pension, and contribution records, were also listed. HMRC requires the data for tax purposes. HMRC said the loss was unlikely to pose a risk as it could only be read by an IBM mainframe computer. But IRN reported that in a letter to customers on December 13 Countrywide Assured said: \"This does not guarantee that it could not be read if it falls into the wrong hands.\" In an interview with the radio network, the chief executive of Countrywide Assured, Graham Kettleborough, said he did not understand how HMRC could lose the cartridge at its secure premises. He added: \"It is a failure I would not expect.\" A spokesman for HMRC said: \"This was one of the seven data loss incidents reported to the information commissioner which Dave Hartnett referred to in his evidence to the Treasury select committee last week. \"It is very unlikely that any unauthorised person would be able to access the customer information due to the nature of the medium on which the data is held. \"We are taking this loss extremely seriously and have done everything possible to locate the data cartridge. We would like to apologise to those affected.\""
