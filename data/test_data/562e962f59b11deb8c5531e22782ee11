  "content": "Princess Caroline of Monaco's five-year-old daughter has won a record \u00a353,000 in compensation from the German supreme court after magazines published photos of her without her family's permission. Mattthias Prinz, the lawyer acting Alexandra, daughter of Princess Caroline and Prince Ernst August of Hanover, said it was the highest sum \"ever awarded to a minor in a German trial over the rights of the press\". Pictures of the girl and her parents were taken illicitly by paparazzi and published in Die Aktuelle and Die Zwei, magazines owned by the Gong publishing house, in 1999 and 2000 - when Alexandra was still a baby. According to Mr Prinz, the photos showed the family in various private situations. They included a shot of Alexandra being carried by her mother as she left the maternity hospital. Another was taken by a photographer who had climbed a tree in the grounds of the family home. The lawyer said the ruling was evidence of a \"clear trend towards awarding higher compensation payments\" and added the verdict showed \"that the courts are prepared to protect the private sphere of children\". The court ruled that the publication of the photos amounted to an invasion of the child's privacy. The ruling will be of interest to lawyers acting for UK stars, who are snapped regularly by paparazzi while on holiday overseas. It will also interest celebrity mothers such as Gwyneth Paltrow, who has complained about photographers following her around London. Henrik Zoerner, a spokesman for Germany's National Union of Journalists, said the verdict did not come as a shock. \"I'm not surprised at the court's decision as we are talking about the protection of a child, and such cases are not uncommon,\" he said. However, he admitted the amount of compensation was high by German standards. \"The amount is unusual for Germany but it is difficult to judge whether it is fair or not. I'm sure in America it would be considered reasonable, if not too small,\" Zoerner said. He added that earlier cases involving Princess Caroline had a greater impact on the media. \"The case involving Princess Caroline and the European Court of Human Rights is another matter. Here the fundamental rights of the freedom of the press were at issue. The EU court has basically censored the press by not allowing them to photograph celebrities when they are on 'private' business. But it is now difficult to judge what is considered private,\" he said. \"That ruling will cause a lot more problems for journalists and photographers, not only in Germany but in the rest of Europe.\" The European Court of Human Rights ruled in June that photos published of Princess Caroline and her family sunbathing, cycling and shopping infringed their privacy. The court said there was no legitimate public interest in where Princess Caroline spent her holidays or what she did in her private life and that the publication of the pictures contradicted the right to respect for private and family life enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. Leading German newspapers and broadcasters described the ruling as censorship and said it put \"press freedom under siege\". In a separate hearing last week, the supreme court also ruled in favour of Princess Caroline's eldest daughter, 18-year-old Charlotte Casiraghi, who appealed for an injunction to stop the Springer publishing house reprinting photos taken of her at an equestrian event. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
