  "content": "Sony Ericsson breached advertising rules by exaggerating a mobile phone's ability to use Facebook, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled today. The television ad for the Satio phone, featuring a woman using the handset to take photos and chat with friends, showed the screen displaying icons for several applications including social networking site Facebook. A voiceover said: \"Packed with applications and more available to download.\" A viewer who bought the phone complained that the ad was misleading because it did not come with the Facebook application, which appeared to be incompatible with the handset. The ASA upheld the complaint, ruling that the use of the Facebook logo and the voiceover was likely to mislead viewers. In response, Sony Ericsson said a software problem meant the Facebook application had initially not been available on the phone but could now be downloaded from its application website and used on the Satio. But Clearcast, the body responsible for clearing scripts for TV commercials, said it had \"received assurance from Sony Ericsson that the Facebook application was pre-loaded on to the handset\", adding that the commercial would not have been cleared had Sony mentioned the software problem. The ASA said: \"Because the ad implied the application was either pre-loaded on the phone or would be available to download, and because this was not the case at the time the ad was broadcast, we concluded the ad was misleading.\" \"The ASA acknowledged that links installed on the phone allowed users to access the Facebook website via the phone's internet browser. However, we understood that this was not the same as the phone being able to run the Facebook software application, which would offer better functionality and a faster user experience.\" In a separate ASA ruling, ITV3 was found to have breached rules on sound levels after a viewer complained of \"excessively noisy\" adverts during a repeat showing of 1980s drama The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. ITV claimed the loudness of the ads was \"appropriate and consistent in the context of the overall loudness of the channel\", but had appeared to be louder because the dialogue and incidental music in the drama was quieter than modern production standards. \"ITV3 said the Sherlock Holmes series was made in the early 1980s and the style of production was considerably different to modern dramas and ads,\" the ASA reported in its judgement today. \"They said there were many instances where the audio was nearly silent as the characters considered the mystery before them, and incidental music was very much in the background. They said that the scenes where characters argued and shouted, although short in duration, were as loud as the loudest parts of the ads.\" But the watchdog upheld the viewer's complaint. \"The ASA acknowledged that ITV3 were working with other broadcasters and the industry generally to ensure compliance and welcomed their efforts in this regard,\" it said. \"We noted that the programme had a wide dynamic range, with periods of quiet suspense punctuated by short, louder bursts. We noted that the maximum subjective loudness of ads was consistent with other ads during the break, but that it was not well matched to the overall sound levels of the programme, making the ads seem loud in comparison. \"Whilst we recognised that commercial breaks sometimes occurred during especially quiet parts of a programme, we nevertheless concluded that the ads were excessively strident and breached the code.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
