  "content": "Editors who are serial offenders of the Press Complaints Commission code of practice should be forced to stand down from its board, according to a new report. The media ethics pressure group Mediawise said the PCC still had a lot of work to do to improve its credibility and called on the watchdog to introduce a new \"three strikes and you are out policy\". It has also recommended every newspaper carry a Guardian-style \"corrections and clarifications\" column. Mediawise director Mike Jempson said there was a public perception that the PCC, which as a self-regulator is run by a commission involving editors, \"is a creature of the establishment\". He said organisations representing working journalists, such as the NUJ, should be included on the commission, and said negative PCC adjudications should be flagged up on newspapers' front pages. \"[PCC chairman Sir Christopher Meyer] could insist that editors serving on the commission should stand down if their publications are in breach of the code. That would add an edge to the peer pressure that is supposed to keep editors in line,\" said Mr Jempson. \"A three strikes and you're out policy might mean that a revolving door will have to be installed at [PCC headquarters] 1 Salisbury Square, but it would be a strong card for the chair to play were he to be accused of toadying to his paymasters.\" Former Sunday People editor Neil Wallis was a member of the PCC when the paper broke the code by publishing naked pictures of DJ Sara Cox and her husband on their honeymoon in 2001. The code states that photographers must not take pictures of people in private places without their consent. Wallis has since resigned his seat following his move to the News of the World where he is deputy editor. Radio 1 presenter Cox received a 63-word apology on page three of the paper the following week. The apology was negotiated through the PCC. She also won \u00a330,000 from the Sunday People although the case never went to court. Mr Jempson says the appointment of Tim Toulmin, who has been a long-standing member of the PCC's staff as Guy Black's successor on the PCC \"has done little to dispel the whiff of the establishment with which the PCC has been tainted from its early days\". Mr Black and Mr Toulmin both worked as researchers for former PCC chair Lord Wakeham. They are both old boys of current chair Sir Christopher's alma mater, Peterhouse College, Cambridge, as is Conservative party leader Michael Howard, for whom Mr Black now works as a press officer. In a survey by Mediawise, most people who have taken a complaint to the PCC said they were dissatisfied with the outcome. Some 64% of complainants questioned by the charity said they were unhappy with the PCC, compared with the commission's claim that 62% were satisfied. The results of the study appear in Satisfaction Guaranteed?, published by MediaWise today. It concludes that the PCC and its code of practice requires a thorough overhaul. Mr Jempson said editors should be prepared to flag up PCC adjudications on their front page and establish a regular spot within news pages for corrections. \"Some of these measures would, of course, be unnecessary if every publication ran a regular 'corrections and apologies' column, then at least we would all know where to look.\" The study also contains an analysis of how the press watchdog has handled various complaints, including an account of the PCC's response to the Sun's infamous \"Swan Bake\" allegations about asylum seekers. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
