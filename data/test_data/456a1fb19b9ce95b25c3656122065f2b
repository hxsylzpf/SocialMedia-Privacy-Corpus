  "content": "Good afternoon and welcome to the voluntary sector digest \u2013 our daily space to bring you all the latest news, advice and analysis from the sector. \u2022 On the network today - Stephen Hill, head of social action at the BeatBullying Group, offers his top tips for using social networking to engage volunteers. He provides advice on catering to the digital age, how to grow your online community, and the importance of getting on the #network. \u2022 Also on the network, we round-up the best bits of advice from our recent ethical investing live discussion. For charity trustees looking to invest their funds and promote their message - ethical investment may be the best option. \u2022 Meanwhile, Charity Times reported today on research published by The Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI) on the Department for International Development's Support to Agricultural Research. ICAI examined a sample of seven projects supported by DFID, and found that DFID has an effective and innovative agricultural research programme. \u2022 Yesterday the Charity Commission announced plans to scrap the summary information return, and will display information about whether charities pay their trustees on its online register. The changes are among 10 amendments that the regulator will make to the annual return that charities must complete and the information that it displays on its online register. \u2022 In other news, the Third Sector reported on the debt advice charity StepChange appointing Mike O'Connor - head of the consumer body Consumer Futures - as chief executive. Speaking of the new hire, former chief executive Gordon Bell said: \"I leave it in good hands and I wish Mike every success in the future.\" \u2022 Finally, Oxfam makes plans to cut 125 jobs in the UK as part of a major restructure of its operations \u2013 aimed at saving \u00a37.5m over the next year.
