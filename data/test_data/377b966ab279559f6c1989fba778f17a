  "content": "When Howard Davies-Carr uploaded a video of his two children on to YouTube, he thought it would be seen only by his sons' godfather and a few friends. More than 400m views later, it has earned him well over \u00a3100,000. The clip of one-year-old Charlie mischievously nibbling his three-year-old brother Harry's finger, known as \"Charlie bit my finger \u2013 again!\", became a global phenomenon. Davies-Carr now regularly uploads videos of his sons \u2013 satisfying a cooing international audience and earning him money from the adverts YouTube places next to the clips. In his case, they include a leading baby milk provider, Oxfam and Vodafone. \"I've always filmed the boys, but now I make a short extract to upload. I'm grateful to have these snapshots of the boys growing up \u2013 the money is a bonus.\" You would be forgiven for thinking Davies-Carr's story is a fluke \u2013 even he puts his success \"entirely down to luck\". But increasing numbers of people are earning money through the advertising revenue generated by their videos \u2013 and not only clips that have gone \"viral\", such as the one of the man cursing his dog, Fenton, as it chased deer across Richmond Park. Across Britain, people of all ages are putting their hobbies online and uploading films to an audience which waits with bated breath. Livie Rose, 21, originally from Swansea and now living near Brighton, started filming make-up tutorials in January 2010 after she got hooked on the beauty videos produced by teenagers in America. \"My mother saw the videos I was watching and said 'You could do that', so I did,\" she told Guardian Money. Rose has deferred studying politics at Queen Mary University in east London to concentrate on her YouTube channel, \"liviesays\", and has even created a studio from her earnings. \"I don't want to lose the chance to study, but the channel was starting to take me places. I didn't want to miss out on an opportunity.\" The hobby she describes as her \"unnatural interest in make-up\", earns her anything from \u00a350 to several thousand pounds each month, depending on the popularity of her videos. \"I didn't set out to make this into a living, but it's the best kind of hobby, because I get to make money out of it.\" She adds: \"The proportion YouTube takes is fixed, but it doesn't actually take that much. Say I earned \u00a31, they would probably take about 10p.\" Video makers can earn money from advertising via the site's partner programme, a scheme aimed at regular uploaders with big audiences. Basically, this means you share in the revenue generated when people watch. Partners must agree to YouTube allowing \"relevant\" adverts to be placed alongside, and even within, their videos and earn money based on a combination of \"impressions\" (views) and \"clicks\" (how many people click on the ad). \"Pre-roll advertising\" \u2013 those often annoying ads you have to watch before the video starts playing \u2013 can be particularly lucrative, as advertisers are willing to pay more. All of this means the amount of money you can earn will vary dramatically. However, YouTube insists that \"partners will always get the majority of the [ad] revenue\". There are more than 20,000 partners worldwide. While the site wouldn't disclose how many there are in Britain, it claims it has seen a \"seven-times increase\" in the number of UK partners earning more than $10,000 (around \u00a36,460) a year, plus a 154% increase in revenues received. Anyone can apply to be a partner as long as they regularly upload original videos that are viewed by thousands of people, and either own, or have permission to use, all the audio and video content, it says. This means videos featuring pop songs, a movie, TV or video game visuals can be problematic. Shoo Rayner, 55, a children's author from the Forest of Dean, whose mission statement is to teach the world to draw, has been sharing artistic tips for two years, and has racked up well over 2m views. He has his own channel, Shoo Rayner Drawing. \"I'm not making an enormous amount but I am hoping to do this full time soon,\" he says. \"I'll have to do other things, as well \u2013 I'm starting a course on YouTube for business, and I can do speaking engagements to top up my earnings \u2013 but I expect around 60% of my income will come from YouTube advertising.\" Rayner adds: \"You can't predict the amount you're going to make, although I find January is pretty lean and it starts building from there until Christmas. You can see your earnings ticking up throughout the day, depending on who has watched the video.\" Rebecca Flint, who is 16 and from the Isle of Man, has sold language learning books, music CDs and dance DVDs after a video of her dancing to pop songs went viral, propelling her to Japanese stardom. Her stage name is Beckii Cruel, and she now has her own website, beckii.co.uk \"When I first started, I was filming the videos on a laptop in my bedroom and then overlaying the music,\" she says. \"Nothing happened at first but then, suddenly, I went viral. It was a complete surprise. It's been fantastic \u2013 I've had the opportunity to travel to Japan eight times and perform live.\" But you don't have to go viral to make it, according to Steve Roberts, who lives in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. His football skills tutorials (available on his YouTube channel, STRskillSchool) have more than 48,000 subscribers. \"I judge my success according to how many people come back to watch each week. If you've got something interesting to say, or a hobby to share \u2013 put it on video.\" So what happens if that clip of your cat climbing into a box ends up \"doing a Fenton\"? YouTube claims its technology can predict when a video is about to go massive. \"We can contact the owner and offer to start serving up advertising, so they can make money from a one-week sensation,\" it says. The Fenton clip was reportedly filmed by a 13-year-old boy, and has inspired a range of spin-off items. In early December, the boy's father was quoted as saying: \"We won't be buying a Caribbean island just yet.\" At that point, the clip had been viewed by just over 1 million people. By this week, it had been viewed more than 4.4 million times \u2013 and counting.",
