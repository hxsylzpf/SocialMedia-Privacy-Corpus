  "content": "Are we all ready for next year's royal wedding? Ready for the colossal #Megharry event in Westminster Abbey, which may well be the new US president's first major state visit abroad? Well, we had better be. The indications are that the engagement of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be announced before the end of the year. Perhaps the Queen will mischievously drop the bomb in her annual television address just after describing her visit to the RNLI offices in Poole, and just before wrapping it up with a gentle panning shot over the gardens at Sandringham. Social media is expected to go into irony/excitement overdrive on the day; royal watchers will experience a condition known as protocolgasm as they discuss Meghan's new princessdom and ponder her appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony; hardworking newspaper professionals will attempt to find a rhyming word other than sparkle. And perhaps most important of all, the prime minister will find that she is channelling the spirit of Margaret Thatcher more than ever as she tells us to just rejoice in that news. The remoaning Minnies can jolly well belt up about their tiresome objections and purchase a couple of tea towels and sit down in front of the TV that day and tweet facetiously about Meghan's sister's outfit along with everyone else in the world. And you thought 2016 was a trial. Perhaps I can somehow go into hibernation until it is over. Reader, I curated it The eternal student in me loves a good reading list, so I am tempted to add to my Christmas present requests the new app called Alexi, launched by former Picador publisher Andrew Kidd: it's a kind of digital book club with titles recommended by authors such as John le Carr\u00e9, Kamila Shamsie and Ali Smith, offering about 400 books a year to its subscribers, who get to keep up to 12 titles in their online library at any one time. Of course, what Alexi is about is curating. Curatorial is the buzzword of the moment. Curating is the new rock'n'roll. When I was little, curating was done by elderly, white-bearded, dust-covered types who curated by typing out little white slips which would be placed next to bits of broken pottery in glass cases in an unvisited room of the local library. Now curating is super-sexy. People curate world music concerts. They curate conceptual art exhibitions. And of course they curate film festivals, on and offline. Organising things and setting them up is old hat. I look forward to Alexi's curatorial suggestions. Questions, questions Another politician has fallen prey to interviewers' cheeky new penchant for factual quizzing, a tendency I wrote about when Zac Goldsmith wobbled in the face of questions from the BBC's Norman Smith. This time it is the foreign secretary who has an uncertain finger on the buzzer. Sky News presenter Dermot Murnaghan \u2013 who had already riled Labour's Emily Thornberry with his quizzing \u2013 caused Boris Johnson to walk out when asked the name of the South Korean president. He said: \"I have a terrible feeling that if I keep answering you, you'll keep coming back with more.\" He's got a point. So maybe politicians need a new tack: when challenged to a quiz, say yes, sure \u2013 but only if I get to lob a quiz question at you in turn. He could have asked Murnaghan to name the Bulgarian foreign minister, or the shadow energy secretary. It's fair to make politicians sweat on points of fact. But maybe interviewers should be made to sweat as well."
