  "content": "London's West End is buzzing with rumours about the identity of a Twitter prankster who claims to know all the secrets behind London's biggest musical shows. Top agents and actors are scrambling to reveal the identity of a tweeter calling himself (or herself) @westendproducer, who delights in heavy hints that he is Sir Cameron Mackintosh, the impresario responsible for stage hits including Miss Saigon, Oliver! and Phantom of the Opera. Much is made of the producer's fondness for vintage Dom Perignon \u2013 auditioners are advised not only to learn five songs and three scenes, but to make enthusiastic references to champagne. The writer enjoys being rude (without ever quite being libellous) about some of entertainment's most prominent figures, including Bill Kenwright, Sir Cliff Richard and Neil Morrissey. One message reads: \"Just had a nightmare Dale Winton was playing the phantom in the new tour next year, dears.\" Another complains: \"Ow. Savagely hung over. My head feels like I've listened to John Barrowman's complete works, dear.\" Mackintosh himself is relishing the joke. \"Not only is impersonation the highest form of flattery,\" he said , \"but the fact that someone thinks I am technically savvy enough to tweet (dear) is a big compliment!\" As conjecture spreads that the tweets come from a well-placed source inside Mackintosh's production company, every comment is combed by followers for clues, mistakes and hidden details. \"Whoever it is, they're very funny,\" said musicals casting director Anne Vosser. \"Lots of people are desperately trying to find out \u2013 actors and especially agents. I was accused myself at a party a couple of weeks ago, but I can promise you it isn't me. It's definitely someone in the business, because they know all about the Oliver! tour rehearsals that are going on at Pimlico right now, for example.\" Any out-of-work performers following @westendproducer in the hope of picking up tips can expect cold comfort. One cynical tweet last week warns: \"There really is no point getting your agent to try and up your wage, hundreds of actors will work for even less, dear.\" More ominously, he adds: \"Actors \u2013 if you ever turn down a role offer from me, don't expect to ever work for me, dear.\" Despite the camp sign-off at the end of every tweet there's a note of world-weariness, bolstering speculation that the phantom of the iPhone has endured the long hours and low wages that are common in musicals. Like Vosser, actress Susan Penhaligon is keen to unravel the mystery: the anonymous tweeter has dubbed them \"Rosemary and Thyme\" after the TV sleuths. The star of classics including Bouquet Of Barbed Wire, Penhaligon believes she is close to guessing the mystery figure: \"I've been playing detective. I don't think it's Cameron \u2013 but someone in his office? Or someone tweeting on his behalf? Musicals are clearly his thing. Some references to north London places seem a bit of a giveaway, like a certain pub in Highgate where he goes for Sunday lunch. I've often seen Paul Nicholas in there: I know him really well, from a two-handed play we did together. It's Paul's way of talking, his kind of language \u2013 except there's no swearing.\" Pressed to respond, Nicholas's agent replied: \"Kindly\u2026 no comment.\" Last month @westendproducer claimed that TV presenter Keith Chegwin was eager to base a musical on his own life. The remark drew a flat denial from Chegwin's office \u2013 \"but if Cameron wants to have a chat, Keith will bring his tap shoes!\" Trevor Chenery, an entertainment industry consultant, pointed out that the real Mackintosh wouldn't have the time to tweet, even if he had the expertise. \"This has caused a stir,\" he said. \"It brightens people's day and it helps to knit the theatre community together. The challenge is with the mystery surrounding the identity. The downside is if we find out who it is, even if it turns out to be Elton John or Andrew Lloyd Webber, it kills the fun stone dead. If I work out who it is, I'll keep it to myself.\" Christopher Stevens is @infamyinfamy on Twitter"
