  "content": "We begin this week with a touch of schadenfreude. The usually excellent Isaac Butler has confessed to what he describes as an \"ugly\" feeling of satisfaction in response to the \"freaking out about funding cuts\" here on the Guardian. Butler has obviously had some bad experiences with British or European theatre practitioners who, he feels, are frequently dismissive of American theatre. \"There's always a moment when one of them enters into a Big Speech About How Conservative and Dull American Theatre Is,\" he writes, before suggesting that perhaps \"the silver lining on the funding cut cloud is that at least theatre artists in other countries might have some level of understanding/sympathy for what their cousins across the pond are doing.\" Now, I can't think of many theatre-makers I know who would make those criticisms, and as David Cote points out in the comments thread on Butler's post, he seems to confuse the British and Continental European approach to theatre. But it is worth noting that when arts funding in this country gets a hammering, it is not just going to be British artists taking the hit. There are many American writers \u2013 from Stephen Adly Guirgis and Tarell Alvin McCraney to Tony Kushner and David Mamet \u2013 who have had work premiered or revived regularly by subsidised British companies. Alongside this, American theatre companies such as the Team and the Riot Group have benefited hugely from their relationships with companies like the National Theatre of Scotland and the Soho theatre. All this is likely to be jeopardised, as funding is reduced and pressure is inevitably put on artistic directors to focus what money is left on developing British talent. (Incidentally, this is an excellent website which details different easy-to-use responses to the Tory cuts.) Yet regardless of who produces the best theatre, one thing seems certain \u2013 both America and Europe are capable of producing some really spectacularly bad work. The US-based Stage Grade blog \u2013 which reports \"the critical consensus for New York City plays and musicals\" \u2013 is currently rejoicing in the discovery of Viagra Falls. Stage Grade has given the show an average of \"F-\" but this surely does not do justice to a show which, according to Time Out New York, \"falls somewhere between watching your grandparents masturbate and watching them go to the bathroom\". Meanwhile, on this side of the Atlantic, Andrew Haydon recently came across a show in Estonia called Answer Me by the Dutch company Dood Paard. As he points out, the show was so bad that: \"Of a starting audience of maybe 300, roughly a third left before the end. Of those who remained until it finished, half simply left instead of applauding. And, judging by every conversation I had or overheard afterwards, those who did clap were just being polite.\" Inevitably, reading these reviews has left me with a desperate urge to see both shows. In other news, there does appear to be one arts-related area where the Americans seem to be doing undeniably better than the Brits. As the Playgoer points out, the US immigration department has recently vowed to process all artist visas in 14 days or less. This belies a considerably more enlightened attitude to the arts than that displayed by our own immigration service \u2013 who, it has been reported, have regularly refused artists entry into the country. Finally, and in completely unrelated news, Chloe Veltman of Lies Like Truth has been exploring the different ways that the internet is affecting how we consume and produce art. She reports that the San Francisco Playhouse has, in an attempt to draw in new audiences, been allowing audience members to Twitter during shows. This has, in turn, sparked a furious discussion on the Facebook page of the Berkeley Rep theatre. In addition, she is intrigued by the possibilities that Skype provides in terms of the creative process. She refers to an interview in the Wall Street Journal with Michael Tilson Thomas, music director of the San Francisco Symphony, who says he often rehearses via Skype. Perhaps when all our theatres are closed down, the internet will be the only space left in which to perform."
