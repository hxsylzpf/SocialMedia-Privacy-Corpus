  "content": "Students who think the new 14-19 vocational training diploma is a heaven-sent chance to bunk off college may have to think again. Edexcel, the UK 's largest education qualification awarding body, has just announced that it is recommending that consortia introducing the new diploma should also deploy a clever piece of software that allows students' attendance to be monitored at all times. This web-based technology, with the deceptively cuddly name of Collaborative Learning Manager, can be used to track a student's presence in school, college or elsewhere and will notify the authorities instantly of unauthorised absences. It has been devised by Perspective, a UK software developer specialising in webbased training and learning solutions. The new diplomas \u2014 the first five in IT, media, construction, engineering and health are being offered initially by 144 consortia in England \u2014 involve schoolbased students learning off -site in colleges or with other learning providers. Schools have a statutory responsibility to be aware of the whereabouts of all their pupils, and the problem posed by diplomas is how to keep track of students who are training off-site. The software is already used in 14-19 partnerships offering vocational education in Leicester, Stafford, Bromley, the Isle of Wight, Nottingham, Birmingham, Islington, Rotherham and Oldham. Now it is to be used in delivering the new diplomas in Birmingham, Bolton, Barnsley, Islington, Coventry, Lincolnshire and Hull. \"There is a big issue with the attendance or non-attendance of learners,'' says Peter Barnett, Perspective's director of collaborative learning. \"It's a safety thing. One local authority told me: 'We are not on top of where kids are 100% of the time. It's an accident waiting to happen.'\" Perspective originally devised the system with a learning partnership in Leicester, which was having difficulty tracking the movements of 800 pupils moving around the city every week. The Vocational Education Support Agency (Vesa), which supports the collaborative partnership between 22 schools and nine training providers in Leicester, has been using the software for more than a year. \"We are very impressed with it,\" says Stuart King, Vesa's coordinator. \"We have hundreds of young people every week on off -site placements. Now, at every location, the people responsible for delivering the learning will use a computer to register the students. The results are then sent across the internet to our office, and schools and homes can be notified very quickly if Johnny has gone missing.\" The software is also being used to monitor individual student performance, learning and development. And it can also provide an overview of college, school and overall student performance. To those who find the idea of round-the-clock educational surveillance somewhat Big Brotherish. An Edexcel spokesperson says: \"This software has been developed to ensure maximum attainment and to ensure the individualised learning programme is maintained. Additionally, it supports the duty of care, as students move from one institution to another.\""
