  "content": "6 January 2010 Amid snow and cold weather, Doncaster's Robin Hood airport closed, threatening to derail the travel plans of Paul Chambers, then a 26-year old trainee accountant who was hoping to fly to Belfast to meet Sarah Tonner, a woman he had met on Twitter where she was known as CrazyColours. He tweeted on the publicly accessible feed. \"Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!!\" 13 January 2010 Chambers was arrested by four officers from South Yorkshire police who called at his office at a car distribution firm in Doncaster. He lost his job as a financial supervisor. February 2010 Chambers was charged with \"sending a public electronic message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character contrary to the Communications Act 2003\". 10 May 2010 Chambers was convicted by district judge Jonathan Bennett sitting at Doncaster magistrates court and fined \u00a31,000. The judge accepted that, although it was an unusual case, the message was of a \"menacing nature in the context of the times we live in\". 24 September 2010 Chambers launched an appeal against conviction at Doncaster magistrates court in front of Judge Jacqueline Davies and two lay magistrates. His legal counsel claimed the message was not menacing and Chambers had no intent to menace. Stephen Ferguson said it was \"obviously facetious\" and \"a parody\". The court heard a senior airport official, Steve Armson, had \"determined it was a non-credible threat\" and the airport duty manager Sean Duffield said the impact after he found Chambers' message was \"operationally nothing. It had no impact\". 11 November 2010 Davies refused the appeal and ordered Chambers to pay a further \u00a32,000 legal bill. She said the tweet was \"menacing in its content and obviously so. It could not be more clear. Any ordinary person reading this would see it in that way and be alarmed\". 15 April 2011 Chambers' supporters from the world of comedy staged a benefit concert to raise money to pay for his legal fees. Comedians including Stephen Fry, Al Murray, Jack Whitehall, Graham Linehan and Katy Brand performed at the Bloomsbury Theatre. 8 February 2012 Chambers launched a high court appeal and his barrister, Ben Emmerson QC, told Lord Justice Gross and Mr Justice Irwin \"the preponderance of evidence was that this was a joke\". He said the conviction was \"a steamroller to crack a nut\". Appearing for the director of public prosecutions, Robert Smith QC said: \"The message was posted at a time when the potential threat to airport security was high. It was capable of being read by members of the airport staff and members of the public as a threat to airport safety and public safety.\" 28 May 2012 The divisional court failed to reach a decision and ordered a new hearing. The judges gave no reasons as to why they had not ruled. 27 June 2012 Chambers faces his seventh day in court over his joke in front of a panel made up of the lord chief justice Lord Judge, Mr Justice Owens and Mr Justice Griffith Williams. They are the seventh, eighth and ninth members of the judiciary, including district judges, magistrates and high court judges to consider the case."
