  "content": "Anyone employed as a film reviewer has to get used to some scary and horrible experiences. But I don't think I have seen anything on the big screen recently that is quite as loathsome, creepy, icky and purely and outrageously irritating as the Plan the BT Wedding campaign that is now all over the internet. Plan the BT Wedding. We, the public, are being invited to help \"plan\" the fictional wedding of Adam and Jane, preparations for which are unfolding in cute mini ad-episodes (pictured). Adam and Jane, you will remember, are the adorable couple in the BT ads, who are almost \u2013 almost! \u2013 experiencing terrible crises, such as almost losing all their digital photos before realising that BT have made automatic backup copies in their miraculous, yet sinister way. Jane is heavily pregnant and must have the baby before the wedding happens, thus spinning this narrative ordeal out almost unendurably. With its corporate tongue in its cheek, BT is describing this as the second most important wedding of the year. It is, in fact, the first most annoying phenomenon of the century. The idea is that you go to the Plan the BT wedding page on Facebook \u2013 and abandoning all self-respect as a human being, I have done precisely this \u2013 where you will be confronted by Jane's perky, upbeat face. You can \"vote\" online for the dress she should wear: traditional lace, Swan Lake or 1930s vintage. Gosh, which one should it be . . . ? There is a video of Jane modelling various numbers, in the style of Andie MacDowell in Four Weddings and a Funeral. You can then vote for which first dance Jane should have. There is a video of Jane dancing on her own to each of these songs, apparently pinched from Hugh Grant's similar turn in Love, Actually. The choice is Spandua Ballet's True, Minnie Riperton's Lovin' You or EMF's Unbelievable. Finally, Jane broods over which car she should hire in which to arrive at the ceremony: Bentley, Mustang \u2013 or bubble-car, of all the outrageously quirky third choices! Here, the video does not appear to be nicked from Richard Curtis. I think we should all put our heads together and start devising some alternative storylines for Adam and Jane's wedding as it plays out in these mini ad-episodes. Perhaps something inspired by Roman Polanski. After Jane has that baby of hers, Adam could be just on the blower to the operator when he is idly looking at the baby's scalp. His expression changes to one of horror. \"Which number were you trying to dial?\" asks the operator. \"6 \u2026 6 ... 6 \u2026 ?\" gasps Adam to himself. Jane comes over and says: \"Gosh, when I had that dream about having sex with Satan, it was so vivid I did sort of wonder if it was actually happening in some sense.\" Or when it comes to Adam's jolly stag night \u2013 and don't tell me that the BT creatives haven't got a sweet little mini-episode lined up for this one \u2013 Adam's experiences should be along the lines of John Boorman's Deliverance. With some of his mates, he should go on a camping weekend in the remote Fenland. He gets separated from his friends and, cold and hungry, he must rely on the help of a bunch of lowbrowed farm workers in a lonely pub who finally tie Adam over a tractor wheel and pleasure themselves brutally on him while jeering that, despite BT's Anytime Calls deal, out here no one can hear him calling for help. Finally, there is the wedding itself. Here, the model surely has to be Thomas Vinterberg's Dogme classic Festen, or The Celebration. After the best man's speech, Jane \u2013 whose perky face has now gone deathly pale \u2013 stands up. The amused chatter dies away as Jane begins a passionate denunciation of her father and makes revelations that stun the entire party into sickened silence. After a queasy pause, Jane screams that from now on she will be changing to Virgin Media's outstandingly good phone and broadband package \u2013 and storms out. Adam slumps over, sobbing, and declares that he will be opting for TalkTalk's fantastic offer, which includes a free wireless router. The baby gurgles precociously about Sky. In this way, Adam and Jane's wedding might rival the drama of Wills and Kate's."
