  "content": "Andy Chantrill is hoping to do well over the next few years, recession or otherwise. Last week, the entrepreneur was one of the first to buy some of the new .tel domain names as they went on sale. This was the \"landrush\" phase, when premium names went on sale to people who didn't own them as trademarks. Previously, trademark owners were invited to register their names in the so-called \"sunrise\" phase; general availability opens on 24 March. Chantrill's idea is to aggregate companies that want to be found as easily on people's mobile phones as through a standard internet search. \"Every minute, thousands of people are getting off planes, and what is the first thing that they do? Turn on the BlackBerry,\" he says. \"Some of them will be thinking ahead to renting a car. For them, it's RentalCars.tel - the directory quickly connects them to an agent, saving time and hassle. Or maybe you're thinking of sending flowers? Florists.tel will let you quickly find your nearest florist.\" Chantrill is among those who have accepted the idea of the latest fashionable domain name as a single point of contact. The explosion of contact information in recent years means that getting in touch with someone can be done through phone, fax, email, website, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace and numerous other means; people with a .tel domain will have all of that information, should they choose to enter it, up to date on a single page in a fixed format. There will be no website finessing, no bells and whistles. The technology underpinning the domain works at the heart of its server, so it's possible to bypass the web altogether: there is an add-on available for some phones that will allow you to get at an individual's .tel information via your personal address book as easily as if it were on your phone already. Moody ruse Telnic, the registration company behind the new domain, is understandably bullish. Khashayar Mahdavi, its chief executive, believes the demand will be significant as customers perceive the benefits of individuals being able to find them - although he concedes that if more than one person has the same name there could be elements of confusion. \"You can add tags to your domain, though, to distinguish you from someone else,\" he says. A colleague of his, for example, shares the same name as the lead singer of the Moody Blues, Justin Hayward. He has therefore put \"Not Moody Blues\" in his tags so that a search for \"Justin not Moody Blues Hayward\" should find him. Of course, someone could pose as Hayward, unknown to the real celebrity - or as Madonna, or as anyone else. There are commentators who see the emergence of the .tel domain as yet another blank cheque for cybersquatters. \"It's a real issue,\" says Mahdavi. \"There are already laws to protect people who have trademarked a name.\" He stresses that his organisation, as a registration operation, isn't offering protection - enforcement of existing laws is not one of the tasks his company performs. Gregor Pryor, a partner in the advertising, media and technology team at the legal firm Reed Smith, remains cautious. \"The 'first come, first served' system of registration, plus the ability to register a domain for 10 years, creates further potential for disputes between businesses concerning the registration and use of their name or brand online,\" he says. \"Many companies will have missed the sunrise registration period and will now be subject to the vagaries of the UDRP [uniform dispute resolution policy] process, which is used to resolve domain name disputes. \"While .tel is good news for businesses legitimately trying to harness its benefits, it is not so rosy for those who find their .tel domain has already been registered by someone seeking to turn a quick profit.\" Disputes are a feature of registering any name on the internet. What disturbs some people is the idea of a single point at which all of an individual's information will be available. Nima Yassini is head of digital at the marketing company RMG Connect. \"As digital marketers, we constantly hear people worry about the safety of their online details: paranoia about the privacy levels available on Facebook; outrage at levels of identity theft and [there is] endless coverage reprimanding the government for losing personal data disks,\" she says. \"I don't see people willing to upload all their details - from Facebook profile to address and mobile number - on to the same internet space. This could be a spammer's heaven.\" She ponders whether .tel will be any more successful than Wap, or .tv, or .travel, before it. Meanwhile, Telnic remains positive about the impact the new domains will have, but as Technology Guardian went to press, the company wasn't able to say how many registrations there had been, only that Dave.tel was the first to go. Certainly, feedback from the Namepros.com forum suggests there's some confusion about where .tel will be useful. One commentator has bought his brother's name.tel and has been told it's useless because friends will already know how to contact him; others have looked at names such as poker.tel and realised that if you can't put a gambling site there then a .com name is probably better commercially. .tel us more However, there is evidence of enthusiasm for buying a .tel domain, tempered by a number of commentators who are reluctant to pump their money into yet another internet address, unique or not. The domains that have been booked will go live on 24 February; until then you'll get a blank page if you type most of them in. Meanwhile, for an idea of how they're going to look, you can find a handful of demos working - including Kash.tel, for the chief executive of Telnic."
