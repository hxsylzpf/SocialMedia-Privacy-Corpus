  "content": "So, I haven't really got to grips with Instagram yet. Eager not to be left behind, I'm hoping that The Rich Kids of Instagram (Channel 4) can help steer me in the right direction. I want to be rich, I want to be a kid, I want to be on Instagram; this sounds like a show that's been tailor-made for me. (If you think this is all too much about me, then you're probably just a sad jealous hater troll; and you know what? I don't care.) Right, this Lana \u2013 @LanaScolaro \u2013 seems like a lovely girl and a really great role model and guide, to help me build Brand Me on Instagram. Lana, 20, a multimillionaire heiress, spends her time jetting and helicoptering between London, Ibiza, New York and Monaco. She's also known for not being Robin Thicke's wife but still having his hand up her skirt. No wonder she's got 23,000 followers. Right now, Lana's in Monaco, in a beautiful topless Bentley, with her cute dog bulletscolaro_thepuppy. They're going shopping, of course, and she's wearing Louboutin boots and a Herm\u00e8s Birkin bag worth \u00a325,000 to \u00a330,000. She had another Herm\u00e8s Birkin bag that she graffiti-sprayed by accident \u2026 well, not really by accident, she just felt like doing it, and then putting it on Instagram, of course. Oh my God, I love it, that's so cool, like a statement. Lana spends \u00a315,000 a month on shopping. What does she think the average person spends, the man behind the camera asks her? \"Erm, I think the average person a month spends on shopping like \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000?\" she says. I'm not entirely happy about the guy asking the questions. Why would Lana know what an average person spends on shopping when she's so very un-average herself? It's not about knowing what's average, it's about inspiring average people to be a bit less average. It's almost like he's got an agenda, doesn't entirely approve. Probably a hater himself. Well, let me ask you something, Channel 4 troll, hiding being your camera: how many Instagram followers have you got? Exactly. You ain't no role model, bruv. Next to LA, where Evan Luthra \u2013 @evanluthra \u2013 who designs phone apps and has 126,000 followers, is having a yacht party. Yacht parties are one of Evan's favourite things to do. Mine, too: well, they will be, just as soon as I go to my first one. Today on Evan's yacht there are three guys and 15 girls, a good ratio, says Evan. Camera hater asks how well Evan knows everyone on the boat. Again, totally not getting it, trying to make out he's Billy No Mates or something. It's one of the brilliant things about being rich and young on Instagram; you can just announce you're having a yacht party and loads of really hot girls will hit you up. Instagirls. Who don't mind being sprayed with champagne, in fact they seem to quite like it. I'll have some of that please. Evan truly is an inspiration. As is diamond heir Timothy \u2013 @thetimothydrake \u2013 22 years old, Botoxed since he was 14, he's in Europe (from the US) shopping and spending \u20ac25,000 to \u20ac40,000 a night on hotel suites. And Sammy \u2013 @mrsammydee \u2013 driving around London in a black and white Rolls-Royce to match his shirt. Sammy sees Instagram as a canvas, and he's the artist, painting a picture of his life. \"I wouldn't say it was showing off,\" he says. \"I would say, as my late mother told me: 'If you've got it, flaunt it.'\" Exactly! Flaunting, not showing off. Also art. Right, I'm ready, I'm @samuelwollaston, 22 followers at time of writing. But I'm now following all of the above, on Instagram and in life, plus the others featured in the programme \u2013 @dimashadilet in Kazakhstan, @nathaniel_cashfleezy, who showers in money, Miss Universe 2014-2015, @paulinavegadiep \u2013 so hopefully they'll accept me into their clique, start spreading the word and I'll see my numbers rocket. All that's left is for me to post some stuff. So, today's bag, there it is, up it goes. And you know what? Inspired by Lana Scolari, now I'm going to make a statement and graffiti it, too, because I can. What did you do today, to get closer to your #goals? I'll post a few things that I've achieved already that might give you something to strive for. Shoes? You want shoes, I'll give you shoes. Go on then, and my car, too. I don't want to show off, but in the words of a great man's late mother: \"If you've got it, flaunt it.\" Yes, and that is my favourite bubbly on the bonnet. Go hate on that, haters."
