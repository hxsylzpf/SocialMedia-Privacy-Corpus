  "content": "The film director Spike Lee is the subject of legal action by an elderly American couple whose home he wrongly identified as the residence of Trayvon Martin killer George Zimmerman. In the lawsuit, plaintiffs Elaine McClain and David McClain say Lee's post on Twitter led to ongoing hate mail, threatening phone calls and an unwanted media presence at their Florida home. While the McClains initially agreed an out of court settlement with the director of Do the Right Thing and Jungle Fever, they were subsequently targeted all over again in the wake of Zimmerman's trial and acquittal when Lee's post to his 240,000 followers began to be widely retweeted. The director initially wrote: \"I don't give a fuck what you think kill that Bitch. HERE GO HIS ADDRESS, LET THE HUNGER GAMES BEGIN.\" \"While defendant intended to post the home address of George Zimmerman, he actually posted the address of plaintiffs Elaine McClain and David McClain,\" the suit reads. The McClains are now seeking \"in excess\" of $15,000 (\u00a39,500) in damages."
