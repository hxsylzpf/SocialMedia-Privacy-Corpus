  "content": "England and Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand is launching a privacy action over a Sunday Mirror kiss-and-tell story. The article was published on the paper's website for five days in April last year before being taken down. Ferdinand, who has two sons and a daughter with wife Rebecca, claims the publication was a misuse of private information. The paper counters that it was in the public interest to run the story about his alleged 13-year relationship with another woman. Both Ferdinand and the woman are expected to give evidence in the high court in a case expected to last for three days. The judge, Mr Justice Nicol, must decide whether the newspaper was justified in publishing under article 10 of the human rights act, which protects freedom of expression, or whether Ferdinand's privacy rights, under article 8, were unfairly compromised. Ferdinand is represented by Hugh Tomlinson QC and Gavin Millar QC is acting for the newspaper. Source: PA",
