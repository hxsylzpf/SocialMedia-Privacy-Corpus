  "content": "Facebook has introduced Save, a new feature which allows users to bookmark content from their news feeds to revisit later. Announcing the launch of Save in a blog post, Facebook software engineer Daniel Giambalvo wrote: \"Every day, people find all sorts of interesting items on Facebook that they don't have time to explore right away. Now you can save items that you find on Facebook to check out later when you have more time.\" Saved items will be private, but users can share items with Facebook friends. The feature is designed to encourage users to save music, links, places, books and movies; the tool is accessed through the drop-down menu in the upper right hand corner of a post or piece of content. The bookmarking feature will be available both on web versions and the iOS and Android mobile apps of Facebook. To access saved content on web, there will be a link on the left hand side of the page to view either all saved content, or items arranged by category. The mobile version will introduce a 'More' tab, with saved content collated there. Items that have been saved can be shared, ordered, permanently archived or deleted. Before Save, there was no clear way to revisit older posts, and the non-chronological nature of the news feed made it difficult to resurface a post that users may have wanted to read at a more convenient time. Twitter doesn't have a specific bookmarking feature, but savvy tweeters often favourite posts as a means of coming back to them later on. Save is another example of how Facebook is increasingly focusing on breaking news and trending content. Facebook has said Save will be rolled out to all users over the next few days.",
