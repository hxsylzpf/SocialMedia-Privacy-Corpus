  "content": "BlackBerry manufacturer Research In Motion will allow Indian authorities partial access to its Messenger chat services to placate security fears, a senior government source has told the Reuters news agency. The Canadian company is reportedly ready to allow authorities more access to data transmitted between its handsets, and is talking about how to allay government fears over BlackBerry Enterprise email services. India's Department of Telecommunications \u2013 the body orchestrating the discussions \u2013 has asked at least three mobile operators to put in place monitoring capability for the BlackBerry Messenger and Enterprise email by 31 August. RIM has said it will provide a \"technical solution\" to the worries this week, a government source told Reuters. India has said it will shut down some BlackBerry services by 31 August if no settlement is reached. A senior government source, who asked not to be named, told the news agency: \"They have assured partial access to its Messenger services by 1 September and agreed to provide full access by the end of the year.\" Last week RIM issued a public statement to its approximately 800,000 BlackBerry users in the country, saying any negotiations over increased access to data transmitted between its devices would abide to four principles: that it was legal, that there would \"no greater access\" to BlackBerry services than other services, that there would be no changes in the security for Enterprise customers, and it would not make \"specific deals for specific customers\". India's main concern is thought to be with data passed between corporate BlackBerry devices using Enterprise services. When using the BlackBerry Enterprise Service (BES), an organisation hosts its own server and encryption key for access to transmitted content, offering a higher level of security. RIM said neither it nor the mobile operator has access to these encryption keys, meaning the only organisation able to decrypt data is the company hosting the server. India is seeking a solution where it can lawfully intercept messages passed between the devices, which may involve using internal servers hosted by a third party. Security fears over BlackBerry services in the country are thought to spring from the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack in which 116 people died. Officials suspect the culprits used encrypted Blackberry services. RIM is facing the threat of a ban on some BlackBerry services in India, Indonesia, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.",
