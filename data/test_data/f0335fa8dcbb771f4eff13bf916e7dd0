  "content": "You may have heard a lot about Google's Knol recently, but you have probably never heard of HubPages. This is a pity, because while Knol is based on the same idea \u2013 inviting users to create pages on topics they know about \u2013 HubPages looks better, reads better, and is better organised. I am being a little unfair to Knol, of course. The service was only announced in December, and opened to the general public on July 23. It will certainly improve. HubPages, by contrast, is already two years old, and Squidoo \u2013 another site based on exactly the same idea \u2013 is even older. But by learning from these pioneers, Google could have done a much better job with Knol. Most of us have compared Knol to Wikipedia: they could have called it Googlepedia. But both Knol and HubPages do two things very differently from Wikipedia. First, they identify their authors, who take full responsibility for their own pages. Second, they provide a way to make money, though I suspect most contributors won't make much. Writing knols or hubs is therefore a competitive rather than a collaborative sport. A thousand people can all create pages about the same topic and hope the best one wins. But there are also differences. Knol has a desperately dull home page with text links to articles about Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Evolving Trends in Laparoscopic Surgery, and so on, and most of the featured articles are very academic. HubPages has a colourful invitation to \"Publish your passion\". It features articles about Beatles album cuts, the Top 10 Most Expensive Items On eBay, How to Identify Poisonous House Spiders, and so on. It takes a populist approach. Hubs are easier to browse than knols. HubPages uses tags to create subject categories such as Love, Health, Finance, Shopping and Business. You can also browse by author, request a hub if you can't find what you want, and chat with other hubbers in the online forum. In these respects, HubPages is more of a social networking site. If you like one of Shalini Gupta's hubs, for example, you can vote for it, leave a comment, browse her other 260 articles, download some of her ebooks, and become a fan \u2013 she has more than 600 already. She's popular partly because one of her subjects is writing hubs for profit. So far, HubPages has published more than 50,000 hubs and attracts more than 5 million unique visitors per month. It also makes more than 90% of its revenue from Google Adsense advertising, and Google features HubPages as a case study. For a small start-up, this is success. Can that success continue now that Google has invaded its turf? HubPages gets most of its traffic and almost all its money from Google, but what if Knol's pages appear consistently higher in search results than those from HubPages, Squidoo and similar sites? Google's search is closed and proprietary, so we have no way of knowing if it favours Knol unfairly. But we're watching."
