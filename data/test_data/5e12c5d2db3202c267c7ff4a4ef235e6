  "content": "Paul Chambers. Sir Olly C. Joshua Cryer. The one thing the three men have in common is that all have been found guilty of offences under section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 for tweets they sent. Section 127, entitled \"Improper use of a public electronic communications network\" says in subsection (1) that it is an offence for a person to send a message that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character over a public electronic communications network. It is this subsection that the above tweeters all fell foul of. Joshua Cryer, a law student, was convicted after posting a series of racist tweets aimed at the footballer Stan Collymore. The judge determined they fell into the category of \"grossly offensive\" and sentenced him to a two-year community order. John Kerlen \u2013 aka Sir Olly C \u2013 was found guilty earlier this month of sending tweets the judge determined were both grossly offensive and menacing, for posting a picture of a Bexley councillor's house and asking: \"Which cunt lives in a house like this. Answers on a postcard to #bexleycouncil\"; followed by a second tweet saying: \"It's silly posting a picture of a house on Twitter without an address, that will come later. Please feel free to post actual shit.\" He awaits sentence, due in May. A lot of the debate surrounding his case focuses on the context of the tweets against the background of the battle between Kerlen and Bexley council, and whether his words are indeed grossly offensive. Paul Chambers's case, widely known as the Twitter joke trial, is perhaps the most famous of the trio and arguably the most ridiculous. Due in more than a week to travel to see his girlfriend and noting the local airport was closed, he was convicted after he tweeted \"Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!!\" He appealed against his conviction to the crown court. In dismissing the appeal, the judge said his tweet was \"menacing in its content and obviously so. It could not be more clear. Any ordinary person reading this would see it in that way and be alarmed\". In February, Ben Emmerson QC appeared in the high court on behalf of Chambers on a further appeal. This appeal was by way of case stated, which means the focus is on points of law only. Judgment is awaited. At the time, Carl Gardner, who was at the hearing, wrote: \"Where Ben Emmerson made more ground was on his proportionality argument \u2013 that freedom of expression means that the court must consider the entire context, including the fact that those responsible for security at Robin Hood airport did not see the tweet as representing a 'credible' threat, and decide whether the prosecution was a proportionate response to the tweet.\" Whenever section 127 is used in respect of Twitter, it raises debate ranging from questioning if it is an appropriate use of law at all, to concerns regarding the effect on the right to freedom of expression. Has section 127 itself become a menace? Looking at Chambers's case, DC Lighton, one of the officers, seems to hit the nail on the proverbial head when he made the following entry on the police case management system: \"Male detained re making threats to Doncaster Robin Hood Airport. The male in question has been bailed and his phone/computer has been seized \u2013 there is no evidence at this stage to suggest that this is anything other than a foolish comment posted on Twitter as a joke for only his close friends to see.\" It is frequently said the law is an ass. My usual riposte to that comment is to smile and agree, suggesting it is indeed a hard-working beast. In the case of Chambers, however, it is bordering on impossible to defend the prosecution itself, the subsequent conviction and the failure of the crown court appeal. At the other end of the spectrum is Cryer. Should anyone have to put up with a racist attack because the words are put out over Twitter, or should the mechanism in that context not matter? Arguably the law was put to proper use in that instance, although there were alternative charges that could have be laid, as seen in the case of Liam Stacey, recently convicted under section 4A of the Public Order Act 1986 for similar acts. In the middle we have Kerlen, whose tweets, when read in the context of his battle with Bexley council, could be described as a further demonstration of his frustration. To say that expressing frustration should be a criminal act is uncomfortable, although it frequently is \u2013 physically lashing out is still an assault, as is verbally in some contexts. The events leading to the frustration do, however, have their place in mitigating sentence, which is now his only hope given the conviction. Is section 127 a menace? Paul Chambers's legacy may well be that he brings about clarification in the law, should the high court step up to the plate and use the opportunity it has been presented with. If not, we best all be careful of what we say.",
