  "content": "Naomi Campbell today branded as \"harsh\" the appeal court's decision to back the Daily Mirror's report of her drugs counselling. The Streatham-born model said the fact she had lied about someting private did not justify newspaper intrusion. \"The idea that because you deny something about your private life automatically entitles the media to publish otherwise private information seems to me to be very harsh indeed and doesn't seem to recognise that there may be all sorts of conditions that someone should want to keep private,\" Ms Campbell said through her lawyer, Keith Schillings. She added: \"The appeal verdict was harsh. I do not think it was terrible or extraordinary to want to keep private the fact that you have problems and are seeking treatment.\" Ms Campbell stressed the legal saga was not an attack against the entire UK press. \"I wish to clarify that my legal action was not an attack against the media in general. I have the utmost respect for the media, many whom have contributed to my success over the years. \"My complaint is against those who deliberately set out to publish a sensational article using highly questionable methods.\""
