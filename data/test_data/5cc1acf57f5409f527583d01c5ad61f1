  "content": "A 15-year-old boy has been detained in Glasgow in connection with allegations of computer hacking, after reports that FBI agents sat in on his questioning. According to the Daily Record, the boy is accused of trying to hack into the US crime agency's computer system, and agents from the FBI travelled to Glasgow after detectives arrested him on Tuesday and searched his home. In a statement, Police Scotland said: \"Following a search of a property in the Glasgow area on Tuesday 16 February, a 15-year-old male was arrested in connection with alleged offences under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. He has since been released from custody and is subject of a report to the procurator-fiscal.\" Police would not confirm whether, if prosecuted, the boy could face extradition to the United States."
