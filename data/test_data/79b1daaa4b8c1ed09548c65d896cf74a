No surprises, then, that Johnny Marr, currently of the Cribs but also kind of famous for his guitar work with the Smiths, decided to take to Twitter to let his feelings be known about one of his most high-profile fans. Who knows, maybe Dave will respond with a \"Whatevs, lol!\" on his own Twitter?"
