  "content": "Requirements that internet cafes in a southern Chinese city install Chinese-developed operating systems are raising new concerns over cyber-snooping by the authorities, a US government-funded radio station reported yesterday. The new rules went into effect on November 5 and are aimed at cracking down on pirated software, said Hu Shenghua, a spokesman for the culture bureau in the city of Nanchang, Jiangxi province. Internet cafe operators are required to replace unlicensed software with legitimate copies of either Microsoft Windows or China's Red Flag Linux operating system, while paying a fee, he said. However, Radio Free Asia said cafes were being required to install Red Flag Linux even if they were using authorised copies of Windows. It quoted Xiao Qiang, director of the California-based China Internet Project, as saying the new rules would help the authorities to undertake heightened surveillance of the cafes. Chinese people who use internet cafes are already required to register with their identification cards. Whether accessed from home or an internet cafe, the internet in China is regularly monitored for content deemed politically subversive, or related to gambling, pornography, or illegal business dealings. Large numbers of websites are blocked and dozens of Chinese citizens have been arrested for accessing or sending politically sensitive information over the web. China has the world's largest population of internet users, with 253 million, and the Chinese authorities are eager to encourage internet usage as a driver for commerce."
