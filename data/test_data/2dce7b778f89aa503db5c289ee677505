  "content": "Inside, a new \"social film experience\" directed by DJ Caruso (I Am Number Four, Disturbia) invites Facebook, Twitter and YouTube users to participate in an in-production movie in real time. A trailer for the project, funded by Intel and Toshiba, shows a young woman (played by The Day After Tomorrow's Emmy Rossum) waking up in a locked, padded room. There is no obvious way of escape and no link to the outside world other than a laptop to communicate with real people once filming starts on 25 July. Users will be able talk to Rossum's character as the \"blockbuster calibre\" film is shot, and will be encouraged to help her think of ways in which she could escape. The trailer for the project is running with the tagline: \"Her only way out will be to bring you in.\" While this could potentially open up a new avenue in crowd-sourced film-making (labelled \"social Hollywood\" by Caruso in a promotional video) there is some suggestion that traditional Hollywood values will still hold some sway over the experiment. \"When the story begins everyone can play a part,\" said the director. \"But with the Social Casting Call we're looking for one talented, well-connected person to make a special cameo in the final film.\""
