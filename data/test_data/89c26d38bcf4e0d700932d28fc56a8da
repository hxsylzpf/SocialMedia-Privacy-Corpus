  "content": "Absent from the world of pop for five years, Justin Timberlake last week announced his return with the promise of a new album (The 20/20 Experience) and the release of a new single, Suit and Tie, which has already sold around 300,000 digital copies. Not bad, JT \u2013 but what have you been up to while you've been away? For those who haven't been keeping track, here's a refresher course in the pop star's busy sabbatical from music. Designing golf courses What else? Timberlake has been a keen golfer for a number of years, since being introduced to the game, mid-tour, by his stage manager. \"All I was thinking about is getting a little ball into a little hole. It was just the best mental release from performing on stage,\" he said in 2011. \"A golf course can be a spiritual place.\" Playing wasn't enough. In 2009 Timberlake designed his own course in Tennessee and it has won several awards for eco-friendliness since. Getting married in Italy\u2026 To actor Jessica Biel, at the end of last year. \u2026 and offending the homeless of LA on the way to the altar A friend of Timberlake's, excited by the impending nuptials, made a YouTube video in which he interviewed homeless people in Los Angeles about the event. The video was titled \"Greetings from Your Hollywood Friends Who Just Couldn't Make it\". Apologising for the stunt, which he put down to \"associative knuckleheads\", he was moved to assure people that the footage was not broadcast at any point during his wedding. Investing Timberlake bought a stake in MySpace, at the time owned by Rupert Murdoch, as part of a $35m acquisition of the social media site by Specific Media in June 2011. The chief exec at Specific Media confirmed at the time that Timberlake, as part of the team, would get a desk at MySpace HQ, but was \"probably not going to be there every day\". Timberlake's new single streamed for free on a new-look MySpace last week. Acting In the brilliant Facebook movie The Social Network, and in the not-so-brilliant In Time, a sci-fi thriller about a future Earth in which nobody ages beyond 25. Otherwise dressing up Fooling around with American Esquire magazine in summer 2011, the pop star dressed up in a full-body costume as Ernie from Sesame Street, and spent some time walking around a comics convention in California. \"One of the most memorable days of my life,\" he called it. \"I keep forgetting, when people ask to take our picture.. It's because I'm Ernie. It's not because I'm me.\""
