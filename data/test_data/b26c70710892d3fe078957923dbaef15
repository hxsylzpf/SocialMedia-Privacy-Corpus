  "content": "As someone who aspires to run a country one day, Sarah Palin (@sarahpalinusa), the problems you have running your own Twitter account concern me. Between made up words (\"Peaceful Muslims, pls refudiate\") and inflammatory rhetoric (\"Commonsense Conservatives &amp; lovers of America: \"Don't Retweet, Instead RELOAD!\"), your stint on Twitter has not been a resounding success. Can you be helped? You betcha! Being good at Twitter could be as easy as seeing Russia from your house. How do you solve a problem like Bin Laden? Last week, you tweeted: \"Show photo [of Bin Laden's corpse] as warning to others seeking America's destruction. No pussy-footing around, no politicking, no drama; it's part of the mission.\" You're getting \"what to do when you shoot the world's most wanted international terrorist\" confused with \"what to do when you shoot Alaska's most wanted moose\". Easy mistake, but this is one circumstance when a framed photo of a corpse on the mantelpiece is not appropriate. Calls for Bin Laden's head to be stuffed and mounted on the wall of the Oval Office will probably be refused on similar grounds. Pick your fights You really have a bee in your bonnet about Barack Obama (@BarackObama), Sarah. Where I see a groovy cat with big ears and an even bigger IQ, you see some kind of tax hikin', liberty hatin', rootin', tootin' antiChrist. Your incessant anti-Obama outbursts, such as \"Pls refer to Jan.1 tax changes appropriately: they're OBAMA TAX HIKES &amp; they'll slam every American's savings, investments &amp; job opportunity\" are dull. You had your chance in 2008 and you're not in the White House. You're no longer even mayor of a two-bit town in Alaska, just another wannabe with a reality show. Why not debate vajazzles with The Only Way is Essex's Amy Childs (@missamychilds) instead? It's more your level. Sex up your avatar You might think you look outdoorsy and \"all\u2013American\" in your Twitter picture, but that red tracksuit is a bit Sue Sylvester from Glee (@S_SylvesterGLEE). If you insist on a sporty look, a swimsuit shot might distract followers from some of the more unsavoury comments on your Twitter. Show a bit of skin, Miss Alaska. That way nobody will care what you say. Love, @scouserachel"
