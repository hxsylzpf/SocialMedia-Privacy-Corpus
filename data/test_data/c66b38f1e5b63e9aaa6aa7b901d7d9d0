  "content": "Twitter's having a bad day. First it got told off by the US Federal Trade Commission for incidents in January and May last year when 33 accounts, including Barack Obama's, were hacked using the company's own internal support tools. And then it's having to scale back on its API in order to get the site in order, according to its status page. The FTC settlement is \"the agency's first such case against a social networking site\" over flawed data security. According to the FTC's complaint, between January and May 2009, hackers who gained administrative control of Twitter were able to view nonpublic user information, gain access to direct messages and protected tweets, and reset any user's password and send authorized tweets from any user account. The January case was interesting: \"a hacker used an automated password-guessing tool to gain administrative control of Twitter, after submitting thousands of guesses into Twitter's login webpage. The administrative password was a weak, lower case, common dictionary word. Using the password, the hacker reset numerous user passwords and posted some of them on a website, where other people could access them. Using these fraudulently reset passwords, other intruders sent phony tweets from approximately nine user accounts. One tweet was sent from the account of then-President-elect Barack Obama, offering his more than 150,000 followers a chance to win $500 in free gasoline. At least one other phony tweet was sent from the account of Fox News.\" The key there being \"weak, lower case, common dictionary word\". Weak passwords are likely to be the Achilles heel of startups, because nobody thought they'd get big, so they used easy passwords. Then when things get big, everyone's forgotten that there's a weak link in the system from those early passwords. Similarly in May 2009: \"During a second security breach, in April 2009, a hacker compromised a Twitter employee's personal e-mail account where two passwords similar to the employee's Twitter administrative password were stored, in plain text. Using this information, the hacker was able to guess the employee's Twitter administrative password. The hacker reset at least one Twitter user's password, and could access private user information and tweets for any Twitter users.\" Guessable passwords: also not good. However the action taken against Twitter could be called wrist-slapping: \"Under the terms of the settlement, Twitter will be barred for 20 years from misleading consumers about the extent to which it maintains and protects the security, privacy, and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information, including the measures it takes to prevent authorized access to information and honor [sic] the privacy choices made by consumers. The company also must establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program, which will be assessed by a third party every other year for 10 years.\" Could be a lot worse, to be honest. Could have involved money. Meanwhile, Twitter is having \"issues\" with its site, and has temporarily disabled RSS and Atom feeds, and has lowered the number of queries that can be made through its API per hour as it makes \"adjustments to some site features\".",
