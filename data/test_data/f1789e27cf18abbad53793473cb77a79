  "content": "I have joined Twitter. Because I was advised to. But now what? I don't know whether I'm cut out for this sort of thing. I can't manage LinkedIn, I only have six Facebook friends, because I don't want any, honestly. I only joined to track Daughter while she's away working on dangerous foreign rubbish dumps, but now I've plunged into Twitter in a rather reckless way, just following anyone I know vaguely on the list of suggestions that pops up. I see enormous potential for rejection, humiliation and heartbreak here. What if these people I'm following think I'm a creep and don't follow me back again? I notice that I'm following loads more people than are following me, but some of them are just TV news stations, which I started with, because they're less personal, so hopefully Channel 4 News and al-Jazeera won't mind me creeping after them, but then I just went wild, clicking on nearly everyone. \"You just want to show off about your book, don't you?\" says Rosemary harshly. \"Really! I'm ashamed of you. And from what I hear, it's just people criticising other people. I get enough criticism, thanks, mainly from you. I don't need any more. I can't be fiddled with it. Anyway, I thought we opposed such novelties?\" So did I until now, but things are changing. Tweeting is good for conferences, says Olivia. She should know. She chaired a discussion in an art gallery last week, and instead of ordering everyone to turn their mobiles off, the chap in charge almost begged them not to. \"I do hope you'll all be tweeting,\" said he rather poignantly. \"These are shameless and desperate times,\" said Olivia briskly. \"Do you know the terms 'trending' and 'on trend'?\" No I don't. So I've tweeted about my frogs. Could that be \"trending\" and riveting enough? If I just stuck to events in the back garden: froggies, dogs, birdies \u2013 would that be desperate showing off? \"Don't ask me,\" says Rosemary. \"Who are you telling about the bloody frogs? What's the point of it? I'm no clearer.\" Neither am I. But do follow me on @froggiewoggie."
