  "content": "\"Flawed scientific thinking\" in the government's proposed changes to the DNA database will leave it open to further challenges by the courts, experts have said, in a stark attack on Home Office plans to overhaul the current system. The proposals, set out as part of a government consultation after the existing DNA database was found in breach of human rights last year, are based on exaggerated scientific claims and ignore the realities of persistent offending, two leading criminologists have said. \"There is a flaw in the scientific evidence that sustains the government's argument,\" said Keith Soothill, emeritus professor of social research at Lancaster University. Soothill and fellow professor Brian Francis last week published a paper arguing that key aspects of the government's proposals \u2013 which change the current periods for retaining DNA from all people arrested to six years, and 12 years for serious and violent crime arrests \u2013 have not been proved. \"We are concerned that the DNA database will focus on crimes, not criminals,\" Soothill said. \"If every criminal committed one crime it would be fine, but in fact half of all crimes are committed by something like 6% of persistent offenders. Because they are re-offending quickly, the length of time their records need to be kept is significantly less than six years. \"The government has been given a version which exaggerates the length of time you need to catch these crimes.\" The criminologists, who have presented their findings to the Home Office, were also critical of plans to keep DNA profiles for those arrested for serious offences for 12 years. \"The only logic of keeping people on for the longer term is that they have a chance of being convicted for a serious crime, but the government have not produced any evidence for this,\" Soothill said. \"Keeping people convicted of serious sexual assault on the database just because they are more likely to commit shoplifting would not stand up before the European court of human rights.\" The claims come as lawyers also questioned the government's evidential basis for the new six- and 12-year periods for retaining DNA, and the need to retain profiles from those who are arrested but later acquitted. \"In Scotland there is no power to retain DNA material when a person is arrested but not convicted unless the offence is a serious one,\" David Pannick QC, a human rights barrister and crossbench peer, said earlier this month. \"The consultation paper does not refer to any evidence that this has caused any detriment to the fight against serious crime in Scotland. \"The evidence presented in the consultation paper to justify a period as long as 12 years is weak.\" The Home Office consultation follows a ruling by the European court of human rights in December that condemned the government's existing database for failing to strike the correct balance between preventing crime and protecting privacy, stating that the court had been \"struck by the blanket and indiscriminate nature\" of the government's powers to take and keep DNA samples and profiles. The Home Office has said it will comply with the court's ruling and take evidence into account in determining the new retention periods for DNA. \"We are committed to putting in place an evidence-based retention regime that is informed by public consultation, has public support and enhances public protection,\" a Home Office spokesperson said. \"Our proposals will ensure that the right people are on the database, as well as considering when people should come off.\" Minority groups have also slammed the government's plans. There are concerns minorities are overrepresented on the database \u2013 with an estimated 57% of black men reported to have their profiles stored despite their lower overall lifetime offending rates than white men. \"This disturbing fact perpetuates the racist and wholly inaccurate stereotype that this group have a higher propensity to break the law,\" said Matilda MacAttram, the founder of Black Mental Health UK. \"The DNA database is potentially the greatest threat to black civil liberties seen in the last 50 years in the UK.\""
