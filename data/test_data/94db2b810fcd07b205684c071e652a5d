  "content": "Information commissioner Richard Thomas has said that his organisation will target \"deliberate and cavalier offenders\", including journalists, who obtain confidential information such as celebrities' telephone numbers and bank details illegally. Speaking today following the publication of the Information Commission's report \"What price privacy?\", Mr Thomas added that he wanted the document to act as a \"warning shot across the bows\" of organisations including newspapers who buy personal information from private detectives. \"We obviously cannot prosecute left, right and centre but if there are deliberate and cavalier offenders then we will bring a case,\" he said. \"We have asked the National Union of Journalists to toughen up their approach to this issue.\" Mr Thomas added that the list of the names of 305 journalists, who his office said had obtained information on people using illegal methods, was \"not likely\" to be made public, but that the offenders will be monitored. He said that the report served to remind potential offenders of the dangers of having a criminal conviction. \"Even if it is a \u00a310 fine it is still a criminal record,\" he added. \"We want to stifle the supply and demand.\" The commission is calling for the Commons culture, media and sport select committee to investigate its claims and will consult on its report. Mr Thomas will produce a follow-up report in six month's time. Today's report offered for the first time extensive evidence of the existence of a \"pervasive and widespread industry\" devoted to illegally buying and selling people's personal information such as addresses, details of car ownership, ex-directory telephone numbers , criminal records and bank account details. One private detective invoiced \u00a3120,000 a month according to the commission's investigation. The offence of illegally obtaining information breaks section 55 of the Data Protection Act and current penalties usually carry a \u00a3500,000 fine. Mr Thomas's initiative has already received the backing of a number of celebrities including the television presenters Chris Tarrant and Fiona Phillips. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
