  "content": "Alastair Campbell gave a nice illustration of how social media has changed the game of spin in an address to the Festival of Marketing in London on Thursday. He recalled how he had fulfilled a lifetime dream by playing in a six-a-side tournament at Turf Moor, the home of his beloved Burnley FC against a team from Hollyoaks. A row with one player resulted in \"minor fisticuffs\", but Campbell's team still lost. Two hours later he was trending on Twitter because Mail Online had run a story saying he had been involved in a \"bizarre football punch up with pop heartthrob Tom Parker which led to The Wanted superstar being stretchered to hospital with a suspected broken leg\". The accident actually happened in a later match \u2013 \"when did an inconvenient fact like that stop the Mail?\", Campbell quipped. But his broader point was how he responded by simply composing three tweets, one of which was a link to a statement on his blog \"setting out facts in a lighthearted manner. I cannot claim to have come out well in the papers the next day. But my line was in there, and so was the tone.\" He added: \"I reflected on how much the world of so-called spin had changed. I recalled those Sundays spent at home, ticking off every paper as I called to brief them one by one. Time intensive, ballsaching, not family friendly.\" Now no verbal interaction with a single human being is required: \"Me, my phone, my blog, Twitter, with automatic link through to Facebook. That's it.\""
