  "content": "Someone out there may be trying to steal your identity. Latest Home Office figures reveal that identity theft is the fastest growing form of fraud in the UK and ministers say urgent measures are now needed to tackle it. In a consultation paper called, Entitlement Cards and Identity Theft, published earlier this summer, the government estimated that fraud from either stealing someone's identity or falsifying an identity cost the economy \u00a31.3bn last year. Indications so far this year suggest there is no sign of the figures going down. Incidences of identity fraud against institutions such as the Benefits Agency and against individuals, leapt by 461% in 2000 according to fraud prevention agency, CIFAS. This was followed by a further 122% increase in 2001, with the first three months of this year already up by 55% on the same period last year. But the most alarming growth - up from 2,000 recorded cases in 1999 to 27,000 in 2001 - has been in the theft of an individual's identity used to run up debt. Every day thousands of people casually discard credit card receipts, utility bills and other personal documents, the information which fraudsters use to assume an identity and run up huge debts. The victim may only find out when the next credit card bill lands on the doormat. Worse still, for someone who moves home but fails to have their post forwarded, it may only be when the bailiffs are banging on the door of their new home that they become aware that their name has been used by another person. The ease with which an individual's identity can be stolen is astonishing. Typically, it is taken not by a highly sophisticated crime syndicate, but rather by a small-time crook using a bit of initiative: they happen to move into your old house, then register your name on the local electoral roll as if you still lived there, and go on to lead a double life, opening up accounts in your name, but never paying the bills. Because electoral rolls are not cross-checked for duplication, a single person could easily be registered by any number of councils. And since the electoral roll tends to be the first port of call for checking agencies approving credit, they can pile up the bills. \"False identity fraud remains the fastest growing fraud type in the UK,\" a spokesman for CIFAS says. \"Impersonations are up nearly 20%. Every impersonation involves an innocent victim, many of whom were victims of street crime, burglary or assault and had personal details stolen.\" The report also warns that the true scale of such fraud may be much greater than the government's estimates because many cases go unreported and, of those that are, a proportion may well be recorded as something else. For example, when a credit card is stolen, the crime could be recorded as obtaining property by deception and not identity theft. Last year 1,484 fraudulent passport applications were detected in the UK and 3,231 driving tests were postponed because of doubts about the applicant's identity. The Benefits Agency's Security Investigation Service confirmed 564 cases of identity fraud, while the Financial Services Authority dealt with 18,500 referrals under money laundering regulations. Wider identity fraud is also associated with organised crime according to the Home Office. Gangs are involved in trafficking of illegal immigrants, drug running, money laundering and organised fraud such as creating multiple identities to defraud benefits agencies or credit card companies. One of the government's proposed methods for tackling identity fraud is the introduction of identity cards, yet its own report concedes that one possible drawback of these - that they could become an easy counterfeiting target for criminals - is a very real possibility. \"This could perversely result in an increased risk of fraud,\" the report concludes. There is also concern that, should plans for identity cards come to fruition, many organisations will drop their guard and rely too heavily on the cards as the sole proof of ID, giving counterfeiters carte blanche to steal, falsify, or duplicate the identity of a wider number of people with less chance of being found out. The government has put forward a number of further proposals to address the problem, including setting up a new identity fraud forum which will coordinate government departments most affected, such as the DVLA, passport service and Inland Revenue. It is also suggesting tightening passport application procedures as well as increased use of credit reference agencies to help verify information when someone's identity is in question. In addition, there are plans in the pipeline to create a new criminal offence of identity fraud. Currently, it is only an offence to use a false identity or adopt someone else's if it can be proved there was intent to commit a criminal act. In the meantime, shredding household bills and regularly checking credit ratings could keep the worst consequences of stolen identity at bay.",
