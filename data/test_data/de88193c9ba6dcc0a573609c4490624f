  "content": "The streets of Boston were emptied last week to allow the FBI and the Boston police to do their job. The internet, however, was an all too crowded place. It was crammed with speculation, some of it very damaging. Within minutes, web forums were in full production mode: there had been four bombs instead of two; the Boston library had been targeted; online wanted posters appeared naming people who turned out to be innocent. Hard evidence, the FBI's release of photos and video of the two bombers, crumbled in the hands of the social media forum Reddit. The citizen investigators identified the second suspect, the man in the white hat, as a Brown university student who disappeared on 16 March, a mistake for which the thread's moderator apologised. So the case against social media is not difficult to make; the problem is that it ignores that the social media can never be more than a reflection of the society they operate in. Few keep calm or wait for confirmation in the face of traumatic events, and the response in post-9/11 America to anything that can be branded international terrorism is predictably far from calm and orderly. The important thing is not to confuse the medium with the message. The mainstream media were as guilty at jumping the gun as everyone else. The New York Post on Thursday carried a picture of two men, neither of them suspects, under the headline \"Bag Men\". CNN reported that an arrest had been made at a time when the bombers were still at large. The Boston Globe, Fox News and Associated Press all did the same. CNN said it based its report on three sources at local and federal level. As soon as the sources came back to CNN with more information, it \"adjusted\" its reporting. There are lessons for mainstream media, too. It needs to do better than the adage: \"Never wrong for long.\" What were the new media lessons of Boston? Reddit found that the health warnings it posted were undermined by the reality of what was being posted on its site. The whole dynamic of the thread was to investigate, amplify and harden suspicion. Web sleuths were going further than printing wanted posters. \"Find people carrying black bags,\" wrote the Reddit forum's moderator. \"If they look suspicious, then post them. Then people will try and follow their movements using all the images.\" For a few days, they were all playing a grand game of amateur CSI. Did this operationally lessen or increase the pressure on the FBI and the Boston authorities to move faster, with the unforeseen consequences that emerged as a result? Did they clear the streets only to find themselves stampeded into action by the internet? Crowdsourcing is only as effective as the quality of the crowd, and that depends on how much care has gone in to selecting and defining it. But the possibility that the crowd sowed more confusion than it shed light in the hunt for the bombers does not rule it out as a legitimate investigative tool. It helped the Guardian reveal police involvement in the death of Ian Tomlinson. It has become first on the scene of any civil emergency or disaster, be it an airliner landing in the Hudson river, the Haiti earthquake, the Arab spring. In conflicts where there is impunity, such as the civil war raging in Bashar Assad's Syria, the social media are there to provide, if they can, a record. It may never end up in a trial in The Hague but it is a record nonetheless. Compare that to the days of Hafez Assad, who razed an entire town before any news could get out. Social media are here to stay. They create a swirling mass of information and disinformation. They are, in the end, self-correcting. The proliferation of personal cameras ensures that any crowd and any event is self-documenting. The creation and reproduction of these images is no longer the monopoly of governments or armies. The social media are open to all to misuse them, but equally to use as a positive force for change, to challenge official accounts and hold them up to independent scrutiny. No one should or could want to wish this all away."
