  "content": "Younger people are switching off TV and radio in their droves in favour of online pursuits such as Facebook, leading to a growing \"generation gap\" in TV and radio. A report by media regulator Ofcom published on Monday said 16- to 24-year-olds spent an average of 148 minutes a day watching TV in 2013, down from 169 minutes in 2010 and compared to an average of 232 minutes for all viewers. The decline in radio listening has also been precipitous, with 16- to 24-year-olds listening to 15.5 hours a week compared with 21.4 hours a decade earlier (and 21.5 hours across all ages). Ofcom said it was traditional for younger people to consumer less TV and radio, but warned that the latest changes may be part of a structural shift, driven by the digital era, in which TV and radio \u2013 in their traditional sense, at least \u2013 go permanently out of fashion. The regulator said there had been a \"radical change\" in the media and communications industry over the past five years, with the rise of on-demand services, from the BBC's iPlayer to commercial service Netflix, and the switch to digital TV. The main public service broadcasters, including the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, had a 51.1% share of all TV viewing last year, rising to 58.7% when the new breed of \"timeshifted\" channels is included. BBC1 will launch BBC1+1 next year. It is down from a 60.8% share of all the main channels in 2008. In its third annual review of public service broadcasting, Ofcom expressed particular concern about the decline in the audience share and reach of Channel 4's main network and Channel 4 News. The broadcaster's main channel weekly reach was 48% in 2013, down from just over 53% in 2010. Its share of the audience fell to 4.9% (rising to 5.8% including Channel 4+1) last year from 6.2% in 2010, just over a fifth, offset by the growth in its portfolio of channels including E4. However, Ofcom concluded that overall Channel 4 had been \"broadly performing well in delivering its duties\" as a public service broadcaster since 2010. Between 2008 and 2013, public service channels cut investment in original first-run programmes by 17% to \u00a32.41bn. Investment outside of these main channels on homegrown non-sport programmes grew 43% to \u00a3345m. 'Tech natives' Ofcom said the \"generation gap between younger and older audiences appears to be getting wider, with significant differences in opinion, attitude and habits towards PSB and television more generally\". It added: \"While younger audiences have always watched less television than older audiences, our audience research suggests that the connected generation are watching increasingly less television, and that they may be taking these habits with them as they age.\" It identified \"tech natives\", aged 16 to 30, of whom \"less than half now think that the TV is their most important source for relaxing or entertainment\". The Ofcom review is a precursor to a public consultation into the role and performance of public service broadcasters in the UK. It said 78% of viewers said they were satisfied with the channels, up from 69% in 2008. But public service broadcasters were seen as less distinctive than before, with a feeling among viewers that they were \"duplicating successful programme ideas and formats, potentially at the expense of more original, innovative and challenging programming\". Ofcom said it would look at the issue of retransmission fees - the focus of lobbying by both ITV and Channel 4 - and terms of trade as part of its investigation into the future funding of public service broadcasting. It will also look at changing the rules on TV advertising and \"contestable funding\" for public service content. It appeared to rule out further top-slicing of the licence fee. \"It would require additional funding to be identified - any use of current [public service broadcasting] funds would reduce other forms of provision,\" it said. Despite the growth in on-demand viewing - around 3 million people in the UK are thought to subscribe to US internet TV service Netflix - patterns of TV consumption have changed more slowly than expected with the lion's share of viewing still to live linear TV. Overall levels of TV viewing held up, a daily average of 232 minutes in 2013, down from 241 minutes the year before. Ofcom said it would be a \"significant concern\" if the decline in spend on new first-run UK productions continued, and said there was a question about how well the broadcasters reflected different cultures in the UK. It also said there was concern that \"older or more vulnerable people might lose access to content because it is increasingly available only online\". Spend on original UK drama fell 34% over the five-year period, with the biggest decline on ITV. BBC1 saw one of the biggest percentage falls in terms of spend on first-run original content, down 26% from 2008 levels to \u00a3747m last year. In contrast, spend on entertainment programmes rose 9% over the same period. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
