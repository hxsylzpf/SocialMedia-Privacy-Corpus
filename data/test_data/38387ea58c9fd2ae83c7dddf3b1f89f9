Soichi Noguchi, a Japanese aeronautical engineer who has been in orbit since December, is entertaining his 50,000 followers with Twitpics sent from space. He's tweeted (@Astro_Soichi) some extraordinary snaps, including this one of the Golden Gate Bridge. He also describes life on board the space \u00adstation: \"De-gassing of the portable water bags complete. Now, on to the treadmill!\""
