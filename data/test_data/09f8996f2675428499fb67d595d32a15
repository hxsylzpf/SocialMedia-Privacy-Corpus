  "content": "The Football Association is threatening to report celebrity magazines Heat and Closer to the Press Complaints Commission after they published pictures of David Beckham standing on a hotel balcony in his underpants. Both titles this week defied the FA's warning that the pictures represented an invasion of the footballer's privacy and published them in their entirety. The FA's lawyers have contacted Emap, the publisher of both magazines, to try to secure an apology and a donation to a charity of Beckham's choice by way of compensation. They say the pictures, taken by a paparazzi photographer when Beckham was on a balcony of the England team's hotel in Portugal, violate PCC guidelines that ban the publication of photographs taken on private property. However, Emap said it was justified in publishing the pictures because they were \"already in the public domain\", according to a company spokeswoman. The publisher is talking to the FA's lawyers but is understood to have adopted a bullish attitude and to be resisting calls for compensation. A source said the company had pointed out to the FA that the hotel was in the centre of Lisbon and Beckham had recently appeared on the cover of men's magazine Arena in his underpants. The association is also demanding an apology from the Sun and the Daily Star, which splashed the pictures across their front pages last week. Big Pictures, the London picture agency that sold the photographs, has already agreed to pay compensation to Beckham's chosen charity and the FA wrote to Heat and Closer last week warning them not to use the pictures. The FA excluded Sun and Star photographers from a pre-match press conference on Friday and is also threatening to report them to the PCC. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
