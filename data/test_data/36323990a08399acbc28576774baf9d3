  "content": "Supermodel Naomi Campbell arrived at the high court in London today to bring her ground-breaking privacy action against the Mirror. The 31-year-old is suing the paper for breach of confidence and/or unlawful invasion of privacy after it published a photograph of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting a year ago. The newspaper said Campbell had been receiving regular counselling in a \"courageous bid to beat her addiction to drink and drugs\". The Streatham-born model was whisked through a side entrance of the royal courts of justice in the Strand in a limousine. Wearing a light grey flannel trouser suit, white shirt, pink tie and black boots, she fiddled with her mane of dark hair as she chatted to her legal team outside Court 13. Campbell is expected to give evidence before Mr Justice Morland later this morning. Piers Morgan, the editor of the Mirror, was also in court. He has also pledged to go into the witness box during the estimated five-day case, which will not involve a jury. Publisher MGN Ltd is to defend the claim vigorously and, if necessary, intends to pursue the case to the court of appeal and the European court of human rights. The case is being seen as an important test of the Human Rights Act as a de facto privacy law. Several celebrities have threatened to sue newspapers following its incorporation into British law 18 months ago, but so far none have made it to court. Amanda Holden threatened action after she was snapped wandering around a private villa topless by the Star. However, she accepted \u00a340,000 in damages just before Christmas. The pictures, which showed Holden with her hair in rollers, were part of a two-day feature headlined \"It's Miss Titley in the garden of Eden\" - a reference to her school teacher role in the TV series The Grimleys. Her solicitor won an injunction preventing the second instalment of pictures of the actor, who was holidaying at a private residence in Italy."
