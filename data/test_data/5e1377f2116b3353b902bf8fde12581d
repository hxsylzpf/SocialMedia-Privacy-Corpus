  "content": "A journalism professor remains suspended without pay from Deakin University after a Twitter exchange led to the university accusing him of serious misconduct and suspending him. Martin Hirst was suspended on 19 April for three tweets he posted on his private Twitter account @ethicalmartini, which does not identify him as a Deakin University employee. It's the latest run-in with the authorities at Deakin for Hirst, who narrowly escaped losing his job in 2014 after the columnist Andrew Bolt drew attention to his Twitter account by posting a series of his tweets on his blog. This time, the university received a complaint about one tweet \u2013 which they allege was threatening towards a Deakin student \u2013 and after an investigation it identified two other tweets and accused Hirst of breaching the code of conduct for academics. News Corp columnist Rita Panahi said Hirst was a \"rent-seeking simpleton full of bitterness &amp; bile\" because Hirst had called her \"unstable\" when he jumped in to defend someone she had insulted. Then a Deakin university student, Lachlan McDougall, said: \"I'm glad I'm a commerce student and not subject to this man's [Hirst's] stewardship.\" McDougall's Twitter profile identifies him as a Deakin University student. Hirst replied: \"so are you happy to fail commerce?\" McDougall: \"If that's a threat, you're utterly ridiculous. If it's not, my academic record is satisfactory.\" The university received a complaint about Hirst's comment which alleged it was threatening and inappropriate but has declined to identify the complainant or give Hirst a copy of the complaint. \"Your comments are inappropriate, unprofessional and involved an implied threat to compromise this students' academic progression,\" the university said in its letter to Hirst. Hirst denied any threat, saying he did not know who McDougall was at the time and was questioning his intelligence given that he followed Panahi and he had made a derogatory remark about his teaching abilities. \"I am not in the same faculty as Mr McDougall and have no control over his marks for any unit,\" Hirst told the university in his official response. \"It is ridiculous to infer that I have either the intent or the capacity to impede the academic progress of this student.\" The second tweet contained a photo of a knitted beanie on which the words \"fuck it\" are printed, with the caption: \"Back to work after the Easter break? You need this beanie. I've got mine on today, it's a subtle hint to your boss\". A third was a retweet of a comment by ABC host Mark Colvin about Andrew Bolt's relatively small audience on Sky News, Hirst had added the words \"reassuring, masturbating chimps\". Deakin's school of communication and creative arts told Hirst his Twitter use constituted \"repeated instances of misconduct\" because the content was \"offensive and/or disrespectful and/or threatening and had the potential to damage the reputation of the university\". \"Please be advised that due to the very serious nature of the allegations which have been detailed in this letter, the university may ultimately take disciplinary action which may include, but is not limited to, termination of your employment,\" the letter of 19 April said. The university told Hirst in light of disciplinary action taken against him in 2014, his Twitter use was a \"gross breach\" of the academic code of conduct. Hirst told Guardian Australia he was shocked the university had interpreted his remark as a threat. \"To say that those tweets are offensive is just ridiculous. I can't believe that Deakin would accuse me of threatening a student. I've been there for five years, I've been an academic for 20 years and I've never had a student complaint. \"I love teaching, I love researching I'm good at it. I haven't been paid for seven weeks and I haven't heard from them for a month. \"All I was doing in that [McDougall] tweet was suggesting he wasn't very smart. I didn't even know he was a Deakin student ... Deakin won't tell me who complained. It could be vexatious and they're relying on that complaint for the basis of their charge. The Victorian division secretary of the National Tertiary Education Union, Colin Long, wrote to Deakin on Tuesday to demand Hirst be reinstated and his salary backdated because the allegations were not of a \"serious enough nature\" to warrant suspension under the university's enterprise agreement. \"The university has been in receipt of Professor Hirst's response to the allegations for a period of four weeks and still has not advised him of what, if any further action, will be taken in report of this matter,\" Long wrote. In 2014 Hirst was accused of bringing the university into disrepute and suspended without pay for three months after an increasingly vituperative exchange with various people on Twitter. The discussion began when the Daily Telegraph columnist Tim Blair posted on his blog a photo Hirst had taken of himself at Karl Marx's grave in London. Some of the tweets were subsequently posted on Bolt's blog. Hirst's job was saved after 150 academics and PhD students sent a letter to the university. \"It is scandalous that Andrew Bolt and the Murdoch press should have such control over Deakin university's hiring and firing policies,\" the letter said. A Deakin university spokeswoman said: \"It is the university's practice not to comment on individual staffing matters. All staff are expected to comply with their employment obligations and the university's code of conduct. \"Deakin University respects academic freedom and has clear policy on the protection afforded its academic staff in this regard.\""
