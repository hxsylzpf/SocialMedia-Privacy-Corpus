  "content": "The Sun newspaper apologised to Princes William and Harry last night after it published three-year-old photographs of them in a nightclub, claiming they had been taken this summer. A female friend of Prince Harry, Natalie Pinkham, shown in one of the photographs being fondled by him, also demanded an apology, claiming the pictures were hers. The paper splashed five pictures of the two princes, clearly having a good time with young women, across three pages yesterday, along with a cartoon and headlines calling them the Booze Brothers and captioning Harry as Dirty Harry, the Paw Prince and Squeezer Geezer. The complaints followed a troubled week for Rupert Murdoch's News International during which Clive Goodman, the royal editor of the Sun's sister paper, the News of the World, was arrested by police on suspicion of hacking into the mobile phone messages of royal officials at Clarence House. Mr Goodman is due to appear in court today. Senior editorial staff at the Sun said last night that the photographs were authentic but conceded they were old, contradicting an assertion in yesterday's paper that: \"The fun-loving shots were taken this summer in trendy London nightclub Boujis - a favourite haunt of the princes.\" The paper had suggested that Harry would be left \"with a little explaining to do\" to his girlfriend Chelsy Davy, who was not in the party. Across one of the pictures, the newspaper printed its traditional warning to rival tabloids not to lift its exclusive: \"Warning: Our lawyers are watching\". Possibly they were not watching closely enough, though, as an exasperated Clarence House responded yesterday by saying that the pictures were old and predated the prince's relationship with his girlfriend. The length of the princes' hair - rather longer than they would be allowed at Sandhurst military academy where both have trained in recent years - may also have given the game away. Ms Pinkham, 28, was said yesterday to be \"distressed and angry\". A spokeswoman was quoted on her behalf by the Evening Standard as saying: \"The original photographs are under lock and key at her home. (They) were taken at a private celebration of her birthday at the Purple Club in Chelsea in September 2003, which William and Harry attended. \"The pictures are personal and were never intended for publication. Natalie ... considers herself to be a friend of the princes and they are aware that she would never do anything to embarrass them.\" Ms Pinkham, daughter of a Northamptonshire property developer, is hoping to make a career as a television presenter for ITV4 and has also dated the England rugby player Matt Dawson and cricketer Kevin Pietersen. She was said by the newspaper last night to have withdrawn allegations that the pictures had been stolen. Paddy Harverson, the princes' official spokesman, said that they did not intend to take further action, such as reporting the paper to the Press Complaints Commission. He added: \"There are privacy issues but the reality is they [the princes] do not have much.\" In a statement the Sun attempted to mend fences with Harry, whom it described as \"our favourite playboy prince\" but added that the pictures had been taken in a popular London venue attended by members of the public. \"There is absolutely no question over their authenticity,\" the paper said."
