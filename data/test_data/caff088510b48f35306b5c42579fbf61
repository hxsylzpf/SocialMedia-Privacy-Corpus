  "content": "News Corp has bought Dublin-based social news agency Storyful for \u20ac18m (\u00a315m). Rupert Murdoch's global publishing business said Storyful would remain a stand-alone operation that would complement its existing video offerings, including WSJ Live. Founder and chief executive Mark Little and David Clinch, executive editor, will stay, with News Corp senior vice president for video Rahul Chopra joining Storyful's management team as chief revenue officer. Little will report to David Brinker, News Corp global head of business and corporate development. Storyful's headquarters will remain in Dublin, with extra business development and ad sales staff hired to work in New York, where News Corp is based. News Corp said Storyful would continue to work with existing customers, which include its own title the Wall Street Journal, the BBC, New York Times, YouTube, ITN and Channel 4 News. Storyful discovers, verifies, acquires and distributes video and user-generated content to its partners. The company said it had generated 750m views for its partners from user-generated videos in 2013. \"Storyful has become the village square for valuable video, using journalistic sensibility, integrity and creativity to find, authenticate and commercialise user-generated content,\" said Robert Thomson, News Corp chief executive. \"Through this acquisition, we can extend the village square across borders, languages and platforms.\" Little said in a blog post that in News Corp he had found a \"big company prepared to think like a startup\". \"Together, we will combine the authority of premier original content with the authenticity of user-generated content,\" he added. \"We will define the opportunities that the digital landscape presents, rather than simply adapt to them. Ours will be a powerful and unique partnership. \"Our technology teams will continue to build tools to power the newsrooms of the future. We will continue to serve the world's leading news organisations (with more resources and focus).\" Storyful investors apart from Little include Irish entrepreneur Ray Nolan, SOS Ventures, the Irish State Enterprise Board and ACT Ventures. News Corp has something of a mixed record with buying technology and digital media startups, most notably its $580m (\u00a3324m) 2005 acquisition of MySpace. The social networking service atrophied under News Corp ownership as rivals including Facebook and Twitter forged ahead, and was sold for about $35m in 2011. However, since Murdoch's newspaper and book publishing arm split from his TV and film assets earlier this year, retaining the News Corp brand name, the newly separated companies have signalled an intent to invest in startups as they seek to get ahead of the game in digital content. In August, the TV and film business, 21st Century Fox, bought a 5% stake in New York-based digital video and content company Vice Media for $70m. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
