  "content": "Noel Edmonds is threatening legal action against the Daily Mail over two allegedly defamatory articles written about him in the past week. Schillings, the law firm acting for the Deal or No Deal presenter, has informed the Mail that he plans to begin a libel action over the articles, published in the paper on March 22 and 25. The firm has also written to the legal departments of other national newspapers, warning them not to repeat the allegedly defamatory claims made by the Daily Mail. \"Our client's professional reputation is very important to him and he's taking steps to defend it,\" said a Schillings partner, John Kelly. The Daily Mail failed to respond by the time of publication. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
