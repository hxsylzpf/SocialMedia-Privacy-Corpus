  "content": "A tide of teasing tweets are being sent in the direction of the Guardian's Simon Jenkins after his column denouncing, among other things, the BBC's \"current craze\" with science. \"The airwaves are crammed with science quizzes, science chatshows, science magazines and science feedback,\" wrote Jenkins. \"News must have science stories, the Today programme science items, all reverential. No scepticism is admitted to this new orthodoxy \u2013 or rather this revival of CP Snow's 'two cultures' orthodoxy of the late 1950s.\" \"Disgusting! The BBC are broadcasting AN ENTIRE scientific TV programme this week! They should show the Antiques Roadshow instead,\" came the satirical retort from @DickMandrake. \"Computers would work just as well powered by Ballet as Electricity,\" posts @marktibbetts. The #spoofjenks Twitter hashtag was set up by the University College London cell biologist Jennifer Rohn. In a blog post explaining the reaction, Rohn said: \"No area seems exempt from [Jenkins's] scorn: whether scientists are involved in analysing climate change, ash clouds, BSE or swine flu, they are probably up to no good. \"So I've been thinking to myself, can I really let Jenkins get away with painting me and all my colleagues as no-good, money-grubbing evil boffins? In the relaxed Saturday morning Twitter stream, some of us talked about how we might, yet again, try to rebut. Stephen opined that humour might be the best approach, building on the wonderful spoof post of UCL physicist Jon Butterworth. I then proposed making Monday \"Spoof Jenks\" day, with bloggers taking the opportunity to writing an anti-science post in the style of Simon Jenkins. And I'm pleased to report that the idea has taken off.\" This Trendistic graph shows the inexorable rise of \"Spoof Jenks Monday\" on Twitter. Reckon its provocateur is keeping a close eye on the trending list? We're not so sure, but advise interested parties to look out for a spoofs round-up over on the Guardian Science Blog later today."
