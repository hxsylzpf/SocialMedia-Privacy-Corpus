  "content": "The decision by the Crown Prosecution Service that the computer hacker, Gary McKinnon, should not be prosecuted in the UK but should stand trial in the US is a disturbing one which does not reflect well on those involved in making it. McKinnon is accused of having hacked into the US defence department and Nasa in 2001 and 2002. He did so via a computer in a room in north London, using his own email address and making little effort to cover his tracks. He was looking for evidence of UFOs and, as he entered the flimsily protected systems, left messages like \"your security is crap\". The US authorities, still nervous after September 11, reacted angrily and sought his extradition. Back in 2002, the CPS agreed to this. McKinnon, fearing, with some justification, that he would be portrayed as a cyber-terrorist and treated accordingly within the US criminal justice system, resisted. Now all that stands in the way of his removal to the US is a final judicial review in which the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, will be asked to reconsider the extradition in light of McKinnon's recently diagnosed Asperger's syndrome. At the end of last year, McKinnon's lawyer, Karen Todner, wrote to the director of public prosecutions, indicating that McKinnon would plead guilty in the UK to an offence under the Computer Misuse Act. This seemed to offer all sides a fair solution: McKinnon would stand trial and face punishment but be guaranteed a non-political prosecution and any jail sentence would be served in this country. It would appear that this option was seriously considered but, in the end, a decision has been made to accede to the US demands. How ironic that, in the week that Binyam Mohamed returns from his appalling mistreatment at the hands of the US authorities, we should so meekly offer up a British citizen to the lottery that is the US criminal justice system."
