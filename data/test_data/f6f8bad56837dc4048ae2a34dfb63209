  "content": "Richard and Judy's book club might be meeting an untimely end this summer but Jonathan Ross has stepped into the literary breach, launching a book club on Twitter which has sent his first choice, Jon Ronson's The Men Who Stare at Goats, soaring up the bestseller charts. \"I have a great idea! Let's start a book club on twitter! One a week and we all post mini-reviews!\" Ross wrote on Twitter on Friday night, debating which book to start with - \"I think books for twitter club should be fiction. Maybe start with When will there be good news? Or The Suspicions of Mr Whicher?\" In the end, he plumped for journalist Ronson's investigation into the lunatic extremes of \"psychological warfare\" used by US Special Forces (which, like The Suspicions of Mr Whicher, is not actually fiction). Ross's quarter of a million Twitter followers responded enthusiastically, and the book's sales rose 7,000% over the weekend, according to Amazon, where it now sits in the second spot on the online bookseller's \"movers and shakers\" chart. Ronson himself later joined the fray, telling members of #wossybookclub \u2013 there was debate over the name, with Ross also suggesting Twitterbook and twiteracy \u2013 not to despair if they couldn't track down a copy of his book. \"It has sold out everywhere but I'm sure will be back in stock in the next day or two,\" he tweeted, adding that \"every writer feels like a deluded lunatic, sitting alone, imagining they're a writer. So things like #wossybookclub are a great tonic\". Future titles for the television presenter's Twitter book club, which will be tackling a book a week, will include Rutu Modan's graphic novel about a Tel Aviv taxi driver, Exit Wounds, Shalom Auslander's memoir Foreskin's Lament, and Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman. Ross promised to \"bung an out and out laugh fest in next\".",
