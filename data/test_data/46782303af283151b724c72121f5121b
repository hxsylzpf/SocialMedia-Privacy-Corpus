  "content": "It is not always easy to balance freedom of expression with the needs of the justice system. As attorney general I see my role as defender both of press freedom and of the fair administration of justice. And it is as guardian of the public interest, not a government minister, that I act in cases of contempt: protecting the right of a defendant to a fair trial is clearly and compellingly in the public interest. In the UK system, the Contempt of Court Act is part of the apparatus that protects this right, by limiting what can be published about a case while it is live, so that allegations that are not relevant or not tested in court do not form part of a juror's consideration. Other jurisdictions have different ways of endeavouring to protect this right (for example, some \u2013 including many in the US \u2013 practice jury selection). This past weekend, the question of how contempt laws operate in the information age was raised again. Is the Contempt of Court Act 1981 enforceable, or even relevant, in the context of the worldwide rapid communication facilitated by the internet? There is no doubt that the characteristics of the internet, and of social media in particular, pose challenges for enforcement. Comment and information \u2013 or misinformation \u2013 posted from outside the UK jurisdiction can only be addressed with great effort and international co-operation. In the democracy of the internet, what is published by one individual can \"go viral\" within hours, with obvious implications. Comments on the web can soon be published far beyond their original, limited audience. And I use the word published advisedly, as publication is, of course, the phrase used within the Contempt of Court Act \u2013 an online article that breaches the strict liability rule runs the risk of running foul of the law of contempt. Unlike major news organisations, which on the whole act in a responsible and measured manner, the inhabitants of the internet often feel themselves to be unconstrained by the laws of the land. There is a certain belief that so long as something is published in cyberspace there is no need to respect the laws of contempt or libel. This is mistaken. And it does not follow that because law enforcement cannot be perfect, consistent and universal, that there is no point in doing anything at all. I have to consider each case on its merits. Just because in one case I might consider that a tweet, however improper, is unlikely to seriously prejudice or impede the course of justice, it would be wrong to assume that another tweet about another case could not engage the law of contempt and require action on my part. To be clear, the Contempt of Court Act 1981 was not intended to prohibit or restrict free speech \u2013 far from it. The act was introduced as a liberalising measure following a decision, in 1979, of the European court of human rights. It sets limits on the points in time at which publishers will be in danger of committing contempt; it protects a journalist's sources from disclosure; protects the secret discussions of the jury in their retiring room; and provides a defence in respect of the discussion of public affairs. It also provides for strict liability contempt; so-called because individual journalists or editors may commit the contempt without any intention of prejudicing legal proceedings. Of course, the act was constructed when newspapers and broadcasters were the only media available, and a fairly small pool at that, but I believe it is a sound piece of legislation for the modern age. I do not seek confrontation and I have no desire to act as a policeman. The inexorable rise of the internet and the citizen journalist presents us all with challenges for the future. We must work in collaboration to ensure the highest professional standards are maintained at the same time as press freedom and that the right of freedom of expression is not abused by individuals to undermine the fairness of our system of justice.",
