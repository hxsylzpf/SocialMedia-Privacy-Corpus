  "content": "Rappers Lil' Wayne and Wiley today assured the public that they were still very much alive, despite online hoaxes claiming the pair had both met violent ends. In separate reports mocked up to look like a BBC News page, it was first claimed that US rapper Lil' Wayne had been shot and killed yesterday following a gang-related feud in New Orleans. The news was quickly proved untrue, by virtue of Wayne still being alive. Today, UK MC Wiley found himself the recipient of a similar fake news report, saying that he had been \"stabbed to death\" in Hackney, east London. He posted a blog on his MySpace page under the unequivocal headline \"I AM NOT DEAD\". The pranks have all the hallmarks of \"cyber terrorists\" Anonymous, last seen defacing American hip-hop sites with fascist symbols. However, the fake news stories appear to be the result of someone calling himself Gilgamesh, who posted details of a new tool that allows users to mock-up a BBC News article on the Kinetic North website. He, of course, announced details through a mocked-up BBC News report of his own. Posting under the headline \"Gilgamesh BBC tool is 'dogs bollocks'\" the fake article states: \"The site allows you to type in any old nonsense, including words like 'penis'\". Which should be a good indication for anyone reading a BBC News story and wondering about its authenticity."
