  "content": "A judge has held that victims of media reports which cause \"alarm or distress\" can sue for damages for harassment, in an unprecedented judgment that opens a new route of redress against newspapers. The Sun is appealing against the unpublicised ruling, won last week by Esther Thomas, a civilian clerk for the City of London police, who sued the paper under the Protection Against Harassment Act. The act was brought into force in 1997 to protect the victims of stalkers but it does not spell out what behaviour amounts to harassment. It simply says that speech is covered, that there must be a \"course of conduct\" and that the conduct must cause the victim alarm or distress. For celebrities and others, it could open an easier and simpler means of redress than the privacy law emerging under the Human Rights Act, whose limits are still undefined. Geoffrey Bindman, a media solicitor who acts for Keith Vaz, Anna Ford and other high profile clients, said: \"It's very good news. It is highly desirable that there should be a remedy for innocent people who are hounded by the media and whose lives are seriously damaged by media harassment.\" In a private hearing at Lambeth county court in south London, the Sun asked Judge Roger Cox, the senior judge at Lambeth, to strike out the action or enter judgment in its favour. It argued that the case was hopeless and had no legal basis. But the judge ruled last week: \"The act does give to the claimant a right to protection from harassment by all the world, including the press.\" The articles reported that a complaint by Ms Thomas, who is black, against four officers over their behaviour when a Somali asylum seeker sought help had led to the demotion of two sergeants and a \u00a3700 fine for a PC. In the first article, under the headline Beyond a joke: Fury as police sarges are busted after refugee jest, the paper quoted a \"fellow cop\" as saying: \"It was essentially light hearted banter in private and the Somali never heard. This is political correctness gone mad.\" Ms Thomas, who was named in the article and described as a \"black clerk\", received race hate mail at the police station. The following week the paper published a selection of readers' letters attacking her for making the complaint and ruining the sergeants' careers. These were followed by a story seeking readers' contributions to pay the PC's fine. The Sun admitted the pieces were \"strident, aggressive and inflammatory\", but denied they were racist. The judge said that in his opinion the description \"racist\" was justified. The ruling is not limited to racial harassment, but covers anything causing alarm or distress if at least two articles are published. If only one was published it would not satisfy the requirement for a \"course of conduct\". The judgment has alarmed newspaper executives, who are seeking legal advice on its implications. The Sun's counsel, Matthew Nicklin, told the judge that if newspaper reports were covered by the act it would turn the Sun into a \"parish gazette\" and transform media law in Britain. The case is expected to go to the court of appeal later this year. Lawrence Davies, Ms Thomas's solicitor at the London Race Discrimination Unit, said: \"I think it will go all the way to the House of Lords.\" Robert Clinton of Farrer &amp; Co, the Sun's solicitors, said: \"It's effectively a brand new course of action. It would be an extraordinary further string to the bow of potential claimants. Any investigative journalism you do now that amounts to more than one article could make you liable under the act.\"",
