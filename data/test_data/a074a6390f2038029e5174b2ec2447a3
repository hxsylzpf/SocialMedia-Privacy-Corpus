  "content": "The News of the World editor has fallen on his sword over the royal phone hacking scandal, but the reporter guilty of the crime remains employed by News International. Andy Coulson's resignation was announced last Friday, but royal editor Clive Goodman remains suspended from his job at the News of the World and confusion surrounds his future. \"He was suspended on the day of his arrest and he remains suspended and the News of the World will release a statement in due course,\" a News International spokesman said. But a source at the News of the World said the paper was unlikely to make a decision about Goodman, whose sister works at the paper, without input from News International. The News International executive chairman, Les Hinton, could become involved in the decision about what to do with Goodman, who on Friday was jailed for four months for ringing the mobile phone numbers of royal household staff 487 times in order to hack their voicemail messages. Henri Brandman, Goodman's solicitor, referred inquiries to News International. Mr Coulson's replacement, former Sunday Mirror editor Colin Myler, who spent his first day in the office yesterday, will have an input into a decision about Goodman's future. Mr Myler, who left his post as executive editor of the New York Post to replace Coulson, spent a portion of the day meeting staff and heads of department. \"He had a chat with the staff and it's very much business as usual,\" a News of the World source said. \"We have a paper to get out on Sunday but it's been a fairly extraordinary circumstance over the past few days. \"They are genuinely upset about it - Andy was a popular guy. Everyone's devastated about how it's resulted in his resignation.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
