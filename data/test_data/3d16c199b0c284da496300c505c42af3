  "content": "Tony Ageh, one of the architects of the BBC iPlayer, is to leave the corporation after 14 years to join the New York Public Library as chief digital officer. Until the US institution approached him earlier this year, he says had no intention of leaving the BBC. Ageh, most recently controller of the BBC archive, has been one of its most dogged technology advocates, routinely pushing the TV-centric corporation to embrace the internet as the best way to deliver its obligation to inform, educate and entertain. Awarded an OBE in 2015 for services to digital media, Ageh has proven himself adept at navigating notorious BBC bureaucracy. In 2003, a year after joining, he worked with engineer Ben Lavender to push the iPlayer project through no fewer than 84 internal meetings before it was approved. iPlayer has so far been used to watch 10bn BBC programmes online. \"Everything I told the BBC to do they didn't understand or do. There's no shortage of ideas at the BBC but it's about whether that idea survives the BBC's power testing of ideas. I am good at making ideas survive that process, which means they survive the outside world,\" said Ageh. BBC controller for internet services for five years and controller of archive development for seven years, Ageh said that privacy and security of users' data should be a priority for the BBC. \"No one should ever be able to discern your interests or views from the media you consume,\" he added. \"I believe in universal and equal access for all of British culture. It should not be the case that anyone gets better service because of their wealth, sex or religion. We should bring the best of our culture to as many people as possible.\" On 11 April, Ageh joins the New York Public Library as chief digital officer, a role that will involve developing a digital strategy for the city institution, its network of more than 80 district outposts and interactive programmes online for its collection. Ageh says NYPL's ambitious plans for education could have more impact than the BBC. \"I feel I could have more impact on those kids in Walthamstow from NY than I could from W12. They are already ahead of the BBC in their thinking \u2013 the same Reithian, public service values.\" Both organisations, said Ageh, have an obligation to make sure that its assets are both protected and preserved accessible for future generations, as well as encouraging citizens to explore and reimagine material for their own creative ideas. \"The library is the one memory institution that lets you take the artists' work home,\" he said. \"That means you can come back with your own ideas.\" Roly Keating, former director of BBC Archive and now chief executive of the British Library, said: \"Tony has always had a rare and special ability to see the moral and social potential of media and the internet, and to turn his insights into inspiring visions.\" Ageh said a priority will be search, discovery and distribution of the library's collection of 53m items, adding that some of the most exciting projects would come about by experimenting with releasing data sets and APIs for the library's collections. \"I would never have left the BBC but the opportunity is greater than I could have imagined,\" he said. \"I was good for the BBC because I was so unlike them, and didn't want to be like them. But I told them that they have to shape this challenge, the internet, before it shapes you. People do well that run towards the problem, not away from it. \"I ain't afraid of no ghosts.\""
