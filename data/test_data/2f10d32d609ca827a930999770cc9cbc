  "content": "Sheryl Sandberg gave the commencement speech at UC Berkeley last weekend, during the course of which she said many stirring things about the future awaiting the class of 2016. She also built on her much-commented upon Mothers' Day Facebook post, in which she spoke for the first time about life in the wake of her husband's death last year. These two elements, the motivational speaking and the personal reflections on grief, combined to do something that has so far eluded Sandberg and the corporate world generally: the acknowledgement that people are human. Since entering public life three years ago, one of the most likeable aspects of Sandberg has been that she is not, in some ways, a terribly good public speaker. While her words are always resolutely on message, full of phrases that make people outside the corporate world want to rip their own eyes out (not least, at this point, \"lean in\"), her delivery is uncertain and she is often visibly nervous. I say this with caution; as Sandberg has herself pointed out, the need to be likable is a criterion only applied to women and is measured in terms of softness, vulnerability, unwillingness to offend. To avoid this, women in high executive office often assume a corporate persona that overcompensates by being either brittle and defensive, or Thatcher-esque in terms of belligerence. Either way doesn't leave room for much in the way of doubt or shade. Early editions of Lean In suffered from this stylistic tic, an infuriating certainty, a spit-spot efficiency that failed to take into account the generations of women who had been trying to figure out the problem of workplace discrimination before Sandberg came along and saved us with her study of the data. Since then, Sandberg has been on what she herself would almost certainly describe as a steep learning curve. For later editions of the book, she learned to use the phrase \"women of color\" and to acknowledge the existence of women who haven't been to Harvard Business School. She tried very hard to address earlier criticisms. In these, her latest pronouncements, her corporate identity is less absolute and she seems finally persuaded of the fact you can't live by data alone. This seems important given the constituency of Sandberg's audience. She is not speaking to people who relax after a hard day's work by rereading a couple of chapters of Helene Cixous. She is not interested in whether logocentrism subjects thought to a two-tier system or what that means in terms of ingrained bias against minorities and women. She is a corporate beast, talking to other corporate beasts, and if she is able to expand the range of their vocabulary to include some sampling of lived experience, that can surely only be a good thing. In the Facebook post on Mothers' Day, Sandberg talked about what she had learned from the sudden, shocking loss of her husband. Unlike the 8 million other single mothers in the US, half of whom live with their children below the poverty line, Sandberg is in a position of extraordinary privilege. But this doesn't negate her experience, and there was something gratifying to hear her acknowledge the emotional if not the financial difficulties of single motherhood, not least because, in the first edition of her book, she blithely advised women that the most important career decision they could make was \"choosing the right partner\" to marry and have kids with. (I am a single mother of two kids, neither of whom had been born when that book came out, but I recall reading her advice and thinking, glumly, oh, terrific; so everything in a woman's life still boils down to a question of who she marries). In the commencement speech, Sandberg reiterated the difficulty of her last 12 months, and, because she is Sheryl Sandberg, extrapolated a motivational message from it: a hope that the students might \"learn in life the lessons that I only learned in death\". She said, \"you will be defined not just by what you achieve, but how you survive.\" And, \"You are not born with a fixed amount of resilience. It's a muscle. You can build it up and then draw on it when you need it. And in that process, you figure out who you really are. And you just might become the very best version of yourself.\" These are slogans which lend themselves to the motivational posters that adorn the walls of Facebook campus. (In fact, as I recall, \"Be Your Best Self\" is one of them). You can quibble with the language, and recoil at the tone. But for once, the message is off-message enough to actually broaden minds in Silicon Valley.",
