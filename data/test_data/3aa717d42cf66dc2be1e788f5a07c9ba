  "content": "A note of weariness enters Andrew Stott's voice. \"There has been some misunderstanding. It wasn't 20 pages on how to Twitter, there was about a page on how to Twitter.\" According to the man charged with boosting Whitehall's use of digital media, the vast bulk of the government's Twitter Template, published last week, consists of suggestions about how Whitehall departments might use the medium while abiding by civil service rules. Nonetheless, in the current political climate, critics found the image of a government grappling in an amateur fashion with modish new media an irresistible source of mirth. \"The civil service and the government should focus on the job of running the country \u2013 not on wasting time creating more spam!\" was one of the more temperate comments posted on a BBC report. The Conservative leader, David Cameron, weighed in with his laddish \"too many twits\" broadcast comment. Such reaction was foreseen. One of the risks of using Twitter identified in the guidelines is \"Criticism of jumping on the bandwagon/waste of public money/lack of return on investment/pointless content.\" But for Stott, the government's new director of digital engagement, Twitter is a legitimate, if minor, conduit for communication between citizens and officialdom. At least 26 Twitter feeds originate from central government institutions and 86 from local authorities. No 10 Downing Street's Twitter feed boasted 1,102,285 followers this week. In his first interview in the post, created by Tom Watson, the first (and only) minister for digital engagement last spring, Stott this week described his role as falling into two main parts. The first involves helping government bodies use digital techniques, including social media, to engage with the public. The second is to open up access to official information. In this role, he is working with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the prime minister's \"expert adviser on public information delivery\". Obstacle course Both roles follow an agenda set two years ago in the Power of Information review, which encourages the government to embrace \"Web 2.0\" ways of working, and by the subsequent work of the Power of Information taskforce, which Stott's team has replaced. He will be based at the Cabinet Office, along with an advisory panel, to be appointed in the autumn. In his task of opening up public information, Stott faces an obstacle identified by Guardian Technology's Free our Data campaign \u2013 the anomalous position of government-owned trading funds such as Ordnance Survey. Earlier this year, the Power of Information taskforce urged that freeing up geospatial data should be a priority \u2013 a recommendation accepted \"in principle\" by the government. Stott says he is \"working with OS on developing a new business model\" as an alternative to the current \"user pays\" setup. But trading funds, he says, are only a small part of the free data question. \"A lot of my job is about much larger data sets, which are not released under any terms at the moment.\" Some is data never released because no one has asked for it; some is data sets restricted except for approved users such as researchers. There are also data sets that have been published, but in a format that makes them impractical to reuse. One strand of this work will be a version of the US's data.gov repository of public data sets. But Stott indicated that this will not be a complete one-stop shop \u2013 some organisations will continue to hold their own repositories \u2013 and that work is still at an early stage. \"We haven't quite decided what to call it yet.\" The tweet goes on On the government's new media agenda, Stott is unapologetic about Whitehall (and politicians) using all the tools in the Web 2.0 box to reach people who are not getting information through traditional media. He says that there is a legitimate role for Twitter in drawing attention to announcements, and for answering frequently asked questions. He stresses that last week's Twitter template, published on Stott's blog as a guest post by Neil Williams of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, is about the institutional use of Twitter, as distinct from tweets by individual civil servants. These would be covered by the previous short guidance about online participation, with its reminder that \"you should not disclose information, make commitments or engage in activities on behalf of Government unless you are authorised to do so\". Most of the rules, Stott says, are common-sense applications of the existing code. \"For example, any dialogue with individual citizens shouldn't be blogged at all, just as it would not be appropriate to reveal it in any other channel.\" He commends the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development as government bodies that have shown what can be done within these strictures.\" Two fundamental obstacles lie ahead for Stott's work. One is that the Cabinet Office, despite its proximity to Downing Street, cannot give orders to other government departments, much less the wider public sector. Local authorities, for example, own the copyright in their data and can set their own terms for publication and reuse, even when these conflict with wider government policy. The issue came to a head this week when several councils said they would defy a ruling by the Information Commissioner's Office to make data for property searches available free. At the moment, Stott does not even have a direct ministerial sponsor \u2013 the role of digital engagement minister is still formally vacant, following Watson's resignation in June. No doubt the post will be filled when the political season resumes in the autumn. But this brings the digital engagement programme perilously close to obstacle number two \u2013 a general election. If the opinion polls are correct, there is a strong chance that in less than a year a new government might bring in a new digital engagement policy \u2013 or, perhaps more likely, make a point of abolishing a prime example of \"Labour spin\". Stott, who has spent 30 years in Whitehall under a wide range of political masters, refuses point-blank to speculate. However, he says the challenges posed by new web media are not parochial ones. \"This is an issue faced by governments around the world, enterprises around the world.\" Apart from the US, the Australian federal government in June announced the creation of a Web 2.0 taskforce (with funding from Microsoft). The Conservatives, who have already pledged to create a new \"right to data\", are watching such developments with interest. Tweet facts 26 \u2013 The number of Twitter feeds from the UK's central government bodies 86 \u2013 The number of Twitter feeds from local authorities in the UK 1,108,065 \u2013 The number of people following the Downing Street Twitter feed."
