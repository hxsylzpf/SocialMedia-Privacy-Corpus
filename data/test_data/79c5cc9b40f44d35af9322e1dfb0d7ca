  "content": "From a drunk Swedish elk to the death of Amy Winehouse, Facebook has revealed the most popular UK news stories of 2011. The Facebook list shows that users of the social network are as diverse as on Twitter \u2013 and that the weird and wonderful often outdoes news on natural disasters. The BBC's smart interactive to mark the 7 billionth person on earth was the most shared news story on Facebook this year, according to the social network. The Sun's unique take on a woman whose scorned ex-boyfriend tattooed a poo on her back, headlined \"Tatt-poo for cheating\", was the second most popular story. Winehouse's sudden death in July provided the fourth and eighth most-shared stories on Facebook, outdoing the death of Osama bin-Laden, which came in at 14th. The BBC was by far the most-shared UK news outlet this year, with 11 stories in the top 20. The Guardian was the most-shared UK newspaper, with four of the most popular stories, ahead of the Daily Mail and the Sun. 1. BBC: The world at seven billion 2. The Sun: Tatt-poo for cheating 3. The Guardian: The shocking truth about the crackdown on Occupy 4. BBC: Amy Winehouse: Tributes paid to dead singer 5. BBC: Austrian driver allowed 'pastafarian' headgear photo 6. The Guardian: Charlie Sheen v Muammar Gaddafi: whose line is it anyway? 7. The Guardian: The meaning of 9/11's most controversial photo 8. Daily Mail: Amy Winehouse, 27, found dead at her London flat after suspected 'drug overdose' 9. BBC: Drunk Swedish elk found in apple tree near Gothenburg 10. BBC: 'Brinicle' ice finger of death filmed in Antarctic 11. Daily Mail: Robber who broke into hair salon is beaten by its black-belt owner and kept as a sex slave for three days... fed only Viagra 12. The Sun: Frankie Cocozza kicked off X Factor 13. BBC: Japan earthquake: Footage of moment tsunami hit 14. BBC: Osama Bin Laden, al-Qaeda leader, dead - Barack Obama 15. The Guardian: Osama bin Laden corpse photo is fake 16. BBC: Japan earthquake: Tsunami hits north-east 17. BBC: Speed-of-light results under scrutiny at Cern 18. BBC: Arrest over video of 'racist rant' on Croydon to Wimbledon tram 19. Daily Mail: Loyal to the end: Heart-breaking photo shows Navy SEAL's devoted dog guarding his coffin 20. BBC: LIVE: Osama Bin Laden dead",
