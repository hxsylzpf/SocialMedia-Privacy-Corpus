  "content": "Keeping a close, loving hold on your right to be initially (or permanently) indifferent is the best way to survive the furious opinionstorm that is social media. That's why I highly recommend that we take a \"Lebowski approach\" to everything vehement online. The Big Lebowski has much to teach us, but in this case I want to focus on one deathless line: \"That's just, like, your opinion, man.\" In the movie, it's a comeback to the claim \"we're gonna fuck you up [at bowling],\" but it can also serve to keep contrarianism, trolling, and hot takes at arm's length until they can be evaluated. (Because I am fundamentally less relaxed than the Dude, I also rely frequently on the more aggro \"I don't care what you think\"; this makes men very mad, which is delightful. But let's stick to the cooler one for now.) We could have used this approach last week, for instance, when writer Sarah Miller got the internet all het up by declaring, on Jezebel, that she hated maxi dresses. (Full disclosure: Sarah is a friend). Comments on the site included: \"Uhhh, excuse the fuck out of me, but I look goddamn fantastic in a maxi dress\", \"How about we just let women wear whatever the fuck they feel comfortable in\", \"who the fuck cares\" and \"fuck you.\" Twitter was similar; my stream, for a day or so, was all impassioned maxi dress defenses and apologias. Suffice it to say, the post struck a nerve. Around the same time, the internet discovered a month-old post on a college site celebrating the \"dad bod\": slightly out-of-shape male physique. \"Girls love the dad bod\", it said. The comments on this one were teeth-gnashing, too. Once the post went viral, though, the response pieces started: dad bods are hotter than six-packs! They're worse than Ebola! The whole phenomenon is \"a sexist atrocity\"! The internet will always reward extreme views with extreme attention. If you can manage to average out all the spiky opinions, if you can mentally balance \"dadbod is gross\" and \"dadbod is great,\" you can't help but come up with \"oh well, takes all kinds\" \u2013 a much less marketable position, but a much more comfortable one. And the first step is to realize that so many of these massive pronouncements, so many of these indictments and screeds, are just, like, someone's opinion. Obviously, right and wrong exist. I am trusting you guys not to be dumb. Some people are vehemently in favor of cops shooting unarmed black men (and women), but this does not average out the people who are vehemently against it; the people who are vehemently against it are correct. One must consider the source; some people love the new Mad Max and some people hate it, but the ones who hate it are virulent misogynists so I'm still gonna go. (I'll go with the awareness that it still probably isn't The Best Thing Ever \u2013 just not for those particular reasons.) Use your brain \u2013 but don't let yourself be manipulated into wasting energy shoving back against something that's just meant to get your goat. You can always get another rug."
