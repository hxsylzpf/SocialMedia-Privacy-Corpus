Some rights reserved. Andersson has topped the music service's creative and art direction, interaction and graphic design, brand identity and user interaction since it started in 2006. \"Leaving Spotify is indeed very emotional - my little baby - but at some point you have to let the bird out of it's cage,\" he writes at his blog. \"I believe Facebook is a very interesting entity which is changing the way we look at the internet in large - I'm thrilled and very happy to become a part of that. \"For me, working with basic human needs (music, social interaction, etc) in an aspect where peoples lives are being improved, has always been the focus of my professional life, thus both Spotify and now Facebook.\""
