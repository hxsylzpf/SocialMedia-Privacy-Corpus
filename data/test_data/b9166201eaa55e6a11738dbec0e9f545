  "content": "Snapchat chief executive Evan Spiegel has met Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal to discuss \"potential business co-operation\", it was announced on Sunday. The meeting comes as Snapchat embarks on a new funding round aimed at raising up to $500m (\u00a3330m), prompting speculation that Alwaleed may be about to invest in the messaging app. The latest funding round could value it at up to $19bn. \"On the agenda of discussions was future potential business co-operation between Kingdom Holding and Snapchat in the technology field,\" Alwaleed's Kingdom Holding investment vehicle said in a statement. News of the meeting comes after Alwaleed sold most of his shares in Rupert Murdoch's News Corp for \u00a3125m. Kingdom also owns 6.6% of Murdoch's entertainment company, 21st Century Fox. Alwaleed has previously invested in technology brands, including Twitter. Last month, he launched the TV news channel Al-Arab in Bahrain, but it was closed by the government after only a day on air, officially due to it \"not having received the necessary permits\". A Bahraini statement accused the channel of failing \"to match the standards of regional and international practice agreements, to take account of efforts aimed at stemming the tide of extremism and terrorism throughout the region and the wider world\"."
