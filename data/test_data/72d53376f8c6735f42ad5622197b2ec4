  "content": "The Gallery of Glorious Euphemisms has a new exhibit that I hope that future generations will admire as much as they admired Economical with the Truth. It comes from Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, the Swedish businessman who persuaded eBay to overpay grotesquely for his Skype business on the basis of wildly optimistic forecasts about future profits. Last week eBay sacked him as chairman of the company and announced that it was writing off nearly $1.5bn on the deal, having paid $2.5bn for the company last year. Asked to explain this by the New York Times, Mr Zennstr\u00f6m said the figures he'd used to sell the company had been \"a bit front-loaded\". So if I persuade you to buy a lottery ticket for a million pounds, on the basis that this is what it will be worth after it wins next week, and you come back in 10 days' time to complain that it lost, I will know just how to explain the situation. My valuation had been \"a bit front-loaded\". That is all. Then I retire, still giggling, to the bank. There is a long, dishonourable history of internet businesses whose values turned out to have been a bit front-loaded. The last tech bubble was full of them. There was Boo.com, also run by Swedes; Redbus in this country, worth \u00a3750m at the height of the bubble, and nothing two years later. But if eBay overpaid for Skype, is Facebook, also, being grotesquely overvalued at $10bn, rather than a mere $2.5bn? The case for the prosecution is one page too graphic to print here. But if you follow the link to this mock Facebook page at you will see the distillation of everything that is vile and inconvenient about the Facebook interface. Everything that Facebook does is better and more imaginatively done elsewhere. The status updates are available from Twitter; the blog feeds are badly done; the pictures are infinitely better at Flickr, and the literary showing-off at Librarything or Bookmooch; the webmail interface is the worst that I have every used. Then there are fatuous games and still more fatuous quizzes. Perfectly sensible people in real life, or even in other corners of the internet, send messages to announce that they have thrown a sheep at you, or that their vampire has bitten some biology professor's vampire and been promoted from Widdecombe to Howard. Seriously. The only benefits that I get are being able to list influential people as among my \"friends\" - hi, Alan! - and to play scrabble when I should be working, though even that is possible outside Facebook. But then, whoever supposed it was the users who were going to benefit from Facebook? It's not the users to whom it is worth any money, but the advertisers, and this is becoming clearer every day. The Register recently carried a story about the ultimate Facebook app: it lets you fling lumps of virtual shit at all your friends. I don't myself see that is a vast advance on the experience of the internet as it was before Facebook, but there is something new and genuinely frightening about the program: in order to lob the virtual turds, you have to answer 25 questions about yourself of interest to potential advertisers. And 75,000 people a day do this. At 75,000 idiots a day, the company might just conceivably be worth its $10bn without too much front-loading. The information that Facebook might gain about its users is far more intimate than even Google has. Every craze for throwing anything that runs across the network sends home a map of users and how they are connected. You can know not only who is on there, but who among their \"friends\" they want to impress and who they just like talking to. Facebook knows who its users' sleep with, which parties they attend, and which demonstrations, and what political views they hold. No one prepared to pay for all that information could possibly mean well - and yet we queue to hand it over. No one is forced to use Facebook. Perhaps the craze will end or pass away like almost every other craze across the internet. And if that happens and the company turns out to have been a bit front-loaded a lot of people will look fools. But not half as many as if it turns out to be fairly valued at $10bn, on the backs of millions of sheep-flinging idiots."
