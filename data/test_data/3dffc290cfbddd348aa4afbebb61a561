  "content": "Over at the Guardian Music Tumblr we're working hard (aka surfing the web) to bring you all the best in new tracks, album streams, videos, gifs and music news. Here is a round up of the best things we've stumbled upon this week. Leave tips and comments in the thread below, and tell us what you've enjoyed this week. Her. She is Mariah\u2026 The Elusive Chanteuse Mariah announced her new, amazingly titled album (Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse) with a small YouTube clip. To celebrate, here is a gif of Mariah doing what Mariah does best. Metallica, Kasabian and Arcade Fire announced as Glastonbury headliners Worthy Farm announced the full Glasto line-up, including Metallica as headliners. Below is the full roster of artists performing. Here's what our writer Dom Lawson had to say about Metallica's appearance. And the best new video of the week is \u2013 CHANDELIER BY SIA Sia's video for the lead single from forthcoming album, 1000 Forms of Fear, is a heartbreaking narrative story about Sia's childhood, which encompassed neglect and her parents' alcoholism. The choreography is stunning, with Maddie Ziegler from Dance Moms throwing herself about like a semi-lucid Mowgli. Runner-up for best new video of the week \u2013 RESERVOIR BY METRONOMY Most disappointing new video (but great song) \u2013 WEST COAST BY LANA DEL REY This picture of Anastacia with Huskies We asked you to send us your pictures taken with music stars, after the brilliantly awkward Avril Lavigne ones. This one made our week. Michael Hann also wrote a piece about stars charging fans to pose with them. New old songs from Michael Jackson Two new songs emerged from Michael Jackson, produced by Timbaland and with a Justin Timberlake vibe to them. The first was Loving You and the second, Blue Gangsta. Now, a whole album, Xscape has dropped. Read Tim Jonze's review. Chuck Berry \u2013 still amazing Chuck Berry is to be honoured with the Polar Music Prize in August of this year. The prize is sort of like the Nobel prize for music. The rock'n'roll legend will received \u00a3100,000 in prize money. The great guitarist is currently on tour in Russia. Treat yourself to a video of the great man in concert here. Bye!"
