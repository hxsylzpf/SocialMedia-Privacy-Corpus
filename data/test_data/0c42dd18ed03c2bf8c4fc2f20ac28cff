  "content": "\"If there's consent is it paedophilia?\"; \"She's gonna be a porn star at 12\"; \"Doing those dishes: what a bitch\". These are just a few of the graphic and abusive tweets directed at 12-year-old Valentina Schulz, a contestant on the Brazilian television programme Junior MasterChef in Brazil. But, while the flood of misogynistic comments was horrifying, the response of Brazilian women and girls was moving and powerful. Using the hashtag #primeiroass\u00e9dio (first harassment, in English), they stood alongside Schulz and used the moment as an opportunity to raise awareness about sexism, harassment and sexual violence, creating a wave of more than 82,000 stories across social media platforms. As women shared tales of being followed, harassed, assaulted and seeing men expose their genitals deliberately in front of them, an analysis of over 3,000 of the tweets found that the average age at which girls started to have such experiences was just nine years old. The hashtag was particularly pertinent in a country where a recent study found that of the 527,000 people raped each year 89% are female, and 70% are children or adolescents. Ipea, the Brazilian institute of applied economics which carried out the study, estimates that only 10% of rape cases are reported. As well as starting a discussion about an endemic problem, the hashtag also had a wider effect, inspiring another campaign that saw women taking over the blogs and columns of influential male writers for a week, highlighting media inequality alongside other women's issues. This is just one of several recent examples where women around the world have stood together and declared \"enough is enough\". In Mexico, women started a nationwide outcry against sexual harassment in the workplace after a male TV presenter attempted to lift his female colleague's skirt and touch her breasts on music programme A Toda Maquina. After the female presenter, Tania Reza, stormed off the set, her male co-host turned to the camera and said: \"Excuse me, but my colleague is a bit hormonal.\" After peoples' initial shock wore off, it was the women who raised their voices in protest who ensured issues of discrimination and harassment in the workplace remained a talking point for days afterwards. Mexican women have also shared some of their stories of workplace harassment with the Everyday Sexism Project. One woman reports being told by her employers about \"the power of the miniskirt\". Another was asked, in an important business meeting, \"Why do you work so hard intellectually, if you are a good looking woman?\" A university student aiming for a high-flying career in medicine was told by her professor: \"Calledita, te ves mas bonita.\" (\"You look prettier when you shut up.\") Meanwhile, a new campaign #HerVoice has seen nine Indian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) come together to demand government action and raise public awareness of sexual violence against women. Speaking about her support for the campaign, activist Priti Patkar told the Independent: \"Nobody wants to hear her and nobody wants to be confronted with the facts. It is an uncomfortable truth.\" The campaign is calling on the government to enforce existing rape laws, and campaigners also want to see better rehabilitative aftercare for victims. In the UK where, on average, 85,000 women are raped or subjected to sexual assault by penetration every year, around 404,000 are subjected to sexual offences, and one in four women experiences domestic abuse, cuts, reductions and closures are having a demonstrable impact on frontline support services. The closure of charity Eaves, which has supported victims of violence since 1977, and the threatened closure of Rotherham's only support group for women from ethnic minorities who have experienced violence, Apna Haq, are just two recent examples . But here, too, women are fighting back, with a rally in support of Apna Haq planned in London this Saturday and a march to protest cuts to domestic violence services organised by Sisters Uncut later in the month. The sheer scale of violence against women internationally remains vast \u2013 the UN estimates that worldwide one in three women will be raped, beaten or abused by an intimate partner in her lifetime. So it is powerful and heartening to see people responding to devastating events with clever, moving and determined protests and campaigns. Women and girls are using their voices and stories to raise awareness and protest. The battle is far from over, but the inspiring campaigns of women around the world make me feel empowered to keep on fighting."
