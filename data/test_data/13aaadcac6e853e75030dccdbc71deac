  "content": "Telegraph.co.uk lost more than 84,000 unique users last month as a result of a denial of service web attack, the latest figures from Audit Bureau of Circulations Electronic reveal. The website recorded 7,275,288 unique users during May 2007, a fall of around 1% from April. Page views rose slightly to 69,848,878. The attack on May 21 made the site inaccessible to most traffic for several days. The Telegraph resolved the problem by assigning a new numeric address for the site, but internet service providers and search engines took several days to update the change. Telegraph.co.uk's ABCe statement acknowledged the attack as a \"significant downward shift\" in its traffic numbers. The site lost two-thirds of its typical Monday traffic as a result of the attack, dropping from around 3 million page impressions on Monday May 14 to 1m on Monday May 21. Guardian Unlimited, which launched a redesigned homepage on 10 May, saw unique user numbers grow 5.9% month-on-month to a record 16,062,221 - a 20% growth since May 2006. Page views increased 10% from April to 159,665,856. Tom Turcan, the head of digital media development and general manager at Guardian Unlimited, said it was too early to make any direct connection between the relaunched homepage and month-on-month growth. \"It is great to see underlying growth but it is early days for the redesign,\" he said, adding that the majority of the redesigned GU site had not yet launched. \"What it is good is that there have been no blips. There are often huge readjustments after a redesign but this is a phased, careful and considered programme.\" Guardian Unlimited's busiest section last month was general news with 8.4 million unique users, followed by football with 7.2m unique users. This month GU revealed its ABCe-audited figure for British users. Mr Turcan said that providing a geographical split on user information was important for advertisers that want to target their campaigns, and said the company would publish these figures three to four times each year. The audit recorded 6,021,061 unique users in Britain - equivalent to 37% of GU's audience. Sun Online saw strong growth in users during May, topping the 9 million mark for the first time. Unique users increased 9.3% month on month to 9,002,325. The year-on-year increase was 34% from April 2006 to April 2007. The Sun Online editor, Pete Picton, said the site launched a Big Brother microsite in May along with a desktop headline reader and an application for Facebook that displays Big Brother headlines in a user's profile. TimesOnline also recorded a slight fall in unique user numbers from 8,905,701 in April to 8,730,026 in May, although page views rose by 8.5% to 63,825,586. Since June 2006, the site's user numbers has risen nearly 13% from 7,738,638. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
