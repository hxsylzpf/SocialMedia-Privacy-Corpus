  "content": "Instagram may be all the rage, but it was Hipstamatic that first hit upon the idea of adding interesting, amusing or simply aesthetically pleasing filters to photos taken on mobile phones. With the popularity of Vine's six second videos, the developers are now seeking to take that idea into the motion picture sphere with Cinamatic (iOS, Hipstamatic, \u00a31.49). Losing the stylish interface that made their other app stand out is a shame, with the standard iOS 7 design now in place, but it functions competently, and the recording controls will be familiar to Vine users. The glitzy effects are fun to play with \u2013 Darwin's dirty old-school projector filter a particular favourite - and the results sure to enliven feeds with the app seamlessly connecting to Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Extra filters can be purchased in-app, but there isn't the diversity of Instagram's still offerings. Whether this will come, or the medium doesn't lend itself to such variety, remains to be seen \u2013 meanwhile, it's an easily affordable route to spicing up your bitesize home videos."
