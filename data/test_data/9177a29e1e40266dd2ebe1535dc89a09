  "content": "How many times, dear politicians, have we been here before? To coin a phrase, when it comes to political inquiries into privacy and the press, it has been d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, ad infinitum and, yes, ad nauseam. I would therefore urge you, the 11 members of the commons select committee on culture, media and sport, not to overlook history when inquiring into newspaper intrusions into privacy. Memories are short or non-existent, and a new generation of MPs and, too often, journalists moans about the present with little knowledge of the past. They stop the clock and shout confidently: press misbehaviour today is infinitely worse than it was yesterday. Something must be done. Let's tame the hounds with a privacy law and clean up the stables of Fleet Street. The stables have since moved to better conditions in Wapping, Kensington, Canary Wharf and Blackfriars Bridge but the politicians' desire to rake out the straw remains as fervent as ever. Wishing to be helpful, I therefore think it important to provide you all with a factual history. So where should I begin? The period after the second world war seems appropriate because of the pressure applied in the late 1940s which gave rise to the original, if grudging, formation of a system of self-regulation. The greatest concerns at the time were about political bias and editorial interference by proprietors, but controversial privacy invasions were hardly uncommon. Take the celebrated case of Tommy Lea, a Daily Mirror photographer who tricked his way into a so-called high-society wedding in 1945 by the simple ruse of sporting a red carnation and announcing he was from \"the paper of the times\". He was rumbled but dared to snatch a couple of pictures of the happy couple. The bridegroom punched him, smashed his camera and was later fined for the assault. Several people thought the groom shouldn't have been charged, and one wrote a piece in an obscure magazine arguing that the man had acted correctly in defending his bride from \"the insult of having her picture in the gutter press\". Lea and the Mirror foolishly sued for libel and lost. The judgment, by Mr Justice Hilbery, though infected with class prejudice, set out a line of argument which many people - including MPs such as yourselves - have used since. Lea believes, he said, that he \"has some high mission as a press photographer to portray to the vulgar, the idly curious and, on some occasions, the morbidly-minded, the private lives of other people... He does not recognise such a thing as privacy or that people's private lives can be sacred even from the illustrated press.\" In a book about the Lea case, H. Montgomery Hyde took that argument a stage further by contending that the picture and story of the wedding were not of genuine public interest. They were instead a front for purveying \"personal gossip and scandal\". Newspapers were appealing to the prurience of the public. Perhaps the select committee thinks the 1950s was a golden era of good behaviour? Not according to the newspaper historian, Francis Williams, who wrote scathingly in 1957 of the Daily Mirror. It \"embraced every stunt however contemptible in terms of normal human dignity the public could be got to swallow and set no limits on what was permissible in print...\" The Mirror also \"invaded privacy shamelessly\". Now consider the record of Bert Gunn, who was censured eight times by the press council while editor of the Daily Sketch in the 1950s. In one instance, a Sketch reporter was discovered in a car boot trying to smuggle herself into a party at the Duchess of Kent's home. Shall we try the 1960s instead? Labour's firebrand leader Aneurin Bevan was so hated by the Daily Express's owner, Lord Beaverbrook, that six of his paper's reporters followed him everywhere he went. When Bevan was dying in hospital, reporters from the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph - yes, Telegraph - were found in a neighbouring ward. The 1960s also saw the grossest intrusions into privacy during the Vassall spy case and, most notorious of all, the Profumo affair. The private lives of every person involved in Profumo, no matter how flimsy their relationship to the case, were trampled over by papers competing for stories. In months of increasingly hysterical reporting there was blatant wrongdoing by journalists, including harassment, trespass, the unethical use of subterfuge, widespread lying and even blackmail. The press council, inundated by complaints, eventually admonished newspapers for publishing \"intimate details\" and deplored \"the publication of personal stories and feature articles of an unsavoury nature where the public interest does not require it\". At the time, no one had the guts to tell the tragic truth: newspaper misreporting and exaggeration, fuelled by invasions of privacy, created a scapegoat, Stephen Ward, who committed suicide. Did papers clean up their act in the 1970s then? Hardly. In 1973, the News of the World used questionable methods to film a junior minister, Lord Lambton, consorting with a prostitute. The public interest defence to the intrusion was barely justifiable. In 1975, the Times launched an assault on \"scandal-mongering\" gossip columns for their invasions into privacy which had no genuine public interest. A couple of months later, the Daily Mail's Nigel Dempster proved the Times's point by running a story about a woman Labour MP who had left her husband to share a house with another woman. The MP complained to the press council that the Mail's \"leering\" and \"lip-smacking\" article had intruded into her privacy. The council decided her public position meant she could not keep her private life secret, but it censured the Mail for identifying her housemate. On then to the 1980s. I'm sure that most committee members recall that decade when scores of the worst press misdemeanours occurred. Many invasions of privacy were detailed in the report by a special committee chaired by David Calcutt. It's true that Princess Diana and other members of the royal family figured in several complaints and, in the light of what was revealed later about palace leaks to the press, it's difficult to have much sympathy with them. But there were plenty of other victims, such as the TV presenter, Russell Harty. In 1988, as he lay dying in hospital, reporters were found trying to get into his room while photographers tried to picture him through a window. Also in 1988, the Sunday Mirror ran a story about a British man whose wife and two daughters were killed in a fire in Greece. It suggested, incorrectly, that he had dug his wife's grave because of \"greedy Greek undertakers\". By far the most heinous culprit of the era was the Sun which, in 1987 alone, was censured 15 times, amounting to almost 40% of that year's complaints upheld against national papers. But the political pressure had grown so strong it was obvious that the situation could not continue. Enter Calcutt. As you must all be aware, his committee's report led to the most far-reaching change in self-regulation. Editors drew up a code of practice and the press council was replaced by the press complaints commission. It had a sticky start, though it's fair to say that there were fewer intrusions into privacy in the first half of the 1990s than in the previous five years. Most of the lapses involved royalty and if you discount those, there were none of any consequence. Since then, with improvements to the code, intrusions into privacy have become much rarer. All tabloid editors now recognise that they have to work within the code, and blatant breaches are rare. For instance, no reporter would enter a hospital. It certainly doesn't mean that everything is rosy. To bypass code restrictions, some editors have stretched the definition of public interest to breaking point. There are other kinds of intrusion, too, which require careful monitoring, most notably the News of the World's penchant for sting operations, with a string of victims which includes the Earl of Hardwicke, two Newcastle United directors, the Countess of Wessex and the alleged Victoria Beckham kidnap plotters. I also remain very unhappy with the way in which papers routinely use intrusive paparazzi pictures, and the fact that freelance photographers often flout the code. If they are foreign, of course, they are usually unaware of it. You will doubtless learn about the People's disgraceful publication in 2001 of nude shots of the DJ Sara Cox and her husband on their honeymoon. Amanda Holden also suffered from similar intrusion. Your committee will have noted that virtually all my examples down the years involve people who are well known, rather than what we might call ordinary citizens. This isn't an oversight on my part but a statement of reality. In this celebrity age it is the famous - be they pop singers, models, TV stars or politicians - who feature most often in tabloids. It is they who regularly pay the price of fame by suffering from press intrusion. People who aren't in public life are much less likely to have their privacy compromised. I concede that at moments when big stories break, such as the murder of the two girls in Soham, the press pack does descend on a community and reporters competing with each other do have a tendency to transgress. Those are moments when I think the PCC should be pro-active, calling on editors to remind their troops to stay within the code's guidelines. There will never be a perfect press, just as there isn't a perfect person, so there will never be a perfect system of self-regulation. But looking back down the telescope over more than 50 years of newspaper naughtiness I honestly believe the climate has improved. If your committee's eventual report is to have any impact whatsoever it must take the long view. The papers really aren't worse than they were were when you were young."
