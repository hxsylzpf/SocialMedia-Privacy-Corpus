  "content": "Facebook is halfway through its app competition, and is asking users to help choose the five best apps from 25 finalists. Each of those has been whittled down from 600 entries and there's a grand prize of $225,000 to the five apps that win. These are all funded by fbFund, Facebook's fund for tech entrepreneurs. Facebook have made their own votes as part of the first round, according to Cat Lee on the site's official blog, but users are invited to vote for the second round of judging. And you're encouraged to watch a 30-second explanation of each app and to try it out before you vote. Top 25 finalists include the social organiser Socialfly, the university search tool Check My Campus and the very impressively designed Mousehunter game. Which ideas will sink, and which will swim?"
