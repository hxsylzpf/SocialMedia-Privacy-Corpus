  "content": "The first mobile-phone call was made 40 years ago this week, by a Motorola engineer roaming the streets of New York. Phones have made amazing advances since then: I for one would be lost without Google Maps, literally and all the time. Having something called a \"smartphone\" makes me feel \u2026 well, smart. (Non-smartphones are known in the industry as \"feature phones\".) And now the latest exciting evolution of the phone has just been announced: Facebook Home. Premiered on a new phone, the HTC First, it's a forthcoming Android app that replaces your \"home screen\" with direct Facebook access. Wake up your phone and your Facebook news feed is right there. OMG, \"Like\"! Right? Facebook promises that this will result in a \"great, living, social phone\", which gives me alarming mental images of something alive wriggling around in my pocket, connected directly to Mark Zuckerberg's brain. The instantly available news feed is apparently \"for those in-between moments like waiting in line at the grocery store or between classes when you want to see what's going on in your world\", which oddly implies that \"your world\" is not what is actually going on around you \u2013 which you could, after all, see by simply staring at it rather than fumbling for your phone. No, \"your world\" is Facebook's world. Welcome to it! Facebook's use of the word \"Home\" for the app does reflect, though, the site's attraction to many of its billion users: that it is the digital world's equivalent of a gated community, or perhaps a padded cell. Facebook is nice because it's comfortingly insulated from the flame wars, gadget reviews, and paedophile rings that make up 99% of the rest of the internet. And smartphone users already spend a third of their time on Facebook, so why not make it even easier? If Facebook is a home, it's furnished by Ikea, in calming blue and white: minimalist, reassuringly boring. But it also has no curtains. Modern technology increasingly encourages a peculiar kind of information exhibitionism, defaulting to making you \"share\" your every digital move, not only with the drone-bots of the corporate cloud but with everyone you know. Some users of the new Blackberry Z10 have been mildly discombobulated on learning that the phone's video player was alerting their friends that they had been browsing sites such as pornhub.com, which is (or so I understand) very much Not Safe For Work. The publicity material for the very first mobile phone emphasised the urban freedom offered by the device. \"It will be possible,\" enthused a Motorola spokesman in 1973, \"to make telephone calls while riding in a taxi, walking down the city's streets, sitting in a restaurant or anywhere else a radio signal can reach.\" After four decades, people are still making calls in taxis and restaurants (possibly more loudly than ever before), but the difference is that your phone now knows where you are better than you do, and it's phoning home about it. A recent MIT study determined that even \"anonymised\" location-tracking data from mobile phones can uniquely identify 95% of individuals; a Cambridge study found that simply \"Liking\" things on Facebook can reveal, to clever analysts, lots of personal things, such as sexual orientation and \"use of addictive substances\", which one might prefer to keep private. In using such services, we sign up to what effectively is a voluntary self-surveillance program. We manufacture and collect our own data and send it for free to the companies who will profit from it through targeted advertising. And so we become unpaid data-entry clerks, happily busy contributors to a giant program of corporate welfare. Facebook Home will encourage us to do even more of this: to use Facebook for all our text messaging, phone-number storage, instant chat (via the scary-sounding Chat Heads feature), and so forth. That way Facebook will come to \"know\" even more about us. The point, of course, is to sell adverts. Mark Zuckerberg announced that advertising might be coming to Facebook Home's news feed in due course, which is probably why Facebook's stock jumped 3% after the unveiling. (Google, which makes the Android phone operating system on which Facebook Home runs, won't be happy: it would rather show you its own mobile ads.) Adopters of Facebook Home might also be tempted into a subtle shift in the rhetorical framing of their Taylorised social lives. The app that currently stores people's phone numbers and addresses on your phone is probably called \"Contacts\". According to the excellent book Work's Intimacy, by Melissa Gregg, the popularisation of the term \"contact\" by industrial communications software worked to blur the boundary between work and social life. In Facebook world, on the other hand, you don't have \"contacts\", only \"friends\". To call everyone you know a \"friend\" is as odd as calling them all \"contacts\", but here the emphasis is reversed: rather than clinically treating everyone as a potential business partner, the hegemony of \"friends\" implies a wheedling sentimentalisation of mere acquaintance. Google's rival social network, the not-very-popular Google+, attempts to solve this problem by letting you define and name different \"circles\" \u2013 eg, Family, Friends, Colleagues, Weirdos from the Internet. On Twitter, meanwhile, you just \"follow\" and have \"followers\" \u2013 if you think about it, a curiously messianic term. (Do let me encourage you to join the swelling cult of @stevenpoole.) However our relationships are described, we might not want to be publicly associated with them for ever. So it is right that data-privacy and data-retention issues involving Facebook, Google and their brethren are being scrutinised in the European courts, and that the European Commission is working up a consumer-data protection plan that would include the right to have your data erased \u2013 or as the EC puts it, with a pensive Mediterranean poetry, the \"right to be forgotten\". (This won't, as hysterical new-media cyberhustlers intermittently claim, destroy the internet as we know it.) In the mean time, you don't need to eschew the joy and utility of smartphones and slip on a tinfoil onesie to resist digital overexposure. I don't want to leave Facebook, because it's a good way of keeping in touch with friends abroad: I'd miss the updates from my former London flatmate who now runs mountain-based ultramarathons around San Franciso, which are very inspirational to read while I'm lying on the sofa covered in crisps. You too can perfectly well continue to use Facebook, and even adopt Facebook Home, as long as you make sure to \"curate\" your data trail with appropriate misdirection. Facebook doesn't know where I live or work, and it thinks my oldest schoolfriend is my grandson. And today, I updated my \"Liked\" pages to include George Osborne. That ought to keep the bots confused for a while. Steven Poole's You Aren't What You Eat is out in paperback from Union Books."
