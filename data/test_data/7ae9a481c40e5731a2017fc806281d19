  "content": "The Daily Mirror today called on the House of Lords to throw out model Naomi Campbell's appeal for a right to privacy after the paper revealed she was receiving treatment for drug addiction. Desmond Browne QC, for the Mirror, asked five law lords to uphold an earlier ruling by the court of appeal that said details of Ms Campbell's attendance at Narcotics Anonymous and a photograph of her leaving a meeting published in the Mirror in February 2001 were not confidential. The internationally renowned model has conceded the Mirror was within its rights to reveal that she was receiving treatment for drug addiction, but claims the paper overstepped the mark and breached the law of confidence by publishing details of her therapy. \"It is submitted that there was nothing left in the peripheral details of the Mirror articles to which the law of confidentiality could attach,\" said Mr Browne. \"In fact, the articles contained no details about the appellant's treatment, and the peripheral details about her attendance were extremely anodyne,\" he added. The only details the Mirror gave, said Mr Browne, was the fact that the organisation she was attending was Narcotics Anonymous, and some largely inaccurate details as to the duration and frequency of her attendance at NA meetings. Neither the text of the Mirror article nor the accompanying photograph revealed the location of her meetings, he added. Mr Browne underlined that there was no law of privacy in this country, describing privacy as \"an insufficiently precise concept\", and emphasised that Ms Campbell's claim was based on the law of confidentiality. Ms Campbell's counsel, Andrew Caldecott QC, yesterday argued that the extra detail about her therapy reported by the Mirror deterred her from attending NA meetings, and suggested the paper had only printed a photograph of her leaving treatment in a bid to appeal to readers. In March 2002 Mr Justice Morland awarded \u00a33,500 in damages to Ms Campbell over the article, which the model said left her feeling \"shocked, angry, betrayed and violated\". His decision was overturned in October 2002 by the court of appeal, which ruled that the detail contained in the Mirror's article was \"a legitimate, if not essential, part of the journalistic package designed to demonstrate that Ms Campbell had been deceiving the public when she said she did not take drugs\". The five law lords - Lords Nicholls, Hoffmann, Hope, Carswell and Lady Hales - are expected to reserve judgment for six to eight weeks. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
