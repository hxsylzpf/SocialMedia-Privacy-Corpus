  "content": "Much has been made in recent months of how the digital revolution has caused the inhabitants of western Europe and North America to inhabit cultural bubbles in which they are prey to \"false news\" stories (The internet gave us fake news. Internet users can help defeat it, 4 February). However, \"false news\" as a phenomenon predates social media, and the internet in general, by about 350 years. The Warwick county quarter sessions order book records that in the autumn of 1668, Sir Robert Holt, baronet and justice of the peace for Warwickshire, was tasked by his fellow members of the bench \"to make inquirey [sic] and find out if he can all such as have reported any false news ... and to proceed against such persons as he shall so find according as the statute in this case doth direct and appoint\". How successful he was is not recorded.
