  "content": "Facebook overtook the BBC's network of websites in September to become the UK's fifth most popular online destination, according to the latest figures from web measurement firm comScore. The social networking site saw its UK traffic rise 80% from September last year to to 18.4 million unique users the month before last. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg spoke in Europe for the first time last month, appearing at the Future of Web Apps conference in London, where he claimed the site's global userbase had risen to 100 million. Traffic to the BBC's websites, including news, sport and its programming sites, fell slightly by 2.7% year on year to 18.2 million unique users, according to comScore's figures. The two sites still trail Yahoo, Microsoft and eBay as the most visited in the UK but Google, whose network includes YouTube, still claimed the top spot with 31.8 million unique users during September. ComScore has identified an inevitable growth in traffic to politics and business sites since September as a result of interest in the US election and the global financial crisis. Among UK web users, traffic to politics sites rose by 27% between August and September, while business sites saw a 22% increase in user numbers. Lloyds TSB saw a 15% growth in traffic month on month in September, and HBOS 13%, reflecting interest in the proposed takeover of the latter. The two banks' websites both recorded around 4.07 million uniques during September according to comScore, which calculates web traffic based on a panel of web users. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
