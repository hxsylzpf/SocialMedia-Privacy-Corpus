  "content": "As some readers may remember, I'm a keen photographer. For many years, I've always carried a camera. In the early days of digital photography, that meant a succession of small point-and-shoot cameras \u2013 Canon Ixus and S models generally \u2013 concealed in a small leather pouch attached to my belt. And then there came a point when I stopped carrying these charming little devices. Why? Because I'd just bought my first iPhone. Since then, I still always carry a camera. Except that it's not called a camera any more: it's a smartphone. Living and working, as I do, in a historic city that is swamped by tourists in the summer, I regularly get the opportunity to do some photo-ethnography. You can tell someone's age by the kind of camera they are using. Elderly folks are still using point-and-shoot compacts. Middle-aged folks are sporting \"prosumer\" digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs) from Canon, Nikon, Fuji and Panasonic. But as far as I can see, everyone under the age of 25 is using a smartphone, possibly with the assistance of a selfie stick. This is partly because the main reason young people take photographs is to post them on social media, and smartphones make that easy to do. But that's not the whole story. Those who are more serious about photography tend to upload their pictures to photo-hosting services such as Flickr. Guess what the most popular camera for Flickr members is? Apple's iPhone \u2013 by a mile. This is no doubt partly a reflection of the old adage that \"the best camera is the one you happen to have with you\". But lots of Flickr users are technically savvy and picky about kit. So the predominance of the iPhone on the service is also confirmation that it can produce very good pictures \u2013 better in many cases than one can get from more expensive \"proper\" cameras. And this is no accident: for it turns out that Apple has 800 engineers and other specialists working on the iPhone camera alone. Yes, you read that correctly: 800. One wonders if the R&amp;D departments of Nikon or Canon have those kinds of resources. My guess is that they don't. Now, the corporate culture in Apple (like that in Google, Facebook and Amazon) is an intensely strategic one. Nothing happens in Cupertino (Apple's HQ) unless it fits into a longer-term vision. The interesting question then is: what is that vision? One answer to that question is hinted at in an intriguing essay by Ben Evans, a Brit who now works at Andreessen Horowitz, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and who is one of the most perceptive observers of the tech industry. Whereas most commentators tend to look at digital technology through rear-view mirrors \u2013 interpreting new things in the light of older things that they understand \u2013 Evans consistently tries to avoid that trap. So in his view, the fact that the iPhone has a better camera is neither here nor there. \"Terms like camera or photo,\" he writes, \"like phone, are inherently limiting \u2013 they specify one particular use for underlying technology that can do many things. Using a smartphone camera just to take and send photos is a little like using Word for memos that you used to create on a typewriter \u2013 you're using a new tool to fit into old forms. Pretty soon you work out that new forms are possible.\" The key thing, Evans thinks, is not the camera but the sensor that underpins it. \"Just as the telephony app is just one app on your smartphone, the camera app is just one app for your image sensor, and not necessarily the most important. There are other ways to talk to people\u2026 and there are other ways to use imaging,\" he writes. There are indeed \u2013 as the millions of kids who use Snapchat have realised. And as Evan Spiegel, one of the company's co-founders, understood from the beginning. In his first blog post in 2012, he wrote: \"Snapchat isn't about capturing the traditional Kodak moment. It's about communicating with the full range of human emotion \u2013 not just what appears to be pretty or perfect\u2026 We're building a photo app that doesn't conform to unrealistic notions of beauty or perfection but rather creates a space to be funny, honest or whatever else you might feel like at the moment you take and share a Snap.\" In other words, Snapchat isn't really about photography, but about communication. Which might also explain why it's currently valued at $20bn.",
