  "content": "Over the weekend, Daily Show fans learned the cold, hard truth: correspondent Jessica Williams would not be stepping up to replace Jon Stewart as host. \"Fact 1: I'm not hosting,\" she tweeted on Sunday. \"Thank you but I am extremely under-qualified for the job!\" \"At this age (25) if something happens politically that I don't agree with, I need to go to my room &amp; not come out for like, 7 days,\" she continued. \"That being said I am not super right for it, but there are quite a few people who are! Can't wait to stick around &amp; see what happens.\" Which is beyond fair, and should have been enough. As fans, we don't know what a job like hosting the Daily Show entails; we don't know what a host has to endure (especially behind the scenes); nor we do we understand the emotional complexity of taking on a role that addresses political tragedies and frustrations in a comedic manner four days a week. If Williams doesn't think she's \"super right\" for the job, then guess what: she's a grownup. She knows best. Case closed. But it wasn't. Instead, the Billfold accused Williams of suffering from Impostor Syndrome, going so far as to mock her modest tone on Twitter before arrogantly telling the correspondent how wrong she was about her own life choices. Williams (understandably) stood up for herself (calmly, let's add), and left off with an important reminder: \"I am not yours.\" Which is true. Williams isn't ours. But the increasing accessibility in celebrity culture has fooled us into thinking that she \u2013 and so many others \u2013 are. As we know, fans are important to a celebrity's success. Fans drive everything from ratings to record sales, and have helped bands like One Direction and series like Sherlock succeed at levels that were unimaginable even a decade ago. Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram give us direct channels into artists' lives, blurring the lines between public personas and private lives, which doesn't usually become a problem \u2013 until said artist makes a choice not in-step with his or her fan following. In the case of Williams, she made a personal call about a beloved franchise that went against popular opinion. Is disappointment warranted? Sure: seeing Williams behind the desk would have been great. But that's where our involvement in her choices end and where we need to check our privilege. Investment in fandom is great, but devotion needs to end at the art, not at an artist's personal choices. This isn't a new phenomenon. Back in 2011, Rihanna had to tell Twitter to relax after she followed Chris Brown, while more recently (and on a different note) Kim Kardashian's followers lost it over the reality star's choice to crop her daughter out of a photo. Meanwhile, Walking Dead showrunner Robert Kirkman has reminded fans that despite their mantra \u2013 \"If Daryl Dies, We Riot\" \u2013 the character still isn't safe (he's just another character, no matter how beloved), while back in 2013 some Doctor Who fans expressed their unhappiness over Peter Capaldi's appointment as the Doctor. And these are just a few of the more memorable clashes. As fans (since we all are of something), it's easy for our love of something to eclipse the fact that TV shows, bands, movies and any other pop cultural institution don't belong to anybody but the creators and stars. And of course, fans aren't the problem, and neither are their fandoms. The problem is when we use this identity to overstep boundaries and infringe on people's freedom of choice. As fans, we are familiar with a person's work, not with a person. If that person becomes problematic, as fans we can walk away. But unless there's an online contest or survey involved, that's where our involvement in decision-making ends."
