  "content": "Facebook has recently changed the way we organise our relationships online, making it easier to decide who sees what by grouping our \"friends\" into lists. For me it couldn't come sooner because, much to my surprise, recent events have made me realise that my life on Facebook and other social networks was just too public. Sometimes my friends have complained that I \"take over\" their Facebook or Google+ homepage because of the volume of content I share, both professionally and personally. But no more. Events in my personal life made me sit back and question, really for the first time, why we post what we do and what it's telling us about the way we think and live our lives. For a while, I've worried that social networks can be a distraction from real life, can reduce our productivity and potentially warp the way that we understand friendship. But I've also seen how good Facebook can be at helping build and maintain real friendships and organise real-world socialising. It's so much easier and more informal to exchange Facebook details with someone you meet at a party than exchanging phone numbers. Slowly but surely, your list of \"friends\" grows. People you went to school with, people from university, old work colleagues, your ex's friends, some bloke you met at a party and so on. I think this has made us change the nature of friendships. Obviously, I know who my close friends are and I speak to them in real life. But should we be sharing our intimate thoughts and images with this wider group of \"friends\"? And then there's the images themselves. It's hard to remember a world before photos on Facebook. It's become routine when we go on holiday, have a party or a new baby is born to upload all the photos of the occasion. Once we upload the photos, we tag everyone in them, not only sharing the event with our friends but with their friends, without thinking. Trying to deconstruct why I do it, I'm not afraid to say that I'm at least a little vain, I wouldn't appear on television if I wasn't. But at first glance that accounts for a tiny proportion of the 750 million on Facebook. So my reasons must be pretty similar to a large number of other Facebook addicts. Maybe it's because actually, it is a little like being on television. Being on social media is a bit like being a celebrity. Spotted (or tagged) at places you have been; photographed at parties in various states of intoxication; your future plans publicised in advance and your innermost thoughts known to people who barely \u2013 or don't \u2013 know you. It's a bit like The Truman Show, except in my case, it's The Benjamin Cohen Show. The \"like\" button shows you when your \"friends\" appreciate something you've said, somewhere you've been or something you've done. The comments give even more detailed feedback: \"you look great\", \"that's so funny\", \"I'm literally LOLing!\" Some of us even measure our worth in terms of the number of responses a post achieves. I've heard \"Amazing number of likes over this\" more than once. It feeds our ego but it also normalises what is still very new behaviour. Behaviour that can upset the friends who you might \"tag\" at a location or \"tag\" in a photo. Actions that you take without realising at first the ripple effect of consequences of your own behaviour. I've done it and I've been upset at the photographs and location tags I've found being broadcast to everyone I know. I came out of a really long-term relationship a few years ago. We'd been in a relationship long before Facebook and so when it came along, by default, I was \"in a relationship\" with him. But when we split up, I simply removed the relationship part of my profile, while his went to \"single\". It's hard to express how hurtful it is to see a load of people you know clicking \"like\" when they see that news. I saw the same recently when a few of my friends split up. It's slightly disturbing and it's something we've not encountered as a society before. What have I done about it? I considered culling my Facebook friends or starting again. But then I thought that would be rude and sometimes it's nice to hear genuine news, such as someone is getting engaged or having a kid. So, inspired by Google+, I've gone through my list of \"friends\" and divided them into different \"circles\". Circles of friends that I'd share everything with, circles that I'd share some things with and circles I'd mainly share pieces of content available elsewhere online. But I've also done something else: I've stopped sharing as much, full stop. I used to post things like \"having a bad day\" on Twitter. I don't any more. I guess I posted these sorts of statuses to feel good when 20 of my 9,000 or so followers would say \"hope you feel better\". I used to share photos of all sorts of things on Facebook, but again, not any more. I shared 4 out of 100 or so photos of a recent holiday. I'm not suggesting that everyone else should do the same, but it's something that resonates with people I talk to about it. Mark Zuckerberg has always said the world would be a better place if it was more open. I'm suggesting that sometimes the world might be a better place if it was more private. \u2022 A longer version of the blog was published at Channel4.com.
