  "content": "This week, Noises Off is shouting \"Macbeth!\", whistling, spitting, turning around twice and sleeping with a script under its pillow. Theatre blogs and podcasts have turned their attention to myths in need of busting. First, have a listen to What's On Stage's podcast of Monday's panel discussion on the Future of the West End, which defies myth number one \u2013 the false dichotomy that sees the West End as inherently good or bad. The discussion accepts the sector on its own terms without pandering to it. As our very own Lyn Gardner says, the West End \"has always been in crisis and it has always been in rude health\". Later, playwright Richard Bean and Society of London Theatre (SOLT) chief executive Julian Bird set about shattering the accepted truth that West End ticket prices are extortionate: Bean points the finger at legal ticket touts selling tickets at inflated prices. Bradley, meanwhile, points out that no teenager ever scoffed at paying \u00a375 for a JLS concert, so if you give people what they want, they're happy to pay. (If you've not got time to listen, Lyn Gardner writes about the discussion from her perspective here on the blog LINK TO COME, while Catherine Love offers a good summary at The Public Reviews.) That's echoed by American blogger Curt Hopkins, who smashes another myth \u2013 the idea that social media is the way forward. In a rant against tweet seats \u2013 the idea of roping off special seating where audience members who want to can tweet or text undisturbed, which he brands an \"operatically stupid idea\" \u2013 he argues that \"if kids don't have a sense of ownership and theatre doesn't produce a sense of wonder for them, they won't come \u2026 And Twitter won't help.\" Over at DC Theatre Scene, meanwhile, there's a great interview with Hungarian critic Andrea Thompa, which gives the lie to the idea that the free market and theatre are necessarily compatible. Hungary's theatrical culture is currently controlled by its politicians, but Thompa suggests, interestingly, that the marketplace \"can transform and control culture\" just as much as politics. At the Writers' Guild website back in Britain, playwright Arnold Wesker questions \u2013 well, attempts to obliterate \u2013 the very idea of a writers' theatre. He believes the term refers not simply to new writing in general, but to \"new writing by new writers\". Wesker is a great playwright, but his argument surely smacks of bitterness: \"On what basis could the Royal Court claim to be a writer's theatre when they kept rejecting the work of one of its most acclaimed writers?\" The clue, I'd suggest, is in that rogue Freudian apostrophe: the Court, and any new-writing venue, exists to support more than one writer. Mind you, if Wesker feels exiled, perhaps he should spare a thought for Mat Smart, a playwright living at McMurdo Station in Antarctica. In a beautiful post for HowlRound, Smart asks whether theatre and art have any value in the harsh conditions there. \"At McMurdo,\" he writes, \"everyone must perform a necessary logistical task to keep the town running and the inhabitants alive. We don't need to see a performance at 8pm. We need to eat \u2026 More than anywhere I've ever lived, it's easy to see why no one is paid to be an artist.\" Even so, happily, art flourishes; it's a myth that humans don't need to be creative. Without art, he says, \"a sizable percentage of the population would lose their minds\"."
