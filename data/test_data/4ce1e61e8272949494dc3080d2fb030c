  "content": "Only one thing mattered to the UK's digital constituency this week: the digital economy bill. The election date announcement meant the #debill, as it is referred to on Twitter, was hurried through parliament before the election. An ambitious bill designed to kickstart the UK's broadband-enabled future and tackle internet piracy, it deserved more scrutiny than two hours' late-night discussion in an empty chamber, but was passed on Wednesday with Tory support. Techies that cared watched MPs give gushy statements about saving the creative industries, but ignoring the clumsy clauses that could theoretically block sites including Google and Wikileaks if anyone claims they are used for copyright infringement. Steps designed to stop filesharing could also end up discouraging shops and public bodies hosting open public wifi. As ever, Twitter is the back channel of choice for irreverent, real-time discussion, and commentators such as Kevin Marks, a former engineer for the BBC, Apple and Google, have been reinterpreting proceedings for the less politically inclined: \"You'll care about the #debill when Youtube, Blogger, Google Docs are blocked for copyright infringement in the UK,\" he scolded @jeddings, and later reported on the Lords debill debate. Marks tweeted: \"Lord Whitty describes how Mozart format-shifted Allegris Misiere and distributed it through his social network\", referring to one of the fiercest critics of the bill, \"At least the Pope realised that this was a good thing\" and retweeted @superglaze's \"Music industry risks appearing 'less entrepreneurial than the 18th century papacy'\". Furious developers have been rapidly hacking together protest sites using political data and organisational tools. debillitated.heroku.com gave the story in numbers: 25,000 tweets, 20,000 letters written, 64% of MPs didn't turn up to vote and 187 \"strolled in at the end without bothering to listen to the debate\". Guardian developer Dr Chris Thorpe built didmympshowupornot.com in a few hours, which works out the answer from a postcode. Thousands of people on whatdebill.org pledged not to recognise #debill once passed. Even Google seemed discreetly in on the act: a search for \"who voted for the debill?\" helpfully suggested \"did you mean 'who voted for the devil?'\". If this is the digital constituency, its representative on earth is Tom Watson, MP for West Bromwich East \u2013 and geek. Watson stuck up for his digital constituents in Wednesday's vote, defying Labour whips for the first time in his nine parliamentary years. \"First time I've ever broken the whip in the chamber,\" he tweeted. \"I feel physically sick.\" Hell hath no fury like a mad techie scorned and, once the bill had passed, attention shifted to listing MPs who had vote no, or not voted at all \u2013 particularly those in marginal seats such as Glenda Jackson and Frank Dobson. Political activist @bristly_pioneer asked George Galloway's office how he'd be voting: \"George Galloway \u2013 although saying he was going to vote against #debill \u2013 didn't even bother to turn up. Angry phone call on the way!\" Biology graduate Robert Shepherd told his MP: \"@annebegg \u2013 Not turning up to the #debill reading has cost you my vote.\" The last straw was when it was revealed that Stephen Timms \u2013- the minister for Digital Britain \u2013 was under the impression that \"IP address\" referred to \"intellectual property\", rather than internet protocol. Expect him to appear on Fail Blog any time soon.",
