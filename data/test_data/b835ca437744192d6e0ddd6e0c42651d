  "content": "Police have been granted an extra 12 hours to question News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman and another man held in custody over alleged phone-tapping in the royal household. Scotland Yard has confirmed that the two men in custody at Charing Cross police station will remain there for another 12 hours. One of the men is Goodman, but the identity of the other man - a 35-year-old - is unknown. \"The two men remain in custody. We have been granted a superintendent's extension, an extra 12 hours on top of the 24 they have already been in custody for,\" said a Scotland Yard spokesman. The extension will keep the men in custody until this evening. Earlier this morning, a 50-year-old man - whose identity is unknown but is not thought to be a News of the World employee - was bailed to return to a central London police station in September. The three men were arrested early yesterday in south London by police investigating allegations that members of Britain's royal household - including Prince Charles - may have had their mobile phone calls intercepted. They were arrested under Section 1 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, under which the potential penalties are a maximum of two years in jail, a fine or both. Scotland Yard is investigating how long the alleged phone interceptions have been going on for, amid claims that it could have been a year or more. And a cabinet minister and celebrities are believed to be among those allegedly affected. Meanwhile, former royal press officer Dickie Arbiter said it was very unlikely the Prince of Wales would have left voicemail messages on the mobile phones of staff in his household. On the repercussions of the police investigation, he added: \"The staff will probably be taking advice on what they should be doing.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
