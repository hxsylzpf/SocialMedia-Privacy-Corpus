  "content": "Police are investigating after students at an elite Melbourne boys' school were accused of creating an Instagram account that shared photos of local girls, reportedly as young as 11 and without their knowledge, and invited people to vote for \"slut of the year\". The Instagram account, @ys_academy_puspus, was reportedly run by students at Brighton Grammar and shut down on Saturday after the mother of a girl who featured on the account reported it to the school. The school confirmed on Monday that two year 11 students involved in the account had been suspended, and that it \"will make a final decision on their enrolment status at the conclusion of further investigations into this serious matter\". In a post on Facebook, reported in Fairfax Media, the woman, who has not been named to protect the identity of her daughter, said there were images of girls as young as 11 or 12 on the page, which also showed girls in various stages of undress. Some photos reportedly included captions describing sex acts the girls would perform. \"I am writing this as a mother of a girl that has not only been sexualised but violated within our small community,\" she said. \"I will not rest until the consequence for the crime meets the severity of the crime itself \u2013 for my daughter and all other young unsuspecting girls.\" A spokeswoman for Victoria police said detectives had been notified of the Instagram account on Saturday and were investigating. \"Police can confirm it has received a report in relation to inappropriate content on an Instagram account originating in the Bayside area,\" she said. In a statement, Brighton Grammar said it was made aware on the weekend of \"an unacceptable social media posting\" involving two year 11 boys. The statement appeared to confine the complaint to one post, made on Friday afternoon. It said the school \"regrets the distress caused to the girls and their families\" and was taking the matter \"very seriously\". \"The Instagram post is disgraceful and does not reflect the values of BGS (Brighton Grammar School),\" principal Ross Featherston said. \"Disrespectful behaviour on any social media site is simply unacceptable and will not be tolerated.\" The school said the wellbeing of the girls involved was a \"top priority\" and it was working with their families to offer ongoing support. \"Respectful relationships are a critical part of the culture at BGS with various programs in the curriculum addressing this issue,\" the statement said. \"The behaviour of these boys does not in any way reflect the values of BGS or what BGS stands for.\" It is the second time Brighton Grammar has faced public criticism this year. In May it published a blog post on bullying by a \"resilience coach\" which suggested the victims of bullying were \"part of the problem\". It asked parents to consider if their bullied child was \"a whinger, a complainer, self-absorbed, an exaggerator, loose with the truth, a passive doormat, displaying negative body language, an approval addict, a try hard, critical or a bad sport?\" The school, which charges $28,000 a year in its senior school, tells parents of prospective pupils it fosters a \"culture that celebrates the unique ways men interact with one another\" and believes in the importance of a \"positive masculine culture\"."
