  "content": "That the word \"readers\" doesn't appear once in your analysis of the Leveson inquiry (After 86 days and \u00a36m, the real battle for reform is just starting, 22 June) is powerful testimony to the way in which their interests have been locked out of these lengthy proceedings. Consumers of the press have a right to expect that it won't publish \"inaccurate, misleading or distorted information\" and will \"distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact\", to quote the Press Complaints Commission code of practice, and a right to complain if they believe this code has been broken. Yet that right is denied them. All they can do is complain to the newspaper itself. If that fails there can be no appeal to the PCC because the category of \"readers\" as potential complainants simply doesn't exist. Only complaints from a subject of a story will be accepted, and even in these cases readers cannot complain as \"third parties\" other than in very exceptional circumstances. It is almost beyond belief that this issue hasn't been acknowledged, let alone addressed, by the inquiry and appears to have gone unnoticed by the press. This matters not just because readers' rights have been denied. It matters because, in the vast majority of cases, breaches of the PCC code of practice can go unchallenged. This lack of accountability seems very likely to have been a major cause of the deteriorating press standards that the inquiry seems so determined to tackle. If Leveson is serious about achieving this, readers have to be given a voice. Kate Francis Bristol \u2022\u2008The Beaverbrook-Coward vendetta (Letters, June 25) worked both ways. Near the start of Coward's heroic epic In Which We Serve, a copy of the Daily Express is seen floating just under the surface of the sea. The headline reads \"NO WAR\". Barry Hewlett-Davies Brighton"
