  "content": "The man Rupert Murdoch parachuted in to News International to take over from Rebekah Brooks after she resigned as chief executive at the height of the phone-hacking scandal in July is to give evidence to the Leveson inquiry next week. It will be the first time Tom Mockridge will be questioned publicly since taking over as News International chief executive. A journalist by trade, he has worked with Murdoch since 1991, rising through the executive ranks at News Corporation. Mockridge moved to Wapping from Italy, where he was head of News Corp's pay-TV broadcaster Sky Italia. He will appear at the inquiry on Tuesday and is expected to be quizzed about changes in News International's policies since the abrupt closure of the News of the World last July. Also appearing on Tuesday will be the editor of the Times, James Harding, and his Sunday Times counterpart John Witherow. Private Eye editor Ian Hislop will also give evidence. The Guardian will be represented on the same day by editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger and the paper's readers' editor, Chris Elliott. Also appearing for News International is Rupert Pennant-Rea, former deputy governor of the Bank of England and independent board member of Times Newspaper Holdings, the NI subsidiary that publishes the Times and Sunday Times. On Monday, Richard Wallace, Tina Weaver and Lloyd Embley, the editors of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People respectively, will appear. Trinity Mirror chief executive Sly Bailey will also appear, with Kevin O'Sullivan, the Sunday Mirror's TV critic and the former Daily Mirror former deputy showbiz editor, among those submitting written evidence. Wednesday has been dedicated to celebrity magazine and regional newspaper editors. Rosie Nixon, Lisa Byrne and Lucie Cave, the editors of Hello!, OK! and Heat respectively, will appear on Wednesday morning. That afternoon Lord Justice Leveson will hear from the editors of the Yorkshire Post, South Wales Evening Post, Belfast Telegraph, Manchester Evening News, Scotsman, Irish News and Ipswich Evening Star. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
