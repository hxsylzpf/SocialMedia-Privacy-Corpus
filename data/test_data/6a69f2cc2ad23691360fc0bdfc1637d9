  "content": "Lord Prescott, the former deputy prime minister, has launched a scathing attack on \"collusion\" between the owners of the press to benefit \"media barons and shareholders and restrict access to justice for the less well off\" after discovering that newspapers and broadcasters had made identical submissions to the government about legal aid cases involving privacy and defamation. In an article for the Guardian Prescott argues the government's proposed changes to limit the use of no win, no fee arrangements with lawyers will ensure the winners of libel cases against the media will end up with a big legal bill for their troubles, effectively shutting off the courts to people seeking to bring newspapers to heel. He said: \"This [bill] will most likely be more than they get themselves in damages. It means that most victims will end up, in net terms, with a bill for winning their case.\" \"Under the government's proposals, it would be unaffordable for me or any member of the public to take on the financial might of the multimillionaire owners of the free press over an issue like phone hacking. Anybody challenging a Murdoch in future would find themselves exhausted and outspent by the wealthy who carp on about freedoms \u2013 but only for those who can afford them. That's what the powerful do. They drag out cases until you've sold your house and your possessions trying to get justice.\" The peer said the responses to the government's consultation \"were all identical\", pointing out that there was no difference between the submissions from the Guardian, the Daily Mail, the BBC and BSkyB. This looks like \"collusion\", Prescott said. \"One highlight was the Mail and the Express citing the European convention on human rights in their favour. What would their hate-filled columnists say about that?\" The former deputy prime minister has been a high-profile critic of some sections of the media \u2013 and received a payout of \u00a340,000 over phone hacking by the News of the World. The News of the World admitted they had placed Prescott under surveillance. At the time the peer said the settlement had \"brought clarity, apology and compensation\" and followed years of \"aggressive denials and a cavalier approach to private information and the law\". News International apologised in court but later said senior staff knew nothing about the wrongdoing. Prescott has a track record of heading off attempts to limit payouts to people who take cases against the press. He ran a guerilla parliamentary campaign \u2013 successfully \u2013 to derail the last Labour government's attempt to cap lawyers' success fees in media cases. The attack opens up a hitherto unexplored front of how the media operates. While the Leveson inquiry focuses on the future of press regulation and governance, changes to legal aid seek to head off a rush to the courts. This coupled with a new parliamentary defamation bill seeking to rebalance press freedoms in the internet age this year, will, said Prescott, \"make it impossible to bring your case even when there has been defamation under the new definition\". When contacted the Media Lawyers Association, which represents the legal departments of every newspaper and broadcaster, did not wish to comment. One board member told the Guardian that the submissions had been collectively agreed but had been put in separately because the government would otherwise not count each media organisation's viewpoint. A Guardian News &amp; Media spokesperson said: \"Guardian News &amp; Media strongly favours an alternative dispute resolution system for media complaints. As Alan Rusbridger told the Leveson inquiry earlier this month, for claimants, such a system would provide quick and affordable justice but perhaps more importantly, pragmatic and valued solutions.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
