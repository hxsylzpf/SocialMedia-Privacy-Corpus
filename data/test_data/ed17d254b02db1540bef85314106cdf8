Anyone who follows the rise and fall of social nets will notice a few recognisable bits of information - Facebook's growing domination, Friendster's continuing popularity in south east Asia and Hi-5's stronghold in central America. The big surprises? MySpace is only top dog in the US and Bebo's number one in Ireland. Still, the data's taken from the mercurial traffic service Alexa - so it needs more than a few pinches of salt.",
