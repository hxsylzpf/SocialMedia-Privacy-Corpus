  "content": "The power of the press or, indeed, TV? Forget it. After weeks of relentless hype, Mad Men comes back for a fifth series (this time on Sky Atlantic) and nets just 98,000 viewers first time around \u2013 far below the 355,000 it attracted on BBC2. Don't automatically think big, glamorous television numbers, then. Think readers \u2013 97,000 of them for a little specialist magazine success like Garden News. Because some show's up on a screen, rather than lying on a newsstand, doesn't mean it's taking pasty-loving Britain by storm. Tweet justice A former Indian cricket official tweeting about a former New Zealand cricket player loses his libel case: damages \u00a390,000, costs to lawyers on both sides head towards \u00a31m. Libel lawyers point out that \"false statements on Twitter or other social media will be treated just as seriously as those on traditional media\". There'll always be new ways of keeping the bewigged caravan rolling fruitfully forward."
