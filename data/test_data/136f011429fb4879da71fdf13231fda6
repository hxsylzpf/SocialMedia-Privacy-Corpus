  "content": "The 140-character social networking site Twitter has found a business model: \"promoted tweets\" written by advertisers, which will appear when people search on the site. The system echoes that used to huge success by Google, which serves adverts against search results. Twitter says it has already signed up a number of well-known organisations, including the coffee chain Starbucks, film-maker Sony Pictures, caffeine drink Red Bull, TV channel Bravo, the Virgin America airline and the US retailer Best Buy. Users will see sponsored tweets at the top of some Twitter search pages, which will be an ordinary tweet from the brand clearly labelled \"Promoted\" to distinguish paid-for tweets from normal ones. Later on, adverts will also begin appearing on the site's home page when users visit it which will be tailored to the user's interests, determined by the messages they publish and receive. They will also appear in the tweets that are sent to users when accessed through other applications \u2013 which makes up anything between 60% and 80% of access to Twitter. Biz Stone, the company's founder, said in a blog post that sponsored tweets will have to \"meet a higher bar\" than normal ones: if people do not interact with them \u2013 by passing them on around the network \u2013 they will be removed. \"Although our services extend beyond the web, Twitter ranks as one of the most popular sites on the internet. Over the years, we've resisted introducing a traditional web advertising model because we wanted to optimise for value before profit,\" Stone said. But the industry analyst Ovum said that the \"promoted tweets\" could irritate users: \"The flip side of Twitter's immediacy is that if advertising messages are not very carefully positioned, users can hit back at brands and in real time, and brands will have little control over this,\" said Eden Zoller, Ovum's principal analyst. Twitter's reluctance so far to display adverts \u2013 even on its home page, which millions of people use each month to read and post to the service \u2013 has led to questions about how it will fund itself, as it is clearly unwilling to charge users to access the service. Stone acknowledged that, saying: \"Believe me, when your name is Biz and you're a co-founder of Twitter, it also means putting yourself at the mercy of folks like Stephen Colbert who hit home runs with lines like, 'So, I assume that 'Biz' in 'Biz Stone' does not stand for 'Business Model'.\" The company is clearly taking a more aggressive approach to spreading its brand to put it on more platforms. Late last week it announced that it was buying Tweetie, one of the most popular applications for accessing Twitter on the iPhone, and would be recruiting its developer to produce a version for the Apple iPad. It is already charging Google and Microsoft's Bing search engine for access to its content so they can offer it in search results, in a deal reckoned to be worth more than $10m annually. Twitter has seen dramatic growth since its inception four years ago. The number of visitors to the Twitter.com site has risen from 9.3 million in March 2009 to 22.3 million this March, according to comScore, a web metrics company. That does not include the people who access it through third-party systems. It is estimated to have around 45 million regular users, and has been valued at $1bn based on venture capital funding it has received."
