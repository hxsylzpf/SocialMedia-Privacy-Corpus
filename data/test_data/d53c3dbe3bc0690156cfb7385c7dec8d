  "content": "A concoction of meat, chips, cheese and sauce in a styrofoam container has become an unlikely social media phenomenon, sending revenue at some takeaway shops \u2013 and cholesterol counts \u2013 through the roof. The halal snack pack has long been a staple of Australian takeaway shops, if a little overshadowed by the kebab. But a Facebook page dedicated to the delicacy, the Halal Snack Pack Appreciation Society, has attracted nearly 90,000 members since December \u2013 tens of thousands in the past month alone. Its founder, Luke Eagles, says the group is about \"sharing great snack pack stories and discussing possible best snack pack in world\", with members rating their meals on greeting, signage, packaging and taste. They also police the rules for ordering a proper snack pack, namely keeping your snack pack salad-free and never, ever asking for tomato sauce. Transgressors risking banishment from the group and the title, \"Haram Dingo\", signalling a kind of stubborn \"whiteness\" that no amount of shredded meat can overcome. One dispensary, Metro One in Ashfield in Sydney's inner west, has seen revenue climb more than 75% since it was featured in the group as serving one of the city's finest snack packs. The Appreciation Society's membership is a mix of Muslims and non-Muslims, who uniformly refer to each other as \"brothers and sisters\". Muslim members of the group have helpfully provided the others a glossary of Islamic and Arabic terms they are encouraged to use in reviewing their culinary experience. The warm, somewhat wry embrace of a takeaway food explicitly billed as halal is at odds with the way Islamic religious certification is often portrayed by the media and in politics, as something shady or alien to Australian tastes. Last year the Liberal senator Cory Bernardi channelled discontent around halal in rightwing circles to secure an inquiry into the $13bn industry, which heard from a range of government agencies there was \"no link\" between Islamic certification and terrorism."
