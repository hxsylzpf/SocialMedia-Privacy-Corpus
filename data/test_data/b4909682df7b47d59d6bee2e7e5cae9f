  "title": "Fancy: New York's hottest site for your shopping wish list",
  "content": "On Monday, Manhattan-based startup Fancy received $53m in its latest round of funding, with investors now including Will Smith and American Express. But just what does the company do \u2013 and why has it been valued at $600m? \u2022 Fancy.com is a website where users upload the products that they \"fancy\" or \"want\". The items then appear on a user's public profile \u2013 though users can tweak their privacy settings to make their fantasy list private. \u2022 The similar look to Pinterest has, perhaps naively, meant that the social commerce website has often been compared to the online pinboard. But the ambitions are much, much bigger; in an interview with Business Insider last year, chief executive Joseph Einhorn said that he wanted Fancy to be a \"'newer version\" of Amazon. \u2022 A user profile resembles an Amazon wish list, with users able to \"feature\" products as well as having a separate tab with items that they specifically \"want\". \u2022 Similar to Facebook's News Feed, the website's home page displays products that people you follow have uploaded or \"fancied\", as well as a list of the most popular items on the site. These will often range from expensive watches and hot tubs to cheaper, but unnecessary, items such as a laser cut map of London or a staple-free stapler. 5. The company reportedly generates \u00a33m of revenue a month by taking a 10% commission on orders through the site, and selling $39 monthly subscriptions to a \"Fancy box\" \u2013 the contents of which are worth about $80. 6. In addition to its new film star investor, its recent filing also discloses that among its directors are Twitter and Square co-founder Jack Dorsey, owner of football club AS Roma James Pallotta and editor-in-chief of The New Republic Chris Hughes. 7. It is interesting to note that Joseph's brother, Jack, is the pesident of the parent company, Thing Daemon. Perhaps they're looking to be the next famous entrepreneurial family, \u00e0 la Winklevoss.",
