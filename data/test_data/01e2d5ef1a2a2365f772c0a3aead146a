  "content": "Orange is to launch a major push for mobile social networking in the UK, introducing a service which aggregates users' accounts across the major social networks. Launched as a trial in France last month under the name MySocialPlace, Orange has now partnered with the biggest social networks - Facebook, MySpace and Bebo - to introduce the service in the UK in the autumn under the Orange World branded website. UK users will also be able to access the chat service Flirtomatic and the photo-sharing site Pikeo, while Orange customers in France can use the Skyrock community, DailyMotion video site and dating service Meetic. Users set up their login details to the sites once and MySocialPlace aggregates messages from friends and newsfeed alerts with photo uploads, messaging and status updates. The Orange head of strategy and business development, Gerard Grech, said nine months of research in the UK, France and Spain had shown that users typically use multiple sites and need an aggregated service. \"The key benefit is simplicity. Social networking is just another form of communication, so it extends the raison d'etre of the phone. It is exceeding our expectations how many people are accessing the service daily [in France] - more than use it on the web because it is so simple,\" Grech added. He said the service will be commercialised through banner adverts, but will work across all web-enabled phones. The company wants to establish the service as a standalone application on Orange-branded phones and allow users to synchronise their social networking between mobile, PC and the TV. Data from Nielsen Mobile in May showed that 44% of UK mobile phone users have registered with a social networking site, and estimated that 1.7% of users, or 812,000 people, had accessed those services from their mobile. Facebook had been accessed by 9% of all mobile web users, MySpace by 3.4% and Bebo by 2.6%. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
