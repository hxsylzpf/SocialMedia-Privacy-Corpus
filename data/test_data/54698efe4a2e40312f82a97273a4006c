The pair shook their stuff on the dance floor when they visited the Scott Mills show at BBC Radio 1. And while you are in the mood for dancing, we celebrate the 40th anniversary of Abba's Eurovision Song Contest victory in Brighton with Waterloo. This week's celebrations of their victory \u2013 they scored nul points from the UK \u2013 included a party at the Swedish embassy in London and a celebration at Tate Modern, which featured the mesmeric magic skills on Charlie Caper. Spring is a popular season for weddings and we've got a couple of clips on that theme. Bambo and Janice want their family and friends to save the date so they filmed a Great Gatsby-style reminder featuring the music of Kanye West.
