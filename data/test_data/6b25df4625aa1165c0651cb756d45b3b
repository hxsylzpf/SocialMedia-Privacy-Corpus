  "content": "A high court judge refused yesterday to order the BBC to disguise the face of a man to be featured this week in its documentary series The Hunt for Britain's Paedophiles. The man, named only as A, who was convicted of possessing and distributing pornographic pictures of children, made an emergency application yesterday to block his identification in the second part of the series, which is to be broadcast on Thursday on BBC2. But the judge, Mr Justice Ouseley, refused to order the BBC to disguise the man's identity. A's counsel, Keir Starmer, said he had pleaded guilty to offences involving the possession and distribution of pornographic pictures of children last year and was under a three year community rehabilitation order with a condition of treatment. Mr Starmer told the judge: \"There is a real risk of physical attack if his name and image are shown with adverse comment about the leniency of his sentence.\" The man, who was \"not a notorious offender\" and had no previous convictions, would feature in the programme for three minutes. Giving his ruling, the judge said: \"There is, a degree of risk to anyone who is identified as a paedophile. but I am not satisfied that the combination of name, filming and commentary will establish that risk.\""
