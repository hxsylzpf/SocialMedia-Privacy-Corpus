  "content": "They demanded \u00a3600,000, but today Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas were awarded just \u00a314,600 in damages from Hello! magazine in compensation for publishing unauthorised pictures of their wedding reception. But while it may be seen as a pyrrhic victory for Douglas and Zeta Jones, who had said she had felt \"violated\" by the sneak photographs of their lavish, but nonetheless private event in a New York hotel, Hello! magazine was heavily penalised. The magazine is also being ordered to pay rival OK! magazine \u00a31,033,756 as a result of its spoiler operation which involved a batch of photographs of the wedding in November 2000. The Douglases had sought \u00a3500,000 for breach of commercial confidence and \u00a350,000 apiece for personal distress, while OK! had hoped to win \u00a31.75m. Who will pay the costs of the six-week-long high court battle between the Douglases and OK! and Hello! earlier this year will be decided at a later date. The judge, Mr Justice Lindsay, said the award of damages \"may make Hello! alive to the unwisdom of acting as it did\". Hello! said it was \"very happy\" with the award of \u00a314,600 to the Douglases - \u00a33,750 each for distress plus expenses and a nominal figure for data protection. However, the magazine said it was \"disappointed\" at the amount awarded to its competitor, and said it was almost certain to appeal the decision. \"The basis for the judge's calculations is what OK! might have sold if it had not been for Hello's publication of the unauthorised photograph, and their re-use in the Sun and the Daily Mail,\" said Sally Cartwright, the publishing director of Hello!. \"Since Hello! sold only around 150,000 more than it would otherwise have expected, we do find it surprising that we should be held responsible for a theoretical 1.4 million lost sales of OK!\" Hello! said it was almost certain to appeal against the part of the judgment that related to the re-use of the unauthorised photographs in newspapers, since it had specifically forbidden the papers to publish the pictures. \"It is also alarming to all print media that the financial consequences to Hello! of following the normal practice of the UK media, namely running a spoiler, should be so great,\" Ms Cartwright added. She said the award had \"wider implications for the press as a whole\". \"They are now apparently on notice that whenever one media organisation has an exclusive, all others are at huge risk if they cover the same ground. This is potentially not only anti-competitive, but also a restraint on freedom of expression.\" In a statement a spokesperson for the Douglases described the damages awarded to the Hollywood couple as \"historic\". \"The couple took the action as a matter of principle and are delighted that Justice Lindsay's ruling vindicated their position and OK!'s position establishing their right to the protection of law.\" The spokesperson added that the damages awarded to the Douglases would be given to the Family Learning Centre. In a statement OK! magazine said: \"Mr Justice Lindsay accepted OK!'s claim for massive commercial losses because the publication by Hello! of the unauthorised pictures forced OK! to publish the Douglas wedding feature prematurely and very seriously damaged its sales.\"",
