  "content": "Making quantum cryptography practical has been a holy grail for some physicists - but it's proved elusive. Now a British team of researchers think they have discovered a way to make it accessible to anybody. Unlike traditional cryptography (where the data itself is encrypted using complicated mathematical functions) in quantum encrypted communications a key is sent by beaming a string of photons, representing a code, from the source to the target. If it gets to the other end and matches what the target expects, then the data gets unencrypted. If anyone tries to intercept or break it? Well, thanks to the laws of quantum physics, the mere act of observing the stream of photons changes it - and so it fails. That means that with enough photons in play, data can be made essentially hacker-proof. All very good - and known for some time. But the problem so far has been trying to transmit the data over the sort of distances we're used to seeing in communications - over tens of miles down telephone lines, for example. With quantum encryption you can get great transfer rates over very short distances, but it degrades as you try and transmit the data further: meaning that scientists have so far been playing with data rates of around 10 kilobits per second over a distance of 20km. Now a team consisting of Toshiba's Cambridge Research Lab and Cambridge academics have come up with a new system that can achieve much greater speeds at a lower cost. In a paper published in the New Journal of Physics, the team explain how they've improved the efficacy of quantum communications a hundredfold - so that they can now achieve speeds of 10Mbps to a target 20km away. That's much more like a useable speed - and, crucially, it was achieved using lower cost components. One of the researchers, James Dynes, told me that the development \"now opens the door to potentially new high speed secure applications\" - even allowing to become commonplace. That's good news for all sorts of people who want to conduct totally secure communications over the network - particularly banks, for example. \"In particular, the high bit rate could support a multi-user network,\" said Dynes. \"In the past, quantum cryptographic bit rates have been too low to allow this, as the bit rate has to be shared between many pairs of users. Now with Mbit/s key rates, many users over a network can securely communicate with each other.\" And how much would a system like this cost? \"If mass manufactured, the system would have a cost comparable to a high-end firewall,\" he said. \"The most expensive components are typically the very sensitive single photon detection devices. Our system uses cheap semiconductor devices, which gives it a considerable cost advantage.\""
