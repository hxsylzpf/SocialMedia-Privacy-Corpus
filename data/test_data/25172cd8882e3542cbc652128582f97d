  "content": "Retweets \u2013 they are part of the DNA of Twitter, and a big part of its success. In fact, one might say retweets are the whole point of Twitter, given that the platform's modus operandi is to impart information, share content and jokes, and generally connect. The poorer cousin of the retweet is the \"quoted tweet\", used when, instead of retweeting an original tweet, a person wants to add comment or opinion. This can be a very positive thing \u2013 for instance when a user is explaining why they find the content interesting \u2013 but can also be a source of great frustration. We've all felt the pain of composing an amazing tweet, and rather than watching the retweets roll in, receive notifications of people endlessly quoting the tweet. Especially irritating when the only addition is a redundant \"RT\". Well, now Twitter has altered its \"quote tweet\" function, making it much more substantial. The change was announced via Twitter's official account and demonstrated with a gif. Rather than the \"quote tweet\" button just being a quick shortcut to copying and pasting the text and media content of a tweet, the new function embeds the original tweet a user is quoting. Make sense? In truth, this isn't all that much different from when Twitter rolled out, a few months ago, the ability to embed tweets as cards within tweets, via copying a link. But embedded tweets were viewable only on the mobile app and not web. Twitter tunnels So, what does this altered function mean? Well, within hours, creative tweeters had already created the concept of \"Twitter tunnels\". Otherwise described as people falling down wormholes of quoted tweet upon quoted tweet, like climbing the never ending staircase of an Escher creation, or becoming wrapped up in a chain email. This means the \"back\" button will certainly see a lot of action, as users attempt to clamber back out to breathe, eventually arriving at a timeline. However, it turns out \"Twitter tunnels\" can actually be put to some good use. Within hours of the function launch, users were joining up to tell tweet-by-tweet stories. Each new section of the tale embedded in another tweet. An example is below: Stories told in the medium of tweets aren't new \u2013 novelist David Mitchell wrote the first short story on Twitter. Prolific tweeter and author Teju Cole famously wrote an essay on immigration, A Piece of the Wall, via Twitter. The Guardian even has its own Twitter Fiction series \u2013 challenging authors to come up with a narrative within the 140 character limit (think along the lines of Hemingway's \"For sale: Baby shoes, never worn.\") Of course, people have actually found numerous ways to beat Twitter's character limit using the likes of TwitLonger (essentially a link to an outside web page). Also of use is the \"screenshort\", AKA a screenshot of a passage of text, particularly useful for when one wants to quote a large section of an article. The screenshort is starting to be used by news outlet social accounts in order to promote content. It's also utilised by teenagers to take a screenshot of the notes app on their phones, to expand on their thoughts. But what the new \"quote tweet\" button does is essentially extend Twitter's character limit \u2013 allowing 116 characters in addition to the embedded tweet. Reaction So what has the reaction been to the new \"quote tweet\" function? Mostly positive \u2013 people are enjoying the Twitter tunnels and the possibilities they offer. However, others find the concept of the \"tunnels\" irritating and have voiced concerns that Twitter is moving away from the simplicity that made it attractive in the first place. The danger is that Twitter's UI becomes an acid trip of quoted tweets. Though it will be useful for storytelling and to put tweets into context, arguably users have already managed to do this by manually replying to their own tweets to create a chain. This means followers can more easily follow a tweeter's train of thought, but it doesn't exactly have Storify quaking its boots. Still, it offers opportunities for narratives around particular events, whether that be TV shows, elections or other world developments. There does seem to be one clear downside of Twitter's new function, however: what happens when an original tweet is deleted? So far, this results in an ugly \"this tweet is unavailable\" message where the original tweet is supposed to be embedded. So remember, if a politician makes a mortifying mistake on Twitter: make sure to take a screenshot.",
