  "content": "Last week the charity Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust came under scrutiny for its #SmearForSmear social media campaign where women are asked to take a selfie wearing lipstick that's smeared, use the hashtag, tag the charity and nominate a friend encouraging them to do the same. Sounds like a winner right? So why has it come under fire? Because, according to the author, the charity should be doing less to raise awareness of cervical cancer, given that just over 10% of women are failing to attend their first smear test, and more to make the actual experience less intrusive. The charity is also accused of \"jumping on the social media bandwagon, trying too hard and not succeeding\". Ouch. So why has this campaign failed? Or has it? It seems that if a social media campaign doesn't go viral and raise millions in days then it's been a complete waste of time and we should all hang our digital fundraising heads in shame and go back to the drawing board. In fact the campaign, which launched on January 24, has been a resounding success. According to the charity's communications manager, Maddy Durrant, the hashtag has had 14,975 mentions on Twitter with a reach of 109.3m \u2013 in just one week. Traffic to the website has increased by 41% in January (compared to the previous year) and the campaign's landing page has had over 13,000 views to date. It's even made Third Sector's Digital Campaign of the week. Nadine Woogara, digital manager at Ovarian Cancer Action, said: \"Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust has got it spot on with their #SmearForSmear awareness campaign. It works because it's a simple, easy to understand and easy to take part in campaign \u2013 a real winner. \"As a tiny charity where resources can be tight, the beauty of social media is that you can see straight away whether you've got it right or not. If you haven't, you just won't get the engagement. The advantage with social media, unlike with expensive press or advertising campaigns, is if your audience doesn't like it or it doesn't even reach them, you have the opportunity to change tack and try something else.\" So it's clear for the charity, and the sector, that the campaign has been a success but would the public think so? The fact that it's not gone viral leads me to believe that they would think not. Is this a case of viral fatigue or does the ability to go viral depend on the cause? The phrase \"sexy cause\" is bandied about a lot in the sector. It means, essentially, that some causes are easier to fundraise for than others and are, therefore, \"sexy\". But I defy anyone to show me a sexy charity? You know what's definitely not sexy? Talking about toilet habits. Yet Wateraid managed to raise awareness of World Toilet Day by creating a campaign that used toilet humour, literally, to raise awareness of the importance of sanitation in developing countries. They asked comedians to share their best toilet jokes and the public voted for their favourite. Alicia Robinson, digital communications lead at Wateraid said: \"The campaign naturally lent itself well to social media. With fun, tongue-in-cheek creative and sophisticated targeting with paid social [media advertising], the posts received high levels of engagement and drove a significant amount of traffic to our web page. What's more, we managed to engage a new, younger audience online. On Twitter, we benefited from the comedians themselves tweeting about the campaign, thus spreading the message further.\" Here's another charity that's definitely not sexy \u2013 The Sohana Research Fund. They are a tiny charity who are trying to find a cure for a very rare disease called recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). Sufferers are born without skin that has formed properly and often die from malignant cancer by the time they are in their 30s. The charity was set up by Sharmila Nikapota, whose 12 year old daughter Sohana suffers from RDEB. The charity came up with the idea of a #EBtongueTwister challenge as the disease is such a difficult word to say. Charity patron Damian Lewis soon got his celebrity friends involved and to date the hashtag has had a reach of over 30m and the charity has more than doubled both its Twitter followers and Facebook likes. Not bad for a campaign you've probably never heard of. So the next time we criticise a charity social media campaign for not going viral, perhaps we should take a bit of time to delve deeper into what success looks like for that charity. In fact, if I had it my way, I'd ban the word viral altogether. Going viral is not something you can actually do, it's only something you can prepare for.
