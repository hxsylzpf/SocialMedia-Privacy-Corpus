  "content": "\u2022 Bill Gates managed to make plenty of headlines with his comment that Chinese censorship was \"very limited\" - but he wasn't finished there. Dropping by the offices of the New York Times yesterday, Gates said that Google had \"done nothing and gotten a lot of credit for it\" (pretty much true) and said he didn't understand the point that Google was trying to make in its wrangle with Beijing (surely disingenuous). \u2022 Given his recent email to the troops at Sun Microsystems ahead of the company's takeover by Oracle (a message which urged them to \"emotionally resign from Sun\"), it's no surprise that speculation is building that Jonathan Schwartz is getting ready to step down from his post. The news could come by Wednesday, when Larry Ellison is hosting an event at Oracle HQ to outline future strategy. \u2022 You may know the name of Robin Dunbar from his famous number describing the number of relationships that a primate can viably maintain (it's 150, if you didn't know). But despite suggestions that websites like Facebook could help us broaden our ability to talk with each other, it turns out that the internet doesn't make Dunbar's number bigger. His latest preliminary study shows that while we can maintain many more weak ties thanks to social networks, the number of meaningful relationships doesn't change. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
