  "content": "The founder of the social networking site MySpace has unveiled plans for global expansion and a new mobile phone service that will allow its users, who already number 87 million globally, to connect to the service wherever they are. MySpace chief executive Chris DeWolfe said the site, which now has more than 3 million registered users in the UK alone who use it to make friends, share music, films and photos and communicate with one another, said it would expand into 10 new countries over the next year in addition to offices in the UK and Australia. The site, which was acquired by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp in July last year as part of a \u00a3332m deal, gained a reputation for helping break new music acts. Mr DeWolfe said the new mobile service, which has already launched in the US, would come to Europe soon. He said: \"We think there's a great opportunity to create a MySpace Lite for any mobile device.\""
