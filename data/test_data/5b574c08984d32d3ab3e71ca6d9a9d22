While the stock markets tumble, the pound plummets and history hurtles forward, we can rely on memes to get us through the tumult. We hope. Fortunately, Twitter provides them in abundance. Whether it's opining on how history will look back on today: Or there's this variation on the idiot sandwich: This oh-so political chat-up line: A statement on the general chaos that is our current political situation, aptly illustrated by the IT Crowd: Sky News broadcasting someone shouting insults at Boris Johnson: This one doesn't need explaining and maybe it won't cheer you up at all because the pound really doesn't look great right now: How long until Brexit causes yet another jump in the price of Freddos? Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear: But at least we will always have the town of Falkirk's Hitler door: And also that time Ed Miliband looked like a DJ: For a wonderful moment, before most of the rest of Wales emphatically joined Leave, the land of my fathers looked a bit like a pig wearing a jolly blue top hat: Speaking of things that look like other things, it's incredible just how much the cliffs of Dover look like financial doom: And if you're still feeling sad, just remember the UK is the Ginger Spice of the EU:"
