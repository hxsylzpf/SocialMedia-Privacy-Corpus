  "content": "A man has been arrested after Stan Collymore, the football player turned radio presenter, made a formal complaint that he was racially abused on Twitter. Police in Northumbria arrested the suspect, 21, on suspicion of racially aggravated harassment after Collymore, who works for the radio station Talksport, reported two tweets to officers last night. Talksport confirmed that a Twitter user sent one racist message which read: \"@StanCollymore has anyone ever called you Stan Cooneymore #greatracistabuse.\" The second read: \"@StanCollymore has anyone ever referred to you as semi pro as in a semi pro coon #neitherwhitenorblack.\" Northumbria police said: \"Just after midnight, police received a complaint of racist comments made on Twitter. Officers are carrying out enquiries.\" The Twitter user's account has been removed from the site and the tweets prompted an outpouring of support for Collymore from other users of the microblogging site who condemned the racist abuse. Jamie Durent, of Ingleby Barwick, Stockton-on-Tees, tweeted: \"Kudos to stan collymore. Racism has no place in any walk of life. Baffling how people think they can get away it.\" Chris Trott, based in Hong Kong, tweeted: \"that guy is bang out of line great effort from Collymore nobody needs that.\" Collymore's complaint comes as police trawl through CCTV after Oldham footballer Tom Adeyemi was allegedly racially abused by fans during the FA Cup third round tie with Liverpool on Friday night. Officers are likely to be taking witness statements as well as interviewing the defender, who was visibly upset after the incident involving a section of the Kop stand at Liverpool's Anfield stadium. Despite reassurance from his team-mates, as well as Liverpool players Dirk Kuyt and Steven Gerrard, the right-back, 20, who is on loan from Norwich, seemed close to tears. There then appeared to be discussion between the fourth official and a police officer by the tunnel while the match was continuing. The police said: \"Merseyside police can confirm that no one has been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated behaviour during tonight's FA Cup fixture at Anfield. \"However, the force and Liverpool Football Club are investigating following an incident that occurred during the second half of the game.\" Liverpool, who won the match 5-1, said they are also investigating the incident. \"An incident occurred in the second half of the match which is now being investigated by both the club and the police,\" said a statement issued by the club. Last night, Oldham manager Paul Dickov, said: \"From my point of view I have not spoken to Tom about it but I know the kid and something has been said. \"He is fine now. He has calmed down. He is a laid-back kid who just gets on with business.\" Last month, Collymore used his Twitter account to emphasise that racism remains a big issue in football. He spoke out after Manchester United player Patrice Evra became the subject of racist abuse on Twitter in the wake of Luis Su\u00e1rez, the Liverpool player, receiving an eight-match ban for insulting language that included a reference to Evra's skin colour."
