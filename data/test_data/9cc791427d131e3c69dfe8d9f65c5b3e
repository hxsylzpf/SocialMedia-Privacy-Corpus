  "content": "From: Nick Davies Sent: 06 July 2009 13:56 To: Fishburn, Honor Subject: Message for Andy Coulson Andy, This is a blast from the past, and I'm sorry to bother you with it. I've been told that last year the chief executive of the Professional Footballers Association, Gordon Taylor, sued the News of the World on the basis that journalists working for the paper had been involved in the hacking of his mobile phone during the time when you were editor and that, in the course of this action, the court ordered disclosure of some documents by the Information Commission dealing with their inquiry into illegal requests by journalists for information held on confidential databases. I have put this to News International, who say they don't recognise the case at all and, therefore, have not been able to talk to me about its outcome. Can you help me on any of the following points? \u2022\u2009Are you aware of this legal action? Did News International consult you about their response to it? Can you tell me how it was resolved? \u2022\u2009Do you accept that during your time as deputy editor and then as editor of the News of the World, journalists for whom you were legally responsible hacked into the mobile phones of targets other than the Palace staff in relation to whom Clive Goodman was convicted, and illegally obtained information from confidential databases? From: Honor Fishburn Date: 6 July 2009 15:21:54 BDT Subject: RE: Message for Andy Coulson Dear Nick Your email didn't ring any bells with Andy, so apologies, but I'm afraid we can't help. Thanks, Honor Honor Fishburn, Office of Andy Coulson, Director of Communications &amp; Planning, Conservative Campaign HQ"
