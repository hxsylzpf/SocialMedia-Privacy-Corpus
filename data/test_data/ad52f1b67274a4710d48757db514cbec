  "content": "What's the difference between @borisjohnson and @mayorofLondon? Nothing, argued the man currently residing in City Hall, when he changed the mayor of London's official Twitter feed back to a personal one to coincide with the start of his re-election campaign. For several hours, @mayoroflondon lay dormant, while Boris Johnson took 200,000-odd followers with him to @borisjohnson. At first glance, the affair seems reminiscent of the case of Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC chief political correspondent who left to become ITV's business editor. When she moved, her Twitter name changed from @BBCLauraK to @ITVLauraK, but she got to keep her 58,800 followers (which she has now boosted to more than 75,000). There were suggestions at the time that Kuenssberg's followers were in some way the property of the BBC \u2013 that she had acquired them, in part, through her status as a BBC employee and should have started afresh with a new account. Jemima Kiss, writing on it at the time, noted that Kuenssberg's followers were \"fans of her specifically, following her on Twitter for extra personality, colour and breaking news that they have come to associate with her style of reporting\". The BBC didn't press the matter. In the wake of that case, it has become increasingly obvious that the mix of private and professional offered by Twitter feeds is uncertain terrain for big companies and public bodies. In the US, writer Noah Kravitz is being sued by his ex-employer PhoneDog for taking his 17,000 followers with him when he left \u2013 and for $2.50 (\u00a31.60) per follower per month no less. Nothing on that scale has happened here, but still the personal/company divide is not always clear on Twitter, and many err on the side of caution. For example, journalists for broadcasters such as BBC and Sky don't offer political opinions, in line with the impartiality rules. The Guardian's social media rules are pretty relaxed on this point: its reporters and editors' feeds are treated as largely personal whether they're tagged as employees of the paper or not \u2013 Comment is free's Jessica Reed, for example, is @GuardianJessica, while I am @jonathanhaynes. There's an acknowledgement that people follow our individual feeds, as well as or instead of the main @guardian account, because of the personal perspective we bring to stories. Other places however are more keen to brand their employees' Twitter accounts. Sky News, for examples, likes its journalists to incorporate the name into their handles \u2013 hence @adamboultonsky and the rest. Sky News's controversial new social media rules also forbid them from retweeting non-Sky employees and from tweeting about subjects outside their beats. Their Sky-branded names, of course, mean that if even they took their followers with them to a new job, they would still need a new identity, even if they migrate those followers. Which brings us back to Johnson. The key issue here is whether the account is an official one, bound up with the job, or a personal one for someone who just happens to be mayor Of London and has been crafty enough to snag the Twitter handle. While private companies might be OK with employees tweeting in work hours, on work computers and BlackBerrys, the rules are different for public servants. Either the feed was official \u2013 in which case it shouldn't have been used for campaigning \u2013 or it was private, in which case it shouldn't have been promoted on the GLA website. By 6.41pm last night, and with \u2013 what else \u2013 a Twitter storm brewing, Johnson's team had clearly come to the same conclusion. In a blog post on his campaign website his team said: \"As he entered the campaign [Johnson] was determined to ensure there was no confusion between him as mayor and him as a candidate and therefore changed the name of his Twitter account. He did not expect this openness and honesty to have created such hysteria.\" In yet another curiosity, by Wednesday morning that post had itself disappeared. At the time of writing, @mayoroflondon is back talking about official duties while @borisjohnson is dormant; campaigning has been shifted to @backboris2012. Whether the whole incident was a cock-up or a PR stunt \u2013 @backboris2012 has added droves of followers as a result \u2013 one question remains: the next mayor of London will be very likely to want to use the name @mayoroflondon too. If that happens to be Ken Livingstone, will Johnson let him? \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"
