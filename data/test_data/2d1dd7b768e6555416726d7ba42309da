  "content": "Ralph Lee was responsible for Channel 4's most complained about programme of 2013 with its daily Muslim call to prayer during Ramadan, and its most controversial programme of 2014 in Benefits Street. The hotly-contested documentary series about James Turner Street in Birmingham \u2013 \"poverty porn\" to its critics, a timely examination of the modern day welfare state to its supporters \u2013 will return for a sequel next year, set in Kingston Road in Stockton-on-Tees. But before then C4 will screen a second series of Skint set in Grimsby (the first was in nearby Scunthorpe) with Southampton-based Immigration Street \u2013 like Benefits Street, but about immigration \u2013 to come . All three have been the focus of protest from residents, much of it a consequence of the backlash against Benefits Street, dubbed by one critic \"a medieval stocks updated for a modern format\". Grimsby MP Austin Mitchell asked the station to \"consider the ethics of the trend Channel 4 has embarked on, demonising the poor and making poverty entertainment\". \"[The backlash] did have an impact on how easy it was to go out and make these documentaries,\" says Lee, C4's head of factual and deputy chief creative officer. Lee says the intention with Skint, which will return to C4 in November is \"not to say this is what life is like in Grimsby, but this is what life is like for people who are skint\". \"We can't let this kind of criticism have a chilling effect on making programmes,\" says Lee. \"In a way what they are calling for is a form of censorship and I am always really suspicious of that. I defend our right \u2013 and the necessity \u2013 to tell the stories of some of the distressed parts of our society.\" In Southampton, a TV crew from Love Productions, the same company behind Benefits Street, was pelted with flour and eggs. It remains to be seen what form the final series will take, with producers currently going through the rushes after several months of filming. \"The community is very split,\" says Lee. \"Some are very happy to show their lives, others less so, and those who aren't have received a lot of support and encouragement from everyone from the local MP to community groups. \"Rather than just close the door and ignore it, people have tried to obstruct it. That's a real shame. They seem to assume there is a malign intent, a guaranteed negative impact of trying to tell the story about immigration and integration. We don't have a malign intention; there isn't an agenda.\" Like Benefits Street, Lee says the biggest complaint is about the programme name. It has been suggested C4 regards Immigration Street as a \"working title\". \"We could change the title or we might not,\" says Lee. \"The danger now is we would look like we were backing down.\" Head of factual since 2011, Lee was given his additional role, as deputy to chief creative off icer Jay Hunt, in March this year. He describes himself as her \"close confidant and sounding board\". It was reward, perhaps, for a burgeoning factual department responsible for some of C4's biggest hits, including Gogglebox, Educating Yorkshire, One Born Every Minute and Richard III: The King in the Car Park. The team behind 24 Hours in A&amp;E applied the same formula to 24 Hours in Police Custody, while Grayson Perry returned with Who Are You?, a winning combination of art and interview in which he made a dick (lots of them, on a vase) out of Chris Huhne. Lee attributes his department's success in part to finding a \"tone of voice that unites factual on C4, that doesn't have that same slightly patrician voice of the BBC. It is slightly more connected, engaged.\" It is also a result of new technology, using Big Brother-style fixed rig cameras that allows producers to put 100 in a police station and record 24/7. The technology will be used again in a four-part series following a rural African tribe in Ethiopia. Lee is now searching for where else it can be used. \"It's a question we ask ourselves all the time,\" he says. A doctor's surgery, a frequent suggestion, was rejected as too boring, while he admits The Model Agency, an eight-part Channel 4 series in 2011, \"didn't really work because not enough happened in that space to engage viewers\". A theme he is keen to explore is the impact of the internet and social media on society, the focus of The Secret Life of Students earlier this year. If it was only partly successful, Channel 4 will return to the topic with Teens, about a dozen 17-year-olds' digital lives. Educating the East End, the third in its Educating \u2026 series, is suffering diminishing returns, with 1.2 million viewers last week compared with the 3 million-plus overnight audience of Educating Yorkshire. Lee says the latest series has another 40-45% viewing on catch-up but admits it might not have the characters of Educating Yorkshire. \"Maybe for a national audience London isn't as attractive.\" Nevertheless, a fourth series has already been commissioned (presumably outside the capital). Gogglebox, one of C4's biggest recent hits, has settled into its new Friday night slot, with a celebrity special, part of the Stand Up To Cancer night, watched by 3.5 million viewers earlier this month. Lee hints at a possible permanent return for a celebrity edition. \"Who knows?\" he says. \"It would have to continue to feel quite natural, I wouldn't want people to start seeing it as a performance vehicle.\" Mariella Frostrup's series Sex Box was less successful, possibly the least sexy show ever about sex on television. \"We are still debating [whether it will come back],\" says Lee. \"Views internally are very split about it. The Americans made it and they were less hung up about it, with the host constantly cracking jokes. Maybe what we discovered is that people really don't want to talk about sex in this country.\" A new commission, How Rich Are You?, will be presented by Richard Bacon, part of a season of programmes about the wealth divide in Britain. But it is the return of Skint, and associated programmes next year, that will generate the biggest debate, not least on Twitter where the first series of Benefits Street prompted an outpouring of bile and threats against some of its contributors. How much does a broadcaster such as C4 have to take responsibility for the social media response to its programmes? \"I think it's one of the most complex, evolving and emerging areas around the ethics of documentary making,\" says Lee. \"You can't let the few extreme voices stop you from making things. Twitter can't have a chilling effect on what we do and most of it is hot air,\" he adds. \"If there are specific threats, or accusations that are defamatory, there is obviously a protocol in place. It has become part of our normal practices now.\" Curriculum vitae Age: 44 Education: Whitgift School, Croydon.
