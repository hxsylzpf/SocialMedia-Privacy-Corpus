  "content": "Hootsuite will soon allow users to schedule and manage paid social media marketing across their channels, Ryan Holmes, CEO, has told the Guardian. Following a $60m (\u00a337m) funding injection from US asset managers, disclosed last week, Hootsuite CEO Ryan Holmes said he was ready to expand the software's capabilities. Over the next 12 months, Holmes said, the company would be working on introducing features that will help users to buy social advertising across all of their social networks, directly from the dashboard and informed by Hootsuite's analytics. He added: \"We're looking at social advertising and how we can help our customers more with advertising and social. We're able to tell people which messages at which time of day are the most successful for them, how viral these messages are, and [how] we can help in the future. We're going to build a product that can help them double-down on the successful ones through social advertising.\" Holmes argued that the move was a significant development for social media, comparing it to the \"freemium\" model applied by Google to paid search marketing (pay-per-click or PPC). He said: \"Where initially there was organic search, content was put on Google and ultimately free, and then there became a market for a paid search, all thinking about how you get your content to the top of the stack. I think we're going to be able to really successfully help our customers amplify the message they need through social advertising.\" Hootsuite operates a \"freemium\" model, in which a free version with restricted functions is available alongside paid-for versions with more expansive functions. Holmes said that such social advertising innovation led him to consider paid products in a similar way to the way in which content is currently surfaced with Hootsuite's \"suggested content\" function in beta testing, scheduled and managed from the Hootsuite software. He explained: \"We as an organisation are looking at managing products for payment in social and I think that there may be an opportunity for us to help manage your products that are for sale, and multiple social sales, in the same way we help manage content in social channels; why not think about organising product sales for payment and for purchasing across social channels? I think that's definitely an interesting opportunity, and so we're looking more deeply into that.\" He added that \"scheduling of paid product will play down the road\" of introducing mobile (digital) payments and e-commerce functionality to the Hootsuite dashboard. \"Mobile payment, I think there is an opportunity for us there, and I think that's going to be a huge market,\" he added. Holmes claims that Hootsuite is currently the \"best of breed social relationship platform\": \"If you look at our products right now, we have a publisher product, an engagement product, analytics and campaigning, at some point we have this publisher product,\" he says, \"and it is highly likely we will build an e-commerce or shopping product tailored towards management of e-commerce in shopping.\" With the most recent acquisition of Zeetl \u2013 a social telephony company that Hootsuite plans to integrate into its platform to enable sales and support teams to communicate more rapidly with their customers \u2013 Holmes is positioning Hootsuite in competition with CRM (customer relationship management) providers like Salesforce. He said: \"At some point, if we end up in the CRM space and competing with Salesforce more directly (we're already competing with them on the marketing and social cloud) we're happy to go there.\" Holmes said businesses of all sizes were less sceptical and now \"fully convinced that [social media] is important, relevant and here to stay\". Consequently, Holmes said every external-facing role within an organisation is going to need to be part of social, from marketing through to sales, support teams, PR, HR and company management. Holmes's vision is for Hootsuite to be the integral software as a service (SaaS) to achieve this. Having secured a total of $250m in funding to date and with a strategic roadmap that covers \"three Ts \u2013 technology (innovations and acquisitions), talent (a hiring spree) and traction (including greater penetration of UK and European markets) \u2013 is the next step an IPO (initial public offering; stock market launch)? Holmes said: \"We are building what looks like a public company, putting all the best practices such as governance, financial safeguards and other things in place. If and when it makes sense early next year or beyond we'll absolutely head in that direction, but we're not in a rush.\" While Holmes says he doesn't feel \"like anyone is really breathing down our necks\", the risk for Hootsuite in this competitive, fast-moving market is that an equally well-financed CRM provider goes head-to-head with Hootsuite in this new, centralised social selling and e-commerce space. Holmes said: \"We have pole position in the market. I feel that if we take the throttle off then it opens an opportunity for people to try to catch us up. So we want to just completely put the throttle down and continue to offer the very best of breed of product in the market.\" Anna Lawlor is content creator and co-director of boutique media communications agency, Social i Media.
