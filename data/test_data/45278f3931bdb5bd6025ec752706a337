  "content": "A growing number of people are claiming \"the right to be forgotten\" online - but removing your online profile from the internet isn't always easy as you'd think. Charles Arthur, editor of Guardian technology, says: \"You shouldn't put anything online you don't want to be visible to everyone forever. You can try to get stuff removed \u2013 and you might be lucky enough to succeed \u2013 but all someone has to do when they see a photo or web page is to copy the image or do a screenshot of the page, and that's your deletion efforts wasted.\" The Guardian is investigating online profiles and deletion processes and we want to hear from those who have experience in trying to disappear from the web. Do you think sensitive personal data about yourself is too readily available online? Have you tried to delete your social media activity that is no longer relevant? Or have you tried to have press coverage about yourself erased? Share your experiences with us anonymously by filling in the form below. You can also contact our news team directly by emailing mark.rice-oxley@guardian.co.uk or owen.bowcott@guardian.co.uk."
