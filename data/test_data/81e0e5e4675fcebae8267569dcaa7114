  "content": "Of course not. If you are weak-willed enough to believe that \u2013 or if your manager is, and has therefore cut off your access to the social network \u2013 then consider a few facts. The \"survey\" that came up with that number was carried out, as Mike Butcher of TechCrunch Europe has noted, by a company that makes staff-monitoring equipment. It has an interest in selling things to companies to stop their staff \"wasting\" money by \u2013 allegedly \u2013 spending 40 minutes a week on social media. If the company (which we won't name) succeeds in selling some of its equipment to anyone as a result of the survey, then that will be a net gain for the UK economy through its sales. So Twitter won't have lost the economy money \u2013 why, it'll have generated some, though one would have to offset that against lost productivity through not being able to contact customers, clients and others through the social network. But the economic justifications for Twitter go well beyond selling slightly spooky monitoring equipment. Louis Halpern, CEO of the digital marketing agency Halpern Cowan, thinks that idea that time on social media sites is \"wasted\" is nonsense: \"The first step to getting a return on investment from the time employees spend on social media is to empower them to use social media to help their business,\" he said in response to the \"survey\". \"A company's employees are its most effective advocate, and can directly sway the opinion of customers and stakeholders\u2009\u2026\u2009Customers will only continue to buy if they feel good about the service they're receiving, which staff actively posting positive sentiment online can impact directly.\" Sometimes, naturally, the use of social media goes awry. Halpern acknowledged as much when discussing the recent case of Dixons Store Group staff being abusive about customers on Facebook. But with companies such as Dell and JetBlue recording millions of dollars in sales through Twitter, it's clear that the network has value; and newspapers find it useful in contacting sources, getting readers to their site and even, occasionally, helping overturn injunctions \u2013 the latter service being hard to price but definitely socially valuable. The fear that employees let loose on the internet will waste time is as old as Sir Alan Sugar, who thought it had \"obvious disadvantages\" when used by web-surfing staff and that it could \"all go pear-shaped\". (He did answer his own emails, though.) The reality though is that people at work have always found ways to waste time. The key problem for managers remains, as ever, finding ways to make them like their work enough not to. In that respect, non-work use of Twitter and Facebook and the rest aren't the disease; they're the symptom."
