  "content": "Florida is infamous for its weird news stories. But according to natives, a 12ft-long American alligator's cameo during a leisurely golf game isn't one of them. Photos of a massive gator lounging near the 7th hole at Myakka Pines Golf Club in Englewood, Florida, quickly went viral after they were posted on the club's Facebook page this week, sparking debates over whether the photos were yet another viral hoax or actual proof of giant dinosaurs coming to take over the world. Online, Floridians vouched for the photos being authentic (as did the golf club), if a bit mundane \u2013 with many saying that sightings of the prehistoric reptiles in populated areas are not all that rare. \"This happens like every week down there \u2026 Florida is short for alligators,\" one user wrote in a thread on Reddit. Mickie Zada, Myakka's general manager, said gator encounters on the 27-hole course are so common that the club instituted special rules for when they interfere with a golf game \u2013 if a gator is on the green, \"don't go up there!\" but instead take two putts. \"It's impossible to play 18 holes and not see at least one alligator,\" Zada said. \"When you're in Florida, you're going to see alligators.\" The club is situated on open land without a house for miles near the swampy Everglades, making it a haven for the imposing creatures. This internet-famous gator isn't even the course's biggest member \u2013 a massive 15-16ft gator nicknamed Big George previously called the club home for more than a decade. With temperatures warming, the odds of spotting an alligator are even higher than usual, as the animals are on the move looking for new territory and mates after winter, Gary Morse, a spokesman for the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commision's south-west region said. Morse declined to speculate on the creature's weight, saying that photos can be misleading, but said there's \"no doubt\" that it's a male, given its size. It's not an unusual sight, he said, particularly given the course's proximity to Myakka River State Park, where visitors can go on boat tours to see gators in the wild. \"There are alligators in just about every freshwater body of water in the state,\" Morse said. \"It's only unusual to people who are new to Florida, and don't quite understand how common they are.\" Despite the prevalence of alligators, the number of attacks on humans each year is extremely low, and the club has never had an attack during its 37 years in business. While the club's viral fame hasn't caused a noticed uptick in business yet, Zada said tee times are fully booked up, with a few requests for memberships coming in. Zada also had a brush with the internet's capriciousness, saying she routinely posts golfers' photos of the wildlife they encounter online. \"Our page has hundreds of alligators. I don't know why this one went viral,\" she said."
