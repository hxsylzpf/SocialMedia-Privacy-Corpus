  "content": "Instagram has apologised after it handed control of a Spanish user's account over to a Barcelona football player with the same name. Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, from Madrid, is the holder of the @ainiesta Instagram account. Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, from Fuentealbilla, is the captain of Barcelona football club. The former Iniesta woke up on Wednesday to find that access to his Instagram account was blocked. The app gave him a message saying it had \"deactivated his account because it infringes our conditions of use\" \u2013 and then, two days later, his friends started noticing updates from the footballer on their feed. \"A couple [of] days later, other followers reported that suddenly Andr\u00e9s Iniesta the football player appeared on their 'following' list,\" Iniesta wrote on Medium. \"And they don't even like football!\" By this point, Iniesta had contacted Instagram three separate times, and received no response. So he took to Medium in despair. \"What pains me is that all of this has happened without any explanation, not even a twitter response from Instagram,\" he wrote. \"I'm not a celebrity, and I don't want to be one. I just don't like things being taken away from me.\" Five hours after posting on medium, the company relented, and returned his account to him. Later still, Instagram provided a short statement, and, finally, an apology. \"We made a mistake here and restored the account as soon as we learned about it. Our apologies go out to Mr Iniesta for the trouble we caused him,\" the company told Gizmodo. As for the significantly wealthier Iniesta, he's returned to Instagram, on his own account this time. It already has 5.4 million followers."
