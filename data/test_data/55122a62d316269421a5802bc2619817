  "content": "Newspapers can no longer be trusted to regulate themselves, Guardian reporter Nick Davies told the Leveson inquiry into press standards. Davies, who broke the phone-hacking story that led to the closure of the News of the World in July, said: \"I don't think this is an industry that is interested in or capable of self-regulation. The history of the [Press Complaints Commission] undermines the whole concept of self-regulation.\" The reporter told Lord Justice Leveson at the high court in London that the PCC's report into the Guardian's phone-hacking revelations two years ago was \"terrible\". \"Just an awful piece of work. [Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger] said it was worse than useless and that was an understatement,\" Davies said. Davies added the report was one of the factors that finally convinced him self-regulation of the press does not work. \"You have got a huge intellectual puzzle here\", he told Leveson. \"How do you regulate a free press? It obviously doesn't work. We're kidding ourselves if we think it would because it hasn't.\" Davies added the PCC is designed with the interests of the newspapers in mind. \"No system that is designed within that shape is going to succeed and be stable. It has to take account of the victims of the media. That's the crucial first step,\" he said. \"We have to stop only thinking about the freedom of the press and build a satisfactory way for those people to get remedy.\" The Guardian investigative journalist said apologies should be published as prominently as the articles in which incorrect or damaging information originally appeared. \"If I publish something which falsely damages somebody's reputation, what they deserve is a correction of equal prominence not the PCC's weasel words: 'due prominence',\" he said. Davies also argued that complaints about libel or defamation should be resolved by arbitration without recourse to the courts. \"I'd want an arbitration system that's quick. I would put a statutory deadline on in,\" he said. Under such a system, he said, newspapers could be required to respond to a complaint within four weeks. He used the example of Kate and Gerry McCann, who took libel action against the Daily Express and Associated Newspapers, to illustrate the advantages of such a system. \"The Daily Express has to put [an apology] on their front page. They don't get damages. I don't think they wanted damages,\" he said. He also said he would like to see a statutory body established to advise newspapers on whether stories could be justified in the public interest. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
