  "content": "For months it has fulminated against the consequences of laptops left in taxis and CDs lost in the post. But journalists employed by Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, have now received letters warning them to contact their bank after a company laptop with their personal details was stolen. The letters went out to journalists and other freelancers employed by Associated, which also publishes the Mail on Sunday and Metro, and regional newspaper publisher Northcliffe. Both are owned by parent company Daily Mail &amp; General Trust. Those affected were told their name, bank account number and sort code had been lost. The letter, from the group finance director, Simon Dyson, also advised them to consult a government identity theft website for advice. He apologised for any annoyance and inconvenience, saying the \"incident was inadvertently caused by a technical issue\". But the incident provoked an angry response from some of those affected, particularly freelance employees who had not worked for the company for some time. Laurence Clark, whose wife, Susan, had a contract to distribute freesheets on the south coast, said they received a warning letter. \"They still have information on file a year after we finished work for them ... They shouldn't be hanging on to information this long and then losing it.\" A spokeswoman for DMGT confirmed a computer containing confidential information was stolen last week. \"The password-protected computer contained limited information on some current employers and suppliers from the group's newspaper division ... DMGT has contacted all those affected and apologised.\"",
