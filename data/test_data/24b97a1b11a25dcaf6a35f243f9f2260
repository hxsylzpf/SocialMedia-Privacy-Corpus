  "content": "As the first ChatRoulette video goes viral on YouTube and shoots to the top of the chart, one online trend meets another. Pianist Merton \u2013 or is it Ben Folds? \u2013 accompanies his webchats with improvised songs, until he breaks down with laughter. As it is common on ChatRoulette, he is slightly disguised with a hoodie. Do you want to know what he sees? Check it out. There's nothing too outrageous, but a few swears here and there... Once upon a time, Facebook was a world in which you could be cool according to your rules. Then came the brands. Well, that didn't matter so much. But then work-related people you don't really know wanted to be friends with you. Those people could go to LinkedIn. But what do you do when your mum or dad sends you a friend request? Here is your song! Wouldn't it be nice, if we could press a button to slow down reality and watch how things really move? Until this button is installed, we can at least watch films shot with a high-speed camera that captures more than 1,000 frames per second. This one here shows that dogs can really look gorgeous in slo-mo, and it's no wonder that this Pedigree video went viral. By the way, this is where they had the idea from: the music video that French digital artists Pleix created in 2006 for Birds by Vitalic. 1 ChatRoulette Funny Piano Improv #1 Chap in hoodie switches on ChatRoulette to sing about what he sees. Media Monkey thinks it might be Ben Folds. What do you think? 2 My Mom's on Facebook Brilliant! LA-based Backoftheclass sing you a hair metal anthem. If you like it, look at this version, too. 3 Leprechaun in Mobile, Alabama After Charlie Brooker and The Onion made fun of the news, NBC hits back with this report about a leprechaun. 4 Lady Gaga - Telephone (Official Explicit Version) ft. Beyonc\u00e9 Great piece of art. No, I am serious. 5 Pedigree Dogs ad shot 1000 FPS using the Phantom camera Dogs turn headscatching treats in slow-mo. 6 Mega64: The Beatles Rock Band Oh, dear. The Beatles jump out of their Rock Band game to enter the real world. Mega64, a low-budget comedy group centered on video games are taking them out. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 7 The Future of Publishing - created by DK (UK) Inspired by Lost Generation, in this video a young girl explains how it sees the world, and you have to watch it till the end for full understanding. The statements about the future of publishing were produced for the UK branch of Penguin books. 8 NASA | Surprise Shrimp Under Antarctic Ice Well, hello! As it pulls up its camera, Nasa finds a small orange shrimp-like creature more than 12 miles away from open water. 9 Jay Park-Nothing on you (cover) What do you do today if you leave a fairly successful Korean boy band? You install a webcam in your corridor, sing, and post it on YouTube. 10 Kevin Butler \"Moves\" from the FUTURE PlayStation introduces a feature we already know from the Wii except that it uses a camera, so they made a viral clip to promote it to their target group.
