  "content": "Age: 73. Appearance: Surprisingly undecomposed. Poor man. He wasn't very funny but he had a lot of fans. I hope Camille and the kids are bearing up. He's not dead! He is! It was all over Twitter. It doesn't get much clearer than \"Bill Cosby died.\" It's still not true. Cosby himself went online earlier this week to set the record straight. What did he say? \"Rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated, lol\"? Nothing so predictable. \"I'm rebuttaling rumours about my demise,\" he tweeted. Are you sure that was America's best-loved comedian? It sounds more like Sarah Palin. He was using the word \"rebuttal\" in an ironic sort of way. How do you know? Because when Cosby first \"rebutalled\" something, in February, the pedants were kind enough to correct him. \"I don't care,\" he said, \"because I'm alive.\" What was he denying then? That he wasn't alive, of course. This is the fourth time the rumour has broken out, and Cosby doesn't think it's an accident. \"Emotional friends have called about this misinformation,\" he complained the other day. \"To the people behind the foolishness, I'm not sure you see how upsetting this is.\" Why do they pick on Cosby? Is it comedians they don't like, or just overrated ones? Cosby's not the only victim. Other supposedly dead but very much alive celebrities include Justin Bieber, Britney Spears, Eminem, Kanye West, George Clooney and Tom Cruise, as well as Johnny Depp, Russell Crowe, Jeff Goldblum, Matt Damon and Natalie Portman. And Elvis. Don't be ridiculous. Elvis's \"death\" wasn't a cruel internet hoax \u2013 it was a cunning scheme to escape the burdens of fame. Shut up for a minute. I've just heard some terrible news. What's that? Britney's dead! She isn't! She is! I read it in the Guardian. Do say: \"The important thing is that he's still with us.\" Don't say: \"Do you think I can get my money back on this wreath?\""
