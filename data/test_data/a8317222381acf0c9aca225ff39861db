  "content": "If FOMO, or Fear of Missing Out, is the definitive malaise of today's smartphone-touting masses, then Snapchat is its ultimate totem. The app shot to global fame (and its current $15bn valuation) by allowing users to share photos with each other \u2013 complete with emojis and scrawled annotations \u2013 that vanish seconds after being viewed. Cue an avalanche of dick pics and instant notoriety. But, while other sleaze-friendly services such as Chatroulette swiftly receded, Snapchat attracted plenty of non-X-rated fans too, with its \"stories\" function. This lets users cobble together stills and videos into a jump-cut short film, which can be watched for 24 hours before evaporating into the digital ether. For most people it's just another platform to broadcast their consumption of liquified kale or sunkissed workouts captioned #strong #blessed. But Snapchat also gives addictive glimpses into the lives of rich and famous users \u2013 and it's superstar DJs who have embraced it most enthusiastically. Whether it's Diplo cruising around the Florida everglades in a speedboat, Calvin Harris riding an inflatable flamingo in a swimming pool, or Afrojack making appreciative noises about Lamborghinis, Snapchat sucks you into the lives of monied, turned-up party-starters. Chief among them is Dillon Francis. \"It's your own reality TV show, without having to spend any money,\" says the LA producer. \"There are people who will literally watch you make a cup of coffee. I did a Snapchat after I got this new crazy coffee siphon thing. People were tweeting me saying, 'Hey man, thanks so much for showing me how you make coffee.'\" \"Little kids are like, 'I want to go be a DJ!'\" adds Francis, sounding a little worried. \"You have nightclubs for kids, and that is so sad. What have we done to the world? Kim Kardashian, me, Calvin Harris ... People want to see into the life.\" He says that fans no longer take selfies with phone cameras, but with Snapchat. For Francis, the app wasn't immediately interesting. \"Everyone was using it to get nudes, and that's clearly what I did. Then some dude sent me a picture of his nuts and I was like, OK, this app is not for me any more.\" He returned once the \"stories\" function was launched, allowing him to make streams of Snapchats full of the kind of invented characters (bewigged Australian surfers, moustachioed rednecks). Some of these ad hoc comedy sketches are funny, some miss the mark \u2013 but crucially, Snapchat doesn't have comments or feedback from users, so Francis never needs to hear any unkind reviews. \"It's a safe haven,\" he says. \"The internet, it's a cool place, but, holy shit, it feels like 60% hate out there.\" With Snapchat on the other hand, \"no one can have an angry argument about it. It's just there.\" This is the chief benefit for another superstar Snapchatter, Swedish EDM producer Alesso. \"Everyone who posts work online, they get so criticised, it's crazy. On any Instagram or YouTube video, there's more hate than positive feedback. That's why I like Snapchat \u2013 you don't get judged.\" He became the first DJ to debut a music video with the service, and will post bursts of live sets or studio sessions. Francis also talks up this aspect: \"It's a really good way of premiering something. You get the tiniest amount of the song, the highlight, so no one has to listen to the rest of it \u2013 yet!\" Snapchat is now facing competition from livestreaming apps such as Periscope, which allow users to broadcast their lives in real time. But, for Francis, the ephemerality of Snapchat means it will survive. \"I like that a Snapchat is going to be gone for ever. If you say to someone, 'Hey man, I'm going to be doing a livestream \u2013 don't worry though, it's going to be archived,' who's going to want to watch it? It's just sitting there waiting to be watched, and there's no way of making it feel important.\" For Alesso, Snapchat's ephemerality is freedom from Instagrammed perfection. \"I don't have to think that much when I'm on Snapchat,\" he says happily. \"I can just be going for a walk \u2013 not a big thing, but it's still entertaining.\" So for the DJs, Snapchat is a more benign and creative platform than other social networks. For their followers, though, it's a double-edged sword. Yes, it allows them a previously undreamed of intimacy, but it's also frustrating: the portal opens, you get a 24-hour taste of a millionaire lifestyle, and then it snaps shut again. The same cycle of aspiration and dissatisfaction that powers lifestyle magazines is what also drives Snapchat. As Francis says: \"The kids feel closer to you, but in reality they're just watching a video, and thinking they are. Because you're on the other side of the world.\""
