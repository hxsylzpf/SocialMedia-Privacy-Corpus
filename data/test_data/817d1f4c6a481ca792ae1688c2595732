  "content": "Lord Wakeham, the chairman of the press complaints commission, has warned the 1998 Human Rights Act is threatening the self-regulation of the British press. He described two recent injunctions, which have been made under the act, as \"very disturbing developments\" that could introduce a de facto national privacy law and undermine the power of the regulator. Lord Wakeham said an injuction, brought against the Manchester Evening News last June by Michelangelo and Rina Attard, was a \"worrying precedent\". Mr and Mrs Attard were the parents of conjoined twins whose plight made the headlines last year. The 1998 Human Rights Act incorporates the European Convention of Human Rights, which contains a \"right to privacy\" and has aroused concerns that press freedom might be affected. But Lord Wakeham today said a number of safeguards, which were brought in to protect the power of the PCC following the introduction of the act, could be bypassed by the courts. In the case of Mr and Mrs Attard, the Manchester Evening News - part of the Guardian Media Group - was prevented from publishing photos of their daughter, Gracie, because a high court judge deemed their publication was in breach the code. One of the safeguards contained on the Human Rights Act states injunctions could only be granted if the courts had taken into account such factors as the importance of the freedom of expression and compliance to the PPC code. Lord Wakeham said the court's interpretation of the code was different to that of the PCC. The PCC ruled that Mr and Mrs Attard had compromised their child's right to privacy by agreeing to sell photos of her to rival newspapers. \"When the government introduced section 12 of the Human Rights Act, it made clear the importance of the newspaper industry's own self-regulation, and of the PCC, rather than the courts in establishing whether or not the code was breached,\" said Lord Wakeham. He added such a \"perfunctory\" interpretation of the 10-year-old code posed a threat to the PCC's authority. \"There is great potential danger if the courts seek to place themselves in the position of the commission, especially if they are granting injunctions restraining publication on the basis of an interpretation of the code which can only be, at best, perfunctory,\" he explained. Lord Wakeham said a recent injunction brought by a professional footballer against the Sunday People, which was set to print a kiss-and-tell expose of his marital infidelities, was an \"unacceptable infringement\" on press freedom. \"There seems to be great weight in the argument of those who say the injunction is an unacceptable infringement on press freedom and freedom of expression,\" he said. He added: \"This is not a precedent that can be allowed to stand\" and called for the issues to be resolved by the court of appeal, which will hear the case against the injunction next month. The PCC chairman said the Human Rights Act had not been as big a threat to self-regulation as had been expected. However, Lord Wakeham said \"full force\" must be given to the proper functioning of the sections of the act that cover the PCC's autonomy. \"A tough and effective system of self regulation... will continue to be the best way of maintaining press freedom,\" he said."
