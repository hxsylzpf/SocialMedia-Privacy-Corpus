This takes the social engineering route of telling you that your Flash player is out of date, and asks you to download an update. It lies. It's an attempt to install the Koobface worm, which only affects Microsoft Windows. For details, see Koobface remains active on Facebook or W32/Koobface.worm Don't install it: just delete the email. If you did install it, you need to run anti-virus software to remove it. Apparently, a similar attack is being made on MySpace users.",
