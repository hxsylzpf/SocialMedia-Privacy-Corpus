  "content": "Taxi Driver 2. Godfather Part 4. Jaws 6. These are the great movie reunions the world has been breathlessly awaiting. Now, to add to Scorsese and de Niro, Coppola and Pacino, and Spielberg and that rubber shark, we can add the names of Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels and the Farrelly brothers. A tweet from Daniels \u2013 who, incidentally, has just won an Emmy award for The Newsroom \u2013 has brought with it an on-set picture to mark the start of shoot for Dumb &amp; Dumber To. Forget the misbegotten Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd, the 2003 \"prequel\" - this is the real deal. The stars have aligned: for some reason, the Farrelly brothers have nothing better on than to revisit their 1994 debut, while Carrey \u2013 not exactly washed up, but considerably less ubiquitous than a decade ago \u2013 has found time in his busy schedule of kiddie book writing. Ironically, it's Daniels who appears to have the least reason to do it: what with his white-hot TV presence, and sense that he was relatively dispensable first time around. (Hence the casting of Randy Quaid in the Daniels-esque bozo role in the Farrellys' followup, Kingpin.) Still, it's all good for D&amp;D mavens, as the project looked dead earlier this year, after the poor performance of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, in which Carrey had a small role; Warner Bros bailed, but Universal stepped in. Peter Farrelly gave some plot details to Digital Spy in 2012 \u2013 \"the story revolves around the fact that one of them may have sired a child. They want to go and find the child because he's having a kidney problem and he wants to ask him for one of his kidneys\" \u2013 and some other key cast will be back, including Canadian ice hockey Hall of Famer Cam Neely, who played the thuggish Sea Bass in the original. The main thing is, it's bound to be funny, isn't it? After a 20 year break, there's no way the magic won't still be there. How much are you looking forward to it?"
