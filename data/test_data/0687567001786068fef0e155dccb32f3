  "content": "Despite yesterday's news that the UK is officially no longer in recession \u2013 by a whopping 0.1% \u2013 there are still a lot of people looking for work. However, with human resource departments using social media, tracking down vacancies has been made easier \u2013 even more so with the launch of an application tracking jobs advertised on Twitter. The London-based company TweetDeck recently teamed up with the job search engine TwitJobSearch. Together they've created JobDeck, a version of TweetDeck that tracks recruitment news, and is indexing tweets containing job adverts. More than 360,000 jobs have been listed on Twitter in the past 30 days. \"Recruitment is quickly evolving and better tools to manage this shift are an essential part of any career management suite,\" says Howard Lee, the CEO of WorkDigital, the company behind TwitJobSearch. JobDeck is a custom-branded version of Tweetdeck. It is rolled out with pre-installed columns, for example listing 25 Twitter accounts of experts, or all the tweets from @TwitJobSearch. The search engine TwitJobSearch scans Twitter for job postings, and tags them according to job categories or location. Their knowledge is now integrated in the popular desktop application Tweetdeck that hands you a neat organisation of your Twitter feed, and integrates at the same time Facebook, MySpace and LinkedIn into one central application. TweetMYJOBS is another service that brings recruiters, hiring managers and jobseekers together. It is free for jobseekers, while recruiters get a 15 day trial. However, before you get involved check your Twitter account \u2013 background and all. 41% of UK's HR Managers have rejected a candidate as a result of their online profile, according to a study commissioned by Microsoft. Might be a good idea to make sure there's nothing there you wouldn't want potential employers to see ...",
