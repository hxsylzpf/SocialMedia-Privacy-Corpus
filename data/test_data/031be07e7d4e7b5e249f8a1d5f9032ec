  "content": "US security services accuse Russia of interfering in the US election (Trump meets with intelligence leaders after calling Russia case 'witch-hunt', 6 January), but in view of FBI director James Comey's bombshell only 11 days before the election \u2013 announcing that the FBI had discovered additional emails and was reviewing them to see whether they were related to its investigation into Clinton's handling of classified information \u2013 are we to assume he is also a Russian agent? John Green London \u2022 Loner, hacker supreme \u2013 forget Alisa Shevchenko (Young Russian denies she aided election hackers, 7 January), it's got to be Wasp (Lisbeth Salander). Paulette Phillips Bromley, Kent \u2022 Good for the pope (Go ahead and breastfeed in church, 9 January). Another benefit of breastfeeding, which would appeal to the pope, is that it can be an effective method of birth control, as long as breastfeeding remains exclusive and frequent. The activities of milk companies have inadvertently contributed to the population explosion, increasing the number of their potential customers. Peter Greaves London \u2022 Like Andy Croft (Letters, 9 January) I too have concerns about the Guardian's list of must-read books for 2017. It failed to take into account the growing market for self-published books, many of them of higher quality than so-called mainstream books. In particular, I suspect one bestseller is due to be out in October 2017: Corpse Roads of Cumbria by Alan Cleaver. Alan Cleaver Whitehaven, Cumbria \u2022 Had Peter Riocreux (Letters, 9 January) asked the good Dr Wiki for advice he would have learned that: \"The word broccoli comes from the Italian plural of broccolo, which means 'the flowering crest of a cabbage'.\" The internet can tell you a lot. John Presland Meres, Asturias, Spain  \u2022 I'm not sure about a broccolo, but I do know that a spaghetto is the last strand left on your plate. Jerry Stuart London \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com \u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters"
