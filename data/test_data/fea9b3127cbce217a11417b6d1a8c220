  "content": "Authenticity isn't an advertising tactic, it's an absolute. You have it, or you don't; by definition, you can't fake being real. Authenticity is also one of the golden rules for brands' use of social media. Advertising is a medium built for business. It's geared to selling creative visions of how brands wish to be seen. But social media was built for people \u2013 conversational media where brands don't just need character and values, but personality that is captured in every post they make or question they answer. So brands that present a personality that doesn't reflect the reality of people's experience of their products and services will, sooner or later, be found out and called out. It's a point well-understood by Aspall, the cider and vinegar maker, and the oldest family-run business in the current list of Britain's Coolbrands. Eight generations of the Chevallier family have made cider \u2013 or cyder as they prefer \u2013 at Aspall Hall in Suffolk, taking fruit from the surrounding orchards that were planted by the first in the line, Clement, in the 1720s. \"Our vision is that authenticity is everything: in the products we make, how we present them and the communication around them,\" said Henry Chevallier Guild, who runs Aspall with his brother Barry. \"We're very lucky that we have a long and rich heritage to bring into conversation. It's not the be-all-and-end-all; it just helps cement the position that everything we do is steeped in authenticity. \"None of the stories we tell are anything other than true. The products we take to market are products we genuinely believe in from a quality perspective. How we communicate has to reflect that.\" Digital as the future path of marketing But 287 years of family history and business heritage does not equal an unwillingness to change or embrace technology. Henry looks to Clement, the bewigged gent whose portrait adorns Aspall Cyder bottles, as the original innovator. Clement defied the conventional wisdom of the day by planting apple trees in the fertile farmlands of East Anglia \u2013 better known for wheat and barley \u2013 than in the West Country, with its tradition of cider-making. \"They thought he was mad until five years down the line they tasted his cider then thought: 'He's a shrewd old boy',\" said Henry. \"We've thought quite a bit about what he'd do if he was alive today: he'd be the first to embrace technology.\" So a business that saw the rise of the newspaper, the advent of radio, the birth of television and the internet age, sees digital as the future path for its marketing. Marketing consultant Polly Robinson was drafted to help Aspall rethink its approach six months ago. Now a new website is in the offing and a blog channel called 1728cyderhouse.com was launched in January to share recipes, dispatches from Henry's international travel and notes from the Aspall archive. A quieter approach to marketing Crucially, the brand and products are visible, but sales messaging is absent. The approach is pure content marketing and storytelling. The 1728cyderhouse blog gives depth to the Aspall story that can then be shared socially, whether on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. \"It's a quieter approach \u2013 it's getting to know people and make them feel they need to know us,\" said Polly, who is supported by a marketing team at Aspall of one full-time co-ordinator and two part-time colleagues. Henry added: \"You can have a good product that's taken to market in a clever commercial way \u2013 where the communication positions it in a way that makes people interested and want to buy it. \"But our mantra has always been that if a product doesn't have inherent quality, it will fail at some point. It may take a year; it may take five or 10. But it will fail at some point. \"So we're never going to spend money on the basis of persuading people 'You'll be cool if you drink this'. It has to be the Pavlov reaction, the subliminal 'Oooh, yum' reaction rather than 'Didn't I see an advert about that the other day?' \"The latter is transient and doesn't last very long.\" Three hundred years of perspective What's clear is that Aspall's 300-year perspective also liberates the brand from a sense of haste. They want to build relationships with an audience that ranges from aficionados to people looking for a drink as an accompaniment to food \u2013 or indeed, an ingredient. The company has built a loyal social following \u2013 6,545 followers on the main @Aspall Twitter account and 1,900 fans on Facebook. There is also a separate @AspallKnights Twitter account focused on the on-trade, the bars and restaurants that sell the company's range of ciders. \"We looked a year ago and saw that our communication had to be consistent with the products we are taking to market: the authenticity of voice had to be absolutely clear and no blurring of that,\" said Henry. \"We had a Twitter account for about six months before we tweeted and we quite enjoyed watching people asking 'When is Aspall going to tweet?' \"So we had a quite big following before we even said a word. But in 286 years, you don't get into too much of a hurry. \"If you couch everything in a 300-year paradigm, it's about doing it right, not in a hurry \u2013 holding back a little to understand the analytics and get the right team in place. \"Maybe a couple of years ago, I'd get anxious about getting things started. But the dichotomy of social media is that it's so instant, but to do it well, you really need to take your time to understand what success is and how you measure it, how do you follow up, how to you ensure that people are genuinely getting an authentic one-on-one interaction where they feel they own the brand experience? You can't rush that.\" Aspall's digital progress will be worth watching \u2013 not least its evolution as a brand that strives to convey an authentically human voice on social channels. \"I guess it comes back to what we want to achieve,\" said Henry. \"We want to be seen as an individual rather than just a brand \u2013 we want that individuality to come across.\" Paul Hill is content director at digital marketing agency Further To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, sign up free for Media Network membership.
