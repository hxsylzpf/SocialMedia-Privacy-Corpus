  "content": "Comment is free's homepage is not the only place you can read our articles, or talk to us about our work. For the past few years, we've also been engaging with you on various other platforms, and we're keen to keep the ball rolling. There are some exciting social media plans in Comment is free's immediate future, and we'd like to share them with you for your thoughts \u2013 and needless to say, your invaluable (if sometimes harsh!) feedback. As always, you can also email us (cif.editors@theguardian.com) if you want to share ideas with us. We're all ears. 1. Twitter When we launched our @commentisfree account more than three years ago, we wanted it to be a space in which readers felt they could reach out to us to share ideas for commissions, offer thoughts on our published articles and sometimes even pitch to us directly. We also wanted it to be approachable, with a \"human\" face \u2013 which is why I handled the account, sometimes with the help of other editors on the desk. Times have changed, Twitter's popularity exploded, and the micro-blogging site has quickly seen Guardian staff members join its rank (you can find a comprehensive list of Guardian accounts here). On Comment, most of us editors now have our own account (a list is available here), from where we tweet about our daily work, breaking stories or must-follow tweeters. Sometimes, we live tweet as we follow elections, watch Blue Planet or Newsnight, or go to a show. This growing number of accounts explains why we have decided to make the move from a @commentisfree account hosted by only one person to a desk-hosted one. Starting today, @commentisfree followers will not miss any of our stories: we will tweet all of our pieces for a more exhaustive timeline, but will also use it to commission pieces and find new contributors, ask readers for their help when we need it, and sometimes point out other unmissable journalism elsewhere. The account will be mainly hosted by three voices: @beckygardiner, Comment editor; myself, now @GuardianJessica; and Comment's community coordinator @bellamackie. 2. Facebook Our revamped Facebook page gives you a new place to read and share our articles, view our videos and debate with other Comment is free users. Once you like our page, a variety of stories will appear on your newsfeed, giving you the option of discussing them with your friends. We are interested to see how the conversation develops on Facebook, given the lack of anonymity. Will the debate be different? Help us to find out. 3. Tumblr Tumblr is huge in north America, and quickly blossoming in the UK. It is a platform that aggregates trends in visual, video and audio media. Think of it as the modern day scrapbook: a social sharing website on which users post their own content \u2013 especially photos \u2013 and are encouraged to \"reblog\" others (1). The Guardian already has a few Tumblr accounts: a main one, fashion and data to name a few. Here's our brand-new Comment account. Follow us! (1) with thanks to my Twitter followers @jearle, @samuelpalin, @benrobertsphoto and @katie_khan, who helped me define what Tumblr is \u2013 no small task. See how social media works!"
