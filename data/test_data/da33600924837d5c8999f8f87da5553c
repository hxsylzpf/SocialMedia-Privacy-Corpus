  "content": "You started competing in gymnastics for the Great Britain senior team in 2001, aged 16, and retired last year. How did technology change the sport? Oh, it grew and grew throughout my career. By the end, my coach, Amanda, would video my routine on an iPad and say, \"Look, this is where something's not quite right.\" Even down to the way my music was cut and composed. For the 2012 Olympics, we got permission to use Live and Let Die and this guy in Teesside tweaked it so that it went with my routine and the rules. You had a long career for a gymnast. Has the way injuries are treated improved? Before the Olympics, I lived with an ice machine for 12 weeks. It's called a Game Ready and it's basically a contraption that went round my leg and was then attached to a box with ice water in it. During the night, I had it on a setting so it was on for half an hour, off for an hour. It was constantly icing and compressing the knee throughout the night. Wasn't that really annoying? Everyone says that. When I first had it, it woke me up, but I turned all its sounds and lights off and eventually I got used to it. It's a bit of a strange one, but there weren't enough hours in the day to do all my rehab, all my training and get the amount of icing done. So it was a case of needs must. How often do you Google yourself? You need to ask my mum. She has Google alerts set up so that she can see what I'm doing and what news articles are coming through on me. She'll tell me, \"Have you seen you're in this?\" She knows what's going on in my life better than I do. What social media do you use? Facebook and Twitter. I don't have Snapchat or Instagram \u2013 those two are enough for me and they give me a platform to engage with my fans. I've got my own personal Facebook, but to be honest I don't use it that much. I tend to contact my friends by phone if I want to speak to them. Earlier this year, you had an unpleasant experience on Twitter where trolls hijacked a live Q&amp;A. Did that change your feelings towards the platform? Not at all. You're always going to get one or two messages that are pretty nasty or not quite right, but for every one or two nasty messages, I'm sent 100 really nice ones. You just have to learn to glaze over the ones that aren't so nice. Isn't that easier said than done? I'm quite lucky with my personality: I'm one of these people where if something's happened, it's been and gone; there's nothing you can do about it except move forwards. So I applied the same mentality to that. Not long after, you were involved in Safer Internet Day, which aims to \"create a better internet together\". Why did you want to do that? A lot of people rallied and supported me after the issues I had on Twitter, so I wanted kids to understand that it's not just them that get these messages. Everyone will get them and it's just a case of learning how to ignore them. I hope that children can see that I'm on their level and I've been through it myself. It's not a nice experience, but there are ways of getting through it. You are currently promoting LeapBand, a watch-style device for children which tracks their physical activity throughout the day. Gymnasts can start very young, of course, but can we start measuring these things too early? It's important kids get active and have fun and get into sport. Sometimes they can see it as a bit of a chore and it's not exactly the best way to spend their time, but a LeapBand engages them from a very young age and they don't necessarily realise they are doing a lot of exercise. And obviously most kids can work iPads and iPhones better than we can, so it's a great way to relate to it. What gadget would you like to see invented? Pressing a button so you can get from one place to another without having to travel. That'd save me so many hours a week. How do you kill time on those journeys at the moment? I love Candy Crush and I've got the Sky Go app, so I download box sets. I just started a new one called Unforgettable about a police officer who remembers everything and it helps her on crime scenes. I'm also reading a book called Catch Me at the minute about a serial killer. Those both sound quite dark\u2026 Yeah, sounds a bit morbid, doesn't it? But I love how they work it all out. I go into my own little world and come back out when we arrive somewhere. Beth Tweddle is a LeapBand ambassador (leapfrog.com)",
