  "content": "Twitter visualisations come in many forms, but IS Parade is arguably the most inventive yet. Start a 'parade' of tweets across your csreen either by keyword, or by Twitter ID. Use your own Twitter ID and you'll see a parade of your own followers, which is a bit of an ego boost at least... You can set up your own real-time parade by getting friends to tweet the same keyword, and then setting up a parade to follow it. Not the most fuctional Twitter tool yet, but it does draw you in. All done by a Japanese agency to promote Sharp's new IS series Android netbook/smartphone."
