  "content": "Today sees the launch of our new Twitter feed, http://twitter.com/guardian_sport. If you follow us you will receive breaking news, a selection of our best blogs, the odd exclusive, and what's coming up in the sports sections of the Guardian, Observer and theguardian.com roughly five to ten times a day. At least that's the plan. It may be we tweet too often or too little, or don't address some of the subjects you think we should. We're well aware that Twitter is a conversation, not a one-way broadcast, so please tweet us your thoughts, suggestions and questions. We'll do our best to respond, time permitting. In the next few months, we expect more our of journalists to be on Twitter. For now you can follow the Guardian's sports editor, Ian Prior, on http://twitter.com/ianprior, theguardian.com's sports editor, Sean Ingle, on http://twitter.com/seaningle, theguardian.com's deputy sports editor and sometime funny man, Barry Glendenning, on http://twitter.com/bglendenning, our sports news correspondent, Owen Gibson, on http://twitter.com/owen_g, Danny Taylor, our Manchester football correspondent, on http://twitter.com/DTguardian, Barney Ronay on http://twitter.com/barneyronay, Paolo Bandini on twitter.com/Paolo_Bandini, John Ashdown on twitter.com/John_Ashdown and our tea-time football email, the Fiver, on http://twitter.com/thefiver."
