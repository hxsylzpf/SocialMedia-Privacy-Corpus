  "content": "The poor child got off lightly: she could just as well have been called Status, or even Poke. Instead an Israeli couple has named their daughter Like, inspired by Facebook to choose a name which, they explained, was \"modern and innovative\". Lior and Vardit Adler, who enjoy cooking, already have daughters named Dvash \u2013 Hebrew for honey \u2013 and Pie, as in the English apple pie. This time, Adler told the Israeli newspaper Maariv, he was looking for something more original, and had checked that nobody else in Israel had the same name. \"In our opinion it's the modern equivalent of the name Ahava [love],\" he explained. The joyful arrival of Like Adler was, inevitably, announced on Facebook, where her picture and name immediately received 40 approvals \u2013 or \"likes\" \u2013 and when the BBC picked up the story, scores more. Martin Bolanos posted: \"Heey Like! what a cute name you have! greetz from Denmark :) I just found an article from a Danish internet newspaper :-) You have made into a Danish newspaper! You are so famous! Wish you a perfect future!\" Stefan Schafer added: \"Greetings from Germany. Nice baby cool name. Much better idea than that 'dotcom' guy some years ago!\" The proud father was delighted. \"Considering that I have only a little more than 100 friends on the network that's a lot.\" Celebrities have led the pack in inflicting gruesome names on their children. David and Victoria Beckham's sons Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz seem conventional compared with David Bowie's son Zowie Bowie, now a distinguished film director who prefers to be known as Duncan Jones. The singer Donovan fathered Astrella Celeste and Oriole Nebula, and Katie Price (aka Jordan) and her then husband Peter Andre produced Princess Tiaamii. Fifi Trixibelle and Peaches Geldof still bear their names with pride, while Apple, child of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, may yet discover that fruit are not the only names."
