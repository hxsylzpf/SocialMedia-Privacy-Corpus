  "content": "This week, in events more meta than any David Lynch film, the internet is full of chat about how the internet is full. Overflowing. Unable to cope. Creaking under the weight of Jaden Smith's Capitalised Philosophical Tweets: Of course, the internet isn't really full, as the Guardian's Samuel Gibbs explained, but it's also not the first time this fear has arisen. We like to read about how the internet might come to an end in the same way that when we're letting the cat out, we sometimes imagine \u2013 just for a split second \u2013 that the loveable furball may never come back. This is a brief entertainment phenomenon known as \"what-if grief tourism\". (It's not \u2013 I just made that up, but you know what I mean.) But would it really be that bad if the internet did fall to its knees, collapsing into a puddle of crocodile clips and slashes and gifs of Beyonc\u00e9? Here are some of the things we wouldn't miss about it \u2026 Selfies that aren't even selfies People, ie our mothers and all politicians, need to work out what a selfie is. It's a photo one takes of oneself, not just a picture with you in it, for chrissakes. Kim Kardashian #Sorrynotsorry People \"holding the sun\" The younger, even more annoying sibling of the \"leaning against the leaning tower of Pisa holiday snap\". People quoting everything Marilyn Monroe ever said and then mocking it up in Lucinda Calligraphy font on top of an over-saturated picture of a rose, thusly: The humblebrag I'm so blessed Twitter now has a mute function. Reply All emailers Can you take me out of this chain email please? What is this, 1998? Revenge porn Because some people are truly heinous. Pinterest competitiveness Pinterest = a modern-day equivalent of every WI meeting ever held. Fruitcake is supposed to last for a long time, that doesn't mean it's \"vintage\". Redecorating a one-bed in Walthamstow based on Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette does not a Wallpaper* feature make. Vaguebooking Please just stop."
