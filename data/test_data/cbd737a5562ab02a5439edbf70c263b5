  "content": "Hollywood superstars Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas will appear in person at the high court later this month in their battle to get compensation for photographs snatched at their wedding two years ago. Their decision to give evidence in their court case against Hello! magazine is expected to create the biggest media circus ever known at the royal courts of justice in the Strand. The golden couple are suing the magazine for millions of pounds for publishing \"surreptitious\" photographs of their wedding in New York in November 2000. Their move followed a landmark ruling by the court of appeal, which for the first time recognised that celebrities have rights to privacy. The couple had signed a \u00a31m deal with OK! magazine for exclusive pictures of their \u00a31.2m wedding - but rival Hello! hit the streets three days earlier than OK! with its own \"exclusive\" photographs of the stars at their wedding in the Plaza Hotel. It was claimed at earlier hearings that Hello! boss Eduardo Sanchez had his \u00a32m offer for exclusive rights turned down. The couple will claim at the trial, scheduled for January 27, that their private lives had been violated, causing them stress and loss of income from syndication rights. They will say their professional careers had been damaged because the photographs published by Hello! were of poor quality. Michael Tugendhat QC, representing the couple, told the vice-chancellor, Sir Andrew Morritt, at a preliminary hearing today that the couple would be present for the trial. The nearest parallel to a court visit from Hollywood royalty was in 1998 when Tom Cruise made an unexpected appearance at the settlement of a libel action. He and his then wife, Nicole Kidman, had sued the Express on Sunday magazine over a \"highly offensive\" article that alleged he was impotent and sterile. The star, who donated his damages settlement believed to be in excess of \u00a3100,000 to charity, was flanked by lawyers and police as he left court. Although he was mobbed as he left the building, mainly by female court staff, his appearance that day was not known about beforehand by the general public or media. In the same year, rock legend Bruce Springsteen won a victory over a record company which had tried to market some of his early recordings without his permission. And two years later the Spice Girls suffered a highly publicised defeat at the hands of Aprilia, the Italian motorcycle company they had sued for breach of contract over sponsorship fees. But both Springsteen, who was 50 when he appeared at the high court, and the Spice Girls, who by this time were without Geri Halliwell, were losing their international status as media magnets. There have also been visits by Naomi Campbell, Elton John, Robbie Williams and Kojak star Telly Savalas. But none could have the same massive attraction as Zeta-Jones and Douglas, two stars at the height of their careers. Today's hearing, expected to continue for several days, involves presentation of evidence for the trial, which is expected to last several weeks."
