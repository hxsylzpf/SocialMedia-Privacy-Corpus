  "content": "News Corporation will start offering video downloads on its recently acquired myspace.com as it focuses on creating \"more content and better content,\" said the chief executive, Rupert Murdoch. Speaking at a technology and media conference in Arizona, Mr Murdoch described the potential for News Corp's online businesses as \"enormous\", predicting revenues of $350-$400m by 2007. \"There will be millions of downloads a day probably,\" he told an audience at Citicorp's annual Entertainment, Media &amp; Telecommunications Conference in Phoenix without offering further details. He said myspace, which has around 47 million users and is growing at an estimated 1m a week, would form the kernel of News Corp's online activity, but added it would not necessarily develop in the same vein as Yahoo! or MSN, arguing that existing portals didn't reach enough under-25-year-olds. Describing new technology as an \"opportunity\", Mr Murdoch said broadband would bring more \"fragmentation and choice\". \"Big companies like ours must change, and we are preparing ourselves for that,\" he said, adding that the film business in particular could be affected. Commenting on the rising costs of making and marketing movies, Mr Murdoch predicted a growing number of filmmakers would start to release lower budget fare over broadband, charging customers $3-$4 to watch. The News Corp chief also said its US satellite TV business DirecTV would invest up to $1bn in entering the high-speed wireless broadband market. \"You'll be hearing from us within two months on a very clear plan on what will happen,\" he said. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
