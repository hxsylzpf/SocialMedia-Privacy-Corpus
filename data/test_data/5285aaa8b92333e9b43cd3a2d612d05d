  "content": "A judge has ruled tonight that a bid by former MP Iris Robinson to ban surveillance of her by journalists and the publication of her medical details must be held in private because of the dangers that Twitter and other social network sites could pose to her. Northern Ireland's lord chief justice, Sir Declan Morgan, said the development of Twitter and other related sites could mean her personal information leaking out from an open court even with reporting restrictions imposed. Sir Declan made the ruling because \"potential internet disclosure could increase the threat of self-harm or suicide\". In a judgment released on Tuesday evening, he stated that Iris Robinson's right to life under the European Convention on Human Rights meant her application for a long-term injunction must take place behind closed doors. Sir Declan, sitting in the Court of Appeal with lord justices Higgins and Girvan, said: \"We are satisfied that we should take judicial notice of the fact that social networking sites, Twitter and the internet generally now provides an alternative means of publication to traditional daily or Sunday newspapers.\" \"Although the numbers of persons to whom the publication is made may be considerably less than the circulation of a popular Sunday newspaper, publication on the internet is difficult to control and in particular the source of the publication may be outside the jurisdiction of the court.\" \"The hearing of the application will inevitably involve the discussion of aspects of the appellant's treatment and condition. \"We consider that there is a real danger that if these proceedings were open to the public, the information disclosed in the hearing would be disseminated on the internet, even if a reporting restriction was imposed.\" The wife of First Minister Peter Robinson left politics amid revelations about her extra-marital affair with a then teenage businessman. The former Strangford MP suffered severe mental ill-health and depression following revelations about her private life. She issued a writ for breach of confidence/misuse of private information, harassment and breach of her rights after the Sunday World newspaper published articles and photographs of her in London. She is also seeking an injunction to prevent future surveillance, photographs being taken of her while she receives medical treatment, and publication of information about her mental health. However, despite his court application she has been seen in public most notably back in May when the ex-MP accompanied her husband to the Queen's keynote speech at Dublin Castle during the four-day British Royal visit to Ireland. The Robinson family fear that her medical details are in the possession of some journalists."
