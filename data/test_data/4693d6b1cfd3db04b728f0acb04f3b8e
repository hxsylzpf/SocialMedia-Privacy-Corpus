  "content": "Amy Schumer has called out a 17-year-old film critic after he aimed a sexist tweet at her. Jackson Murphy, who runs review site Lights Camera Jackson, met Schumer at Sunday's Critics' Choice awards and tweeted a picture of the pair together. He added the caption: \"Spent the night with @amyschumer. Certainly not the first guy to write that.\" The tweet has since been deleted but Schumer responded with dismay: Murphy soon apologised claiming he thought she would \"like the joke\" and that he should leave the comedy to her in the future. Schumer later tweeted back: \"that's really okay honey. I just remember thinking you and your dad were sweet and it was a bummer to read that.\" It's not the first time Jackson has tried his hand at unfortunately aimed celebrity comedy. According to Vulture, the critic once tweeted a picture of himself with 12 Years a Slave star Chiwetel Ejiofor with the line: \"Happy birthday to my man Chiwetel Ejiofor. Don't be a slave to your diet \u2013 have some cake!\" Schumer also has a history of calling out journalists for their inappropriate jokes. Last summer, an interview went viral after an Australian radio host referred to the way her character dressed as \"skanky\". Schumer went on to give him a dressing down on camera. Schumer's night at the Critics' Choice awards resulted in her winning an MVP award for her banner year, centred around her hit comedy Trainwreck. She has a number of projects in development, including an action comedy produced by Paul Feig and a script she has co-written with Jennifer Lawrence."
