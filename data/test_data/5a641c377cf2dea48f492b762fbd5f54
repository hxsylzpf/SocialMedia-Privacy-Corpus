  "content": "Social media is awash with women highlighting President Donald Trump's sexist and misogynistic behaviour, and his apparent commitment to reversing hard-won women's reproductive rights. But how should those on social media, who are perceived as being in privileged positions, best assist those fighting to be heard? A tweet has the ability to catapult an important issue from obscurity into public consciousness, and inform news agendas around the world. Tilting the balance of power is arguably social media's most valuable asset. But who should own the debate, and how should it be reported? We'd like you to share your thoughts on how men can best support feminists, and women in general, on social media. Or maybe you're a man who works or supports equality campaigns and has advice for others. Share your thoughts on how to do it right by filling in the form below \u2013 anonymously, if you prefer \u2013 and we'll use a selection in our reporting. Or you can email: carmen.fishwick@theguardian.com"
