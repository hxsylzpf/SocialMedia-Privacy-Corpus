  "content": "LinkedIn, the social network for professionals, has launched a developers' platform and a customisable homepage to try and make its site more attractive to its influential business audience. From today, developers are invited to use a dedicated set of LinkedIn code to build tools and widgets for the site, allowing external sites to promote their services and share LinkedIn's audience. BusinessWeek.com is the first company to develop a LinkedIn application, introducing a tool that sits on its website and lists connections between the user and the companies and business people in its stories. LinkedIn's Intelligent Applications Platform is part of the philosophy of openness and information sharing that is part of web 2.0, said Liz O'Donnell, the international director of LinkedIn. Application programming interfaces, or APIs, such as the one launched by LinkedIn allow developers to build tools and services for websites. Flickr, Skype and Google Mail are some of the 10,000 applications now available within Facebook, for example, since it launched a similar developer platform in May. \"The overarching philosophy is to make LinkedIn a useful site on a regular basis for professionals,\" O'Donnell added. \"The network is the network whether it is on LinkedIn or not, and the spirit of openness allows information to go with a professional wherever they are.\" LinkedIn will only approve applications that it feels are relevant to its audience, said O'Donnell, because the site needs to stay efficient for its busy demographic. Though that is likely to be good news for Facebook users frustrated by zombie attacks and food fights, LinkedIn believes that most web users want one social network for their professional lives and one for their social lives and do not want to mix the two. Rather than locking information into one social networking site, LinkedIn aims to allow users to increase their productivity by sourcing new leads, service providers and recruiting within a vetted network. A revamped LinkedIn homepage invites users to customise jobs, contacts and discussion threads from its network and a community-ranked news link tool will be opened to the whole site in the new year. LinkedIn, which is only available in an English-language version, is also planning to launch localised versions in other countries in 2008. The site currently claims 17 million unique users each month internationally, with around 1 million in the UK. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
