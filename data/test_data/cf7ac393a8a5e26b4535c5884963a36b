  "content": "The failure of the courts to uphold a succession of celebrity cases has proved the self-regulation of newspapers is the only effective means of ensuring privacy rights, the press complaints commission declared today. The acting chairman, Professor Robert Pinker, admitted the PCC had been through a tough year but said a number of cases involving stars such as Naomi Campbell had the effect of \"buttressing self-regulation\". Reiterating what is now a PCC mantra, Professor Pinker stressed nine out of 10 people who complain to the commission are ordinary members of the public. \"The task of the PCC in the years ahead is to show that we continue to be up to the difficult challenge of balancing the protection of individual privacy with the public's right to know,\" he said in the PCC's annual review. \"It would be folly to seek to pretend that the months since the publication of the PCC's last annual review have been straightforward ones. \"But the mettle of an organisation such as the commission is to be found in the manner in which it conducts its day-to-day business - crucial to the general public - in turbulent times, as well as in calm seas.\" The PCC's comments come as the Mail on Sunday is seeking to overturn an injunction preventing it from revealing further details about TV presenter Angus Deayton's sex life. It referred to three celebrated privacy cases involving Campbell, Anna Ford and footballer Gary Flitcroft. Campbell withdrew her action against the Mirror on grounds of privacy and a court found the newspaper was justified in revealing she had not told the truth about her drug problem. Flitcroft's injunction against the Sunday People, to prevent the paper revealing embarrassing stories about his extramarital affairs, was overturned by the court of appeal, which backed up the PCC's line that celebrities who court publicity may compromise their right to privacy. Ford branded the PCC a \"pussycat\" after a high court judge upheld the commission's ruling that photographs taken with a telephoto lens of her sunbathing on a beach with her partner and children did not breach her privacy."
