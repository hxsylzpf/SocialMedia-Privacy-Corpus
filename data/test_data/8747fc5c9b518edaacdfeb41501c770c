  "content": "So, \"Facebook could die out\" (Report, 23 January). Many of us might welcome this but it's unlikely. Two engineers, John Cannarella and Joshua Spechler, predict this on the basis of declining searches for \"Facebook\" in Google and link this to a disease model of how innovations spread. For Facebook, a key question relates to \"network advantage\" \u2013 the attractions of the service given that so many others use it. Facebook has a lot going for it here. The disease model can be questioned; it's been popular ever since the father of research on word of mouth, Gabriel Tarde, wrote of \"contagion sociale\" in the 19th century. More recently, Malcolm Gladwell (in The Tipping Point) related shifts in fashion to epidemics. This inadequate account covers the way in which one convert conscripts new buyers (passes on the disease) but doesn't deal with the way in which conversation begets more conversation among existing users and thus increases conscription. I do not think social scientists have made great progress in this field but, if engineers want to help us, they need a better model than disease. Robert East Kingston Business School"
