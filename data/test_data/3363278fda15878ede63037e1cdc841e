Seemingly correcting a few minor bugs, version 3.4.4 fixed various problems that caused crashes, restored the send button for comments, chat and messages and the friends lists to the news feed filter. But, as Bernal discovered, \"change the UIDeviceFamily to 2 for iPhone on the Facebook app you get an iPad version!\". TechCrunch's MG Siegler had an intensive fiddle and pasted two dozen screen shots showing everything you might expect from a comprehensive Facebook iPad app. And to be fair, probably everything you could have expected from a Facebook app months ago. With the app this finished, you have to wonder what finishing touches are worth holding back for. Or, what kind of opportunity Facebook is looking for to time this launch.

The question now is how much longer it will take. \u2022 Meanwhile, some leaked photos of Facebook's brand new Californian headquarters have emerged on TechCrunch.
