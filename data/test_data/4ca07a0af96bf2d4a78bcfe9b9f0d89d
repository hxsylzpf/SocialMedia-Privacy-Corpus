  "content": "Justin Bieber, the 16-year-old Canadian pop star, has long reigned supreme as the most popular discussion topic on Twitter. While all good things undoubtedly have to come to an end, few Bieber fans would have expected the starlet's dominance to be threatened by Diane Abbott's decision to toss her hat into the Labour leadership ring. Since the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington joined the contest this morning she has enjoyed an astronomic surge up the search engines, attracting particular intrigue on the social networking site. According to Trendistic, which allows users to search specific terms to see how popular they are on Twitter, for one brief fleeting moment, just after 8am this morning, the leftwing MP came within touching distance of the Canadian. (Not literally.) Abbott even outshone Nick Clegg as he and David Cameron announced the finer details of their coalition deal. At the time of writing the phrase \"Diane Abbott\" is the third most discussed term in the UK \u2013 behind only #songstohavesexto and #filmquotesaschatuplines \u2013 and the eighth most talked about Twitter topic worldwide. On Trendsmap, the words \"Diane\" and \"Abbott\" loomed large among such weighty discussion topics as \"Olympic mascots\" and \"revision\". But what were people saying about the first woman to enter the leadership contest? Not everyone was sure of Abbott's suitability to lead Labour in opposition: JamesWHarrison: I really like Diane Abbott, one of my favourite MPs actually ... but I don't think she'll make a good Prime Minister! @ClaireFry: Diane Abbott? Why? Just ... Why? You're not going to become leader just because a few people see you on telly every week. Oh dear. izzilivingstone: Brilliant, about time for some good news, Diane Abbott for #Labour Leader http://bit.ly/a9CTbf Others were simply not sure of her identity: @frieslander2: Who is (or, who was) Diane Abbott? Fihan_deNIS: Who is Diane Abbott? Berntheboy: Diane Abbott WHO ? Although Abbott may be unlikely to be anointed Labour leader \u2013 the current odds on her winning the contest are hovering around 30/1 \u2013 she can rest assured that at least she is the frontrunner in one popularity contest.",
