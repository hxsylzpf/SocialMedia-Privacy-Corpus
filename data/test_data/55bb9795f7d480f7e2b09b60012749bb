  "content": "The BBC has hired an expert on virtual worlds as part of its efforts to bring its TV and internet output closer together. Roo Reynolds, who is currently a metaverse evangelist at IBM, will join the corporation as portfolio executive for social media, with a role across BBC Vision. His role will include coordinating the BBC's social networking strategy and overseeing cross-platform projects \u2013 such as BBC3's much-vaunted revamp. 30-year-old Reynolds, who has been working at IBM's research laboratories in Hursley Park, Hampshire, for much of the past 10 years, has been employed in a number of different technical and research roles across the company. Most recently he has specialised in the company's use of virtual worlds, and in particular has championed IBM's use of Second Life. \"I've worked with some great people and on some great projects, and it's good to be leaving on a high,\" said Reynolds in an announcement on his blog. \"I don't regret anything about my time at IBM, and I'm only going because it's time for me to have even more fun elsewhere.\" The announcement comes on the same day that the corporation confirmed that Erik Huggers, a former Microsoft executive, would be taking over as the head of the BBC's overall digital efforts. Huggers will assume the title of director of future media and technology - one of the top jobs at the BBC \u2013 when current incumbent Ashley Highfield leaves on August 1.",
