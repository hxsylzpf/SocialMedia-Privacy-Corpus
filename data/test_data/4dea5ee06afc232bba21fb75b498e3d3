  "content": "The UK is on course to become the first country in the world where spending on digital advertising outstrips all other traditional formats combined. As consumers increasingly shop on smartphones and tablets, more than half of the nation's advertising budget is expected to go on digital media this year, with a boom in paid-for results on search engines such as Google, according to sales and marketing researchers Strategy Analytics. The total UK advertising market will hit \u00a315.8bn in 2015, up 5.5% from last year the researchers said, and just under \u00a38bn of that will go on digital ads, whether on search engines, mobile apps, newspaper websites or video-on-demand services such as ITV Player or 4oD. One of the beneficiaries of the digital advertising boom is 24-year-old video blogger Zoe Sugg, known to her fans as Zoella. The young entrepreneur has amassed more than seven million subscribers for her beauty blogs \u2013 known as vlogs \u2013 which are broadcast on YouTube. Each video is preceded by a short commercial. She pockets 55% of the advertising profits, with the rest going to Google, which owns YouTube. It is said to cost about \u00a320,000 a month to put a banner on Zoella's vlog, while a product placement within one of her videos reportedly costs \u00a34,000. While the UK would be the first country to break the 50% threshold for digital advertising, globally around 30% of advertising spend goes on digital media, while in the US the figure is 28%. The biggest casualty of the surge in online advertising has been traditional print media, with newspapers and magazines struggling to hold on to their market share. Print advertising revenues are predicted to fall by 0.2% to \u00a32.5bn. Meanwhile, TV is expected to see its advertising revenue rise by 3% to \u00a33.8bn, although its overall share of the market will fall to less than half of digital media. Michael Goodman, co-author of Strategy Analytics' report, said: \"TV's declining share is actually less about ad pounds flowing out of TV and more about them flowing into digital from print and radio. \"Thus, broadcasters such as ITV, Channel 4 and Sky will see little, if any, real decline in revenues \u2013 just a shift in the source from linear TV ads to online video.\" Ian Barber, a spokesman for the Advertising Association, the industry's trade body, said online platforms have opened the market to smaller firms that would not consider advertising on national TV. He said: \"British people love their smartphones, and they love shopping online, which is why our digital advertising sector leads the world.\""
