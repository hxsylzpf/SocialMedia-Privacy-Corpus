  "content": "\u2022 Fans of Apple won't be the only ones sent into a spinby the news that the company could be making a product announcement in late January. Rumours were fuelled by the news that the company has hired the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco for a January 26th event. The venue is slap-bang next to the Moscone Center, where Apple has traditionally held its Macworld keynote, and is where we saw new iPods launched in September. Expect other manufacturers to try ramping up their own announcements at the Consumer Electronics Show, as a way of fighting the Apple hype machine. \u2022 After surprising everyone by making money, Twitter caught people off-guard again by announcing that it had purchased Mixer Labs, a geo-location software company. It's not the first purchase the startup has made, having previously sucked in search service Summize and Values of N. Expect more geo features soon. \u2022 And that's it from us. Enjoy the break (if you've got one) and we'll be back with more next week. Merry Christmas!
