  "content": "Paul Dacre was right to draw attention to the chilling effect of libel costs on press freedom and the impact of ever expanding privacy law in his evidence to the select committee inquiry yesterday on libel and privacy, but it's unlikely that his evidence will further the cause of free expression. Few politicians on the committee will have sympathy for the Daily Mail's travails \u2013 even though it's thanks to Associated Newspapers that we now have an important analysis of costs across Europe from Oxford University, which makes an extremely strong case for reform (in A Comparative Study of Costs in Defamation Proceedings Across Europe). There is little support for the principle of free speech in the political establishment \u2013 other than to pay it lip service \u2013 partly because it erroneously tends to be seen as synonymous with press freedom. And as long as there is hostility to the press, reform of libel and privacy will be seen as giving the unscrupulous jackals of the media unlimited licence, instead of as a welcome move towards making free expression that bit freer. So any editor who goes before the committee and rails against libel laws and privacy runs the risk of being seen as serving only their own interests. What we need is for the committee to widen its pool of witnesses, so that it's not just those with commercial interests, and the loudest voices, who are giving their position on libel and privacy, and so that reform escapes being misleadingly portrayed as some kind of surrender to the media. For the issues are far wider than that. The UK's plaintiff-friendly libel laws have turned it into the world capital of defamation \u2013 we should be alarmed and ashamed that we have become the first port of call for anyone who wants to silence investigation or criticism. When a Ukrainian billionaire comes to the UK to sue a Ukrainian website (that has of course written about him in Ukrainian) or when an Icelandic bank uses our courts to sue a Danish newspaper, surely the absurdity of the situation is plain. It would be worth hearing from some of the NGOs who have been taken to court by the people they are seeking to expose for corruption or even from some of the smaller publications and individuals outside the UK who have felt the chill of our laws at first hand \u2013 witnesses without the bullish personalities of the likes of Mosley and Dacre, who make it hard to see past the bluster to the fundamental principles at issue.",
