  "content": "Eminem has announced plans for a brand new album, no sooner than he had junked his old one. The rapper, aka Marshall Mathers, returned from the wilderness last year with Relapse, an album charting his descent into prescription pill addiction. He had been widely expected to release a sequel to that record later this year. But yesterday he shocked fans by taking to Twitter and announcing that \"There is no Relapse 2.\" Many fans assumed that Em had gone into another period of self-imposed exile. But later on came another tweet that read simply \"Recovery\" and linked to eminem.com, where it was confirmed that a whole different album is due for release on 22 June. The rapper explained: \"I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title.\" It isn't yet clear whether the name of his seventh studio album indicates a calmer lyrical mood. But we do know that it features first-time collaborations with the likes of DJ Khalil, Just Blaze, Jim Jonsin and Boi-1da.",
