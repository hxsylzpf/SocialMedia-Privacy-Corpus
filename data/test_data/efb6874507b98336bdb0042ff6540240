  "content": "BubbleIdeas' two co-founders want to formalise feedback for enterprise and government - and they are doing it with a bootstrapped business headquartered in Singapore, developed in India and hosted in the US. The sole employees so far, the site was set up on 1 April this year (a birthday they share with Gmail, as well as the April Fool) but by this time next year, they want 5,000 business-to-business clients. Chief executive Arvind Nagam tells us more. \u2022 What's your pitch? \"Enterprise and government both want to engage with public, customers or citizens, and they want to hear what people think about their product or policy. But there are hardly any tools which help them do that. BubbleIdeas, as the name suggests, bubbles up great ideas/thoughts - the signal from a mesh of conversations - which companies can act upon. Most social media tools like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and blogs are good for broadcasting - and for listening there is BubbleIdeas. \"BubbleIdeas expects to tap the potential of the crowd with collaboration and semantic analysis to figure out relevant conversations in an online setup. It tracks ideas, thoughts or mentions around a brand, leader or government. It also allows people to collaborate and speak with each other on the terminals opened by organisations themselves. The organisations on the other hand are able to take management decisions according to what BubbleIdeas pulls up to the top. \"At the heart of processing, BubbleIdeas is quite complex. It counts plus or minus votes (simple Digg-style stuff) like other tools but that's not all. BubbleIdeas is careful about hijacking of ideas with only negative votes. So we count number views, comments, duration, rate of change, and also semantic analysis of the text and comments to arrive at a score of popularity for a given conversation. Then we rank the thoughts of the crowd in the order of popularity. Companies can take decisions according to the popularity of ideas.\" \u2022 How do you make money? \"We earn in two ways. Clients can sign up for any of the plans directly on our website, and we charge their credit card monthly. \"Social media experts and consultants can sign up our small-to-medium enterprise platform. They consult, sell, customise and integrate BubbleIdeas for their clients, and earn automatic monthly commission as a percentage of what the clients pay us for using our platform.\" \u2022 How are you surviving the downturn? \"We are benefitting from the widespread cheapness actually.\" \u2022 What's your background? \"I'm graduated in engineering from India's top university, the Indian Institute of Technology, and have eight years' experience in technology, government and semantic web. \"Praveen Kumar Sinha, our chief technology officer and my co-founder, studied a post graduate in computer science and is one of the three guys who built Slideshare.com - world's biggest portal for presentations.\" \u2022 What makes your business unique? \"Our product is social and intelligent both. It has capabilities to become an early adaptation of semantic web - the web of the future. Intelligence is sometimes not social, and social is sometimes not intelligent. We are trying to strike a balance between the two. \"The friendliest part is that terminals on BubbleIdeas are the best way to listen to masses. So in future if a company or government thinks it cannot survive without real time engagement with consumers or citizens - it must try BubbleIdeas.\" \u2022 What has been your biggest achievement? \"To have acquired the ability to churn out a truly global startup with least expenses from three different places on earth. Last Monday we launched the first ever platform for millions of social media consultants who are trying to drag the traditional industry and government into web 2.0. Now they can do so much more easily and profitably.\" \u2022 Who inspires you? \"Steve Jobs for me, Steve Wozniak for Praveen.\" \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? \"Setting up exclusive sales partnerships in different parts of the world. It's pretty tough to leverage this remotely over the internet. Our most recent partnership was in California with Silberberg Innovations who lead in Government 2.0 innovation consulting in the United States. We expect to close more partnerships in coming few weeks in Europe, Australia and Denmark.\" \u2022 What's the most important tool you use each day? \"Gmail - Can't get better than that.\" \u2022 Name your closest competitors \"IdeaScale, UserVoice and SalesForce.\" \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? \"The biggest online mass-communication tool between people and enterprise or government.\" \u2022 Sell to Google, or be bigger than Google? \"Really don't know who is going to rule the semantic web!\" bubbleideas.com"
