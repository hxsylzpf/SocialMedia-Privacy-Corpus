  "content": "The immigration department has conceded it should not have used the Australian Border Force Act to deny an academic's request for previously published data on the location of visa holders. Australian National University migration and labour mobility expert Henry Sherrell was last month refused access to aggregated data on the location of second-year working holiday visa holders. The information, which had removed the identifies of the visa holders, had already been published in a submission to a Senate inquiry, but only in map form, and Sherrell sought the raw data to use in his research. But the department refused his request, saying it \"did not comply with the ABF Act\". Sherrell, a former immigration bureaucrat, feared the refusal was \"a small, but worrying\" example of how the law's secrecy provisions might stymie legitimate research. A provision in the act allows the disclosure of information that has already been lawfully published. \"I want to make sure people are aware that this is happening, and even people in the department are aware that this is happening,\" Sherrell said. \"I want people to know that the Australian Border Force Act is having these implications, because I don't imagine anyone who drafted that legislation intended for it to have this kind of effect,\" he said. After Guardian Australia put questions to the department, it again contacted Sherrell, telling him it was granting him full access to the data. On Tuesday morning a spokeswoman conceded the department had made a \"mistake\" in refusing the request. The data was initially handed to the agriculture department, which subsequently used it in a submission to the Senate inquiry into working holiday reforms. The immigration spokeswoman said the original data given to the agriculture department had contained extra detail, which could not be passed on to Sherrell due to privacy provisions in the act. \"The original data provided by the department to the Department of Agriculture contained postcodes, number of grants, industry and citizenship,\" the spokeswoman said. \"The researcher was willing to forgo the industry and citizenship information, however this reduction in the data requested was missed by departmental officers leading to the data request refusal.\" Sherrell's initial efforts to extract a more detailed explanation for the refusal were unsuccessful. But he believes the secrecy provisions of the act, which carry a two-year jail sentence for workers who disclose \"protected information\", were behind the department's early reluctance to give him the information. No one has yet been charged under those provisions. But opponents say they have a chilling effect on officials or anyone else who believes they have protected information. Health workers feared the laws would prevent them speaking out about conditions in immigration detention, although an amendment in September specifically excluded them from prosecution."
