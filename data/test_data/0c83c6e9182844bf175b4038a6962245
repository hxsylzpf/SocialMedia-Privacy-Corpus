  "content": "To: All staff, Channel 8 From: Rupert Sawyer, chief executive of Channel 8 Subject: Well done to all those in the post room Dear staff, What a lot of bother over nothing you've had to endure at Channel 8 in the past few weeks. I'm told that the last time we received such a high level of correspondence was after the broadcast of Grave Digging Live: In Search of Diana \u2013 but on this occasion, instead of insightful documentary-making ruffling the feathers of the botched and the bungled, it was a harmless piece of writing in Auto Trader's not-for-profit sister title, the Guardian, that set the cat amongst the pigeons. I wish I could have been there to share in the excitement, but I've been on an outdoor pursuits holiday with Simon Cowell on the French Riviera in recent weeks and have therefore had to rely on you, my loyal staff, to read my post and maintain my Twitter account in my absence. Some of the most interesting samples have been forwarded to me. \"Now I understand the hatred of BBC, when Rupert Sawyer who spat out articles, runs a commercial TV channel \u2026 \" writes one confused tweeter. But why must commercial equal bad, I say? Do people forget Blind Date and the Darling Buds of May were on an ad-funded channel, and they were perfic'. And to the correspondent who said: \"Because you're on Channel 8, not BBC1, you should be apologising for your failure in life\", I say, I would relish the chance to waste your money on making shit versions of the X Factor, and commissioning offensive 70s style Muslim comedies, but as we all know, rising to DG position at the BBC is only possible after a lifetime of sitting in White City on \u00a3100k, moaning about pay and pensions whilst administering more administrators. Sadly, my go-getting credentials and proven track record of making money from television ruled me out of this race. \"Obviously not successful either, as he's the chairman of the well-known Channel 8 TV\" \u2013 does this person not own a television. Have they never seen our groundbreaking natural history masterpiece The Frozen Gannet, enjoyed the thrills and spills of Porno Paramedics, or indulged in The Voice UK-killer I've Got A Feeling . Of course in a situation like this, it is important that those in positions of responsibility hold their hands up and admit they were wrong \u2013 they were deliberately inflammatory, and they caused a media storm with no regard for the consequences. Therefore, I feel it is time for me to wholeheartedly take the blame for the TeamGB-Gate debacle \u2026 and lay it firmly at Jeremy Vine's door. My missives have informed flag-waving, sandal-wearing leftists reading the print edition of Smooth FM for many months, and until now I have received nothing but positive feedback from previously confused socialists who've thanked me for explaining to them why the World Service should be closed , how books should all be pulped and why celebrities like Jimmy Carr shouldn't pay tax. However, when Jeremy Vine tweeted \"TAKE COVER\" with a link to my usually carefully chosen words to his 130,000 followers, he began a chain of events that has seen usually ineloquent members of the twittering classes completely lose their heads. I ask you, is this a correct use of a Twitter account essentially funded by the licence fee \u2013 YOUR money? Last I heard, Aunty was meant to be ensuring their staff had tweets checked by a least two people before sending them \u2013 who signed off that message over at Radio 2? And he wasn't the only celebrity to stir the pot, but most of the others it seems had the foresight to remove their anti-8 commentaries after doing a little more research into the power and influence of my channels. However, I am pleased that the outpouring of social media comment helped highlight a point I made just a few weeks ago in this very publication ; the general public cannot be trusted with social media, and that privilege should immediately be taken away. Celebrities and public figures such as myself use the internet for making money through self-promotion as well as just showing off how important we are by ignoring tweets from norms. How dare people interfere with my automated sponsored tweet campaign to tell me \"you're a bell shaft\" or assert that I, Rupert Sawyer am a \"vacuous oxygen thief\". Most of the tweets I've read cannot be repeated here in the Scott Trust Ltd's newsletter, but I can tell you now, most of the comments would struggle to make it on to Points of View. No wonder the stars are now leaving Twitter in their droves and heading back to the good old tabloids if this is the thanks they get for spewing out commercial updates in 140 characters or fewer. However, there have been some kind words too. I thank the correspondent who made this rather wonderful comparison: \"You would be the Blake to @piersmorgans Bolt in an Olympic twat twattery\", and the person who recognised my words should be read by a larger, more learned audience, encouraging me to \"Go and write for the Daily Mail, you cunt\". And for those who feel the best way of detracting from my argument is to challenge my journalistic mettle by challenging me to race an Olympian (or in some cases, just the correspondent), I say this: If you are prepared to come to my home in Ha Noi (under your own steam), and build me a running track (at your expense), and offer me at least four years professional coaching (on your tab), I would be more than happy to take you up on your challenge. Apparently the Pulitzer Prize was originally decided by a 100-yard dash \u2013 and I've always been one for tradition. Let the journalistic Olympics begin \u2026 Regards, Your intellectual overlord and benevolent boss, Rupert",
