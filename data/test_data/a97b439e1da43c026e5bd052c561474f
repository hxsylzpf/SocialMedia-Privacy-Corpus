  "content": "I'm a big fan of the trend for the colourful, elaborate infographics (usually in handy, column-sized bloggable format) and videos that are being used to explain statistics and reports, which makes it far easier and more entertaining to digest a page of statistics. There's a sea of good infographics in this Pamorama post from March, and a great example in the form of the social sites boom graphic at the end of this post. For those seeking a regular infographic hit, I recommend informationisbeautiful.net. There's a risk that the 'prettiness' overtakes from the validity of the data, of course, so the publisher needs to be quite clear where the data comes from and why they are publishing. This particular video is to promote a PR and social media agency and the data came from Future Thinking, a market research firm. But that caveat is the same for all visualisations as much as for text reports. This report says 20% of tweets contain a brand or product reference, which I hadn't heard before, and also said UK web users spend an average 6 hours 7 minutes on social networking sites every month. We'll counter that with this delightful and very helpful service that will help you word that tricky corporate social media strategy. NSFW..."
