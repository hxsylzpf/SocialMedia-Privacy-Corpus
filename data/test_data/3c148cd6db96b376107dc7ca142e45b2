  "content": "Consider that most slippery and elusive of media concepts: \"the public interest\", as invoked a few days ago by a battling Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform. \"The public interest is not served by the prurient media disclosure of the identity of a child who has committed a crime, no matter how trivial nor how serious,\" she wrote in the Guardian. \"Any judge who claims that it is in the public interest to identify a 16-year-old boy convicted of murder\u2026 risks giving in to the voracious media and to public voyeurism.\" Clearly, then, this have-you-stopped-beating-your-wife version of the public interest expounded by Crook draws red lines way short of the prurient disclosure and voyeurism dished up by voracious websites, TV stations and newspapers (including the Guardian, which plonked a big picture of Will Cornick on its front page, having previously helped lead court arguments that the killer of Ann Maguire must be named). It's a construct tailored to fit the case she seeks to argue. Conversely, those who wanted Cornick named adopted a different definition. \"This is an exceptional case,\" said the judge in the case, Mr Justice Coulson. \"Public interest has been huge. There are wider issues at stake such as the safety of children, the possibility of American-style security measures in schools and the dangers of 'internet loners' concocting violent fantasies. I consider that the debate on those issues will be informed by the identification of William Cornick as the killer\". And a Guardian editorial weighed in: \"The media case was that in the very particular circumstances, where the crime was so serious and the interest of open justice so important, anonymity should be forgone.\" Note the two words at the heart of that decision: open justice. In the real world, newspapers need paying customers. Websites need clicks. Broadcasters, public and private, chase approval ratings. Take all that away and there would be precious little information (aka the foundation of openness) left. So there's no evident sense in blankly damning media coverage you don't approve of because supposedly driven by a need to make money. That's just an excuse for not digging deeper. We've lived \u2013 as a nation of media consumers \u2013 through the horrors of child abuse, finally brought into the open. We've grown sick of the scandals in care homes, in NHS trusts, in the police as they, too, have seeped into sight. We don't trust our banks and we don't trust our politicians. And we want, when asked, open discussion, open inquiries, open justice. That, for good or ill, is the Fiona Woolf story. Newspapers and broadcasters aren't always best placed to heed these open calls. Hacking was a bad deed in the dark. The BBC hasn't covered itself in Savile glory. All this has to change. But so does any automatic assumption in genteel society that silence is continuing virtue. William Cornick, at 16, would have been eligible to vote on a nation's future if he'd lived in Scotland. He could enlist in the regular army. His identity would, in any case, have been revealed two years later. He is obviously damaged goods, a subject of sadness and distress. But the judge is equally obviously right: he stands at the heart of a debate. But to debate properly, you have to be engaged. To be engaged, you have to believe. To believe, you have to understand. To understand, you have to be informed. And to be generally informed, you also need to be entertained. That's why the \"public interest\", drawn too tightly and narrowly, can blight understanding. Mr Justice Coulson wasn't narrow. The public interest that was \"huge\" in his eyes is general, not specific. It includes other crimes \u2013 say the alleged dismemberment of Indonesian prostitutes by British hedge fund managers. It probably includes Benedict Cumberbatch's fiancee, Claudia Winkleman's badly burnt child, George Clooney's wedding. You may call that prurient and voyeuristic if you must. But it helps the information world go round. It underpins debates. And, in the changing, open spirit of the times, the true public interest is not trying to define what can or can't be published too prescriptively: an interest in disclosure. \u25a0 I helped judge the international reporting entries for the British Journalism Awards the other day, and something about them brought me up with a jolt. Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, Libya, Afghanistan, the Philippines, Africa at war, disease, the collapse of Europe's economy\u2026 It's been a hell of a year, and I can't remember so much brilliant coverage by so many brilliant reporters rising to meet that challenge. Any one entry among a dozen or more could have won in a quieter time. Here be passion, courage and empathy mixed into a compelling cocktail. I can't wait to see what fine German, French and Scandinavian reporters have to add now the European Press Prize for 2014 is open for entries. But I do know one easy excuse for indifference or ignorance won't run: \"No one told me\u2026 !\" On the contrary, you were told in the starkest, most gut-wrenching terms. Devoted correspondents put their own lives at risk to tell you. But did you take any notice?"
