  "content": "Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan today compared the prospect of state regulation of the media to Robert Mugabe's regime in Zimbabwe in an impassioned defence of self-regulation. Morgan praised the press complaints commission for transforming the newspaper industry, admitting that tabloid journalism had been \"pretty lawless\" when he first entered the business. \"I have never known standards to be better than they are today,\" Morgan told a Commons select committee inquiry into privacy and media intrusion. \"When I came into the industry, the atmosphere was pretty lawless. Things have moved on so far it's almost impossible to imagine you could put anymore regulations in place to improve it. \"The old mythology of ghastly tabloids doesn't bear relation to what's happening in our industry.\" Morgan voiced his firm support for the press complaints commission which he said had been \"very effective over the last 10 years in changing the media's behaviour\". A state-sponsored media \"works very well for Robert Mugabe\", he added. Morgan said there was very little difference today between how tabloid and broadsheet newspapers operate. He pointed to a photograph of Peter Mandelson with his boyfriend in today's Daily Telegraph, which he described as 'clearly a paparazzo picture'. He said that during his time as editor, he had overseen 300-400,000 stories and had received very few complaints about privacy from ordinary members of the public, who are the focus of the MP's inquiry. \"We're not just a pamphlet of intrusion,\" Morgan said. \"More people read tabloid newspapers than anywhere else in the world, we are incredibly professional. We take what we do incredibly seriously and with responsibility.\" The Mirror editor hit out at the current portrayal of tabloid journalists on the ITV1 soap opera Coronation Street. \"Twenty million people are watching this ludicrous portrait of tabloid journalists rampaging around Coronation Street,\" Morgan said. In a letter to the select committee written before his evidence today, Morgan described media intrusion as \"something which exists in people's imagination rather than in reality\".",
