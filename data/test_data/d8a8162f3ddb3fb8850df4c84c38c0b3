  "content": "Charity leaders face a unique set of challenges. Brexit means they will be operating in a volatile climate in the years ahead. And public trust in charities has fallen, with donors citing negative press stories and a lack of knowledge and confidence in how donations are spent. So what can charity leaders do? What can they control in a world of uncertainties? Leaders must use every instrument at their disposal to navigate the uncharted waters ahead. Social media can help them achieve many of their goals, whether it's managing reputation, strengthening relationships with government or recognising fundraisers. We're inviting nominations for the Top 30 Charity CEOs on Social Media Awards. Now in their fourth year, the awards reached 2.6 million people on Twitter in 2015, with chief executives Peter Wanless of the NSPCC, Jan Tregelles of Mencap and Frances Crook of the Howard League for Penal Reform among the winners. We want to recognise other charity leaders who are excelling on social media, so we are offering four individual awards including best trustee, best senior leader, best rising star and \u2013 new this year \u2013 leader with the most innovative social media presence. For the first time, we will also be announcing an overall winner from the top 30. Nominations are open to leaders of any registered charity, of whatever size or cause. We're keen to encourage a diverse range of applications. So how could charity leaders use social media to tackle the challenges posed by Brexit? Creative approaches to fundraising Sector umbrella body NCVO has warned that Brexit may result in reduced income for the sector. When money is tight, creativity is everything. Paul Reddish, chief executive of volunteering charity Project Scotland, put on a tutu and filmed a series of dance moves for the charity's #GivingTuesday 2015 campaign. He raised \u00a3790 to help young people and gained positive press coverage. Social media is also an excellent way for leaders to recognise corporate supporters and get their charity's brand seen alongside. Leadership and expertise In uncertain times, people are hungry for answers. Charity leaders have the knowledge \u2013 and the platform \u2013 to provide this. As Simon Blake, our chair of judges, says: \"Facts delivered in a personable manner by a senior leader can cut through in a unique way, adding value to other organisational communications.\" Asking thought-provoking questions is powerful and, over time, will reinforce the chief executive and their charity's status as thought leaders. Bringing communities together Brexit revealed how disenfranchised many people across the UK feel. As sector lawyers Bates Wells Braithwaite say in a Brexit briefing, charities have the power to bring people together in the communities in which they work. Who is better placed to connect with people in difficult situations who may be hard to reach? Deborah Alsina, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, uses social media to offer support to patients, which in turn raises awareness of her charity's cause. She also uses these channels to liaise with stakeholders across the health service. And during a period when things are liable to change rapidly, such interactions offer insights for chief executives into what's happening in real time. Alsina says: \"I've found Twitter an incredibly helpful channel to engage and build relationships with a diverse range of stakeholders, from patients, to supporters to clinicians. It gives me the opportunity to hear a range of views and opinions and of particular importance to me to gain insight into the experiences of those closely affected by bowel cancer.\" Increased scrutiny Brexit means seismic change, but the Charity Commission's research shows that donors are still keen to know how charities work and what they are funding. As a leader, there will be natural curiosity about what you do. Use social media to invite them in. It's a good way to pre-empt scrutiny, demonstrate the good work you are doing every day, and highlight how you are collaborating with others. By making what happens behind closed doors visible, chief executives can help critical relationships develop more quickly and show how committed they are to transparency. Charity leaders can also use social media to tell people about their charity's impact and how proud they are of its work. While Brexit may feel daunting, the fact is that where there is change, there is opportunity. Social media is a fantastic way for charity leaders to show what they and the organisations they run are worth. Nominations can be made here. Nominees will be judged by a panel of voluntary sector leaders and the results will be announced on Friday 18 November. All entries must be received by midnight on Friday 30 September. The Guardian Voluntary Sector Network is a media partner for the awards. For more news, opinions and ideas about the voluntary sector, join our community - it's free!"
