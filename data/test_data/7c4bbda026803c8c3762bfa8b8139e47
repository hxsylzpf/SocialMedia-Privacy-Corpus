  "content": "I know what you're thinking. We've all been thinking it, but nobody has spoken out: we follow him on Twitter, on Facebook, on Instagram and YouTube, but there are simply too few opportunities to observe persistent pop clown Chris Brown making dizzyingly self-righteous pronouncements while gurning with his shirt off. Well, exciting news arrived in my inbox on Wednesday evening: the Chris Brown Channel App is now available for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, and this crushing blow for Android users is great news for the rest of us. Before we explore the \"user journey\" associated with said app, the understated press release is itself a work of wonder. \"The Chris Brown Channel encompasses all facets of the Grammy-winning singer/songwriter, artist, actor and model,\" it underplays, \"from music to art, style to philanthropy.\" Time and space constraints must surely be reason for the release neglecting to detail all those other endeavours that continue to make Brown such a beloved pop-cultural figurehead. \"I am so excited to get closer to my fans \u2013 to bring them into my world, hearing from me directly, in my own words wherever I am, whenever they want,\" adds Chris, or someone pretending to be Chris in order to flesh out a press release with curiously un-Breezylike lexical nuances. \"Through my channel app they can be part of my music, my art and my life, day in and day out.\" Well it seems like there will be a lot of art in this app, so let's install it and see what's what. An early piece of good news is that it's free, presumably because one can simply not put a price on art, and after installation there is an instant alert that \"'Chris Brown' would like to send you push notifications\", which sounds not unlike advance warning of a classic Brown altercation, perhaps in a car park. And who's to say we won't be treated to blow-by-blow accounts of just such high-spirited escapades? Apparently this app gives Chris \"the capacity to broadcast live\", meaning that he \"controls the content, both planned and spontaneous\". This is excellent news for Brown, because this perpetually misunderstood visionary can finally show the world that none of the unfortunate scenarios in which he routinely finds himself are actually his fault. We are also promised that fans \"will be able to interact with Chris, take part in polls (potentially even choosing which song he sings first for a show)\". This promise of fan interaction suggests a high degree of Truman Show-style control, and could have a hugely positive effect on Brown's future. Imagine, for instance, that before graffiti-ing the exterior of his house with a series of pathetic goblins \u2013 as he did earlier this week, to the annoyance of neighbours \u2013 Brown asked his fans for advice. Perhaps they'd simply say: \"No Chris, don't do that, just go back to those thoughtful musings about 'wife-ing' Rihanna\". In practice, of course, his fans would probably go for the goblins and request that he did a dump on his neighbour's lawn while he was at it, because fans throwing themselves into this hermetically sealed world will be where Chris Brown's \u2013 and please excuse the inadequacy of these quote marks \u2013 \"values\" are the law. Fifteen years ago, any star like Brown hoping to get their message out to the public was faced with two effective options. They could throw themselves upon the mercy of the media and hope that the message they hoped to communicate somehow made it past the journalist's own agenda and into the final edit, or they could pay to get the message across in an advertisement. In 2013, direct-to-fan communications, like these apps and the varied wonders of social media, reduce the media's stranglehold to the level of an optimistic hug. This is perfect for celebrities. If you're Katy Perry, why would you announce a new album through a music magazine or media outlet with a paltry 180,000 Twitter followers, when you can whack a message on Twitter and know it will instantly hit more than 36 million fans? Equally, there's no type of pre-emptive press regulation quite like knowing that the ludicrously overblown piece of fiction regarding Millie Mackintosh you are about to send to press will be instantly rubbished by Professor Green, but while the idea of unmediated celebrity truth is rather useful if you happen to be the celebrity in question, Brown's app (which promises \"engagement between consumers, celebrities and brands\") will surely follow the lead of those guest columns celebrities regularly offer to celeb weeklies, more often than not a self-serving cocktail of plugs for upcoming projects, crowbarred-in references to current endorsement deals, and mock-outraged denials regarding stories running in competing publications. Resistance to this power shift isn't the desperate grasping of someone whose job often involves standing between musician and fan shouting about the things neither party wants to acknowledge \u2013 well, it's not just that \u2013 and perhaps Brown's app will actually establish that he's a great chap with a broad and genuine interest in art and philanthropy. But it's difficult to embrace the concept of a news agenda that comes solely from the horse's mouth \u2013 whether that horse be Brown or David Cameron. Not even if they happen to be shirtless."
