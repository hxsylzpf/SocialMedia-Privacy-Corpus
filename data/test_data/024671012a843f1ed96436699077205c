  "content": "There will be no more tweeting from court in Baltimore, the administrative judge of the city's circuit court has decreed. More remarkably, there will be no more tweeting from anywhere in Baltimore circuit court's courtroom buildings, or \"use of any device to transmit information on Twitter, Facebook, Linked In or any other current or future form of social networking\". The order is \"predicated on the assumption that posting to Twitter is effectively the same as having television cameras broadcast court proceedings, which is already banned throughout the state\", according to the Baltimore Sun's Second Opinion blog, which is outraged. They point out that the order can be easily evaded \u2013 just step outside \u2013 but still find it \"hard to see it as anything other than an attempt to shield the workings of the courthouse from public scrutiny\". On the other hand, if Baltimore judges' main concern about court reporting is that there might be too much of it, then maybe the city's journalism isn't in as bad a state as we were told. (Legal system gloss for British readers: according to its website, the circuit court for Baltimore city is \"a State trial court of unlimited jurisdiction. It handles all types of cases and is divided into four main divisions: Family, Juvenile, Criminal, and Civil.\" So this covers a lot of cases. Sources: Romenesko/Second Opinion.)",
