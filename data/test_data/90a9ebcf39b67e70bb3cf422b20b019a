  "content": "Notes on modern Britain: when I looked on Friday morning, some 2,200 Mail Online readers had commented on the Rochester result \u2013 and 3,000 on Emily Thornberry's white van tweet. The online Guardian's scorecard was very similar: 2,300 to 2,600 or so. So a tweet matters more than a vote (at least on Twitter). And Twitter, in the dark hours of Thursday evening, can unseat a shadow attorney general. Who rose up to smite Thornberry for a \"posh\" supposed sneer? Not actual White Van Man, flying his English flags. \"I don't care who it pisses off,\" he told the Telegraph. \"I know there is a lot of ethnic minorities that don't like it.\" Thornberry is a prolific Twitter user, with 7,426 tweets since 2010, and 14,300 followers. Read back through them and you'll find a lot of comments full of wry, earthy honesty: just the kind of human connection politicians are supposed to make. She laughed at Labour voters as well as Ukip ones in Rochester, too. But one tweet \u2013 yanked from a series of \"images\" by sharp-eyed stirrers \u2013 is enough to blight a career. Live by the digital, die by the digital? Or grow up, and search for a sense of humour?"
