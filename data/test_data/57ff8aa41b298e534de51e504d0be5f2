  "content": "How can an author navigate the competing imperatives of art, commerce and the public in the Facebook age? In a provocation delivered at the Manchester literature festival on Monday night, the novelist Joanne Harris complained that the digital age has left some readers feeling a misplaced sense that writers were required to be permanently available to their audience. In this new world, Harris proposed a 12-point writer's manifesto, a compact between author and reader in which \u2013 among other pledges \u2013 she promised her readers \"not to be aloof whenever you reach out to me \u2013 be that on social media or outside, in the real world\". This promise was followed immediately by a caveat, the author reminding readers that she's \"human too \u2013 and some days I'm impatient, or tired, or sometimes I just run out of time\". But it's clear Harris feels there's some kind of obligation on authors to respond, to engage with readers who send them a tweet or track them down at a literary festival. Authors may be struggling with the demands of the online world, but the writer AL Kennedy, who joined Twitter a year before Harris in 2009 and posts regularly on politics and the writing life, isn't convinced that new forms of communication have imposed any new duties on them to connect with their audience. Readers should, of course, be offered the same courtesy any human being can expect from another, Kennedy says, but any engagement beyond the \"usual human stuff\" depends on the author. \"If you're not that sociable, then it's hard to fake sociability. I know some authors who would be their own worst enemy if they had to be very outgoing in certain contexts and who avoid them like the plague as a result.\" There may be some obligation to communicate for writers who are \"involved in public life and [have] louder than average voices when it came to communicating with institutions\", Kennedy continues, \"but that's not necessarily all about writers being lovely and altruistic \u2013 anything that a writer does with the public might potentially increase their sales, or visibility.\" A higher profile doesn't always translate into higher sales, Kennedy adds, with some readers becoming disenchanted with authors because of their politics, or for other reasons. \"I think that social media audiences have a fairly low tolerance for naked marketing disguised as chat, or activism.\" Emily St John Mandel is another novelist and long-time Twitter user who says she enjoys interacting with readers, but doesn't consider it a duty. \"Our sole obligation to readers is to write the best books that we possibly can,\" she says. Mandel is always happy to \"exchange a few words with readers when I meet them in person\", citing a tour to promote her novel Station Eleven that has involved 109 events in six countries, but attests to the increasing pressure on writers \"to market ourselves, which in practical terms has translated to making ourselves available to fans via email and social media\". It may be easier than ever to talk with readers, librarians and booksellers, she continues, but \"more time spent interacting with strangers on the internet means less time spent writing\". \"The only way I can get any serious work done is by limiting my availability online. I took the email address off my website because I found that I could either respond to emails all day or write, but not both, and am much less active on social media than I used to be. \"I've been avoiding Twitter lately, because I want to make some headway on my next book and find Twitter too distracting. I deleted my Facebook account a few months back for the same reason.\" For all the dizzying whirl of the internet revolution, Kennedy isn't sure all that much has changed. \"I no longer get many letters from readers, but now I get tweets or emails,\" she says. \"I haven't noticed the numbers rising, despite \u2013 I suppose \u2013 the increased ease of communication. I think people are still a little nervous around strangers or people they feel will be standoffish, or busy, or adversely affected by their own famousness or whatever.\" Publishers and agents have always passed on letters, even from \"unusual people\" \u2013 usually enclosing \"an apologetic note with the clearly strange letters\". \"Twitter reaches you faster,\" says Kennedy, \"but you don't have to touch the same paper as an odd person or deal with their personal enclosures. In a way, the contact has been reduced.\" The rise of the literary festival means that there are many more opportunities for readers to see their favourite authors in the flesh, but \"that's not the same as knowing someone or spending real time with them\", Kennedy continues, and there's little scope for any confusion: \"Seeing me read is no more meeting me (although it's billed that way sometimes) than my going to watch Benedict Cumberbatch being Hamlet would be me meeting Cumberbatch \u2013 it's just being in a big room with him and staring.\" Kennedy prefers to take the long view, arguing that concerns over a new accommodation between writers and readers offer the familiar spectacle of an online version of a real-world phenomenon making us all \"run about saying it's different in some fundamental way\". \"I don't suppose I tour as much as Dickens did,\" she adds. The writer Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn is another who cautions against giving the opportunities afforded by the online world too much importance. He has watched the rise of literary festivals and the internet since he published his first novel in 1990, and has grown used to live webchats and Ask Me Anythings. But T\u00f3ib\u00edn prefers to focus on Harris's determination to deliver work \"the best I could make it\" rather than observe the duty Harris proposes that writers should connect with readers. \"I think your main responsibility is to your sentences, to work as best you can,\" T\u00f3ib\u00edn says, \"everything else is secondary.\" Joanne Harris's manifesto 1. I promise to be honest, unafraid and true; but most of all, to be true to myself \u2013 because trying to be true to anyone else is not only impossible, but the sign of a fearful writer. 2. I promise not to sell out - not even if you ask me to. 3. You may not always like what I write, but know that it has always been the best I could make it at the time. 4. Know too that sometimes I will challenge you and pull you out of your comfort zone, because this is how we learn and grow. I can't promise you'll always feel safe or at ease \u2013 but we'll be uneasy together. 5. I promise to follow my story wherever it leads me, even to the darkest of places. 6. I will not limit my audience to just one group or demographic. Stories are for everyone, and everyone is welcome here. 7. I will include people of all kinds in my stories, because people are infinitely fascinating and diverse. 8. I promise that I will never flinch from trying something different and new \u2013 even if the things I try are not always successful. 9. I will never let anyone else decide what I should write, or how \u2013 not the market, my publishers, my agent, or even you, the reader. And though you sometimes try to tell me otherwise, I don't think you really want me to. 10. I promise not to be aloof whenever you reach out to me \u2013 be that on social media or outside, in the real world. But remember that I'm human too \u2013 and some days I'm impatient, or tired, or sometimes I just run out of time. 11. I promise never to forget what I owe my readers. Without you, I'm just words on a page. Together, we make a dialogue. 12. But ultimately, you have the choice whether or not to follow me. I will open the door for you. But I will never blame you if you choose not to walk through it."
