  "content": "Jason Fraser, the new executive director of Express Newspapers, and his boss Richard Desmond are perfectly suited. Both of them are in denial. The former hates being called what he is: a paparazzo. The latter hates being called what he is: a pornographer. Joining forces therefore is logical. The celebrity-stalking sneak photographer will provide juicy product for the man who, while claiming to have cleaned up his act, is in the process of trashing a newspaper. Fraser's first contribution to the Daily Express since joining - pictures of actors Emma Thompson and Greg Wise with their baby daughter - was a classic illustration of his work and also the deceit which underlies his defence of it. One of the pictures, taken while Thompson and Wise were on holiday in Cyprus, showed the couple with their daughter, Gaia, on a beach. Two more, one of which appeared on the front page, were of Thompson alone on the beach. A fourth showed Wise with Gaia in a hotel pool. They were taken by Mario Brenna, one of the most active of the various paparazzi marketed by Fraser through his agency. He rarely goes out on shoots nowadays, but he invariably provides the essential information on the whereabouts of his star victims, and then insists that his byline appears when the pictures are published. When I have protested in the past about the use of these grainy, telephoto shots, pointing to the editors' code of practice which outlaws \"the use of long lens photography to take pictures of people in private places without their consent\", Fraser - and the papers which have regularly used his work - have offered two justifications. First, sticking to the letter of the code, they say that public beaches are not private places. Even if the victims, again quoting from the code, believe they have \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" because they are thousands of miles from home and are not seeking publicity, they forfeit any protection by disporting themselves on a public beach. Second, and here comes Fraser's favourite escape clause, is the suggestion that the supposed victims are complicit. They take part in the pretence that they have been snapped unawares for publicity reasons. That is why, according to Fraser, there have never been any complaints about his pictures to the press complaints commission. Though I have little doubt that some people do indeed reach secret agreements with Fraser, and others are probably relaxed about being photographed, the suggestion of widespread complicity smears those who are genuine victims. My firm understanding is that Thompson did not give any permission to any photographer to take the shots of her, and I would not be in the least surprised if she did make a formal complaint to the PCC. Apart from the intrusion into her privacy - hotels are not public places - she might also consider a complaint under the clause which protects children being photographed \"without the consent of a parent\". Even if she does complain, and even if she is successful in winning an adjudication, it would still rely on a narrow interpretation of the code and doesn't come close to ending the whole sordid nonsense of sneak photography. Going on the precedent of last month's PCC adjudication following the complaint by Anna Ford about pictures of her which appeared in the Daily Mail and OK! magazine, the main picture of Thompson, Wise and their child would escape censure. Surely, that is unfair and entirely against the spirit of the code. Ford's case is particularly relevant. She and her friend, the former astronaut, David Scott, were pictured sunbathing while on holiday in Majorca with her teenage children. Ford explained: \"We deliberately chose a small, unpretentious family hotel right at the end of the beach... away from the crowds.\" She believed, erroneously but sincerely, that the beach in front of the hotel was private. As far as she was concerned, and I agree, she therefore had \"a reasonable expectation of privacy\". But the PCC found against her, stating that though it understood she and Scott were \"uncomfortable at having been photographed... it could do nothing more than apply strictly the terms of the code\". That's an interesting phrase, is it not? It might just have been possible to have applied the code strictly on behalf of Ford by supporting her \"reasonable expectation of privacy\". More pertinently, I think the code needs rewording to stop the abuse. On the other hand, I realise the implications of finding in Ford's favour: if routine newspaper pictures of \"ordinary members of the public\" on a beach or in the street were allowed, it would suggest that celebrities were getting special protection. Ford is now trying to obtain a judicial review of the PCC's decision. Her lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC, will have to convince a judge that the PCC has failed to follow its procedures correctly. Before he does that, he will need to show that the delay in going to court is justified. I understand that the PCC is fairly relaxed about this unprecedented legal move, believing that it cannot be judicially reviewed. If it is, of course, the implications are far-reaching because it calls into question the validity of press self-regulation. Nor is this the only challenge the PCC is facing. In a separate development, two people are also hoping to obtain a judicial review because the PCC refused to adjudicate on their complaint. Ann and Derek Taylor are the parents of two women, Lisa and Michelle, who were convicted in 1992 of murdering Alison Shaughnessy, wife of Michelle's former lover. Less than a year later, the sisters were freed after the court of appeal decided that \"sensational, inaccurate and misleading\" press coverage had seriously prejudiced their trial. He quashed the murder convictions, pointing out that the police's failure to disclose evidence also rendered the convictions unsafe. Indeed, all the evidence against them had been flimsy. But in June last year, the Daily Mail carried a three-page so-called \"damning dossier\" by Jo Ann Goodwin headlined \"Why I believe they are murderers\". The article was based largely on the \"evidence\" of Bernard O'Mahoney, described as \"a 40-year- old gangster who makes no secret of his background\". He had previously befriended the Taylor sisters and, after their release, had an affair with Michelle. After an acrimonious split with her, he later claimed that he had discovered a letter which proved Michelle's guilt, and that she had also confessed to him. Michelle vehemently denied this in a later court action. In spite of this, Goodwin's article accepted O'Mahoney's version of events. According to investigative journalist Nick Davies, who has written widely about the case, her piece \"essentially consisted of a highly partisan reworking of the prosecution case\". He and the Taylor family were outraged that the Mail had given the Taylors very little time to respond to O'Mahoney's allegations. Goodwin called Mrs Taylor the day before publication and had only a brief conversation with her. The result was a one-sided article. Davies supported the Taylors' complaint to the PCC and was as astonished as they were when the commission announced months later, following several exchanges of letters, that it was not able to adjudicate. It cited several reasons: it was unable to decide in a complex case where the truth lay, it was worried about overlapping legal moves, and it thought the proper course was for the case to be adjudicated by a court, as the Taylors could take libel proceedings. Let's look briefly at those excuses, sorry reasons. No one was expecting the PCC to sit in judgment on a murder case. What was at issue was whether Goodwin and the Mail had published a fair and accurate article. There were no legal moves, so that is a red herring. As for the idea of suing for libel, they had no money to do so. Later, the PCC announced it was refusing to accept their complaint because it came from a third party. Why weren't the Taylors told that at the outset? Anyway, they are named in the article and, as leading members of the Taylor 2 campaign, they are materially involved. There is one further point which links the Taylors to Anna Ford and may well also affect Emma Thompson should she complain. The PCC makes much of the fact that it is not a court. It does not hold oral hearings. It does not have powers of investigation. But I cannot help noticing - and there have been other cases I have championed where this has been the case - that when complaints are not upheld, or there is a failure to adjudicate, the PCC is inclined to offer a very narrow, overtly legalistic interpretation of the editors' code. By sticking firmly to the wording as a defence of newspapers' activities, rather than applying the spirit of a code designed to help the public, the PCC is endangering its reputation. What complainants are so concerned about is journalistic ethics. It's a denial of press freedom to ban the picturing of celebrities on public beaches. But does it mean that a well-known person can never be free from a prying camera? Where is the respect for private and family life accorded by the European Convention of Human Rights? OK, so a journalist should have the freedom to write a heavily biased report accusing people of murder. But should it mean that papers bear no burden of responsibility, losing all sense of fairness? After the hype of its tenth birthday bash, the PCC - and the editors' code committee - need to think deeply about their role. It would be richly ironic, would it not, if a changed code outlawed the very pictures which have resulted in Jason Fraser's preposterous \u00a31m appointment to the Express?",
