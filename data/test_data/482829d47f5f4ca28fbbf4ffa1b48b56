  "content": "You might think being left out of a film that portrayed the founders of Facebook as either Machiavellian popularity seekers or myopic chumps would come as a relief to anyone involved in the early years of the site. Not so for hitherto unsung self-proclaimed co-creator Aaron Greenspan, who is so upset at being left out of David Fincher's Oscar-winning The Social Network that he is refusing to give up on a long-running legal battle to win his rightful place in the story. A Massachusetts judge has already dismissed Greenspan's suit against film studio Sony and Random House, which published the book, Ben Mezrich's The Accidental Billionaires, that Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin used for source material. Earlier this week, the former Harvard student filed an appeal claiming copyright infringement, fraud and \"defamation by omission\". Zuckerberg himself is not named as a defendant, but Mezrich is taken to task for allegedly changing Greenspan's name in his book, the adaptation of which won Sorkin the Oscar for best adapted screenplay last year. The plaintiff, who first filed his suit in November 2011, claims he invented \"The Facebook\" in September 2003, months before classmate Zuckerberg. He says he sent a copy of his self-published autobiography Authoritas: One Student's Harvard Admissions and the Founding of the Facebook Era to Random House and was surprised to see a number of similar scenes turning up in The Accidental Billionaires. Judge Robert Collings dismissed all of Greenspan's claims earlier this week, suggesting that any similarities between the two books were \"not so extensive that an ordinary observer could conclude that there was unlawful appropriation\". The Silicon Valley-based entrepreneur is the latest in a long line of Harvard students to claim involvement in the early days of Facebook, which is due to launch on the stock market later this week for a predicted $96bn. Of those, Eduardo Saverin and the Winklevoss twins both appeared in The Social Network, portrayed by Andrew Garfield and Armie Hammer (both twins) respectively. The twins later reached a reported $65m settlement with Facebook and Zuckerberg, while Saverin also settled out of court for an undisclosed sum and is now a billionaire."
