  "content": "On Wednesday, Bafta holds its annual video game awards, allowing people in the industry to taste the sort of glitz, glamour and mutual back-slapping that those in the movie and TV businesses enjoy on a more regular basis. Hosted by comedian and keen gamer Dara O'Briain, it's a big deal for an entertainment medium that often struggles to gain positive mainstream attention. Yet while big-budget blockbusters such as Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Call of Duty: Black Ops (which has so far earned more than $1bn for its publisher Activision) are doubtless set to be celebrated on the night, the awards mask a difficult time for the industry. Many major publishers recorded losses in the final quarter of 2010, with leaders Activision losing $233m and Electronic Arts down $322m. Revenues are down too: the NPD Group estimated US video game software and hardware sales at $18.58bn in 2010, down 6% from the previous year. In the UK, Chart-Track put retail sales of hardware and software at \u00a32.98bn, down from \u00a33.31bn in 2009. Nevertheless, Ray Maguire, the chairman of Bafta's games committee and head of Sony Computer Entertainment UK, says these statistics do not represent the whole picture. \"The online side of the business is not reflected in the figures,\" argues Maguire, who points out that Chart-Track data only refers to retail sales of boxed goods. \"Although the headlines all talked about a decline, actually the industry as a whole is growing \u2013 it is in good health in terms of revenue, and especially in terms of audience reach. It's never been bigger.\" Ian Livingstone, the life president of global games publisher Square Enix, points to the sucess of Facebook games, focusing on Farmville owner Zynga. \"They have 80 million people playing Farmville,\" he says, \"then they launched Cityville on December 1 2010 and within 44 days had 100 million monthly active users. We've seen 50m downloads of Angry Birds, there are 12 million people playing World of Warcraft, 35 million registered for Moshi Monsters.\" Yet whatever the global figures indicate, the UK industry is struggling. Once a leader in game development, Britain is slipping down the international league table. Canada, meanwhile, is offering generous tax credits to technology firms and excellent university courses in games programming. And developers in China and South Korea have benefited from an explosion in the popularity of online multiplayer games. In the UK, in contrast, it is expensive to make games \u2013 wages are comparatively high and the government has refused to offer tax incentives \u2013 and there is a growing skills shortage. Of the universities offering games-related courses only nine out of 141 are accredited by Skillset, the industry body focused on skills and training for the creative industries; many of the rest Livingstone dismisses as little more than lightweight media studies degrees rebranded to attract game fans. In a recent report on the British creative industries, published by Nesta and co-written by Livingstone, the problems were traced back to schools. \"Many years ago the BBC Micro was the cornerstone of computing in the classroom, but since then the emphasis on programming has disappeared,\" he says. \"ICT classes for children means learning Microsoft applications, Word, Excel, Powerpoint \u2013 that doesn' t give them the creative computing skills for high-tech industries.\" This reluctance to introduce gaming in schools is partly down to a long-running image problem. \"We've always been seen as the unruly stepchild of the creative industries,\" Livingstone says. \"The media has tended to concentrate on violent games or on the idea of addiction, and that has a knock-on effect for the industry. Teachers and parents don't see games as a viable career option, politicians distance themselves for fear of rabid headlines.\" This is an area where the involvement of Bafta could help. \"One of the main things we're trying to do at Bafta is show that games are equal to film and television,\" says its head of communications, Thea Cole. \"There is so much benefit to the culture they have developed, and there' s also a blurring of lines between different media now. If we can elevate the status of games, hopefully the effect is that they're taken more seriously.\" Bafta is also taking its message on the road. It holds regular video game discussion and demo events, and runs an annual Young Game Designers competition. But much of the responsibility for improving the industry's image is down to the games themselves. A browse through the Bafta nominations list reveals lots of titles such as Call of Duty and Battlefield: Bad Company 2, which appeal to young males. The worry is that, as the cost of development rises, the industry is becoming less daring and more like today's Hollywood, cancelling original projects and concentrating on \"surefire\" triple-A prospects, which usually means sequels and shooters. Unsurprisingly, Maguire rejects this. \"As a platform holder, we have a duty to push the boundaries \u2013 we will take gambles on different experiences. Console technology has given us the ability to tell stories in a better, deeper way. In our own case with Heavy Rain, that's a narrative-driven game \u2013 we're opening up new avenues of creativity.\" Innovative products are now also emerging from the growing indie sector. Thanks to broadband internet and digital distribution, small studios can find a worldwide audience. A key example has been Minecraft, an offbeat construction game, created by lone coder Markus Persson, which has been downloaded over a million times. But the awards event itself \u2013 as a spectacle worth watching \u2013 has a vital role in attracting mainstream interest. Previous attempts to broadcast the proceedings have been flawed, presented by hip young things who knew nothing about gaming. \"Dara O'Briain was the first to go, 'actually, games are great',\" says Maguire. \"That's lifted the whole awards up.\" And after last year, the industry certainly needs a good night."
