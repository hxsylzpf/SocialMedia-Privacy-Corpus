  "content": "Snapchat is to get a weekly football \"TV show\" made by digital football network Copa90 and sports site Bleacher Report. James Kirkham, the head of Copa90, says that the new weekly show on Snapchat Discover will look \"nothing like telly\" instead it has been developed to fit with the ethos and style of Snapchat and its youthful users. \"We want to give this [Snapchat] generation of football fans a show that resonates with them and contemporary viewing habits,\" said Kirkham. \"It's a mad, fast paced, high octane, visually arresting feast on the senses combining video animation and typography too \u2013 borrowing the language and grammar of a generation weaned on Snapchat then dialling it up even more.\" British-based Copa90, part of the YouTube Originals channels commissioned in 2012, has no rights to football games or highlights instead building a huge following by reporting on football away from the pitch. The now multi-platform business, which has more than 11 million global subscribers across sites including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube, uses the strapline \"For Fans, by Fans\". The new show, which launches in the UK on Saturday on Bleacher Report's Snapchat Discover platform, will air once a week throughout the football season. \"By creating a weekly show exclusively on Snapchat, we're developing a product that appeals to millennial football fans and through a platform they are frequenting to consume such content,\" said James Grigg, director of global operations at Bleacher Report, which is owned by Turner Broadcasting. In August, NBC Universal struck a deal with Snapchat to make original programming based on its key shows, such as Saturday Night Live, The Voice and The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon, available on the disappearing-messages app. Snapchat also launched its own show, Good Luck America, about the US elections, presented by ex-CNN reporter Peter Hamby, now head of news at Snapchat. Snapchat users are becoming increasingly engaged with visual and video content on the platform. During the Rio Olympics more than half of its 10m daily active users in the UK watched Snapchat's Live Stories coverage, a collaboration with the BBC. The Live Stories were a compilation of snaps taken by Snapchatters at an event or place at the Olympics, then curated by Snapchat, allowing users to give their point of view to the story to build a community. Earlier this week, a report by eMarketer forecast that Snapchat's global ad revenue is set to more than double next year to reach almost $1bn."
