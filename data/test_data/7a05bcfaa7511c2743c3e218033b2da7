  "content": "Twittering celebrities \u2013 we think we're getting an \"in\" to the otherwise heavily fortified inner sanctum of their dazzling lives. But after the revelation by the New York Times that rapper 50 Cent gets his web guru Chris Romero to send tweets to his 200,000 followers, how can we be so sure? Perhaps the penny should have dropped when Fiddy tweeted on 1 March \"My ambition leads me through a tunnel that never ends\". I mean, come on. But it took the NYT to spell out that the glass ceiling of public relations that separates the plebs and those in the land of milk and honey is still firmly in place. So could this spell the end of the short-lived joy we all took from getting what we thought was an intimate little look inside the lives of the rich and famous? I'm disenchanted. And yes, it really is me writing, not my Passepartout. Can we really be sure that tennis ace Andy Murray was planning a steak dinner last night? Or that Stephen Fry is definitely is in Indonesia? And more importantly, is this shot of Demi Moore's bum real \u2013 or did she employ a botty double? It could belong to anyone. Vital questions need asking: can we still trust the words of twittering celebs? More pressing still, what would one call someone who ghosts tweets? Recommendations please."
