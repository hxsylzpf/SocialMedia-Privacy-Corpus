  "content": "The next madcap plan to evolve from Twitter is Twitchhiker, which will see freelance writer (and some time Guardian contributor) Paul Smith blag his way from Newcastle to New Zealand powered only by Twitter. The rules, as far as they exist: He's leaving on 1 March and will only be accepting direct offers of travel and accommodation that are Twittered to him. He can't make plans further than three days ahead. He can only spend money on food, drink and souvenirs. If he has more than one offer, he can choose but if there's only one, he has to take it. And if he's stuck in one place for two days, he has to give up and go home. The idea came to him in the supermarket. It's the kind of idea that if he doesn't try, someone else will. And the money he raises (\u00a3626 so far) will go to charity:water. So far he's had 4 offers of lifts out of the UK, somewhere to stay in Hamburg and India and a lift in an avocado truck in New Zealand. It was just a little idea until Stephen Fry twittered it... More from Paul on Guardian Travel. We'll wait and see whether the 'human search engine' that is Twitter can really power someone to the other side of the world..."
