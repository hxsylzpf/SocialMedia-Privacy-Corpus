  "content": "With the negative press that charities have received over the last year, it is more important than ever for the sector's leaders to stand up for themselves and show how their organisations are making a difference. To recognise the efforts of those that are, in 2013 I set up, along with digital consultant Matt Collins, the Top 30 Charity CEOs on Social Media Awards. This year the nominations rose by 50% \u2013 which alone shows how charity leaders are increasingly growing in confidence with digital. Our winners, announced today, are using social media in ever more sophisticated ways, discussing key issues about their causes and the sector, championing and offering support to beneficiaries and demonstrating impact through storytelling. They're confident about blending the professional and personal, using humour (where appropriate) and have a warm and authentic tone of voice to engage followers. Their social media presence shows how charities are still fighting to make a difference and are undaunted in campaigning for social change. Their work could help reclaim the narrative of our sector, one tweet at a time.
