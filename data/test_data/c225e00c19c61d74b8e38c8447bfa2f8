  "content": "When the Pope joined Twitter last month, the Vatican said his aim was to \"begin dialogue\" with ordinary men and women all over the world. His messages came down in eight different languages, and his followers soon totalled 2.5 million. From Sunday, it has been revealed, he will also be tweeting in Latin. Within hours of the announcement, the Twitter username @pontifex_ln had nearly 2,000 followers. Countering the scepticism of those who suggest the universal Church's official language might not be an obvious tool for spontaneous exchange and debate, Manlio Simonetti, a professor in Christian history, told L'Osservatore Romano: \"Latin \u2026 is very well suited to the brevity necessary on new social networks, even more so than English.\" Roberto Spataro, secretary of the Pontifical Academy for Latin Studies, which Benedict XVI founded last year, agreed, telling the Vatican's semi-official newspaper: \"Twitter is a tool which requires rapid communication,\" he said. \"In English you say 'the corruption of the best one is horrible'; in Latin, three words suffice: 'corrupt optima pessima'. It is a language which helps to think with precision and sobriety. And it has produced an exceptional heritage of science, knowledge and faith.\" The Pope's tweets have so far been confined to the sphere of the living language and sent out in English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Polish, Arabic and Portuguese. His first post as Benedictus PP. XVI will be published on Sunday."
