  "content": "Former US newspaper editor John Robinson, who now teaches journalists, writes about newspapers charging for online newspaper access: \"As more newspapers move to paywalls, it comes clearer to me that publishers are attempting to use a band-aid to cover a bullet hole.\" To illustrate his point he relates an anecdote about asking his class of 20-year-old students at Elon University in North Carolina how many were on Facebook: \"All 33 raised their hands. Many of them suggested they were addicted to the social network... I asked how many would pay $1 a month for Facebook membership. All raised their hands. 'Five dollars?' I asked. A few dropped out. 'Ten dollars a month?' I asked. Nearly every hand stayed down. 'No one?' I said. 'I thought you guys were addicted?' A student piped up with an explanation: 'Someone will invent something else to take its place that is free.'\" Robinson adds that when he shared this anecdote with a newspaper executive he was \"dismissive\", saying: \"They aren't our readers anyway.\" Robinson, clearly unconvinced by such a response, argues that \"college-educated, inquisitive, relatively well-to-do young people\" should form a key part of a newspaper's audience. But paywalls put them off. He continues: \"I can understand paywalls as a leaky short-term strategy, catching some newspaper readers who are addicted to their local papers. But without significant 'value-added' content, that won't last. Paywalls can't be a long-term strategy; the audience will not be there.\" One commenter to his blog - Canadian journalism tutor Mark Hamilton - writes: \"I did a similar exercise in a media economics course, when I asked the class how much they were willing/able to spend for all media (of any kind) every month. For the majority, it was somewhere between $5 and zero.\" And I've asked that question of my City University London students too, with similar results. However, though I remain unconvinced by the paywall strategy, I readily concede that students may well change their minds in future (as they do about so many things).
