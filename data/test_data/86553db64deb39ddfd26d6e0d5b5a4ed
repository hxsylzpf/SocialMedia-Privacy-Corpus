  "content": "As news of Gough Whitlam's death spread there was a steady stream of the expected tributes. Politicians doffing their metaphorical hats, Labor members grieving the loss of a hero who spanned generations and conservatives politely recalling what they deemed good policy. In the midst of the usual mourners sprang up two simple hashtags #thanksgough and #thankyougough on Twitter where users from all walks of life started listing Whitlam's achievements and in a lot of cases, how his reforms had impacted upon their lives."
