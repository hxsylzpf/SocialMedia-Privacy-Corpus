  "content": "In the lead up to tonight's Emmy awards, celebrities have already gotten the party started. Of course, they've been documenting their antics on social media all day long. While some like Heidi Klum and Retta have been documenting their transformation into red carpet goddesses, some, like the cast of Breaking Bad, have been a little more unorthodox with their Emmy prep. Clearly, Netflix's Emmys party bus is the place to be. Since the internet service is home to two of this year's hottest shows, Orange is the New Black and House of Cards, the two ensemble casts carpooled to the Emmys. What they saved in greenhouse gas emissions, they more than made up for with selfies. The men of House of Cards also took the chance to show off their dapper accessories for the evening. Meanwhile, Aaron Paul started early with a champagne breakfast... ... Before sending his fans (to whom he's unusually devoted) on a scavenger hunt across Los Angeles. Heidi Klum, who already looked perfect, documented her transformation from supermodel into ...a supermodel, with a cameo by Zac Posen. Retta, on the other hand, preferred to fly solo. We'll be scouring social media for the most ridiculous celebrity dispatches from the Emmys. Follow our live blog for updates throughout the evening!"
