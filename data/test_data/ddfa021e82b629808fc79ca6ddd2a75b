  "content": "Always the innovator, even after death, David Bowie's final album, Blackstar, is set to be turned into an Instagram miniseries that begins this week. Entitled Unbound, the \"InstaMiniSeries\" consists of 16episodes that provide \"visual interpretations\" of the album. It will star Rookie Magazine founder Tavi Gevinson and Six Feet Under's Patricia Clarkson. According to a post on the site, Carolynn Cecilia and Nikki Borge, who wrote and directed the series for the social network, were given music from his 28th studio album so that they could create the episodes \"with no limits or preconditions on his part\". It takes the audience \"on a journey of evocative images inspired by the moods suggested in the album's music, lyrics and artwork\". Following Bowie's death on 10 January, many fans discovered a new narrative on the Blackstar record: pop obsessives gleaned cryptic clues about his death, with its title, track names, videos and artwork all said to offer insight into the artist's acceptance of death. Below is a trailer for the series, its gothic mood evoked by dreamlike choreography and a dark, eerie library backdrop. The series premieres on 25 February, with a new episode every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday."
