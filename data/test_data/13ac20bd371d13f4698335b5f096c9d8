  "content": "Hello! Here I am waving at you from my platform. This platform may be print, it may be on your laptop, it may be on your phone. It may be retweeted or have popped up as a Facebook share. It may be a link you ignore. Underneath this platform, zillions of people who feel they don't have enough of a platform will explain in their made-up names why this is the most pointless thing they have ever read. Their opinion matters. If they can squash it into 140 characters they may tweet me some hate. Usually some sub-Chomskian nonsense about Jeremy Corbyn and the dead-tree press. They will mostly agree with each other ... so that's nice. Such is the media now. All media is social media and everyone is a critic. We live in constant TripAdvisor mode. I am a hotel that did not impress you much. I am the Uber driver you only gave two stars to. I am a waste of space that you could not even be bothered to read, simply to slag off. Because there is no comment without comment. If a column is not retweeted does it even exist? If I want \"real life\" I pull back from Twitter \u2013 increasingly a circle-jerk of men arguing about the Labour party or people engaged in bland self-promotion \u2013 and I go on Facebook. As Twitter's growth stalls, Facebook's continues. I can't say I am surprised. There, I find it possible to disagree without anyone threatening to kill me or my children. I find this reassuring. As I don't work in an office, I like the mundane chats, the silly jokes, the music. Sure, I will never get over the amount of cats and babies; though I have had both, I find them essentially boring. But I am not a fascist and accept this is something people do. Though I would no more photograph my cat than sext Philip Hammond. Mostly I show off or moan. Both are pleasurable. But increasingly I find the moral superiority about quitting social media in favour of real life somewhat grating. What does this even mean? The idea of \"really sharing\" as opposed to larking about online? This is usually accompanied by a parental rant about kids living on their phones, their lives mediated and somehow unlived. It is as if my generation spent their childhoods climbing trees instead of being passively plonked on the sofa watching godawful telly presented by paedophiles. Sure there is a level of performance to social media. The sucking in of cheeks and stomachs and the constant presentation of femininity as something that needs to be \"liked\" was not invented by Instagram. Instead of tutting, educate your children about consent over imagery and explain that Google is not a primary source. Yet we have this stupid anxiety because we cannot admit that social media is not the binary opposite of real life. It is real life. This is why studies such as the latest one from Denmark somehow just perpetuate this smugness. Half the participants were given access to Facebook, the other half went cold turkey for a week. Those who had a break felt \"55% less stressed\". Comparing ourselves with our peers causes unhappiness, you see. May I just add here that the Danes, though materially well off, have high rates of depression. The study showed those who quit Facebook felt less lonely and more connected to real people. These sorts of studies strike me as self-satisfied. Sure, take a break. A social media detox. Drink your Nutribullet green gunge instead of photographing it. Help the old lady next door. Have some spiritual connection instead of joking with friends who aren't even \"real\" online. After all, you have free choice over these free apps. If you are \"addicted\" and can no longer function, work or have relationships, then there is a problem. But this addiction model is questionable. Are we addicted to televison, reading, music? Why is chatting so bad? Why is having so much access to so much information dangerous? I can sit with the same old friend and have the same old conversation, or I can play with new people who tell me new things. Both are real. Both can be brilliant. If Twitter is stagnating, then it is partly to do with its failure to deal with abuse but also its infantilisation of users. Do I want to \"heart\" a picture of some drowning refugees? No I don't. Facebook, meanwhile, is bombarding us with ads, but it is also giving us a little more control over which \"friends\" see what. The point is that none of this is compulsory. You may connect or not. You may show off or not. You may find love or not. You may or may not win the popularity contest. For this, I am afraid, is essentially life. So don't bore me with your self-imposed sabbaticals; I accept you are a better person than me, who fully connects in a deeper way than I can manage. For I am quite happy on social media, waving not drowning. My friends there will come and rescue me if I need help. For we have only connected."
