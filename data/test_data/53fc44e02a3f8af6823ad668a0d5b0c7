  "content": "An internet startup says it is considering legal action against Microsoft, after the world's biggest software company admitted stealing its code. Earlier this week internet messaging company Plurk accused Microsoft's MSN China operation of lifting code directly from its own program for use in a rival product. After a brief investigation, Microsoft responded by confirming that it had stolen elements of Plurk's system and apologising - blaming a Chinese developer hired by MSN China for the transgression. \"The vendor has now acknowledged that a portion of the code they provided was indeed copied,\" it said. \"This was in clear violation of the vendor's contract with the MSN China joint venture, and equally inconsistent with Microsoft's policies respecting intellectual property.\" An apology may not be enough for the two-year old startup, however, which said that it was looking at \"the full extent of our legal options\" as a remedy. \"We are currently looking at all possibilities on how to move forward in response to Microsoft's recent apology statement,\" said co-founder Alvin Woon in a blog post today. \"We are still thinking of pursuing the full extent of our legal options available due the seriousness of the situation. Basically, Microsoft accepts responsibility, but they do not offer accountability.\" The MSN product, Juku, has been suspended pending further investigation, but Woon took particular issue with the extent that it relied on code stolen from his own team. \"This event wasn't just a simple matter of merely lifting code,\" he wrote. \"Due to the nature of the uniqueness of our product and user interface, it took a good amount of deliberate studying and digging through our code with the full intention of replicating our product user experience, functionality and end results. This product was later launched and heavily promoted by Microsoft with its big marketing budget.\" Plurk, a messaging service along the same lines as Twitter, is registered in Canada but operates a small staff of around seven people worldwide. It has significant numbers of users across Asia, and claims particularly strong following in countries like Taiwan. Faced with a corporate leviathan attempting to muscle in on its territory, Woon said Plurk wanted to stand up for the rights of small companies. \"We write our own code and give back to the community when it is appropriate,\" he added. \"We play the fair game hoping, like many young entrepreneurs out there, to be able to someday help solve other people's problems and grow our little company.\"",
