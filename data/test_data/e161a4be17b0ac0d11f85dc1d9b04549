  "content": "Sienna Miller has reached a settlement with an agency of paparazzi photographers over claims of harassment and invasion of privacy. The actor had sued Big Pictures and its founder Darryn Lyons over what she described as intolerable intrusions by pursuing photographers. Yesterday the agency agreed to pay \u00a353,000 in damages and costs as part of a settlement. It includes an undertaking that the agency will not pursue Miller - by car, motorcycle or on foot - or \"doorstep\" her at her home or that of her family. The agency will be allowed to take pictures when she goes to bars, nightclubs or restaurants, is out in public, or at a \"red carpet\" event. Miller's first legal action, for harassment, was bought by her lawyers, Carter-Ruck, against Big Pictures. The tailing of Miller, between June and September this year, resulted in the publication of 23 photographs. Lyons and Big Pictures agreed to pay \u00a337,000 damages and court costs to settle the harassment claim. The second action, for invasion of privacy, related to shots taken of Miller on a boat in Italy earlier this year that were published in the Sun and News of the World. Big Pictures procured and syndicated the pictures in July. The defendants agreed to pay \u00a316,000 in damages as well as legal costs to settle the privacy claim.The case was due to come to trial at the high court in London in January but her counsel, David Sherborne, told Mr Justice Eady the two sides had reached agreement. Earlier this month, Miller reached an out-of-court settlement against the Sun and News of the World for invasion of privacy over the publication of the articles and images. The News International subsidiary News Group Newspapers paid \u00a335,000 in damages as well as legal costs. The articles and images included coverage of Miller's alleged relationship with Balthazar Getty soon after she broke off a relationship with the Welsh actor Rhys Ifans."
