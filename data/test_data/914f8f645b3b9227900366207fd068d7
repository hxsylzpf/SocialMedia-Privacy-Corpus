  "content": "Your report on the Data Protection Act (PM seeks retreat on bill to outlaw press spying, April 1) did not mention that the media industry is absolutely united in its opposition to jail sentences for journalists for breaches of the act, especially as the threat of unlimited fines already lies on the statute books. All newspapers, local, regional, national - including the Guardian - and the major television outlets are opposed to the idea of two-year sentences for journalists doing their job. Let it be stressed that the industry unequivocally condemns payments to private detectives illegally \"blagging\" private information, but the Data Protection Act is drawn so widely that a journalist's first steps in checking a story - which may or may not be of public interest - could be a breach of the act. The chilling effect on responsible journalism of the threat of jail goes without saying. While the industry is doing all it can to address the concerns of the information commissioner, it is vital that those who believe in the freedom of the media oppose this draconian and disproportionate measure. Bob Satchwell Executive director, Society of Editors Your report makes mention of the intended increased penalties for private detectives as well as journalists. It is absolutely right that the government rethink some of the measures that have been suggested. While it is laudable for the information commissioner to seek to stop the illegal market in personal information, the law must also take into account efforts by both journalists and corporate investigators to defeat fraud, corruption and other criminality. At a time when many victims of financial crime cannot obtain proper investigative assistance from public authorities because of limited resources, City law firms, financial institutions and business generally must resort to corporate investigators - most of whom would be happy to be licensed, providing that licensing is accompanied by sensible legislation. Careful reading of last summer's consultation document suggests that there is little understanding in government circles of what is sensible. While the public interest is clearly served by good journalism, it is equally well served by good private investigations that save shareholders and consumers millions of pounds every year by assisting business to prevent or detect crime. By all means, create sanctions for abuse of personal information, but let the law recognise that serious journalism and serious private investigation serve useful and necessary roles. The government should not criminalise or impede those who enable the public and business to cope more effectively with an ever-increasing level of criminal activity. Jeff Katz Chief executive, Bishop International Ltd"
