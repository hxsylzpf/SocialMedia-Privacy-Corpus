  "content": "I so enjoy the concern from their supposed elders and betters about the so-called \"Facebook generation\". The latest example is a debate at the Sunday Times/Wellington College festival of education. A high-profile panel will ponder the question: \"What do we need to teach the Facebook generation?\" Should there not be an alternative on offer: \"What can we learn from the Facebook generation?\" At least one of the panel, the new media technologist Ben Hammersley, might well take that line. Among the other speakers are academics Niall Ferguson and Sarah Churchwell, journalist Jenni Russell and impresario Harvey Goldsmith. The discussion, curated by Editorial Intelligence, will be chaired by Anthony Seldon, the master of Wellington College. It takes place at Wellington College from 5pm on Sunday 26 June. I'm not certain if there are tickets available, but you can obtain more information by emailing EducationFestival@wellingtoncollege.org.uk or calling 01344 444257.",
