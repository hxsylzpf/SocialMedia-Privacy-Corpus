  "content": "You might think Britney Spears would be busy enough at the moment, what with judging on US X Factor \u2013 with a relieving degree of aplomb, as it turns out \u2013 and joining forces with Will.i.am for new single Scream &amp; Shout, their ambitious joint bid to break the record for Most Execrable Single of All Time. But Britney has somehow found time not only to purchase a new dog but to set up a Twitter account in its name. \"I want you all to meet my new baby girl,\" Britney announced earlier this week, before sending her 22.1 million Twitter followers in the direction of @hannahspears, an account apparently run by the canine celebrity. Several days later, Hannah's own follower count stands at less than 15,000, which is not a conversion rate likely to excite any potential investors in a Britney-themed zoo, but it's a start. So far the tweets have concerned themselves with the business of being a dog (\"What should I chase today \u2013 squirrel or chipmunk?\", \"Pee'd on mom's rug\", \"Woof!\") but Lost in Showbiz hopes that as the days and weeks tick by, Hannah Spears will adopt a voice strangely close to one expressing opinions that Britney \u2013 due to being Britney \u2013 cannot. Anything like: \"I wonder if mom's regretting that hopeless Will.i.am single?\" before the end of the year would be great, thanks."
