  "content": "Lawyers for a former royal servant whose identity the Guardian wants to reveal succeeded in keeping the case behind closed doors at the high court in London yesterday. Desmond Browne QC, for the former Palace employee, persuaded Mr Justice Tugenhat to hear sensitive material in closed court, including details of an interview by the Mail on Sunday with another ex-royal servant, which it was stopped from publishing by an injunction last Saturday. On Monday night the Guardian was about to name the individual who had obtained the injunction when he won another court order to prevent publication. The Guardian is challenging the continuation of the injunction, granted on the grounds that the story was libellous, because the newspaper argues it is an infringement of freedom of expression. It is rare for injunctions to be handed out by the courts in libel cases ahead of publication. Such \"prior restraint\" has generally been frowned on. Although the judge agreed that the more sensitive parts of his application to continue the injunction should be heard in private, the legal arguments are expected to be heard in open court today. Mr Browne told the judge yesterday he was applying to continue the injunction granted on Monday evening by Mr Justice Henriques. He added: \"My application is that this hearing is going to have to be in private and in order to make that application I must - regrettably, the press may feel - ask your lordship to go into private.\" Before asking the media to leave, the judge said that, given the public interest, he was reluctant to direct that the entirety of the injunction hearing should be in private. Mr Browne said the judge would not be blind to the rights to reputation and family life involved in the case. Adrienne Page QC, for Guardian Newspapers Ltd, said the problem could be resolved by imposing reporting restrictions. \"This is a matter of enormous interest to the press and vitally affects what it may or may not report. \"It's extremely unsatisfactory in those circumstances... that the press wanting to cover the argument and the issues weren't present for an important part of that.\"",
