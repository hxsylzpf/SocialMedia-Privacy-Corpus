  "content": "Leeds will make rugby history in Friday's televised Super League game against Hull when their players wear shirts showing their Twitter handles rather than their names \u2013 with one exception. Ryan Bailey, the former Great Britain prop, has been banned by the Rugby Football League from displaying his Twitter name, @Hayemaker16, because it might be seen as encouraging violence, given the obvious link to the controversial boxer David Haye. However, that will not stop the Rhinos launching a range of merchandise with Bailey's Hayemaker handle in their club shop. The Rhinos have more than 18,000 Twitter followers and two of their players, the England internationals Rob Burrow and Jamie Peacock, have more than that, and the club's media and PR manager Phil Daly said: \"We are always looking for ways to innovate and spread the word about Leeds Rhinos. With over 500 million users on Twitter worldwide it is massive around the globe and a tremendous vehicle for us to grow our brand.\" Leeds will also be wearing a green and silver shirt as part of their third annual Armed Forces Day game, to help raise awareness and funds for the Royal Navy &amp; Royal Marine Charity. Their players will not be the first to display their Twitter handles, as the Spanish football team Valencia did so in one game last year, and the FA Women's Super League allow one player in each team to do so. But this is thought to be a first in rugby.",
