  "content": "How not to organise a social media campaign ... House PR's attempt to dragoon hacks into tweeting about event sponsor MasterCard UK in return for Brit awards accreditation backfired spectacularly Wednesday, after the Telegraph's Mandrake diarist Tim Walker blew the whistle to Press Gazette (this is separate from being accredited directly to cover the Brits, which is being handled by another agency, Dawbell PR). Angry hacks and others used the #PricelessSurprises hashtag set up by House PR as part of its MasterCard campaign to express their displeasure. By lunchtime House PR had done the sensible thing and told Walker he could attend the Brits with no conditions. Inevitably, he then asked Twitter: \"What should I do folks?\" House PR managing director Ginny Paton told Press Gazette that a PR agency's role was to \"pursue all coverage opportunities on behalf of its clients\", including providing accurate brand references. This involved a \"two-way conversation between the journalist and the PR ... editorial control always remains with the journalist\". Walker later told BBC Radio 4's World at One he would be attending with the sponsor, while refusing to mention MasterCard on air. He said such exchanges between hacks and flacks about any strings attached to invites were \"normally much more subtle, normally done in a much more gentlemanly way\", but when it became like being required to sign a contract, \"that crosses a line\"."
