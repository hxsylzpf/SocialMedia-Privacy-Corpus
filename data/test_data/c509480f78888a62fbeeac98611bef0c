  "content": "Tim Berners-Lee thinks the internet deserves its own bill of rights. Twenty-five years after writing a draft proposal about what would later become the world wide web \u2013 and one day after describing his proposal of an internet 'Magna Carta' to the Guardian's Jemima Kiss \u2013 Berners-Lee took his idea to an interested audience: the denizens of Reddit's Ask Me Anything section. A refresher from Kiss's Tuesday exclusive: Berners-Lee's Magna Carta plan is to be taken up as part of an initiative called \"the web we want\", which calls on people to generate a digital bill of rights in each country \u2013 a statement of principles he hopes will be supported by public institutions, government officials and corporations. \"Unless we have an open, neutral internet we can rely on without worrying about what's happening at the back door, we can't have open government, good democracy, good healthcare, connected communities and diversity of culture. It's not naive to think we can have that, but it is naive to think we can just sit back and get it.\" Berners-Lee fielded questions from Reddit users about the importance of net neutrality and gave his views about the actions of Edward Snowden. But he also answered for his bad spelling and an apparent lack of foresight into what would become the internet's extreme interest in all things feline. We've collected some of the highlights below: mart95123: Edward Snowden \u2013 hero or villain? Because he \u2713 had no other alternative \u2713 engaged as a journalist / with a journalist to be careful of how what was released, and \u2713 provided an important net overall benefit to the world, I think he should be protected, and we should have ways of protecting people like him. Because we can try to design perfect systems of government, and they will never be perfect, and when they fail, then the whistleblower may be all that saves society. misanthrope: What are your thoughts on the increased surveillance on internet based mediums like GCHQ's monitoring of all the Yahoo video chats. Do you personally think it should be controlled, non existent or fine the way it is now? I think that some monitoring of the net by government agencies is going to be needed to fight crime. We need to invent a new system of checks and balances with unprecedented power to be able to investigate and hold the agencies which do it accountable to the public. FLYINGSPAGHETTEESHIR: Tim, What other names did you consider other than the world wide web? Mine of Information, The Information Mine, The Mesh ... None had quite the right ring. I liked WWW partly because I could start global variable names with a W and not have them clash with other peoples' (in a C world) ...in fact I used HT for them) totharescue: What was one of the things you never thought the internet would be used for, but has actually become one of the main reasons people use the internet?\ufeff Kittens. wobetmit: Do you think in the (not too distant) future we'll look back and think ourselves lucky to have witnessed a neutral, free, and uncensored world wide web? I think it is up to us. I'm not guessing, I'm hoping. Yes, I can imagine that all to easily. If ordinary web users are not sufficiently aware of threats and get involved and if necessary take to the streets like for SOPA and PIPA and ACTA. On balance? I am optimistic. jron: ... What impact, if any, do you think digital currencies might have on how value is sent over the Internet? I think that it is important to have lots of different ways getting money to creative people on the net. So if we can have micropayment user interfaces which make it easy for me to pay people for stuff they write, play, perform, etc, in small amounts, then I hope that could be a way allowing people to actually make a serious business out of it. Flattr I found an interesting move in that direction."
