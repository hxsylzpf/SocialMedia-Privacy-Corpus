  "content": "Last week it was the refreshed design and improved navigation with just a suggestion of Facebookishness. This week - ahead of being completely gutted and reborn in the Autumn - MySpace's strategy for competing with Facebook appears to be 'if you can't beat them, join them'. Photo by bixentro on Flickr. Some rights reserved MySpace users can now sync their updates to Facebook, in much the same way that Twitter users can cross-post to Facebook. MySpace users will notice that the share options next to their status updates now offer Twitter and Facebook; click through, and you're taken to Facebook's permission requests page. It means that every status update, photo, video, games and link posted on mySpace will be posted on Facebook too. Note that the reciprocal arangement isn't quite there; you can't cross-post from Facebook to MySpace as yet. comScore estimated MySpace traffic was about 61 million monthly users in the US during July, compared to 146 million for Facebook. So it may be trailing in second place, but that's a very healthy audience. We await this Autumn's overhaul with interest; it's all about the music."
