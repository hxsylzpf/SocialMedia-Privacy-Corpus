  "content": "David Cameron and George Osborne threw a protective arm around Andy Coulson today as the Tory high command insisted that their communications director would not be forced to stand down. Amid unease among some backbenchers at the party's determination to stand by Coulson, Cameron, the Tory leader and Osborne, shadow chancellor, praised Coulson for \"upright\" conduct in his work for the party. The leadership decided on Wednesday, soon after the story broke on theguardian.com, that they would protect Coulson, a key member of the Cameron and Osborne inner circle. A message was sent out that there was \"no question\" of removing Coulson after he reiterated an undertaking he had given in the lengthy negotiations which preceded his appointment as communications chief in 2007. Coulson made clear once again that he knew nothing of the phone hacking at the News of the World but had resigned as editor because he took ultimate, but not personal, responsibility. \"There was extensive due diligence done into Andy before he was appointed,\" one senior party figure said. \"It became clear that he had paid a price by standing down as editor. That is the line we are sticking to.\" A bullish Tory leadership intensified its defence of Coulson today by sanctioning an aggressive attack on the Guardian and the Labour party after the Metropolitan police said they would be taking no action over the phone hacking. Tory sources were so sure of Coulson's position that they issued a point-by-point rebuttal of the Guardian's claims. They said the Guardian had uncovered nothing new, apart from the payment to Taylor. \"Little is new,\" a source said of the Guardian reports. \"Much of its claims have already been considered by the Metropolitan police, the information commissioner and the high court.\" The Tory leadership decided to rally round Coulson for three broad reasons: \u2022 Cameron believes Coulson is an invaluable asset, who has played a key role in sharpening the Tories' act in the last two years. \u2022 Losing such a senior figure would raise questions about Cameron's judgment. \u2022 A determination not to allow Labour \u2013 which was severely damaged by the resignation of Damian McBride, an adviser to Gordon Brown \u2013 to exploit the new allegations to damage the Tories. Cameron agreed to step up the Tory operation to protect Coulson after finding himself in the rare position this morning of having to answer hostile questions on his doorstep. The Tory leader, who has enjoyed a relatively easy ride in the media over the last two years, criticised the News of the World for invading people's privacy and said it was right that Coulson had taken ultimate \u2013 but not personal \u2013 responsibility by resigning as editor. \"Of course I knew about that resignation before offering him the job,\" Cameron said. \"But I believe in giving people a second chance. As director of communications for the Conservatives, he does an excellent job in a proper, upright way at all times.\" Osborne spoke in almost identical terms. \"Andy Coulson has conducted his job in a totally upright and proper manner and will continue to do so,\" he said. While the leadership is determined to protect Coulson, there is unease in the party on two levels. \u2022 Some MPs fear that the continuing revelations about the News of the World's tactics could mean that Coulson will break a famous rule established by Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's director of communications. This states that a press officer is finished the moment they become the story. One senior Tory said: \"This is a breathtaking story. What the hell has happened? Andy Coulson seems to have a very narrow definition of what he did and did not know. I can't imagine as editor he did not know what was happening.\" \u2022 Some backbenchers said the decision to stand by Coulson highlighted a pattern of behaviour by Cameron: that he protects members of his inner circle while doing little to support other Conservatives. There was particular anger at Cameron's claim that he believed in giving people a second chance, something he did not show to veteran Tory MPs who were ordered to stand down by the leadership when embarrassing details of their expenses were published. \"There does seem to be one rule for the golden circle and another for everyone else,\" a senior MP said. \"Sir Peter Viggers [MP for Gosport] made a silly claim for a duck island which was actually refused. But he was told as soon as the story appeared that he would have to stand down as an MP. Is that fair?\"",
