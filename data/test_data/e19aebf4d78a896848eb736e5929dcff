  "content": "The story Mario Monti So arrivederci, Berlusconi, buongiorno, Mario Monti, who has just been made an unelected senator for life, so that he can in fairly short order become prime minister. That's the equivalent of us making Peter Mandelson supreme overlord of the day as well as of the night, and obviously a democratic triumph. Monti has glasses, grey hair and a sober air. It's a relief until you realise the imminent lack of bunga bunga is going to destroy Italy's service sector and plunge Europe into yet further chaos. He hasn't revealed his plans yet \u2013 sensible, as you don't want to frighten anyone with actual facts, knowledge or comprehension of the problem. But he has created a government of experts, including bankers, professors and admirals, which means cabinet meetings should not be held in any libraries with candlesticks, rope or lead piping nearby. But who will Angela/Nicolas be able to relieve the tensions of EU diplomacy by laughing at now? Reports are that David Cameron is fingering his collar more sweatily by the day. The stat 1 million The number of unemployed young people that was reached this week! And we're only a few months into Dave and the Gidiot's grand plan! Come on, boys, let's see if you can make it two million before the term is out \u2013 step lively! We've every faith in you. The quote Patrick Mercer \"The worst politician in history since William Gladstone \u2026 a despicable creature without any redeeming features.\" Tory MP Patrick Mercer's alleged remarks about the PM at a publishing party. Since denied, and yet they have such a ring of truth about them, no? The tweet @SalmanRushdie \"Victory! #Facebook has buckled! I'm Salman Rushdie again. I feel SO much better. An identity crisis at my age is no fun. Thank you Twitter!\" The author wins his argument with Facebook about being allowed to use his middle rather than first name (Ahmed).",
