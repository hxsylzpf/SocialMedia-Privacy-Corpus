  "content": "\u2022 As December lubes itself up in the calendar's birth canal, the world and its dog is gearing up for Christmas: not least online retailers, who are looking forward to record sales despite the recession. November 30th is what they call (rather anachronistically) \"Cyber Monday\" in the United States, but the positive signs are already around - last Friday was a record-breaker for PayPal, while Activision said that the Call of Duty franchise had surpassed $3bn in sales. \u2022 Here's one you can expect to get picked up by as an example of How the Internet is Destroying Society: a report from the New York Daily News detailing how some of the city's gangs are using Twitter. A variety of groups are throwing out taunts and exchanging insults online, which (of course) is the sort of thing that will raise the hackles of anti-net doomers who don't realise that kids will use whatever tools are at hand to give each other grief. The article quotes local police as saying it's actually handy, since they're able to sift through the site for records and evidence. \u2022 After plenty of talk about Amazon's Kindle over recent months, here's an interesting post from John Battelle, who says that he got one as a gift but doesn't want to read books on it. His reasoning, basically, is that Amazon has turned books into a piece of data, not a social object that can be shared and enjoyed with others. Having ploughed through a succession of books - and then given most of them away - while on holiday over the past couple of weeks, I think he's onto something.
