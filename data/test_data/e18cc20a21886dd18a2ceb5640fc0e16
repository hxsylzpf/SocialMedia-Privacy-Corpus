  "content": "Last week Twitter threw open its doors to developers for their latest DevNest meeting in San Francisco. Twitter announced that there are more than 600,000 app developers working on apps that use the Twitter API. That's like a city the size of Glasgow being a Twitter developer community. Not only that, Tw itter processes more than 13bn API requests every single day and there are 900,000 existing applications that freely integrate with Twitter. In March, Ryan Sarver, Twitter's product manager, told developers to stop developing new Twitter clients, citing his reasons as significant numbers of client apps repeatedly violating Twitter's terms of service. The quick numbers \u2022 Twitter saw a 41% increase in tweets per day in the first quarter of 2011, with a 38% increase in the US \u2022 monthly signups are up by 52% in the same quarter \u2022 mobile usage of Twitter has shot up, with 104% growth on Android, 72% on iPad, 55% on iPhone and 51% on BlackBerry. But the bottom line from Twitter to app developers is that if you're building a rival Twitter client, then stop. It doesn't want it. It wants to work with you and not against. Twitter's development team, along with new recruit, Jason Costa, who's the developer relations manager, is now actively encouraging developers to build apps that \"integrate\" with Twitter. Integrate? With advice from Costa, Twitter describes the five key areas of opportunity to developers as \"analytics, content, curation, publishing and enterprise\". So what does this really mean for developers? Well, that there is plenty of opportunity to develop great apps that integrate into Twitter freely, without directly competing with them by building rival client apps. Looking closely at the five key areas that Costa describes, we have selected five successful apps that we believe currently demonstrate what Twitter is really asking developers to build. Take a look at these: Analytics \u2013 Tap11 Tap11 is a Twitter business intelligence service that provides your business with analytics and CRM tools to engage and grow your audience. Twitter recently selected Tap11 as a top six app at Chirp (the first Twitter developer conference), the judges viewed Tap11 as the \"omniture of the real-time web\". This app allows you to monitor your brand, listen to conversations about your brand, products and competitors. It also allows you to focus on important conversations, allowing you to view people by influence and engage them with relevant content. You can also measure the results of each campaign with per tweet analytics. Compatible with iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. Tap11.com supports Firefox, Safari, Chrome and IE8 browsers. Content \u2013 TweetAgora Content syndication was never so easy than with TweetAgora, providing advanced filtering capabilities to ensure you only see tweets of things you are interested in, even allowing you to \"mute\" certain users. Currently only compatible with iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. Curation \u2013 Social Cloud iPhone Social Cloud is a social network curator of information. Allowing you to manage and find the most pertinent and important information among your Twitter feeds. Your followers become distilled into a text cloud with key words emphasised. You then drill down on those significant words to read the message that are the most relevant. Currently only available on iPhone but soon to support iPod Touch and iPad. Publishing \u2013 HootSuite Publishing on Twitter just got a whole lot easier with HootSuite for mobile. It allows the user to manage and post simultaneously across multiple Twitter accounts. Compatible with iPhone/iPad, Android and BlackBerry. HootSuite currently supports a cross-platform web app (HootSuite.com). Enterprise \u2013 Seesmic Seesmic is a powerful social media monitoring and management app that natively supports Twitter as well as Facebook and Ping.fm . It allows the user to update dozens of networks at once. Seesmic also allows for posting to one or multiple accounts at the same time. Available on iPhone, Android, BlackBerry and Windows 7 devices as well as Mac or PC. Twitter is growing up and is aware that it is just not possible to please everyone as it figures out its own business model and revenue stream. Twitter wants developers to focus on other facets of Twitter rather than developing rival clients. A key example of the reasoning behind this is the rumoured deal that Twitter has acquired TweetDeck. (We contacted Richard Barley the community manager for TweetDeck but he was unable to comment on the rumours). TweetDeck has become one of the most innovative Twitter based services available and in February was courted by UberMedia hoping to add it to its store of Twitter client apps for both iOS and Android. UberMedia's arsenal currently includes Echofon, UberSocial and Twidroyd. TweetDeck is a hugely successful third-party client, with around 10% of Twitter users currently accessing Twitter via TweetDeck. Twitter's acquisition could be seen as a defensive one, albeit expensive one (reckoned to be around $50m). Defensive, in so much as they simply could not allow UberMedia to control such a large market share in this space. Originally, Twitter was hailed as an example of innovation but has been heavily criticised by many 'power users' recently for its lack of innovation and many of these said 'power users' have switched to TweetDeck because of its customisable and multi-column view."
