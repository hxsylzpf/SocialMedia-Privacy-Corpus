  "content": "A teenager was released from prison on Thursday after serving nearly four months for making \"terroristic threats\" on Facebook. Justin Carter, 19, was released on bail after an anonymous person donated $500,000 to his family to cover bail, according to MSNBC. In February, Carter was involved in an argument about a video game on Facebook when people responded by telling him he was \"crazy\". He replied: \"Oh yeah, I'm real messed up in the head. I'm going to go shoot up a school full of kids and eat their still-beating hearts.\" The comment was followed by \"lol\" and \"jk\", to indicate the jokes were in jest. A woman in Canada saw the posting and reported it to a Canadian crime watch group. The information then made its way to Texas, where Carter lives, and he was arrested. Carter's bail was initially set to $250,000, then raised to $500,000 after he transferred jails. A grand jury indicted him on terroristic charges on 10 April after he rejected a plea deal to serve eight years in prison. His mother, Jennifer Carter, created a petition on Change.org in an effort to raise awareness about his case. She said the post was sarcastic and that her son had been repeatedly assaulted in prison. His response may have been in bad taste, but it was written in a non-threatening way that didn't translate well online. None of his friends or family would even question his intention as anything other than a poor choice of words. Things got out of control, but my son is not a felon and terrorist as he's currently being charged! The petition had received more than 121,500 signatures on Thursday. His father Jack Carter agreed that the words were poorly chosen and that he understands why authorities were cautious about the comments. \"I definitely see the need to investigate such claims. Absolutely,\" he told CNN. \"But at some point during the investigation there has to be some common sense.\" Carter's story is one of several recent cases of people making Facebook posts that result in arrest. On Tuesday, UK resident Reece Elliott received a 28-month prison sentence for posting a threat to kill 200 US children at a school in Tennessee. The school locked down the day after he posted the threat, causing more than 3,000 students to miss school. Cameron D'Ambrosio, an 18-year-old from Massachusetts, was arrested in May for \"communicating a terroristic threat\" after writing a Facebook post that referenced the Boston Marathon bombings and calling the White House a \"federal house of horrors\". \"There are no more threats that are high school pranks,\" said police chief Joseph Solomon during a press conference following the arrest. \"If they're thinking that way, they need to get their heads into 2013.\" D'Ambrosio was released in June after a grand jury refused to indict him.",
