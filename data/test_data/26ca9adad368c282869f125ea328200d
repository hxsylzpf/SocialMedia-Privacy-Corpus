  "content": "The intriguing sub-plot to Twitter's flotation was the warning from the chief US security regulator that investors shouldn't be so silly. Mary Jo White did not put it like that, of course. In fact, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission didn't even mention Twitter when making the commonsense point that having lots of users does not guarantee that big profits will follow. But it required no genius to see who White might have in mind when saying this on the eve of Twitter's stock market debut: \"What if only a fraction of those users are paying customers? What does that mean for future financial results? What if the bulk of the growth in the number of users is in an area where the company has not yet figured out how to turn those users into paying customers? What does that then say about the meaning of user growth rates?\" White's scepticism, naturally, was ignored by investors. The market decided that loss-making Twitter, with only a sketchy plan for how to make profits from its base of 230m users, is worth $30bn (\u00a318bn). This is roughly the same as our own BSkyB, a company that last year generated revenues of \u00a37.2bn (about 20 times greater than Twitter's), made pre-tax profits of \u00a31.26bn and has customers who are willing to pay hefty subscriptions. Twitter's valuation is plainly absurd. How did it happen? Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, who thinks the valuation is \"disconnected from any logical calculation,\" thinks these technology flotations have become \"like a video game\". Fair point. Given the sheer impossibility of estimating at any point in the next few years whether Twitter can one day make annual profits of $2bn (the bare minimum, you would think, to support a $30bn price tag), the game looks like a version of \"who's the greater fool?\" Buyers at $45 a share are surely just hoping that somebody might soon be prepared to pay, say, $60. That's their choice. So is the regulator right to fret? Strictly speaking, no. The SEC's job is to ensure investors are properly protected and Twitter's prospectus was stuffed with risk warnings. Buyers know, or should know, what they are getting into. But White's decision to speak out is fascinating. It may suggest that regulators are concerned that a heavy dose of quantitative easing has bred complacency among investors and caused bubbles in less obvious places. They would be right to worry. If Twitter can be hyped to such extraordinary heights, video-game investing may run deeper than a few tech stocks. Three years after the event, Willie Walsh's regular boasts about the 2011 merger of British Airways and Iberia being a great success are starting to make more sense. From the point of view of British Airways' former shareholders, who got 46% of the IAG combo, the terms still look lousy, but the Walsh cost-cutting formula is clearly having an effect on Iberia. When you axe 3,100 jobs (most to be gone by the end of this year) and impose pay cuts, Iberia's short-term financial performance was bound to improve. But third-quarter profits of \u20ac74m (\u00a362m) at Iberia, versus break-even a year ago, was still better than expected. A full-year profit will arrive at Iberia next year, promised Walsh. In the meantime, British Airways, dominant at Heathrow, continues to purr along, providing the main explanation for why IAG's share price has more than doubled this year and rose 8%on Friday. BA's third-quarter profits rose 78% to \u20ac477m. But the joker in the pack is Vueling, the Barcelona-based budget airline. Iberia owned 40% at the time of the merger and IAG took its stake to 98% early this year. Smart timing: Vueling contributed profits of \u20ac139m in the third quarter at a remarkable profit margin of 25%. Special factors were at work (Barcelona had a bumper tourist season, apparently) but Vueling clearly has the potential to be more than a minor irritant for Michael O'Leary at Ryanair. It is currently less than a quarter the size of Ryanair (17m passengers a year versus 81m) but it is in the sweet spot of what passengers currently seem to value in a budget airline \u2013 flights to prime airports and more attention to service. The Ryanair empire, despite two profit warnings this year, is not about to crumble \u2013 it will still make profits of \u20ac500m this year. But Vueling, not just easyJet, is now a serious competitor. O'Leary, in his interview with this paper this week, even talked about flying to more city centre airports. Times are changing. For a company that says it wants to dispel misconceptions about its business, Wonga ought to take more care before making this claim: \"Our bad debt (the amount of money loaned that we don't get back) is around 7.5%, comparable to credit cards.\" That statement was part of the company's tetchy response to Ed Miliband's disparaging remarks this week about the \"Wonga economy\". Wonga's figure for its own bad debts is obviously correct \u2013 it is in the company's accounts and the precise figure is 7.4%. But chief executive Errol Damelin hasn't been following the data if he still thinks this is \"comparable to credit cards\". The Bank of England publishes data on lending and write-offs by UK banks and building societies. For credit cards in the last quarter the ratio was 3.5% \u2013 slightly less than half Wonga's rate. In fairness to Damelin, his boast would have been correct a few years ago. In 2007 and 2008, rates of 6% and 7% were the norm for the credit card industry, according to the Bank's figures. Indeed, in 2010, after the banking bust and during recession, defaults briefly hit 10%. But the pattern since then has been sharp declines across the credit card industry, all the way down, as said, to 3.5%. By contrast, Wonga's default rate rose last year from 6.7% in 2011. Does it matter? Yes. The \"vast majority\" of Wonga's customers, as the company says, may use its service responsibly. And nobody is misled about the ugly rates of interest \u2013 the website is a model of clarity. But it's the number of irresponsible loans (plus the come-on advertising) that's the worry about the payday industry. Wonga, it should be said, is by no means the worst. But does Damelin regard 7.4%, and rising, as acceptable for a company that wants to be considered part of the mainstream financial industry? An estimate of what he would regard as a \"good\" figure would be more useful than a dull film about 12 of his happy customers."
