  "content": "August 2006 Anti-terror police arrest the News of the World royal editor, Clive Goodman, on suspicion of illegally intercepting phone calls. Glenn Mulcaire, 35, a former footballer turned private detective, is also arrested. Scotland Yard had previously been contacted by members of the royal household who suspected their mobile phones had been hacked into. A series of stories in the paper seemed to be based on voicemails left on their phones. Goodman is suspended a few days later. November 2006 Goodman admits conspiracy to intercept phone calls made by staff at St James's palace \"without lawful authority\" between November 2005 and August 2006 at the Old Bailey. Mulcaire pleads guilty to the same offence, and to further charges of intercepting phone calls made by other well-known figures, including Simon Hughes MP and model Elle Macpherson. The News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, apologises to the Prince of Wales and says: \"I have put in place measures to ensure that they will not be repeated by any member of my staff. January 2007 Clive Goodman is sentenced to four months in jail. Mulcaire receives six months. The judge, Mr Justice Gross, describes Goodman and Mulcaire's behaviour as \"low conduct, reprehensible in the extreme\". Coulson resigns immediately saying he took \"ultimate responsibility\". Les Hinton, the chairman of the paper's parent company, News International, says: \"I understand Andy's logic and accept his resignation with great sadness.\" March 2007 Hinton tells MPs conducting an inquiry into the self-regulation of the press that Goodman acted alone. He defends phone-tapping, arguing that it can be in the public interest. May 2007 The Press Complaints Commission concludes its investigation into the affair, finding there was no evidence that News of the World executives knew about his behaviour. Coulson was not asked to give evidence. His successor Colin Myler told the PPC that he had improved internal controls at the paper. June 2007 David Cameron appoints Coulson as the Conservative party's director of communications and planning, a newly-created post. He starts the job the following month. December 2007 Hinton is made chief executive of Wall Street Journal owner Dow Jones by Rupert Murdoch and moves to New York. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
