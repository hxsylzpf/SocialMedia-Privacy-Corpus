  "content": "\u2022 The Guardian's heading out to this year's Consumer Electronics Show - I'll be meeting up with Jack there, where we plan to bring you lots of news, interviews and hands-on excitement from the show floor. But before that, there's the little matter of the Google phone. Due to be announced at around 7pm UK time, I'll be at the Googleplex in Mountain View for the news, and - with any luck - telling you what's happening live. \u2022 As part of its attempt to reorganise MySpace and divest itself of a lot of its digital assets, News Corporation announced yesterday that it was selling the popular movie site Rotten Tomatoes to rival Flixster. It's the latest in a series of relatively quiet moves that have left News Corp with a much smaller digital \u2022 And here's one that gave me a bit of a laugh yesterday: hackers temporarily posted a picture of Mr Bean on the European Presidency website, dealing a minor embarrassment to the Spanish government and sending - one presumes - a fairly weak political protest.
