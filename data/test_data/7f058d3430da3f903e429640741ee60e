  "content": "How reassuring to know that our leaders have \"made a broad statement about the need to see some restraint\" (Ministers cave in to City over bank bonuses, 11 January). That'll send the bankers scuttling into the bunkers. This whole saga is sickening \u2013 spineless politicians, so forthright in their promises to curb bonuses before the election, so timid as they roll over for their banker friends after. Meanwhile, they turn their fire on the poor, devastating lives and careers up and down our country. Have these visionless people no shame at all? John Merrigan East Molesey, Surrey \u2022 Successive governments have failed to stand up to the grasping pigs who have ruined our economy. What to do? We thought of forming a Facebook group, but frankly we are too old. Then we decided on a protest march, but the thought that two-thirds of the marchers would be police informers was too depressing. So we are driven back to old values. We urge readers to prioritise the use of local shops and stores such as John Lewis, and of ethical banks such as the Co-op. Nick Lee and Sue Austin Oxford \u2022 So Bob Diamond believes the time for apologies from banks is over (Report, 12 January). The time will be over when the banks reimburse me for the \u00a330,000 lost from my retirement savings, a loss which meant I had to sell my house and downsize to release capital to supplement my pension income. The arrogance of the man is breathtaking. Marj Waddecar Ambleside, Cumbria \u2022 Could the \u00a385k deposit guarantee be only made available to banks that didn't pay astronomic bonuses while paying microscopic interest to depositors? This could give control to customers, who would move their savings to safer banks. David Monkman Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire \u2022 I despise bankers as much as any other reader, but I love the fact that they need to express their success by spending their gambling winnings on luxury items. Denying themselves a balanced life obviously requires some sort of success statement to persuade everyone that the \"self-denial\" and \"hard work\" has been worth it. So buying all those fast cars, light carbon-fibre bicycles, golf clubs, expensive garden furniture etc does us all a huge favour when we can pick them up a year later on the used market. One careful owner, 10 miles, never seen rain ... Duncan Schwier London \u2022 I was delighted to see your headline \"Era of massive spending is over, say City\" (12 January) \u2013 until I noticed it was in the sports section.
