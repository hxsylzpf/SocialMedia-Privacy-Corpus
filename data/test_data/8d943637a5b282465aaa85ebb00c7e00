  "content": "Clearly, the man who runs the Independent titles and the London Evening Standard loves Twitter. Evgeny Lebedev tweeted news today that the Indy's editor, Chris Blackhurst - who is gratifyingly described as \"a brilliant journalist\" - has been appointed as the \"group editorial director.\" Moreover, he is said to be \"in charge of future integration.\" I understand that Blackhurst has also been appointed to the boards of the Standard and the Independent. That lends credence to Dan Sabbagh's column today in which he wrote of the \"option\" to merge the Independent and the Standard. I'm not certain whether the newly-appointed editor of the Standard, Sarah Sands, will be jumping with delight. But I'd guess that she went into the job in the realisation that the merger of departments is a precursor to ongoing integration. There appears to be general agreement that the merger of the business sections is working out pretty well. With 340 journalists working across four loss-making titles - Indy, Sindy, i and Standard - greater synergy makes accounting sense. There is no point in even rich men digging deeper than necessary into their pockets in order to fund unprofitable newspapers. Full disclosure: I write a weekly media column for the Standard Sources: Twitter/Private information"
