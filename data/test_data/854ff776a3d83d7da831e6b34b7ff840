  "content": "Morrissey has been approached by the makers of The Archers to take a guest role in the long-running Radio 4 soap. The former Smiths singer is said to be \"fascinated\" by the offer to take part in the series originally billed as \"an everyday story of country folk\". He would be the rural soap's latest celebrity cameo, after Olympic gold medal winning cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins, who appeared in March this year to coincide with Sport Relief. The Duchess of Cornwall was on air three years ago, with Princess Margaret famously featured in the show 30 years ago. A prominent vegetarian and opponent of the livestock industry who has been known to ban meat products from venues at which he performs, Morrissey is no stranger to guest appearances. He appeared in Channel 4's Brookside spin-off South in 1988, in a scene where he was recognised by character Tracey Corkill who gasps: \"I know who you are.\" He responded: \"So do I.\" He revealed in his autobiography last year that he had been offered roles on BBC1's EastEnders, as Dot Cotton's \"so far unmentioned son\" and Emmerdale on ITV. Of the EastEnders offer, Morrissey wrote: \"I would arrive unexpectedly in Albert Square and cause births, deaths and factory fires every time I opened my mouth.\" He added: \"The most fascinating aspect of both offers is that somebody somewhere thought it a good idea.\" Morrissey, who submitted a script to Coronation Street before he found fame in The Smiths (it was rejected) was also once offered a cameo on Friends in the US. The BBC declined to comment, saying it did not reveal details about future storylines to avoid spoilers for the show's 5 million listeners. The offer was revealed on Morrissey fansite True To You, which is a semi-official site for the singer. Morrissey, who has just joined Twitter, recently announced a new album, World Peace is None of Your Business, his 10th solo album and his first of new material since 2009's Years of Refusal. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
