  "content": "A children's hospice nurse has been suspended from working in the profession for six months after posting a series of offensive messages on Facebook. Believing they would only be seen by her friends, Allison Marie Hopton posted messages such as \"big bollocking shitting bastard work tomorrow\". She said a student would have to become her bitch and posted a picture of a colleague sitting on a bedpan. Hopton initially argued that Facebook was a place \"where people vent\" and what she said there had nothing to do with her professional life. But after being reported to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), she finally accepted that her comments had been irresponsible. The NMC tribunal panel pointed out that she had described herself on her profile page as a nurse at Ty Hafan, a centre near Cardiff that provides care for children, and her postings were accessible to members of the public. A statement from the panel said: \"Mrs Hopton used a number of profanities on her Facebook page and made direct and indirect references to the hospice. \"The panel was mindful of the vulnerable nature of those in her care and the sensitivity that would need to be applied to the families of patients at the hospice and the wider public. \"Her comments on Facebook had been wholly inappropriate and had undoubtedly called into question her judgment and integrity. The public rightly expect nurses to act in such a way as to uphold public confidence in the profession. As a registered nurse, Mrs Hopton had a duty to uphold public confidence in the profession. Her numerous remarks had undoubtedly brought the reputation of the profession into disrepute and undermined public confidence in the profession.\" Hopton worked at the hospice between 2007 and 2011. Last month, the tribunal ruled that Hopton's fitness to practise had been impaired but could not decide what punishment to hand out. After more than five hours of discussion at its offices in Cardiff on Tuesday, the panel ruled that a half-year suspension order was justified. When her employer investigated the case she claimed: \"Facebook is where people vent. Nurses are human. I don't mix work with my private life. I feel I have been professional.\" The panel accepted she had now shown genuine remorse. In a letter to the tribunal she said: \"I cannot go back in time, although I wish I could. I have however reflected on the whole incident and changed my behaviour because of it. I accept that comments were irresponsible and stupid, a complete lapse of judgment.\""
