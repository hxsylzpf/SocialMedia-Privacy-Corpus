  "content": "Snoop Dogg has professed an interest in becoming chief executive of Twitter after the announcement that current chief Dick Costolo is to step down. The rapper, briefly known as Snoop Lion during a short-lived reggae phase, tweeted: \"I'm ready to lead @twitter!\", following up with: \"First order of business, get that moolah!\" It's unclear whether this was the reason for a brief 8% rise in Twitter stock, but the Guardian would like to think so. Shortly after Snoop's announcement, hashtags #SnoopforCEO and #IfSnoopWasTwitterCEO were created. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is to take the helm at the social network as interim chief executive, after Costolo's shock departure, but users backed Snoop's tongue-in-cheek ambition. Tweets in support quoted Snoop lyrics and puns and referred to the star's well-known love of marijuana. Many were retweeted by the star. Snoop is well known for his wide range of interests. He is a big fan of football (aka soccer) but perhaps most brilliantly, he is a follower of British soap Coronation Street, even pursuing a cameo role and professing his attraction to the character Deirdre Barlow, played by the late Anne Kirkbride. Speaking about the programme, he said: \"I love the whole dynamic, the way it is put together, it is my world, it is something I could fall into.\" Costolo leaves Twitter with the network reporting 302 million MAUs (monthly active users), but his tenure has been marked with issues surrounding abuse and bullying on the platform. In a leaked staff memo, Costolo wrote: \"We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we've sucked at it for years.\""
