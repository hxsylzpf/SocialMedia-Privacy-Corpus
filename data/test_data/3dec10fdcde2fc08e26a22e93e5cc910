  "content": "Lord McAlpine's solicitors plan to ask everyone who tweeted his name in relation to false allegations about child abuse to make a small donation to charity and to remove all offending posts on Twitter. Lawyers for the former Conservative party treasurer are still locked in negotiations with ITV over what is expected to be a six-figure settlement over Phillip Schofield's on-screen blunder, in which he ambushed the prime minister, David Cameron, with a list of Tory politicians allegedly linked to child sex abuse, the result of a \"three-minute\" internet search. McAlpine's lawyers are trawling through a list of about 1,000 tweets and up to 9,000 retweets mentioning his name following the botched 2 November Newsnight report, which wrongly linked him to child abuse in north Wales, a broadcast that ultimately cost the BBC's director general, George Entwistle, his job. There has been speculation that the final ITV payout could be as much as \u00a3500,000 and that McAlpine would seek at least \u00a35 each from members of the public who tweeted or retweeted posts containing his name. A spokeswoman for McAlpine said: \"No set amount has yet been agreed. The lawyers are considering this, but they will be asking for a donation to charity.\" McAlpine's solicitor, Andrew Reid, said last Thursday that ITV headed a \"very long list\" including Sally Bercow, the wife of the Speaker of the House of Commons, who faced legal action over the false allegations. McAlpine has said the Newsnight allegations left him shattered and \"consigned him to the lowest circles of hell\" when they were made on 2 November. He said he wanted to end \"trial by Twitter\", saying people had to realise that the social networking site was not just a \"closed gossip coffee shop\". \"It gets in to your bones. It gets into [you], it makes you angry. And that's extremely bad for you to be angry. And it gets into your soul. You just think there's something wrong with the world,\" he said."
