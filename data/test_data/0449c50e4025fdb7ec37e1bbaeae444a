  "content": "In the latest sign that the social networking sector is not immune to tougher times, the youth-targeted sites Piczo and Stardoll are to merge their international operations to try to create more appeal for advertisers. The deal, which is a combination of cash and stock described as a \"merger of equals\", will see Piczo's chief executive, Jeremy Verba, leave the new company, which claims a combined monthly unique user base of about 20 million. By and large the Stardoll team will take over running Piczo, led by its chief executive, Mattias Miksche, although both brands will continue as separate social networking websites. Piczo's European managing director, Chris Seth, the former director at the International Herald Tribune and Time Out Group, will take on the new role of executive vice-president of international advertising and general manager of the combined UK operation. The aim is to create a larger network comprising Stardoll, which targets young girls enabling them to create virtual \"MeDolls\" and clothing, with Piczo, which targets a more general teen audience. Miksche said Stardoll would also launch a new brand, Paperdollheaven.com, that would also become part of the Stardoll Network. Social networking websites have struggled to monetise their user base and smaller players \u2013 beyond the top tier names such as MySpace and Facebook \u2013 find it difficult to attract advertisers that are reassessing budgets. \"Each website has different functionality but the audience cross-over is a good fit,\" said Seth. \"You do need to provide scale in the market, it is something that has made perfect sense in the offline world for decades, and the merger will create a more compelling proposition for advertisers.\" Seth said the gathering of brands was in some ways similar to how a company such as Viacom, which operates a range of youth-targeted brands such as Nickelodeon, operates. Jim Conning, the founder of Piczo, is understood to be staying with the new operation. Comscore, which does not measure traffic at schools and colleges, or web usage in public venues such as internet cafes, or from mobile devices or among under-15s, pegs Piczo's monthly unique users globally at 7.7 million in January. Stardoll had 5.5m for the same month. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
