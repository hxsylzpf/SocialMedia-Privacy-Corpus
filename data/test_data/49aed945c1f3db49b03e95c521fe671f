  "content": "In June 2010, the average US mobile user spent 43 minutes a day using apps. In June 2011, that has increased to 81 minutes. That is the key finding from a new piece of research by mobile analytics firm Flurry, based on data from iPhone, BlackBerry, Windows Phone and Java handset owners. Flurry claims that this means that mobile app usage has now overtaken desktop and mobile web usage in terms of minutes per day per user, citing comScore and Alexa statistics to show this is 74 minutes for web usage. \"This growth has come primarily from more sessions per user, per day rather than a large growth in average session lengths,\" explains the company in its blog post. \"Time spent on the Internet has grown at a much slower rate, 16% over the last year, with users now spending 74 minutes on the Internet a day.\" Flurry has also broken down the time spent per app category, revealing that 47% of app usage is gaming and 32% social networking, followed by news (9%), entertainment (7%) and other apps (5%). \"As we drill down into the data, consumers use these two categories more frequently, and for longer average session lengths, compared to other categories,\" explains Flurry. \"Any way we slice it, Games and Social Networking apps deliver the most engaging experience on mobile today.\" The company puts its research in the context of this month's rumours about Facebook's Project Spartan, which is expected to bring the social network's platform for games and other applications to the mobile web, and possibly to its native mobile apps. Facebook's apps are already hugely popular on mobile, but its presence in mobile gaming is currently focused purely on use of its Facebook Connect API. Flurry thinks its stats show why Project Spartan will look to do more, and the company may well be right. Flurry's figures are for US mobile users only."
