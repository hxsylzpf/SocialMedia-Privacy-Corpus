  "content": "The idea of Britain's estate agents calling for house price rises to be capped sounds about as plausible as a set of their floridly drafted property details. But the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), the estate agents' industry body, actually argued last week that if the Bank of England set an across-the-board 5% ceiling on the rate of house-price inflation, it could help to rein in the boom-bust housing market and everyone \u2013 even surveyors and agents themselves \u2013 would benefit. As Mark Carney has repeatedly stressed, when asked about the risks of rampant property inflation, the Bank of England's financial policy committee (FPC) has a set of new tools at its disposal specially designed to prick a future bubble \u2013 including the ability to force banks to hold more capital against high-risk mortgages. The Rics would like to see a clear statement of how Carney and his colleagues will decide when a bubble is inflating, and what they will do about it. Getting to grips with our stop-go, speculate-to-accumulate property market, in which some make millions while others are left out in the cold, would be a great leap towards economic stability. And the Rics is quite right that \"anchoring expectations\" about the likely rate of inflation would be helpful for both lenders and buyers. But the inconvenient fact is that a 5% average rate of house price growth feels very different in Kensington than it does in Keswick. There is no doubt the market has now turned in many, if not most, parts of the country; but while Londoners are back to comparing notes about crazy prices, there are still plenty of areas where the cost of a property is nowhere near where it was five years ago. Policymakers always have to confront regional variations: the Bank has to set interest rates for every part of the UK, despite wide gulfs in poverty, unemployment and wealth. But the gap between house prices in London and the rest of the country is greater than it has ever been, according to the Nationwide. Rationing mortgages throughout the land because a few thousand super-wealthy financiers or foreigners are bidding up the prices in Primrose Hill or Putney would be deeply unfair to struggling young buyers in north-west England or Scotland. But while its proposed 5% ceiling is too low, and too absolute, to make much sense, the Rics's surprising intervention last week did raise several important issues. The first is about the Bank's new powers. The FPC is a brand new, little-known body, yet it could rapidly find itself making deeply political decisions about who should be denied a mortgage in the name of protecting financial stability. Securing the public's confidence for such controversial powers will be tough \u2013 all the more so when it is anything but clear how the committee will make decisions, and on what basis. A policy document published in January outlined 19 different indicators the FPC will scrutinise in reaching a conclusion about whether we're in the grip of a bubble (though admittedly it is in charge of shoring up banking stability, not just the housing market). The Rics 5% rule at least has the virtue of clarity. Second, when even estate agents are warning that out-of-control house prices are bad for us, it's time to listen. That means making sure the Bank is ready and willing to use all the tools at its disposal, but the government should also examine other solutions, including ramping up investment in housing to deal with the supply shortage. As for the millionaires in Chelsea, restricting mortgage availability won't touch them, because so many are cash buyers. But at least we could tax them more, whether through a Lib Dem-style \"mansion tax\" or a land value tax \u2013 an across-the-board levy worth a percentage of a property's value each year, which would put a price on owning all that sleek real estate. The Rics's 5% proposal is a hammer to crack a nut: but Britain's bonkers housing market must be tackled. Facebook's fall may encourage Twitter to aim low Warren Buffett, the leading US investor, finally set aside his professed technophobia to join Twitter in May, announcing his arrival with a stirring \"Warren is in the house\". Within the next 45 minutes, he had picked up a mere 45,000 followers. He now has accumulated more than 600,000. But they haven't heard much from him \u2013 the so-called Sage of Omaha has tweeted a grand total of three times. Hype, followed by disappointment: that's the cycle that afflicted Facebook's stock market debut last year, and one that Twitter will want to avoid for its initial public offering, when it finally happens. Announced on Thursday night in a terse 25-word tweet, the internet grapevine's flotation could come as early as October or November, or we could be left hanging until early next year. The company and its lead adviser, Goldman Sachs, know the dangers of allowing early investors to take too much money off the table when the shares go public. Twitter shares were changing hands on the secondary market for as much as $28 (\u00a317.63) before Thursday's announcement, valuing the company at $15bn. That is 30 times the microblogging site's estimated 2013 revenues, and 15 times next year's potential takings. Not cheap, especially when one considers that Facebook was valued at 20 times its earnings for the year it came to market. There are also dangers in pricing yourself too cheaply, of course. The search engine Google floated itself in 2004 on a multiple of just seven times revenues. With investors still nursing their scars from the dotcom crash, and fears that demand would be weak, the offering was priced at only $85 a share. By the end of the first day, the stock was changing hands for $100. Second-guessing the market is no easy task, but Twitter might prefer to risk a Google pop rather than face the fallout from a Facebook-style flop. Vodafone investors will be getting a call All hail Vodafone. The mobile network's plan to sell its stake in Verizon Wireless, America's biggest mobile phone business, for \u00a384bn and hand more than \u00a350bn back to its shareholders could prove to be music to the ears to a number of company bosses \u2013 and indeed the government \u2013 in the weeks ahead. Everyone now knows big institutions will be awash with cash in the coming weeks. Convenient for a government hoping to sell off Royal Mail and offload a chunk of its 39% stake in Lloyds Banking Group. Also pretty helpful for all those companies said to be eyeing stock market flotations \u2013 the likes of online estate agency Zoopla as well as Foxtons, the estate agency famed for its fleet of Minis ferrying prospective buyers around London, and even Merlin Entertainments, owner of Madame Tussauds and Alton Towers. And, of course, not to forget Antony Jenkins, the Barclays boss who is about to publish a prospectus to kickstart his \u00a35.8bn fundraising."
