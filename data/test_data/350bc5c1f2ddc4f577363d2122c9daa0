  "content": "Boiling down 50-odd works of serious literature into two-page chunks of twitterese must have seemed a fun sort of displacement activity for the pair of 19-year-old students in Chicago who dreamed up this wheeze, but is it fun for the reader? Conceivably, it might be for other 19-year-olds, though you wonder how many will be familiar enough with Tristram Shandy or Mrs Dalloway or Moby-Dick to get the jokes. Despite the authors' arch claims to functionality in their mock high-literary introduction, the book doesn't quite remove the \"burdensome duty of reading\". It's not York Notes. Grown-up readers might find the odd thing to smile at. I liked the entry on Goethe's miserablist novella The Sorrows of Young Werther: \"Charming new town. I will finally be able to relax and be free of my troubles\" and Jack Kerouac gets pleasingly short shrift: \"For TWITTERATURE of On the Road by Jack Kerouac, please see On the Road by Jack Kerouac.\" There are jokey attempts to parody literary styles (\"What my ungrateful girls are kicking me out? This sucketh.\" \u2013 King Lear) but after a while it's like listening to teenagers jabbering on the bus. It's true that a helpful glossary has been included to get luddites up to speed on the various acronyms and slackerisms and social-networking slang that litter the text, but frankly if you have to look these things up you might prefer a real book. LOL? Not really."
