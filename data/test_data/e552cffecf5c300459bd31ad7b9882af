  "content": "Mainstream or \"old\" media face a fork in the road. Last week the nature and scale of the dilemma were vividly illustrated by a number of disparate but related incidents.First we had the case of the Guardian being on the wrong end of a pre-existing injunction apparently preventing parliamentary reporting. The Twitterverse took up the cause, unearthed helpful links and applied the steady pressure of public scrutiny to the company seeking the injunction, Trafigura, and their solicitors Carter-Ruck. As editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger put it: \"Trafigura thought it was buying silence. A combination of old media \u2013 the Guardian \u2013 and new \u2013 Twitter \u2013 turned attempted obscurity into mass notoriety.\" In a second incident of old and new media working in counterpoint rather than harmony, Daily Mail columnist Jan Moir found her article about the death of Boyzone singer Stephen Gately, which provoked a storm of protest over its apparently homophobic under- and overtones, again circulated to a worldwide and largely hostile audience which deluged the Mail's website \u2013 but more tellingly turned its crass editorial judgment into the fodder for web outrage and a lobbying of advertisers. Moir, or her editors, or both, misjudged the speed and breadth of the real-time web and social media in their power to highlight and pressurise at speed and with force. To see the Daily Mail taught a lesson about public outrage in the electronic age would no doubt have raised a weak, battered smile at the BBC. The statistical reinforcement of what lies behind the Trafigura and Gately incidents arrived as Moir was being retweeted around the web. Ofcom reported that social networking is rising rapidly as a mainstream activity for many people on the web. Now 38% of all online users have a social networking profile, as opposed to 22% two years ago, 41% are using networking sites daily and the average time spent there is going up. Facebook, the second largest site in the UK after Google, is the main beneficiary of this trend. The report, however, suggested that fewer people were using the web for information for work or studies \u2013 a drop from 48% to 35%. I suspect, though, that something else is happening \u2013 more of what at one time was \"research\" for work has actually become part of the time spent on social networks, or with \"social media\". So links through Twitter, what your friends or peers are discussing through Facebook, are absorbing some of this time too. This is a huge moment for publishers, because it raises the question: what are you going to do about it? Recently, research in the US commissioned by the BlogHer network, iVillage and Compass, into women on the web showed that women are the most active users of social media and networking sites. This prompted the Harvard Neiman Labs (which looks at trends and thinking around the new media) to ask: what are news organisations doing about this? It is an even more urgent question for some news outlets in the US, where the Washington Post's online presence was last week overhauled in numbers by Arianna Huffington's Huffington Post, the four-year-old political blogging site. And here is the fork in the road. On the one branch there is a new hierarchy of communication controlled by the user, and for the older hierarchies there is the dilemma of whether to literally \"follow the crowd\" or to try to make the crowd follow you, which might be more lucrative or at least stable in the short term, but in the long term risks irrelevance and extinction. If only there were a sat nav for cyberspace this junction would not be the accident blackspot it is threatening to be."
