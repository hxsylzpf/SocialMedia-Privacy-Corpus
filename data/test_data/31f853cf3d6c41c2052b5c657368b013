  "content": "The world of Facebook can be a dangerous place, as two separate incidents this week have proven. The first instance is actually a genuine IQ test, which takes control of your profile and signs you up to a $10 per month premium mobile phone service. If you spot a link along the lines of 'I'm NEVER texting AGAIN' in your feed, then be sure to stay clear. Roger Thompson from AVG demonstrates what you are likely to find if you click through. The second rogue has its main intent on becoming viral through your friends. The page '99% of people can't watch this video for more than 25 seconds' suggests you copy some Javascript code into a browser window to view the video. Executing this code will pass the page to all of your friends, casuing them similar hardships. The eventual intent is still unsure, as the page has been taken down after compiling over 93,555 fans. Legitimate Facebook pages and applications will never ask you to paste something into your address bar, or to sign up to premium services. Remember to always how much data the application is requesting access to. Common sense will usually prevail in these situations though, so do not be fooled. Vigilance is the best method of stopping these rogues from spreading."
