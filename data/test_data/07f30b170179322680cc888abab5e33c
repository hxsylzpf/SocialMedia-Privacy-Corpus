  "content": "\"Should it disappear, this is what it looks like,\" a man wrote on his Facebook wall along with a photo of the MH17 Malaysian Airlines plane he was about to board with his girlfriend in Amsterdam. It was supposed to be a joke. But messages flooded in hours later, as people realised their young friend and his girlfriend from the Netherlands were passengers on the plane shot down over eastern Ukraine. All 298 passengers and crew were killed. \"Such a lovely life taken away,\" one friend posted below the photo. \"Awful \u2026 there are no words,\" another wrote. \"Sending strength to his family\". Reports said 154 passengers were Dutch. There were 27 Australians also on board. Meanwhile, a maths teacher in Florida posted his sorrow on Facebook after hearing two of his students had been killed on the flight. \"I ask all my friends of all faiths to please pray for peace for their family and friends,\" he wrote. \"My heart hurts. They were the sweetest students I've ever known.\" Many of the passengers on board the plane were high profile HIV experts on their way to an international Aids conference which starts this weekend. Australian foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, confirmed the flight was connecting to Australia. \"We will do everything possible to ensure we can bring home those Australians who were on board that tragic flight,\" she said during a press conference Friday morning."
