  "content": "Twitter's apology to a British journalist whose account it improperly \u2013 and thank goodness only temporarily \u2013 suspended was a welcome move. But the company's explanation leaves at least several questions unanswered. And the episode will only strengthen the need to develop communications platforms that are not controlled by corporations or governments, but rather by their users. The good news here is that Twitter did reinstate the account of Guy Adams, a Los Angeles-based correspondent for the Independent newspaper. Adams had annoyed NBC with his pointedly negative coverage of the network's Olympics coverage, and one of his tweets included the corporate email address of an NBC executive. A Twitter employee alerted NBC to this posting \u2013 the companies are partners during the Olympics \u2013 and essentially invited NBC to complain. Then, asserting that Adams had violated Twitter policy, it suspended the account. Twitter reinstated the account after, it claimed, NBC withdrew its complaint. Twitter's actions were misguided on so many levels here that it's difficult to pick the worst element of the fiasco. But here's my pick: what Adams did was arguably rude, but it plainly did not violate Twitter's actual policy, because Adams' email address was a) corporate and easily discernible from the standard format NBC uses; and b) had been published on the web earlier. So here's just one of many questions that Twitter has yet to answer: if Adams had indeed so wilfully broken the rules, why was his account reinstated? If he didn't break the rules, why was it suspended? And why has it not enforced its own rules in other cases, several of which have come prominently to light in the wake of the Adams case. Again, I'm chalking this up mostly to the kinds of mistakes all young companies make. But it's long overdue for Twitter to recognize \u2013 and be honest with its users and partners of various kinds \u2013 that it has become not just a global platform for communications but a huge media company in its own right. Twitter needs to look hard at its rules, and refine them. It also needs to examine how it deals with business partners in the media business. All of us who use Twitter, meanwhile, had better face up to the reality that we are subject to the diktats of the platform providers. While I hope Twitter never does something like this again, it's absolutely entitled to do so if it chooses. It can change the rules, because it owns the platform. Until now, Twitter has been mostly benign in its practices, at least when it comes to users' speech. It has protected users, to the extent possible, from government fishing expeditions and has been clear that it wants the widest possible kinds of speech consistent with civil behavior. The users revolted against Twitter (and implicitly NBC) in the Adams situation, and they won an important victory. But until there are platforms big companies don't control, the victory may be fleeting. I continue to have a lot of respect for Twitter, and will continue to use it. But I \u2013 and all who use it \u2013 should be looking for a Plan B. I'll be discussing that soon in this space."
