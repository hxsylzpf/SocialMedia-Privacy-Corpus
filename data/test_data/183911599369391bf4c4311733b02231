  "content": "Is the Sun's page 3 about to vanish? Two tweets today by Rupert Murdoch suggest that he is prepared to ditch the daily pictures of topless women. He declared that he finds the pictures old-fashioned and appears willing to listen to people's views about the pictures. In one tweet, he wrote: \"Page 3 again. Aren't beautiful young women more attractive in at least some fashionable clothes? Your opinions please.\" Another one said: \"Brit feminists bang on forever about page 3. I bet never buy paper. I think old fashioned but readers seem to disagree.\" Doubtless, the relentless No More Page 3 campaigners will be tweeting with their opinions after managing to attract more than 200,000 signatories to their petition calling on the paper's editor, David Dinsmore, to \"take the bare boobs out of The Sun\". As I reported on Monday, the Sun went four days without publishing a topless Page 3 \"girl\". It did so today, but noticeably not in the Scottish edition. Dinsmore has defended publication of the pictures in the past but has always added a rider about all aspects of the Sun being \"under review\". That said, it is probably Murdoch's call, as the new tweets clearly indicate. The No More Page 3 response was measured. On the positive side, it thought Murdoch's intervention shows that he's reconsidering the matter: \"We're really encouraged that change is afoot.\" But, on the negative side, its statement added: \"We're not going lie though. It's unfortunate that he misses the point entirely by asking whether young women are more attractive clothed or unclothed.\" One step forward, I think, for \"Brit feminists banging on about Page 3\".",
