  "content": "Harry Redknapp Tone: Underdog spirit with a fair dose of score-settling. For a man who \"writes like a two-year-old\", \"can't spell\" and is too \"completely and utterly disorganised\" to \"fiddle taxes\", he has been surprisingly articulate on Twitter so far. Bio: \"Football Manager, Pundit. Lover of sport\" Followers: 61,663 (in three hours) Sample tweet: Carlo Ancelotti Tone: Congeniality personified in three languages Bio: Ancelotti declines to define himself in a few lines and instead links to his official website, which sets out his achievements in some detail. Followers: 1,911,574 Sample tweet: Ronald Koeman, Southampton Tone: Positivity, humour and a lot of photographs from one of the game's most likeable characters. Bio: \"Official twitter account of Ronald Koeman, Manager Southampton FC\" Followers: 906,390 Sample tweet: Marcello Lippi Tone: A lot of old photos of \"Mister Lippi\". Bio: \"Profilo Ufficiale di Marcello Lippi\" Followers: 166,733 Sample tweet: Marc Wilmots, Belgium Tone: The bearer of good news, especially birthday wishes Bio: \"Official account of Marc Wilmots, Head Coach Belgian Red Devils.\" Followers: 230,161 Sample tweet: Rudi Garc\u00eda, Roma Tone: Grand statements. Big emotions. Small sentences. Bio: \"Allenatore @OfficialASRoma\" Followers: 161,238 Sample tweet: Massimiliano Allegri, Juventus Tone: Lyrical and personal. And a dab hand with a camera. Bio: \"The only Official Twitter Account of Massimiliano Allegri\" Followers: 130,211 Sample tweet: Garry Monk, Swansea City Tone: Young, grounded father entirely at home with his job and fame. Bio: \"Official first team manager Swansea city fc\" Followers: 50,518 Sample tweet: Paul Clement, Derby County Tone: \"I have just left the best job in the world.\" Followers: 52,461 Sample tweet: Mark Sampson, England Women's Team Tone: Everything is awesome. Bio: \"England Women's Football National Team Head Coach.\" Followers: 8,252 Sample tweet: Gareth Southgate, England U21s Tone: \"Thanks to... Good luck to... Well done to...\" Bio: \"Played, managed, coached. Lived in South, Midlands + North. Currently awaiting Yorkshire citizenship.
