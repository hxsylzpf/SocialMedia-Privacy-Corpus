  "content": "Mark Zuckerberg status update: richer than George Soros. When the closing bell rang at the end of Facebook's first day on New York's Nasdaq stock exchange, its founder was worth $19.4bn (\u00a312.2bn). The Wall Street analysts whose job it is to build logical arguments about why the online equivalent of a school reunion should have a market value of $104bn have torn up their financial models. The lacklustre trading performance on day one suggests Facebook's share price may have peaked before it floated, but Friday's initial public offering was not about putting a price on a company. Those who did buy into the stock were paying for a slice of American history. The dotcom crash that marked the beginning of this digital century left no room for celebrating the transformational power of the internet, but with Zuckerberg jumping on stage the party has resumed. Silicon Valley's figureheads are more than rich business people. In hoodies and jeans, avoiding taxes and regulators and delivering free and unlimited access to the world's information (and its music and films), the digital entrepreneurs running Amazon, Apple and Facebook have become the new folk heroes. They are the agents of social upheaval, a role once played by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. One time Google chef Charlie Ayers cooked for the Grateful Dead before he began serving brown rice and mung beans to computer programmers. Perhaps that's because the internet pays better than rock and roll. Bono's venture capital firm has made more from its Facebook shares than U2 have done during their entire career. For many, the decision to buy a Facebook share may have been prompted by disappointment at missing out on the Apple phenomenon. Apple's recent success was a slow burn. It started with brightly coloured desktop computers when the internet was in its dial-up infancy, gathered pace with the iPod when music file sharing took hold, soared when the iPhone put the web in our pockets, and culminated last year in the near deification of Steve Jobs. But buying a Facebook share in the belief that it may one day replicate Apple's success is a monster bet. Facebook doesn't sell beautifully-designed and engineered physical objects. It sells advertising and Facebook credits. And one of America's biggest advertisers has stopped liking it. Carmaker General Motors, America's third largest advertiser, has become the first big client to say it no longer wants to pay for ads on Facebook. Will it be the last? Mobile is another sore point. Despite the fact that 425m users access the social network via their smartphones every month, Zuckerberg was forced to warn investors that he has not found a way to sell meaningful amounts of advertising on the smallest screen. One of the greatest forces working in his favour is inertia. The list of rival social networks overtaken by Facebook \u2013 from Britain's Bebo to Friendster and Myspace \u2013 is a long one. But those were in the days when we were entranced by the novelty of the genre. Now we have established the marital and professional status of former friends and lovers, the incentive to sign up to a new network has evaporated, at least for those over 25. Social networking has redefined how much of our private lives we are prepared to share. Facebook is betting that the new generation, raised on a diet of advertising-funded kids' TV channels, will be more willing to tolerate a relentless stream of targeted marketing. There will surely come a day when content is no longer free on the internet, and those with the biggest audience when the music stops will be best positioned to make money. But to justify its valuation, Facebook will have to bring the internet's free-love era to a close. Citizen Bob Get this. Barclays is holding a \"citizenship day\" this week. Seriously, this is not a joke \u2013 although the very idea may be making your sides split. After all, this is a bank that riles its shareholders with a pay policy that allowed its chief executive, Bob Diamond, to take home \u00a317m in 2011 \u2013 in a year that he himself deemed \"unacceptable\". More than 30% of shareholders failed to support the remuneration policy at the annual meeting last month. This is the bank that irked HM Revenue &amp; Customs with tax avoidance schemes so aggressive that the government took the unusual step of issuing retrospective legislation to shut them down. This is the bank that ran into trouble when it emerged that it had paid just \u00a3113m in UK corporation tax in 2009 \u2013 a year when it made record profits of \u00a311.6bn. Diamond has made citizenship one of his priorities for his tenure as chief executive, which began at the start of 2011. As an American, perhaps he cannot see the irony of his bold claims about making it one of the bank's goals. When the bank published its citizenship report last month, he said: \"The challenges ahead will not detract from our commitment to demonstrating that Barclays is a good corporate citizen. I believe wholeheartedly that this is the right thing to do for our customers, shareholders and society as a whole.\" Believing is one thing, seeing is another. Diamond will only be seen to be living by his promise of citizenship if he addresses the ongoing concerns about his own pay, which apparently caused something of a boardroom fall-out before the shareholder revolt. In the report published before this week's invitation-only event, Barclays states that there are \"three pillars\" to its citizenship goals \u2013 growth in the economy, the way it does business and supporting communities. There is also an acknowledgment from Diamond that \"delivering on our agenda will take time; restoring people's trust may take longer\". Replace \"take longer\" with \"be impossible\" and it becomes a statement that is easy to agree with. Posen bows out Fancy earning \u00a3101,000 for a three-day week? You'll need a firm grasp of the economy, and a fine turn of phrase to explain to the hard-pressed British public why the economy is still flat on its back. The Treasury is about to advertise the job of independent member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, after the American Adam Posen decided not to serve a second three-year term. Posen told the Observer in 2011 that he wouldn't stay on if his pessimistic view about the state of the economy, and his expectation that inflation would fall sharply, was proved wrong. So far, he's been half right: his colleagues finally joined him in approving more QE last autumn, as the economy slipped back into recession, but inflation remains way above the 1.5% he was expecting by mid-2012. Still, Posen should return to Washington with his head held high: his record is not perfect, but he was a lot more right than the MPC members who believed until last summer that the best medicine for Britain's flatlining economy was a rate rise.",
