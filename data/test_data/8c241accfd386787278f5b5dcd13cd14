  "content": "Your call for a review of all intelligence surveillance programmes in Britain (Learning the Feinstein lesson, 29 October) is well made but makes one error. Those responsible for oversight here did know what was going on; they just failed to tell the rest of us. The interception of communications commissioner's annual reports detail the process by which warrants for targeted interception are authorised but not those for mass surveillance. The intelligence and security committee reported on the government's communications data bill last February and must have been aware of the breadth of GCHQ surveillance programmes, but just did not tell us. Intelligence oversight institutions can never make public everything they read in their work, but those here must move beyond seeing their role in narrow legal and managerial terms, to inform the public as to the complexities of intelligence, while acting as real protectors of citizens' rights. Peter Gill Research fellow, University of Liverpool \u2022 Congratulations to the Guardian and its brave editor and staff for publishing the latest revelations on the US spying programme. I have been an editor and journalist for 40 years (now retired), and I am aware of the constant pressure from vested interests. Now David Cameron is threatening to use regulation to rein in the scope of the Guardian's investigations. It's outrageous; shooting the messenger because you don't like the message. We must have newspapers such as the Guardian which, unlike other major newspaper groups, cannot be bought off or intimidated by powerful interests. Full support to the Guardian. Darrel Cake Spearwood, Western Australia \u2022 Re the phone hacking trial (Report, 29 October): it would be helpful to we lay people if Judge Saunders could summarise when the hacking of innocent people's phones ceases to be a criminal offence and becomes vital to national security. Is it a matter of scale? Kevin Bell Manchester"
