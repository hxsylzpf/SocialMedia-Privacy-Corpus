  "content": "British MPs collectively spend around 1,000 hours a year on Twitter, if reports are to be believed. Some feel this could amount to a dereliction of their parliamentary duty, sucking up time that could be better spent serving constitutents ... ... though Tom Harris MP responded that this would only mean 36 seconds every day per MP. Others, including the research's author, feel MPs should actually be tweeting more. Regardless of the time it takes, there's also the question of whether our democratic representatives should be publicly making statements about kittens, or what they've had for lunch. To paraphrase David Cameron's words: do too many twits make something no one wants to be? What do you think, and how do your Twitter habits compare with the MPs'?"
