  "content": "Viewers found it impossible to understand Parade's End (Fridays, BBC2) because the actors were mumbling so much and British Muslims among the audience for Citizen Khan (Mondays, BBC1) were appalled by the levels of disrespect for religious practice and family values. We know this because of newspaper articles quoting furious viewers. And how, at a time of severe financial contraction in the newspaper industry, did these titles fund reporting teams to track down and question people who had been watching the shows? They didn't have to: as is now common in an era of instant digital interaction, the dissenting opinions were culled from tweets and comments on blogs. The management of a new show's reputation has radically changed for broadcasters. Until recently, the success of a programme was judged through a combination of reviews (anyone trashed overnight waited hopefully for the Sundays), viewing figures and the eventual lofty conclusions of the broadcasting company's overlords. It was still possible for a newspaper to get a controversy going, but these were mainly achieved by phoning up lobbyists and provoking them to be provoked, which could lead to a sense of inevitability about the offence being taken. \"The swearing in this programme is terrible,\" a spokesperson for ESN (End Swearing Now) would say, while the Bishop of Grantchester's private office reliably expressed unease about the new sitcom ridiculing the fictional Bishop of Gruntchester. Reaction from actual bona-fide viewers was locked away in the limited-circulation \"duty logs\", in which networks recorded phone calls from members of the audience, or in the correspondence columns of the Radio Times and TV Times, which did not appear until at least two weeks after transmission. Now, however, media journalists have immediate access to viewer attitudes. Or, at least, to the criticisms of those who are technologically and psychologically wired to respond during or immediately after transmission. Which is the problem. While responses from tweeting and blogging viewers are a more natural and spontaneous response, they are also part of a flow of reaction \u2013 positive and negative \u2013 and are often placed in context by subsequent comments. When individual remarks are spun into newspaper headlines damning a programme, they may have no more validity than if a reporter had rung up the press office of Stop Actors Mumbling and asked if there were lines in Parade's End the spokesperson might perhaps have struggled to hear. More worryingly, in the case of Citizen Khan, self-selected social networkers who found the show offensive might suddenly be read as being representative of the entire British Muslim community, a position as ridiculous as running stories declaring \"UK middle classes slam Terry and June\" on the basis of one letter complaining that bank managers are being stereotyped. The writer and star of Citizen Khan, Adil Ray, can legitimately claim the licence that, for example, Jewish writers such as Woody Allen and Phillip Roth have claimed: to make jokes about a race and faith into which they were born. If the sitcom were written by an Anglican vicar, it would be quite different. Interestingly, the Daily Mail, which on Wednesday ran a piece claiming Muslim outrage about the show, today gives a full page to the broadcaster and former Apprentice runner-up Saira Khan, in which she argues that a mature community needs to be able to laugh at itself, and that the scene that has reportedly attracted most complaints \u2013 in which a teenage girl quickly puts on a hijab over western hair and makeup to appease her father \u2013 was recognisable from her own experience and observation. My own cultural outsider's view is that Citizen Khan pays British Muslims perhaps the highest compliment television can bestow, which is treating them like any other creed and people by subjecting them to a gentle domestic sitcom in the tradition of My Family. This connection is made explicit by the casting of Kris Marshall from that show as a white English convert to Islam. The jokes about ecclesiastical bureaucracy, parental hypocrisy and teenage cunning have a target and tone familiar from the genre's previous white British incarnations. On the evidence of the opening episode, imams will come off no worse than vicars have in laugh shows of the past, which may be considered a mark of equality. Oh, and thinking that actors are mumbling is, I'm afraid, from my own experience, an inevitable sign of ageing."
