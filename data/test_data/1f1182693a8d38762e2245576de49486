  "content": "The Brits pulled in its lowest TV figures for years and, judging by the Twitter-storm, many of those that did bother watching weren't all that impressed by the antics of James Corden. The Daily Star reports that complaints flooded the Twittersphere over pre-watershed drugs references, jokes about what Justin Bieber can expect in prison and implying what Harry Styles might be up to when he had to nip to the loo. Always constructive in their criticism, tweeters' comments ranged from claiming Corden had make them sick to one saying that if the host managed to divert a meteor heading for Earth and cured cancer, he would still hate him. Charming. But it takes more than a few keyboard warriors to knock our James down, as he tweeted on Thursday: \"Thanks for all your lovely messages. The true star of the Brits is Suzi Aplin the producer. She's an incredible force and deserves all the credit.\""
