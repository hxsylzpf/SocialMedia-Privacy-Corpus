  "content": "Andy Carvin is getting a little sick of talking about which verb best describes what he does. \"It's somewhere between reporting and collaborative network journalism, and George Plimpton-like oral history, except that I'm doing it in real time in 140 characters. I don't know what to call that and I don't care as long as people don't waste my time trying to give it a name.\" Whatever Carvin's particular brand of news gathering should be called, it has made him a must-read source on the Arab uprisings \u2013 and possibly the most talked about person at SXSW. \"All roads now lead to Andy Carvin,\" declared media critic Jeff Jarvis at a discussion on the future of news. Ever since the start of the Tunisian uprising in December 2010, Carvin has been ignoring his day job as a strategist for National Public Radio and serving as a one-man broadcast channel-cum-newswire on events in the Middle East. A veteran of social media who used Twitter to factcheck the 2008 presidential election, he began retweeting testimonies, pictures and video from the protests in Tunisia - then Egypt and Libya. Although Carvin had a network of blogger contacts in the region whom he used to check information being tweeted, what marks him out is his willingness to retweet unverified material and ask his followers for help to establish its accuracy. \"I admit that I don't know the answer to things and see users as potential experts and eyewitnesses. In some ways what I'm doing is not that different from a broadcast host doing a breaking live story with a producer in one ear, talking to pundits and all the while anchoring the coverage, but rather than producers I have followers.\" Anyone who follows Carvin could be forgiven for wondering if he ever sleeps. Since December he has regularly sent more than 100 tweets a day, beginning at around 6.30am and finally logging off at around 11pm. His family have been endlessly tolerant, he says, but there are ground rules: \"If we are going out to dinner I put away my phone. I only take it out if my wife takes one of the kids to the bathroom.\" The ground rules do not preclude broadcasting \u2013 or whatever it is \u2013 all the way through a SXSW debate on the role of social media in the Arab revolts. Someone has tweeted him a link to an image of a mortar round with what appeared to be a Star of David on it. He has tweeted his followers to ask if any of them know what it is. \"I said, 'If you were an Israeli arms manufacturer would you be stupid enough to put a Star of David on it?'.\" One user suggested that the crescent above the star resembled a parachute and that the star might be just that, suggesting that it was an illumination round rather than evidence of an Israeli conspiracy to prop up Gadaffi. Carvin did a quick Google image search and asked his followers to sort through the results. Some users pointed out an Indian round with similar markings, others a French munition. Even if his team of experts hadn't completely nailed it, yet they had done enough to establish that the original characterisation of the picture was almost certainly wrong. During the same session, he broke the news to the room that an Al-Jazeera journalist had become the first journalist to be killed covering the uprisings. Given his international impact, it comes as a surprise that Carvin only has 32,000 followers - compared to the million Charlie Sheen attracted in 24 hours, for instance - but he insists that he is not interested in the machismo of follower tallies. \"I see my Twitter account as a newsgathering operation and the success or failure rate is clearly tied to the expertise of the people who follow me. I would rather have almost no one following me and have them all be experts than have a million followers.\" That expertise was highlighted recently when he tweeted a request for help identifying a photograph from Benghazi of \"a guy holding up the biggest bullet I had ever seen\". After some discussion among his followers, US military serviceman sent him a link to an image of a Russian anti-aircraft round that matched it perfectly. \"There is no way that I or anyone else at NPR could have done that on our own.\" Carvin says neither he nor his bosses have yet worked out the broader lessons of his success for NPR's newsgathering and organisation. \"I don't have a desire to blow up the newsroom.\" But a starting point, he suggests, may be easing the conventional workload on his reporter colleagues so they have more time to engage with social media. Doesn't he ever wish he could be on the ground reporting from the tumultuous events he is tweeting about? \"I do but I don't want to be out there while things are rough. I've never been a war correspondent and I don't know how to do it.\" If he hasn't quite worked out what to call what he does, though, he winces at the description of his journalism as curation. \"I know what I'm doing is a form of reporting. I just don't know what kind of reporting it is.\"",
