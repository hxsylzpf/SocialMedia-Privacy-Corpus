  "content": "The \"Twittering\" curriculum in Jim Rose's leaked primary school proposals encapsulates an orthodoxy now prevalent in education: everything must be \"relevant\" (ie fashionable) and nothing must be stretching. \"We should probably drop [insert the title of some pre-1990 text] ... pupils can't really relate to it and they certainly won't get all that difficult old English,\" is the sort of thing you hear educationists saying more and more. The Bible's really had it, politically incorrect (too pro-Christian) and irrelevant. Instead, at least according to the exam board OCR, it's the less-controversial Druids that young people now relate better to. This \"must make it relevant\" attitude is not just misguided because it's so unproductive, but because we've seen just how effective it can be to teach an antiquated and strictly speaking entirely irrelevant subject such as Latin in inner-city London and New York. Obviously the success of the courses has had nothing to do with Latin coming in handy in either Hackney or Harlem, nor these kids feeling a strong bond with the Roman empire. Introducing Latin has been successful because of the discipline, rules and crucially, high expectations, it's entailed for pupils. And it's exactly a lack of high expectations which underlies making the curriculum relevant to pupils. Lame attempts to engage them by trying to adopt their vernacular signpost attempts to win back disaffected pupils. Disaffected by poor standards, low expectations and weak curricula, rather than because Shakespeare didn't coincide with the MTV era. By secondary school, wooing lost pupils is totally futile. There is nothing less hip than a \"cool\" curriculum \u2013 and missed opportunities in primary school spent messing around with pop culture will only mean less well-equipped secondary school entrants. There is a misguided notion that pupils can only be stimulated by what they know. In reality they are being left utterly devoid of stimulation via this principle that they must learn nothing new."
