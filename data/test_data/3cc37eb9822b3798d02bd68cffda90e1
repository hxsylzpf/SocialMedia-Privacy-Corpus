According to the SXSW event page, Snowden's talk focuses on \"the impact of the NSA's spying efforts on the technology community, and the ways in which technology can help to protect us from mass surveillance\". Also taking part is Chris Soghoian, a privacy researcher and activist at the American Civil Liberties Union. The discussion is moderated by Ben Wizner, the director of the ACLU's speech, privacy and tech project."
