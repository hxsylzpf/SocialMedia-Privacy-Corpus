  "content": "Christopher Jefferies This time last year Christopher Jefferies was an anonymous former English teacher from Bristol. His life was turned upside down over a manic fortnight of tabloid intrusion in December, after he was arrested and later released without charge over the murder of the architect Joanna Yeates. His public \"character assassination\", as Jefferies' solicitor later described it, led to Britain's tabloid press appearing in the dock over charges of libel and contempt of court. Eight titles \u2013 the Sun, Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, Daily Record, Daily Mail, Daily Star, Scotsman and Daily Express \u2013 agreed to pay Jefferies substantial libel damages, thought to total six figures, in July. The Sun and Daily Mirror were separately fined \u00a318,000 and \u00a350,000 respectively for contempt of court Ian Hurst Hurst is a former British army intelligence officer who worked in Northern Ireland. His computer was allegedly hacked by the News of the World, which was supposedly searching for details of an IRA informer. Hurst claims a private investigator confirmed to him that he placed a Trojan virus on his hard drive to obtain emails over a three-month period for the News of the World. This is now the subject of a Scotland Yard investigation. The BBC's Panorama filmed Hurst being shown copies of information allegedly obtained from his computer. The programme claimed the investigator was commissioned by Alex Marunchak, a former News of the World journalist who was a senior figure at the paper. Hurst is suing the owner of the defunct paper, Rupert Murdoch's News International, in the high court. Jane Winter A peace campaigner and charity worker in Northern Ireland who runs British Irish Rights Watch, a non-governmental organisation which monitors human rights abuses on both sides of the political and religious divide. Charlotte Church Charlotte Church will tell the Leveson inquiry how the News of the World in 2005 printed lurid details of her father's alleged extramarital affair allegedly gleaned from voicemail messages left on the singer's phone. Through intercepted voicemail messages, the paper is alleged to have learned that Church's mother was admitted to hospital shortly before the story was published after attempting to commit suicide. Barrister David Sherborne told the Leveson inquiry that the News of the World then approached Church's mother and persuaded her to agree to an exclusive interview about the affair, in return for not publishing further \"lurid\" details gleaned from alleged voicemail intercepts. \"When people talk of public interest in exposing the private lives of well-known people or those close to them this, is the real, brutally real impact, which this kind of journalism has,\" Sherborne said. Anne Diamond Former breakfast TV presenter Anne Diamond insists her battle with News International began over two decades ago, when she asked Rupert Murdoch at a party how it felt to own newspapers that ruin people's lives. \"You can't do that to a newspaper mogul,\" David Sherborne told the Leveson inquiry. Diamond is expected to tell the inquiry how she felt when the Sun published a front page picture of her holding her son's coffin at his funeral in 1991. On a separate occasion, the Sun was accused of paying the Diamond family's nanny to reveal intimate details about her alleged relationship with Diamond's husband."
