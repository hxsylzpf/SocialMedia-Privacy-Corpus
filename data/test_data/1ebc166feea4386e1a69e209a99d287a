  "content": "With only one take to convince the high court in London that her lavish wedding to Michael Douglas had been ruined by the prying eyes of a paparazzo's lens, Catherine Zeta-Jones had obviously decided to play it straight. For an hour and 27 minutes the Welsh-born actor, who is seven months pregnant, kept her composure and declined offers from judge and counsel to take a rest from cross-examination in the couple's potentially groundbreaking privacy claim against Hello! magazine. With her newly acquired Los Angeles twang punctured by the occasional slip into Swansea drawl, Zeta-Jones, 33, told the court of her distress and anguish that her carefully crafted plans to protect the privacy of her \"special day\" had fallen apart so spectacularly. Discovering that a paparazzo had foiled the couple's elaborate security measures and sneaked out \"sleazy\" pictures of the reception made her feel \"devastated and violated\". The stress, she claimed, \"continues up to this day\". Her only concern was to protect the dignity of a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and not to protect the \u00a31m exclusive picture deal the couple had signed with Hello!'s arch-rival, OK! The couple are claiming \u00a3500,000 from Hello! magazine for breach of confidence and invasion of privacy for publishing unauthorised pictures of their wedding in New York in November 2000. OK! is claiming a further \u00a31.75m in loss of revenue. Zeta-Jones was the first to take the witness stand: wearing a black trouser suit, a diamond-encrusted pendant and diamond earrings, she carefully perched herself on the chair provided, while a few feet away her 58-year-old husband - an \"enigmatic Hollywood legend\", according to one magazine quoted in court - chewed lozenges and stared blankly ahead. She has been tipped to win an Oscar for her role in Chicago - now showing less than a mile away in Leicester Square - but the only critical judgment that mattered yesterday was that of Mr Justice Lindsay, the judge hearing the case. Under cross-examination by James Price QC, counsel for Hello! magazine, Zeta-Jones said the \"cheap and tacky\" unauthorised pictures made it appear as if the guests were \"doused in bad disco lighting\". The picture which most offended her showed the groom spoon-feeding her at the reception: it ended up in the Sun, under the heading Catherine Eater Jones. Fixing Mr Price with a cold stare, she said: \"It's offensive because I didn't think I would want the world to see that at my wedding day all I did was eat.\" In her witness statement, Zeta-Jones describes how one picture made her look large: \"The hard reality of the film industry is that preserving my image, particularly as a woman, is vital to my career.\" Mr Price held up an approved picture that was syndicated by OK! for $800,000 (about \u00a3490,000) to People magazine in the US, which showed Zeta-Jones feeding Douglas at the reception. He demanded to know the difference between that and the unapproved picture in Hello! that showed Douglas feeding her. Zeta-Jones said the approved image was \"a much nicer photograph\". The Hello! image made it appear that her husband was \"shoving the fork down my throat\". Mr Price asked: \"Is the distinction that you are drawing the distance of the fork from the mouth? Is that what has caused the offence and this enormous lawsuit? It's all about control, isn't it? That's what this lawsuit is all about.\" This was Mr Price's theme throughout cross-examination: the case was about control of the couple's image, their \u00a31m contract with OK! magazine and the income from syndicating the pictures to 23 magazines in 21 countries. Zeta-Jones disputed the claim. \"It's not about control, it's about recognising that just because I'm in the public eye it doesn't negate the fact that I can let my hair down.\" Later, Douglas would add: \"Control means privacy.\" Mr Price suggested that by selling the pictures to OK!, the couple had not had a genuinely private wedding. He told the court: \"Not everybody, and here I include myself, has their wedding night syndicated to 21 countries around the world. The rights to my wedding, I'm sorry to say, didn't sell for \u00a31m.\" To laughter in the courtroom, Zeta-Jones parried: \"I can understand.\" In a dark single-breasted suit, a cream shirt and lilac tie, Douglas took to the witness box for an hour and 50 minutes. Describing his disgust at the appearance of a photographer at his wedding, he said: \"I felt like a Peeping Tom was present.\" Tension mounted when Mr Price compared the Douglases' case to the usual fare at the royal courts of justice: \"People come to these courts for compensation in all sorts of cases. They come when they have been maimed and disfigured in industrial and other accidents. They come when they have suffered psychological consequences. You would certainly accept that what you have suffered comes nowhere near this?\" Douglas, his voice hardened in anger, snapped in reply: \"I find your comparison highly offensive. Of course I have not suffered physical harm.\" Their day in court over, the couple left in their limousine, its windows blacked out. The case continues today."
