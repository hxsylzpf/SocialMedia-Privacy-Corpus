  "content": "It's the three wise monkeys of phone hacking: Steve Coogan, Hugh Grant and Max Mosley. Fresh from star turns at the Leveson inquiry, the unlikely trio lined up on Monday before a joint parliamentary committee to answer questions about privacy, defamation and injunctions. Looking like the rowdy boys in the back row of a public school classroom, they continued to press their case for stronger press regulation. Mosley, though, looked more than a little annoyed while Hugh Grant was speaking. What do you reckon the actor said?",
  "lead": "What might the actor be saying during his appearance with Max Mosley and Steve Coogan before the Lords and Commons committee on privacy and injunctions?"
