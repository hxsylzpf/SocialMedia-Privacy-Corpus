  "content": "James Harding, the BBC's director of news and current affairs, opened a conference on local journalism today by arguing that the differences between the corporation and newspaper publishers have been \"overdone.\" He told the audience at Salford's MediaCity it was the reason he had been keen to bring both sides together. He said: \"Whether we are in local journalism for profit or to fulfill a public service remit, paid for by advertising or cover price, subscription or the licence fee, our starting point is the same \u2013 the belief that nothing is more important in news than informing people of what's going on where they live and where they work. If all politics is local, then so, by definition, is news.\" Acknowledging the reality of cutbacks, he said that \"the pessimism around local journalism is [also] overdone.\" He continued: \"The single most striking thing I have learned since joining the BBC is that our biggest audiences for TV news are for the regional bulletins: roughly 5 million people tune in each night for the 6 o'clock news; by 6.30, when we roll out the regional bulletins in England and news for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, that number is closer to 6 million people.\" He contended that commercial publishers and the BBC \"share a belief in local journalism\" and believed in the need for local journalism to \"get back on its feet.\" In a striking passage to his opening speech, he said: \"Fewer journalists does not mean less news, it means more PR. It means a society in which the decisions of powerful people go unreported and unchallenged, undermining any belief in local democracy and institutions, public services and private businesses. We may compete like cats in a sack for stories, but, in the end, we have a common purpose. And, to my mind, the squabbles in recent years between the local press and the BBC are getting us all nowhwere. We have looked like a circular firing squad.\" He believes the BBC \"is not to blame for the problems in the regional newspaper business. It's Facebook, Google, Zoopla and Gumtree that have done for the classified and local advertising business in print with all of the consequences for local newspaper revenues and jobs.\" But the BBC is eager to help because the corporation \"has a very real stake in the success of the local and regional news business.\" And that, said Harding, was the purpose of the conference: \"to see if and where we can help each other and, if possible, to find common cause.\" He revealed that he has asked David Holdsworth, controller of the BBC's English regions, to lead a working group to consider practical ways of papers and the broadcaster working together. The \"revival of local journalism\" conference is being co-hosted by the Society of Editors. Source: BBC"
