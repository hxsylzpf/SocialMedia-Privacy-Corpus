  "content": "Diet Coke's famous \"hunk\" is to return in a TV advertising campaign to mark the soft drink's 30th anniversary in Europe, with a British model chosen to bare his chiselled torso to female admirers for the first time. The company introduced the Diet Coke break man to its advertising in 1994 \u2013 featuring female office workers catching shirtless construction worker Lucky Vanous taking an 11.30am break \u2013 but has not aired a new \"hunk\" ad since 2007. The new campaign features Manchester model Andrew Cooper, a one-time wannabe singer who released a track in the late 1990s and was briefly represented by Take That's former manager Nigel Martin-Smith. The ad, set to Etta James's version of the track I Just Want to Make Love to You, will be released on TV in the UK in March. Cooper appears in the TV ad as a gardener joining the ranks of roles the \"hunk\" has been assigned over the years, including a lift technician, window cleaner and delivery man. \"It is not about the Diet Coke man being an object, it is not a voyeur thing, it is about cultural change, women being equal to men and you can see that,\" said Olivier Geyer, Diet Coke director for north-west Europe and the nordic region. \"We wanted to celebrate not just the brand, but also the women who have been with us for 30 years. We have tried to make sure it is not the past but a very contemporary execution. [It] showcases female empowerment and camaraderie.\" The TV campaign, created by ad agency BETC London, will run in at least 11 countries across Europe. Geyer said in early March that Diet Coke cans will be rebranded to celebrate the 30-year milestone, as part of a year-long marketing campaign. The launch of the high-profile campaign to support Diet Coke, which is positioned as a healthy no-calorie option, comes weeks after parent firm Coca-Cola launched a two-minute ad in the US in its first direct push to tackle the issue of obesity. Diet Coke advertising: from Telly Savalas to the \"break man\" 1982 \u2013 Launches in the US with stars including Telly Savalas 1983 \u2013 Launches in Europe 1986 \u2013 Whitney Houston fronts ad campaign 1990 \u2013 Elton John and Paula Abdul star in TV campaign 1991 \u2013 Diet Coke claim world's first CGI ad with Paula Abdul performing with stars including Gene Kelly and Groucho Marx 1994 \u2013 Original Diet Coke break hunk ad launches: Lucky Vanous as a construction worker 1997 \u2013 Second hunk ad: Robert Merrill as a window cleaner 1997 \u2013 Third hunk ad: Paul Johansson as a delivery man, first to keep his shirt on 2007 \u2013 Diet Coke break hunk takes a, er ... break returning with Francois Xavier as a lift technician 2013 \u2013 Andrew Cooper joins the hunk ranks as a sexy gardener \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
