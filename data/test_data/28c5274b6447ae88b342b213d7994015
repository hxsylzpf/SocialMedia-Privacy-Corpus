  "content": "Reading on a mobile? Click to view If, like me, you are wondering which Bret Easton Ellis is likely to turn up for The Canyons \u2013 the trigger-happy chappy who sprays ideas about the Twitterverse like Jackson Pollock, or the rather more measured, precise author of Less Than Zero and American Psycho \u2013 the first trailer proper for the film offers some pretty blatant clues. A previous teaser for Easton Ellis's collaboration with director Paul Schrader, billed as a contemporary LA-set noir, gave us scattershot images of the city of angels, with barely a human being in sight. This time around, we get our first glimpse of stars Lindsay Lohan and James Deen in the form of a grindhousey trailer that just screams throwaway sleaze. \"Where the sex is as cheap as the budget \u2026 and the only way out is death!\" it shouts, before inexplicably referencing Deen's famously humungous package. The whole thing may be tastefully done and beautifully shot, but it still feels like the ultimate example of an \"it seemed like a good idea at the time\" approach to film promotion. Does it say much about the movie itself, beyond flagging up the exploitation-tinged nature of a project we already know is going to be mostly about sex (check out some of the auditions on the movie's Letitcast page for a taste of the movie's dialogue)? Or is the trailer just another example of the increasingly unhinged influence of the same Easton Ellis who thought it would be a really good idea to hire an erratic pop-culture princess and an erstwhile porn star for the project? The Canyons has been been paid for largely by the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform, without studio support, giving the creative team freedom to do exactly as they please without having to get permission from the studio suits. Hence, if Easton Ellis and Schrader fancy promoting the film with a wacky (if admittedly well done) Russ Meyer-style trailer whose retro style is unlikely to be mirrored in the 2012-set movie itself, that's exactly what they get to do. The writer took to Twitter earlier on Tuesday to berate the producers of the forthcoming Fifty Shades of Grey movie, for hiring the creator of cancelled sci-fi show Terra Nova instead of him to write the film's screenplay. Fifty Shades producer Dana Brunetti swiftly hit back, tweeting: \"@BretEastonEllis Really, Bret? The day you release that 'trailer'. School film? You're losing it.\" He also retweeted another post which read: \"I love Brett Easton Ellis... I love Paul Schrader... THE CANYONS looks like the worst student film ever made.\" Personally, I would rather see Easton Ellis's take on \"mommy porn\" than British writer Kelly Marcel's proposed adaptation any day of the week, but you can see why the former didn't get the job. The Canyons' stunt casting and offbeat trailers all point to an overriding air of self-indulgence at the heart of a movie which already feels like Easton Ellis's personal plaything, something to pass the hours and ease ennui, rather than a work he expects to last the test of time. It's as if the writer's habit of hanging out on Twitter, a space where unfiltered, ill-considered ideas are celebrated like lost Shakespeare plays, has irrevocably affected his artistic modus operandi. Then again perhaps Schrader, writer of Taxi Driver and director of the sex-obsessed American Gigolo and Cat People (the brilliantly camp 1982 remake), is keeping a tighter rein on the movie itself than he is on the trailers. What do you think?"
