  "content": "Madonna took the unprecedented step of complaining to press watchdogs about a story in the celebrity magazine Heat in order to \"set the record straight\" on rumours that she was pregnant and had left Britain, her publicist has revealed. Barbara Charone, publicist to the world-famous singer, said she wanted to scotch rumours of Madonna's \"so-called pregnancy\" and put paid to the idea that she was leaving England for good. \"This all started weeks ago when it was reported that Madonna had moved back to the US, which is completely untrue - she has a house in America and had always planned to spend some time there. She is coming back in April,\" said Ms Charone. \"Stories like that tend to gain momentum and suddenly everyone believes she's moved and you get headlines like 'Good riddance Madonna' in the Mail. \"There is untrue information reported about Madonna every day and you couldn't possibly deal with them all, but we wanted to set the record straight that Madonna loves England, she's not pregnant and she's not moving back to the US,\" she added. This week's Heat carried a three-page \"world exclusive\" claiming Madonna had moved back to Los Angeles with her husband, the film director Guy Ritchie, because she wanted to give birth in the city. Ms Charone issued a denial, but that did not stop the world's media from snapping up the story. Some pointed out that Madonna denied both her previous pregnancies when rumours first emerged. Madonna has never complained to the press complaints commission before, and Ms Charone insisted she enjoyed an \"excellent\" relationship with the British press. \"We call the PCC all the time for advice, it's a very useful tool. But we have a very good relationship with the tabloids and the celebrity magazines and we prefer to avoid formal complaints. \"It's one thing reporting it as rumour, but the Heat story was presented as a worldwide exclusive and consequently it has had worldwide coverage. It then gets picked up all over the world with 'according to Heat magazine' on the end, but who takes any notice of the 'according to'?\". Ms Charone added that US media would now \"wake up to the news that we've complained to the PCC\", which she hoped would act as a deterrent against further stories."
