  "content": "Two original members of the hacktivist collective Anonymous are working with the Royal Court Theatre on a fictionalised account of how they took on the FBI and companies such as MasterCard and PayPal from their bedrooms as teenagers. The story of Anonymous and the two boys, Mustafa Al-Bassam from Stockwell, south London, and Jake Davis from Shetland, who led the targeting of websites perceived to be acting against WikiLeaks will be explored in a play called The Internet is Serious Business. Both pleaded guilty to computer offences, with Bassam given a suspended sentence and community service and Davis a 24-month sentence in a young offender institution. They now live in London and are advising the theatre and the play's writer, Tim Price. The Royal Court's artistic director, Vicky Featherstone, said the two young men were fearless and led an internet revolution. The play was not about heroes or villains, she said, but \"as the mother of teenagers, I feel that I understand them, I understand why they did what they did\". Price is the writer of Protest Song, about the Occupy movement, and The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning for the National Theatre of Wales. In a similar fashion to those works, the new play is fiction inspired by real events. Featherstone called it \"an extraordinary, challenging and brilliant piece of writing and will be a thrilling night in the theatre\". It will be directed by Hamish Pirie, a new associate director at the Royal Court, who acknowledged the difficulties of essentially putting the internet on stage. \"I've got lots of ideas,\" he said. He said both men were an inspiration and added: \"They are very humble and aware of their responsibilities.\" The play was announced as part of a wider season that was \"unbelievably diverse\", said Featherstone. If there was a theme, it was revolution \u2013 \"a cry against apathy\", she said. \"The playwrights are asking us to think about active resistance, big and small, about how we can make change happen.\" As well as a series of new plays in its two spaces, the Royal Court is collaborating with the Guardian on six micro-plays \u2013 as short as 90 seconds \u2013 which will be available to watch on the Guardian website. They will involve six playwrights, six directors, six Guardian journalists and \"a stellar company of actors\" creating six plays that respond to John Harris's question, what does it mean to be English? In the Royal Court itself, Katie Mitchell will direct a play called 2071 for which the writer, Duncan Macmillan, has talked at length to Chris Rapley, the climate change scientist and former director of the Science Museum. Enda Walsh has \"mischievously adapted\" Roald Dahl's The Twits for a play that Featherstone hopes will lead to more work for young people at the Royal Court. \"I'm hoping our experienced playwrights will start wanting to write original work for children and young people,\" she said. That will be staged in the spring, while the show at Christmas will be Hope, by Jack Thorne, which features a Labour council having to make \u00a322m cuts. It is good to have something different, said Featherstone. \"We are inundated with light and jolly at Christmas, it is a kind of enforced fun time.\""
