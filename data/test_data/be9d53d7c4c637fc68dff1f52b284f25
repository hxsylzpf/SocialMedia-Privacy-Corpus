  "content": "Early in 2013, after four months of training hard for a charity cycling event during freezing weather, Lee Clark had to pull out with flu. Feeling he would let his sponsors and charity down, guilt set in. Later the same year, as an annual participant in Movember, Clark felt that a lot of people were avoiding donating small amounts because of pride or fear of being seen to lack generosity. Fuelled by these experiences and witnessing a move towards collecting very small amounts for charity by ventures such as Pennies \u2013 which asks shoppers to round their total up to the nearest pound and donate the excess change \u2013 Clark has created a new online fundraising platform called givepenny.com. The big selling point of the platform is that it links to lifestyle apps Fitbit and Runkeeper, as well as Facebook check-in technology to track physical activity and invites sponsors to offer small amounts for training or event milestones \u2013 such as a donation per mile. \"It's a nod to the traditional school sponsorship form of yesteryear and it means that there's an opportunity for a charity to benefit even if someone doesn't complete a challenge. The focus is on pledging small amounts,\" says Clark. \"We want to offer a new way to embed regular giving into the public consciousness. I feel that the very best example of how technology has enabled people to give very small amounts without feeling guilty is the charity Pennies \u2013 they have started the move of spare change donation from the collection tins on shop counters to online or card payments.\" Pennies was one of the many inspirations behind starting Give Penny. Others like the iCuckoo app and websites like Instead, I Can Go Without and Google's One Today, which encourage a \"giving loose change digitally\" mentality, also inspired the team. Pennies has so far brought in \u00a35m for charities since it was founded in 2010. As well as encouraging small amounts from lots of people, Clark aims for Give Penny to be a place where charities can be creative about organising group challenges, such as asking large numbers of people to run or walk a few miles towards a group target. A small handful of charities in Birmingham, where the small team is based, have signed up \u2013 these include Birmingham St Mary's Hospice, the Little Princess Trust and Birmingham Children's Hospital. Stanford Chau, informatics and database officer at Birmingham Children's Hospital is enthused about the possibilities the Give Penny site offers. \"This feels like a more social way of giving than we're used to,\" says Chau. \"It also has a very modern framework and its interface is more customisable and intuitive, which is refreshing in this space when compared to traditional online giving platforms' fairly static pages.\" \"As a fundraiser myself, I often struggle to keep the momentum going when training, so I think something like this will help. I remember the 50p a mile concept from school and have always wondered why JustGiving doesn't do this. I see some of our fundraisers with little to no sponsorship on their page at all, and I think setting milestones is a great idea and offers more visual storytelling and interaction and opportunities for giving small amounts.\" He is unsure if the fitness tracker element will just be a phase. \"But the very idea of integrating third party activities on to your fundraising page is a very exciting idea with limitless possibilities.\" he says. Helen Fleming, head of corporate and major donor fundraising at St Joseph Hospice in East London, feels that existing fundraising platforms work well but says she is interested to see what new options can offer. \"I think what's out there works very well for what we need and I think the most important thing is communicating with fundraisers regularly and giving them lots of tips on how to encourage donations. This is the crucial part. I do feel there's value in the sponsorship per mile concept though, and will be interested to see how this works.\" Analysis of JustGiving data shows a particular trend in sponsorship giving \u2013 where individuals tend to pledge the same or similar amount as other donors (pdf). It does seem to suggest that those wanting to offer lower amounts might hold back and the charity will miss out, backing up Give Penny's aim to value smaller amounts more regularly and potentially tune in to untapped funds.
