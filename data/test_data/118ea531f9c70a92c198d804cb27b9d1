  "content": "Yes, you've seen the iPad reviews. (You haven't? Go and read them. Insightful.) But what about the things that onlookers (and a few users) think? Some observations from all over Twitter. Well, from my Twitter feed. Mathew Ingram on the perplexing number of \"unboxing\" videos: \"You know, I like gadgets as much as the next guy, but the whole \"unboxing video\" thing is just pathetic - I mean, come on. Seriously, do running buffs video themselves opening a new box of shoes? do scotch snobs video themselves opening a box of single-malt?\" Then again, isn't the slow reveal what strippers have traded on for ages? Plus - Ingram was then inundated with videos of Scotches and shoes being unboxed. Truly, the internet spreads its net wide. \"I submit that they got that idea from gadget nerds and/or they are gadget nerds,\" Ingram protested. Oh, did someone mention an iPad unboxing video? Onward: David Carr of the New York Times thinks sales of the iPad will explode: \"sales will jailbreak nerd kingdom quickly because you can't sit next to it and not want. Don't have to peer in like iPhone.\" That fact that it presents itself - rather than needing to be looked into - may be a key element. Carr also thinks that \"for people who are far too wired, #iPad will be 3rd place, something for after [they] close [the] lid on laptop. [Its] lack of multitasking [will be] a plus.\" Remember how Sony marketed the PlayStation 2 as a \"third place\" - not home, not work, but gaming? And that \"People will love reading and consuming stuff on #iPad. Making stuff? Not so much. A lean back device, not lean forward.\" Though we could probably guess that. Andy Ihnatko, whose unboxing video that is, says that \"the iPad generates almost no heat, even after heavy use. Also has no fan so it's quiet.\" (This was on twit.tv, which doesn't offer a URL.) Many reviewers make the point that Apple's proprietary A4 chip uses much less power; and the iPad doesn't have a moving hard drive, meaning it uses much less power than your laptop. Patrick LaForge of the New York Times notes that \"Other reviewers report battery life of 9.5 to 11+ hours for iPad, depending on whether WiFi etc. left on. On a plane, you turn that off.\" David Chartier quizzes \"All these iPad reviews and not a single word about the bizarre lack of built-in apps like Weather and Stocks? Shenanigans.\" A great idea from Bryan Bell: \"Is anyone making a necklace case for the iPad? I want to rock my iPad like Flavor Flav rocks a clock.\" Yes, it takes a nation of millions to hold our sack. Oh, and finally, there's an app for that: the iPad tea thermometer. Warning: may only work on one day per year.",
  "lead": "This may all seem a bit meta, but it's useful to have the perspective on what isn't being reviewed as well as what is."
