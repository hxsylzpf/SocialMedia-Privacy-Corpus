  "content": "While at Sony Computer Entertainment, Paulina Bozek created the SingStar PlayStation music game franchise. Now she's running her own startup, Inensu, focusing on social and mobile games, initially around fashion and music. At today's Evolve conference in Brighton, she outlined the strategy behind the new company. \"What I really want to talk about is new audiences,\" she said, reminding the audience of developers that for the last five weeks, the most popular console game in the UK has been Zumba Fitness, while the rise of Facebook and iPhone gaming has widened the base of gamers considerably. \"Suddenly our addressable gaming audience is literally everyone,\" said Bozek, who said Inensu is focused on mass-market games. \"We see ourselves very much as sitting at the intersection of games and entertainment.\" The studio's first project is Closet Swap, a project with Channel 4 Education. It's a social fashion site that lets people upload photos of their clothes and create virtual fashion closets with their friends. This is a website with Facebook Connect built in, but there will also be a native iPhone app, and a web app for Android and BlackBerry. The idea: to encourage people to swap clothes rather than shop for new ones that they don't need: there is a strong sustainability angle to the project. \"This app was not going to be about preaching to the converted: we really wanted this to be for the Top Shop Girl,\" she said. \"We wanted to influence normal teenagers, not just have an ethical-for-the-already-ethical app.\" When people upload a snap of some clothes, they're invited to enter its \"story\": where they got it, where they wore it, who gave it to them and so on. Then, people can browse their friends' virtual closets and ping swap requests to one another. \"We think about social as a way to get an app into people's everyday social sphere... make it part of their leisure time with their friends,\" said Bozek. \"Fashion is really interesting to innovate in: it's a fundamentally retail-driven industry, and it hasn't really changed.\" This isn't a game, right? But there are game elements. \"We think that dressing up is inherently playful. Self-expression is playful. But we have added a gamification level to it,\" said Bozek. \"Our approach was to make clothes the items that power up.\" When an item is first added to a closet, it is worth 50 points. The first time it's swapped, it becomes worth 100 points, then 200 points the second time and so on. These points then become each user's total, displayed in leaderboards. They also, importantly, show which items are the most popular among a group of friends. Inensu's second project is called Super Fan, and is focused on music rather than fashion. The goal here: to design something for music fans, whose relationship to music has \"fundamentally changed an entire industry... The music industry is going through this big change from distribution models to consumption models, and everyone is trying to figure out how to monetise the music, and replace the lost revenues.\" So, Inensu is looking to combine music, gaming and social features, with a particular focus on 12-15 year-olds who have grown up with digital music and social networking. \"For this audience it's all about accessing music rather than owning it. YouTube is their MTV,\" said Bozek, who pointed out that increasingly, artists' music videos are being shot with YouTube in mind, not TVs in living rooms. \"We think that teens have a very personal and emotional connection to music. It's part of their identity... But the complications of music licensing are still holding us back.\" Bozek cited Turntable.fm, the US social music site that lets people DJ for one another using their own MP3s, as inspiration. It is still available in the US, but has been blocked outside for licensing reasons. \"It mirrored a real-life scenario of people hanging out and playing records,\" said Bozek. \"And it was also about discovering music through others.\" With Super Fan, Inensu wants to gamify fandom, with a mixture of games, leaderboards, chat and other social features. \"We refer to this as fan club 2.0, because fan clubs haven't really changed,\" said Bozek. \"We're not really getting involved with the music licensing itself. We believe there are a whole bunch of other things going on around the music which mean we don't have to focus on the recorded music itself.\" Super Fan will launch in private beta in a few weeks' time. Inensu is talking to some labels about how they can get involved in the future. \"They love the idea of the DAU - the daily active user - even more so than we do in social gaming. There is a good opportunity around virtual goods too. We saw it a bit with Lady Gaga in FarmVille, but she didn't really go down that route: she used it as a promotion.\" Bozek explained that Inensu also thinks there will be an opportunity to link out to concert tickets, merchandise and other products as Super Fan gets going."
