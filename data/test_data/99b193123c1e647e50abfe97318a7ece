  "content": "Heather Mills McCartney is to take legal action against the News of the World over lurid allegations about her past, with her lawyers yesterday calling the claims \"vicious and untrue\". In a statement they said she would commence legal proceedings against the Sunday paper and the individuals behind the allegations once her divorce from Sir Paul McCartney was finalised. They \"vehemently denied\" the \"highly defamatory\" stories alleging she was a highly paid prostitute when she was in her 20s. Ms Mills McCartney's lawyer said the sources of the article were \"unreliable\" and had been paid for their stories. But a spokeswoman for the paper, edited by Andy Coulson, said: \"We stand by the story 200%.\" It is understood the News of the World is weighing up whether to publish further allegations this Sunday. The estranged wife of Sir Paul has been considering her legal options after the paper published the latest in a string of tabloid stories apparently sparked by her marriage split. In announcing her intention to sue once her \"matrimonial matters\" had been resolved, Ms Mills McCartney, 38, is hoping to warn off other newspapers which may be considering publishing similar stories about her past. The statement said Ms Mills McCartney, who split from her husband last month with a joint broadside against \"media intrusion\", was still recovering from surgery on her leg which was amputated below the knee after a collision with a police motorcycle in 1993. \"Heather is very distressed by this article,\" it said. \"She continues to recover slowly from her revision amputation operation and has suffered weight loss, anxiety and sleeping problems as a result of the stress and anxiety of the break-up of her marriage.\" Her lawyer, Stephen Taylor, said the News of the World had threatened to print the allegations three or four years ago but had been stalled by the threat of legal action. Its News International stablemate the Sun last week published topless pictures taken from a 1988 German publication. It returned to the subject yesterday with more pictures. PR professionals said newspapers had been waiting for the pair to split before unleashing negative stories that they had been reluctant to air while Ms Mills McCartney was married to the former Beatle. The pair hope to conclude an amicable settlement and joint custody of their daughter, Beatrice. \"The interests of her daughter are of paramount concern. She will defer issue of legal proceedings until the arrangements in relation to the divorce are concluded but intends to sue at that stage all parties (including individuals) who are intent on damaging her reputation,\" the statement said."
