  "content": "Someone tagged this place as 'Wimbledon' - which it isn't - on Facebook on 29 June. But who? Were you in a pub in Tower Hill on the afternoon of Tuesday 29 June? Did you see someone furtively updating their mobile phone as the TV in the corner showed the Wimbledon match between Kim Clijsters and Vera Zvonareva? Then you probably saw a Facebook employee trying out its new Places product, months ahead of its launch. There is some speculation that the person who posted the update - which appears as a neat little map - might have been Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. Certainly some of the timing fits, as Arun Stephens (who seems to have been the first to spot this) points out in a blog post: \"Facebook Places has been in development for around 8 months, but I've found evidence (for want of a better word) that it has been working, outside the US, at least since June, when several Facebookers were in London, for a hack day and a special edition of the Facebook Developer Garage.\" He continues: \"I've been working out of TechHub [Facebook Place] this week, and there were four Places in the area. One was the Barbican Centre, which was where the Facebook Developer Garage was. Another was labeled \"Wimbledon\" but was in fact probably a pub near Tower Hill. Whoever was at that pub that day was watching Clijsters versus Zvonareva, which puts it a week after the Facebook event at the Barbican. The South Bank Centre was also visited (spelt with English spelling, rather than American, too). Another was arjunabeats.\" You may have spotted the weakness in his argument: Zuckerberg wasn't in the UK for a whole week. He's a busy guy, people to see, gigantic social networks to build, that sort of thing. And Facebook has pointed out that \"Place has been in beta test for all Facebook employees for a while, not just US ones\" - which means that the person who was watching that tennis match probably wasn't Zuckerberg, but instead was one of the UK staff of the company. But the idea that you might stalk Zuckerberg (the - shocking! - only person on Facebook you can't block) gets a little extra piquancy with the warning from Sophos that geo-encoded data in those pictures you put online could aid stalkers. As Graham Cluley explains, many photos taken by GPS-enabled smartphones will contain location data in the metadata of the picture. \"The location data isn't visible to the naked eye in the photo, it's embedded as encoded meta-data inside the picture, alongside information about what type of camera was used, camera settings, and so forth. That means, anyone who accesses your digital photos can (if you haven't wiped the location meta-data) work out where you were when you take the snapshot. And as many people upload their pictures virtually instantly to Twitter via services like TwitPic, someone could find out where you are even if you had no intention of sharing that information with the world.\" That's the warning that I Can Stalk U, another \"scary them into understanding it\" site, tries to make real. (Though note that it says: \"We do not stalk anyone, nor do we wish anyone be stalked.\") It scans Twitter and services like Twitpic and picks out the metadata, and then displays it on the site. The reminder: putting too much information about your location can be risky, even if you hadn't thought of it in that way. And if you need a reminder, or just missed it during the holidays, can we point you to Leo Hickman's piece about location and cyberstalking, \"How I became a FourSquare cyberstalker\" - though you don't need that particular location service to do it. The fact that Places aren't immediately tied to particular people may be one of its benefits - but some people are rushing headlong into geolocation because the technology enables it, without quite considering the full extent of the risks involved. Like every technology in the past, social networking has been blamed for enabling people to do harm; it would be nice, if perhaps optimistic, to think that we'll be more careful with geolocation.",
