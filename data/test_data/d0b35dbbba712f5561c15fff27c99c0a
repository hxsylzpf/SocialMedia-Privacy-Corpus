  "content": "Mark Zuckerberg survived last night's ABC News interview relatively unscathed. He talked about the lawsuit with Paul Ceglia, an IPO, the Facebook film and that 500 million active user milestone. But he gave very little away. Facebook will IPO \"when it makes sense\", Zuckerberg told ABC News veteran reporter Diane Sawyer, skirting any real indication of when that 'sense' might hit. Next year is generally agreed to be the target date; the Wall Street Journal reported back in March that investors anticipate a 2011 IPO valued at $35bn to $40bn. Reuters has reported that the site made $800m in revenue last year, and \"tens of millions\" in profit. By some estimates, that's a fairly modest valuation. Sawyer's report mentioned $84bn - such is the value of access to 34.8% of the world's online population. \"When it makes sense, right. I mean, what we're most focused on is just building these tools that help people stay connected with the people that they care about. \"At some point along that path I think it will make sense to have an IPO but we're not running the company to do that - we're running the company to serve more people.\" \u2022 \"We are quite sure we did not sign a contract that says he has any right of ownership over Facebook,\" he says of the ongoing lawsuit with Paul Ceglia. \u2022 How does he feel about the size of the site now? \"It's pretty surreal...\" Will Facebook make a billion? \"Who knows if we'll get there.\" \u2022 The most interesting part was when Sawyer pushed him, albeit gently, on how he felt about the Facebook movie, The Social Network. Zuckerberg was about as personally open as I've seen him, and there was something quite touching about him saying he was \"19 - only a kid\" when he started the site. So does the film bother him? \"It's interesting, but it's fiction... A lot of these things are distractions but people get remembered for what they build, right? People don't care about what people say about you in a movie... I don't read a lot of the books about us, I don't read a lot of the press about us. I'm probably not going to see the movie either.\" Mark, are you there? No? Oh."
