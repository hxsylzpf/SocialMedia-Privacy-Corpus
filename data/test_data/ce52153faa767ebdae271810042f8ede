  "content": "Facebook is suing Teachbook, a US social networking site for teachers, claiming that the site \"wilfully and deliberately\" infringes its brand. In a trademark infringement filing at a district court in California, lawyers for Facebook said Teachbook \"rides on the coattails of the fame and enormous goodwill of the Facebook trademark\". Teachbook has continued to use the mark \"book\" in its branding \"despite Facebook's protests\", the filing claimed, which they say entitles them to recover \"three times the amount of its actual damages and the attorneys' fees and costs incurred in this action\". Although Facebook \u2013 the world's most popular social network \u2013 appears to own no trademark on the use of \"book\", its representatives argue that \"if others could freely use 'generic plus BOOK' marks for online social networking services [...] that would dilute the distinctiveness of the Facebook marks\". The court filing notes that Teachbook has touted itself as an alternative to Facebook, pointing to a page on the site (since removed) which read: \"Many schools forbid their teachers to maintain Facebook and MySpace accounts because of the danger that students might learn personal information about their teachers. With Teachbook, you can manage your profile so that only teachers and/or school administrators can see your personal information, blogs, posts, and so on.\" Barry Schnitt, a Facebook spokesman, told Wired.com that \"there is already a well known online network of people with 'book' in the brand name. Of course the Teachbook folks are free to create an online network for teachers or whomever, and we wish them well in that endeavour. \"What they are not free to do is trade on our name or dilute our brand while doing so.\" Founded in 2004, Facebook is now being valued at over $33bn ($21bn), while shares in the privately-held company are changing hands for up to $76 each. Its 500 millionth user registered in July this year and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has talked confidently of doubling that figure. Tania Clark, trademark partner at the UK intellectual property law firm Withers &amp; Rogers, said Facebook will have a job on its hands if it decides to pursue Teachbook through the court system, given the volume of companies using a variation of the disputed mark. \"I think they're going to have real difficulty because there are so many companies \u2013 we're talking hundreds \u2013 registered in the [trademark] book,\" Clark told the Guardian. \"Spa and EasyJet have both been successful in cases similar to this, acting against use of the marks 'spa' and 'easy'. These are big companies and [smaller defendants] just don't want to spend the money whether they feel they're in the right or wrong. \"Facebook is perfectly entitled to enforce the registration of trademarks \u2013 they realise they'll one day want to sell the company,\" said Clark. \"But I believe it will have difficulty enforcing this trademark here \u2013 yet 90% of cases like this never make it to the courts as the smaller company caves in.\" Teachbook registered its trademark for use in online social activity in March 2009. A representative for the site did not respond to a request for comment by time of publication. In a similar case to that being pursued by Facebook, earlier this month it emerged that broadcaster BSkyB is embroiled in a five-year long legal battle with internet telephony company Skype over the use of the mark \"sky\" in its branding."
