  "content": "The UK grime rapper Wiley has said he will be \"walking out\" on Warner Music after the label ignored his preference for a new single. \"Enough is enough,\" the rapper said in a since-deleted tweet. \"I don't need em anymore.\" The Ascent, Wiley's ninth and newest album, is his first for Warner Music. The initial three singles, Heatwave, Can You Hear Me? (Ayayaya) and Reload reached No 1, No 3 and No 9, respectively. \"If my first two singles were dance and third was drum and bass, why am I doing a dance single fourth?\" Wiley complained. \"My musical mind is better than that.\" \"My label are doing [the song] Lights On next but I do not like that so you will not see me in the video,\" he went on. \"I am walking out of Warner today \u2026 [I've] rinsed majors for every penny \u2026 Need to put my own money where my mouth is now and stop pussyfooting around the industry. I have got time for [Warner] and I respect you but goodbye.\" Judging from his Twitter feed, the 34-year-old is being pressured to make the transition from acclaimed grime MC to international club act. \"If someone asked me who would I wanna work with more Dizzee or Robbie Williams I would say Dizzee \u2026 that's what's wrong with me lol,\" he wrote. \"Maybe just let me be myself musically now please?\" In what seemed like a direct dig at major labels, he added: \"No amount of money can buy creativity. Your likely to be more creative on zero or when your not thinking of money.\" This is a turnaround from last year, when Wiley was still full of enthusiasm for his Warner deal. \"There's no feeling like being on a major,\" he said then. \"Even when you're on there and they're not playing ball. If you just stay calm, it can turn around to your way.\" Last month, Wiley claimed to be leaking his own album after a falling-out over the track order. \"I made a mistake on the album [and] I need to make a change,\" he wrote. \"If iTunes cannot change the mistake I will leak it \u2026 today.\" It's not clear why the rapper's conflict was with Apple's iTunes, not his label. Wiley has often used the public arena to air his private business disputes. In 2010, he sacked his manager over Twitter. The musician then started uploading dozens of unreleased tracks. \"I jus want everyone to know I make music day and night,\" he wrote."
