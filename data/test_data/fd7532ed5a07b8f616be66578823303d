  "content": "Fears have deepened in Dublin that up to 100 jobs could be lost at the Irish Daily Star, with unions predicting the media owner Richard Desmond would stand by his threat to \"close down\" the joint venture over the Duchess of Cambridge pictures scandal. The head of the National Union of Journalists in Ireland who spoke with Irish Daily Star staff on Sunday told the Guardian there was \"fear, panic and anger\" in its Dublin newsroom. Seamus Dooley, the general secretary of the Irish NUJ, claimed Desmond could use the furore created by the Irish edition's decision to run the topless photographs as an attempt to \"ingratiate himself with the British establishment in the post-Leveson environment.\" On Saturday night, Desmond said he was \"very angry at the decision to publish these photographs and [was] taking immediate steps to close down the joint venture\". His company Northern &amp; Shell jointly owns the Irish tabloid with the remaining 50% owned by Independent News &amp; Media, which controls the Irish Independent, Sunday Independent, Evening Herald, Belfast Telegraph and Sunday Life, and said it would try to protect jobs. Dooley said he believed the owner of Express newspapers and the Star in the UK was \"not just taking a knee-jerk reaction\" to the images in the Saturday edition. Thirteen photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge were reprinted as well as a front page reproduction of the French magazine Closer. \"From what I am hearing this threat to close down the Irish operation is real,\" Dooley said on Sunday. \"There is grave concern among the Irish staff of The Star about the future. There is panic, fear, anger throughout the staff. From what we can gather Desmond is serious about pulling out of the Irish operation. He might see this as a chance to paint himself in a good light with the establishment in Britain especially in the context of the Leveson inquiry.\" Freelance writers and photographers, plus the Irish Daily Star's 70 strong staff, meant some 100 jobs were at risk. Journalists on the Irish Daily Star echoed Dooley's fears that Richard Desmond will withdraw his 50% stake in the paper's Irish edition. The remaining 50% is owned Independent News &amp; Media. Dooley welcomed remarks by INM chief executive Joe Webb, who said the company would be doing \"everything in our power\" to save the jobs at the newspaper. The NUJ in Ireland believed this was \"the one glimmer of hope\" that could save a third Irish-based newspaper from closure in the last three years. Dooley said that the News of the World's Irish operation along with the broadsheet Sunday Tribune had been closed down over the last few years with the loss of dozens of jobs. When Rupert Murdoch liquidated the News of the World the Irish Daily Star ran a front page with the headline: \"Good Riddance.\" Webb said INM would launching its own investigation into the decision to reprint the photographs. Publication had been \"the wrong decision.\" Referring to last year's successful visit by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh to the Republic, Webb said: \"That visit was an important culmination of the work of the Peace Process. Since then Ireland has regarded the Queen and her family in the warmest light. Kate Middleton is a member of her family \u2014 and on behalf of INM, I wish to offer her my deepest apologies.'' A spokesman for Richard Desmond and Northern &amp; Shell declined to comment. St James's palace said on Sunday night that lawyers for the duke and duchess are to make a criminal complaint against the photographer to the French prosecutor on Monday. The couple want the photographer or photographers to be charged with invading their privacy. A palace spokeswoman said: \"We can confirm that a criminal complaint is to be made to the French Prosecution Department tomorrow. \"The complaint concerns the taking of photographs of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge whilst on holiday and the publication of those photographs in breach of their privacy.\" Once the complaint is made, it is up to the prosecutors to decide whether to investigate and pursue it. The former British prime minister Sir John Major said he hoped that the \"peeping toms\" behind the pictures would be prosecuted. Major, who was appointed as a guardian to the duke and his younger brother when Diana, Princess of Wales, died in 1997, said a boundary had been crossed. He told the Andrew Marr show on BBC1 that it was \"absolutely right\" of Clarence House to take the publishers of the French edition of Closer magazine to court. \"The boundaries have plainly been crossed. I don't think we need to mince words about these photographs. The way they have been obtained is tasteless. \"It is the action of a peeping tom. In our country we prosecute peeping toms. That is exactly what they have done and they have been peeping with long lenses from a long way away. They are very distasteful. \"I have often in the past been critical of the British media. I thoroughly applaud the fact that they will not touch these pictures with a barge pole. They deserve credit for not doing so. It is a pity that other people overseas have lower standards,\" the ex prime minister said. Grant Shapps, the Conservative party co-chairman, said of the British press: \"So far we have seen some restraint. I hope very much that the British press continues with that. And I'm sure that will be taken into account over all [by Lord Justice Leveson].\" Since the publication in Saturday's Irish edition websites dedicated to celebrity gossip like Gawker.com have posted up the images the newspaper displayed in the Irish Republic. Individuals have also posted some of the images on Facebook pages such as one named Kate Middleton Topless.",
