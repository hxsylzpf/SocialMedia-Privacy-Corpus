  "content": "For the past year, the Guardian has reported on how the NSA turned its eye on ordinary American citizens after 9/11, creating a massive surveillance dragnet to collect and monitor the communications of millions\u2014 without warrants, under a legal authority that hadn't existed before. Now, Glenn Greenwald, Ewen MacAskill, Luke Harding and others tell the story behind the NSA revelations in a new Frontline documentary, United States of Secrets: Part One, which aired Tuesday night at 9pm ET on PBS (you can watch a clip above). The documentary dives into \"The Program\" of surveying millions of Americans, and how it came to be. Why did the government keep it hidden from the people it was meant to protect? What happened to the whistleblowers who spoke out against it? And how does government surveillance affect the average American? Following the broadcast, join us here on Wednesday 14 May at 2pm ET/7pm GMT for a live chat moderated by Guardian US national security editor Spencer Ackerman, featuring United States of Secrets producer Mike Wiser and NSA whistleblower Kirk Wiebe. They'll take your questions on surveillance, Snowden, secrecy, and more. We've opened up submissions so you can leave a question in advance in the chat window below. We hope you'll join us for what promises to be a lively and revealing discussion."
