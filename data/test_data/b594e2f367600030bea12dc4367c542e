  "content": "Minister for housing Grant Shapps is the only tweeting Communities and Local Government minister not following the department's Twitter account - @communitiesUK. Shapps, who was hailed by the BBC as the first MP to join the site, has written two detailed blogs sharing his advice for MPs wanting to make the most of social networking, and tweets at @grantshapps. He is one of three ministers in the department to share their thoughts on the site, including Greg Clark and Eric Pickles. According to a list compiled by Rob Dale from thinktank LGiU, 41 MPs from all parties follow the @communitiesUK account, which regularly tweets news and other information from CLG. Of those 41, almost half are Conservative (20), while Labour members came second with 16 and the Liberal Democrats last, with just four MPs following the account. One Labour and Co-operative member also receives the updates. Perhaps a clue to why Shapps doesn't follow his own department lies in his advice to other MPs: \"Never tweet the daily party political propaganda from head office\", is tip number two in his '10 rules of thumb for every tweeting MP'. Shapps said: \"As an avid tweeter with over 50,000 followers I also follow a lot of tweets back. However, there are around 100 Twitter accounts that I keep an even beadier eye on and this includes the @communitiesuk account. \"To do this I use the advanced LIST feature on Twitter. This provides me with a tailored list of those that I want to keep an even closer eye on.\" This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
