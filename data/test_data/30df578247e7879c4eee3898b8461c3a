  "content": "\u2022 The Home Office has detailed the spiralling costs of its controversial ID card scheme in a report to parliament today. It's up more than \u00a3200m on previous estimates to well over \u00a35bn (and that's for the back-office systems, not the technology to actually read ID cards). Home secretary Jacqui Smith argues that there will be \u00a36bn in benefits, but the eagle-eyed Tony Collins at Computer Weekly points out that it's estimated over 30 years - way beyond even the usual incredulous timespans the government uses to justify heavy IT spending. \u2022 The first release candidate for Windows 7 has hit the net - that means it's viable code that could potentially be the version Microsoft sells to everyone. Ed Bott at ZDNet has an incredibly detailed run through. \u2022 Here's a mesmerising video that documents building a virtual city. The city was generated programatically by Shamus Young, who details the process on his blog. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
