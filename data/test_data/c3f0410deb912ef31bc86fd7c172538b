  "content": "I used to love going out on a course and learning stuff. The chance to meet new people, share resources, get ideas and a free lunch. The best continued professional development (CPD) these days is online, or so I'm told. From interactive conversations on Twitter to webinars, now it seems I have to maintain a presence online in addition to a physical one in the classroom and staff meetings. I've become an avatar and have to brand myself. It's cheap for schools \u2013 sharing resources and ideas has become easier \u2013 but, for me, teachers and social media don't mix. I am not talking about the no-brainer situations: being friends with students on Facebook or your boozy holiday snaps being circulated around a Year 10 WhatsApp group. No, I am talking about teachers on Facebook and Twitter and how much they piss me off. Like most people, I am on Facebook for two reasons: cat videos and watching people I went to school with get married before me. I pretty much keep myself to myself, but the teachers on my news feed are a vocal bunch who fall into two distinct categories. First we have the moaners. I'm sure we all fall into this camp at times; sharing posts about how the profession is undervalued, ever-moving goalposts, endless meetings, new policies, thinly-veiled swipes at colleagues and students: \"I wish some people would read their job description\". These people use cryptic posts to invite comments like, \"U OK hun?\". How can we foster public support when we berate our own profession on social media? Posting pictures of my marking pile seems like a pointless exercise, it won't make it disappear, and when I see other people's marking it just reinforces how difficult it's all becoming. If moaners take pictures of all the books they have to mark, the second group \u2013 the swots \u2013 take pictures of the books they have marked, uploading comments such as \"100 books in 40 minutes! Got through three pens, lol #doingitforthekids\". These teachers are the ones that want you to know what an amazing teacher they are and frequently post about what a difference they are making. Fellow swots post validating phrases such as, \"They are lucky to have you xxx\", and, \"You are an inspiration to us all (thumbs up emoji)\". The best piece of advice I have ever received as a teacher is from an ex-sixth form student. It felt like a dig when I first read the comment she wrote on the thank you card, but it has totally shaped how I see my role today. It read: \"Don't make the students you teach the basis of your happiness\". The girl saved me years of therapy with that comment. She contacted me last year and asked me to read her dissertation. She thanked me in the acknowledgements. I've never told that to a soul until now. For me, one of the most infuriating things about Facebook are the people who post messages about their babies and how proud they are of them. The teacher equivalent of this is telling the world about how amazing your class is and how proud you are that they passed their exams. Does your friend Stacey \u2013 a legal secretary that you met at Slimming World \u2013 really care that your GCSE class met their Fischer Family Trust (FFT) target grades? As teachers we all strive to make a difference to children's lives. When you do, don't spoil it by boasting about it to all and sundry \u2013 keep it for yourself. Teachers on Twitter are scarier than those on Facebook. They are wonderful and well-meaning professionals who have taught me so much, but many of these teachers practise symbolic violence. Some do it by shamelessly self-promoting, some pick fights with smaller fish and some deploy intellectual snobbery. I've witnessed hard-working teachers torn to shreds because they've dared to challenge a celebrity teacher on Twitter. Onlookers pick at the carcass by retweeting their support. I'm all for debate , we all have our own ideologies, but let's do this in person. I dabbled for a while, creating an account so that I could retweet useful articles . As far as I could tell it seemed to work, but as I got swept along I started to use it to try and keep up with pedagogical changes and new initiatives. It felt like one big club I wasn't allowed to be a member of: acronyms I didn't understand, events I wasn't invited to, discussions of educational white papers I couldn't access or didn't want to read. I felt like I didn't know my craft and it really knocked my confidence. I felt like I have to constantly compare myself and base my own sense of self-worth on the achievements of others, but then social media is a catalyst for relative deprivation. I can't just be a teacher now, I've got to be the next Jean Piaget or Dylan William. It seems we've become obsessed with these teacher celebrities, and by retweeting every one of their posts, we are boosting their egos. Twitter takes time, but I'd rather spend it planning lessons I want to teach. I love the teachers that share resources and actively campaign to make our bonkers system better, but I cannot tolerate those that post links to the books they've written and the resources they make you pay for. These teachers are the spammers of the social media world and nothing makes my blood boil more than the thought of someone getting rich on substandard ideas. Just because we're teachers, and supposed to know better, it doesn't mean we're immune to the facades that people create on social media: the same people that photograph their resources and classroom are guilty of uploading flattering, high-angle selfies. Aggro-inducing teacher tweeters are the ones that end controversial posts with #justsaying or \"RANT OVER\". And the bloggers that flog their resources to death online are akin to Facebook spammers who try to tempt you into a pyramid scheme under the guise of miracle juice or health supplements. My digital interactions from now on will reflect who I am. I am a teacher, I am not a brand. I will not be a Kardashian with a PGCE. RANT OVER. Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach.
