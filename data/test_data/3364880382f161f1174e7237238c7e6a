  "content": "Twitter-using Tottenham fans have been mixing up cyclist Chris Hoy and referee Chris Foy \u2013 and sending the Olympic champion abuse meant for the latter, following controversial decisions during Spurs' defeat to Stoke City at the weekend. Here's how to tell the two apart: \u2022 Hoy's thighs could have been painted by Rubens; Foy's by LS Lowry. \u2022 \"On your bike\" is Hoy's daily mantra; it's the only publishable thing said to Foy by Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp. \u2022 Hoy punches the air in celebration; Foy points an accusatory finger. \u2022 Hoy dresses like Neneh Cherry; Foy dresses like a schoolboy Johnny Cash. \u2022 Hoy takes a picture of Prince William to the barber's; Foy takes a picture of Dame Judi Dench."
