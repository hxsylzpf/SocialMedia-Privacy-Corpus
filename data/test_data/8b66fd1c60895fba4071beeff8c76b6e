  "content": "Privacy in the drone-filled age is going to be more difficult to protect than ever. Competitors, thieves, or even just your neighbours could be spying on your every move using a remote-controlled flying camera. That's the kind of paranoia Domestic Drone Countermeasures (DDC) is hoping to tap into with its new personal drone detection system (PDDS) Kickstarter project \u2013 a black box that promises to go beep when a drone flies within 15m of its sensors. \"Drones are becoming more capable all the time and this is why it's alarming. They fly with payloads like still cameras, video cameras, infrared detectors, thermal detectors, among other things, and they are already being used for surveillance,\" said Amy Ciesielka, founder of DDC. \"Though there are legitimate uses for domestic drones, there is still concern about invasion of privacy and surveillance by various entities,\" she said. In the UK it is illegal to fly a drone within 50m of a structure even for recreation, while commercial use of drones has to be cleared by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). But in the US personal drones are not regulated by the American Federal Aviation Administration and can currently be flown around buildings and built-up areas. Black box goes beep Portland, Oregon-based DDC has been working on the technology for more than a year and promises to warn users of personal drone snooping before it's too late. The PDDS kit cannot detect military drones as \"they fly too high and are too sophisticated,\" according to the company. The kit consists of three boxes \u2013 a primary command and control unit that connects via Wi-Fi to the internet, and two sensors which are placed about the home. More sensors can be connected to the primary unit for covering a larger area. If a drone is detected the command and control unit sends a notification to the user's smartphone, tablet or computer, even while the user is away from home. The PDDS kit does not promise to actually block the drone's invasion of privacy, yet. In April, Robert Knowles became the first person convicted in the UK for \"dangerously\" flying a drone. He was fined \u00a3800 and ordered to pay \u00a33,500 costs by the Furness and District Magistrate court after being prosecuted by the CAA. A starter PDDS kit costs $499 from DDC on Kickstarter, but as ever with crowd-funded projects, the system may not come to fruition."
