  "content": "Six years ago today, the world was sent its first tweet. With just two words \u2013 and far shorter than the 140 character limit \u2013 Twitter founder Jack Dorsey was the first human to publicly tackle the microblogging platform's big question: \"What are you doing?\" His answer: Pretty practical for a groundbreaking moment in web history. So what were you were doing the first time you entered the Twittersphere? If you can't recall, check out My First Tweet or Tweet#1 to jog your memory. Tweet us your first words using the hashtag #myfirsttweet and we'll retweet our favorites. Feeling shy? Don't! Here are a few examples of notorious newborn tweets to get your # flowing: Barack Obama, with more than 13 million followers, the president is far and away the most popular politician on Twitter: Lady Gaga, Twitter monster that she is, is the first person to boast more than 20 million followers: Celebrity chef Paula Deen would become an internet meme in her own right, but on Twitter she controls her own message: Oprah Winfrey says \"you get a tweet and you get a tweet and you get a tweet!\" Not really, but this was her first one: Former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner's first tweet is rather ironically heartbreaking given the medium (and his misuse of it) is what woud ultimately lead to his downfall: Rap mogul and self-styled style icon Kanye West has proven a master of the koan-like tweet: In a chronological list of first-ever tweets, this is guaranteed to be the only time you'll find Gloria Steinem wedged between Kanye and Charlie Sheen: Actor Charlie Sheen's very public flame-out last year netted him more than a million followers in a single day when he joined and introduced the following hashtag: Pope Benedict XVI, a pious tweeter if ever there was one: Dr Ruth Westheimer is an excellent follow \u2013 she tweets timeless sex tips and famously tried to crowdsource what a sexual position named after Jeremy Lin might look like: Samuel L Jackson's might be the best first tweet of all time (with Danny Devito's running a close second): Rupert Murdoch is a late-comer to the medium, and his odd initial tweets raised suspcions that it might be a phony account: What were your first 140 characters? Tweet them at us with #myfirsttweet and we'll RT our favorites. Here are some of your #myfirsttweet posts from today From Slate editor, Jeremy Stahl: Rola Kersha didn't have to look back, she tweeted for the first time today: A bewildered Daniel Crowe reached out to the Twitterverse for comfort: Jonny Eberle was rather trepedatious: While Stefan Campbell's thought of ways to turn a profit: Lauren Salay worried about Hurricane Irene: Nouveau Broke explained his handle: Adam Estes still can't answer the question in his first tweet:",
