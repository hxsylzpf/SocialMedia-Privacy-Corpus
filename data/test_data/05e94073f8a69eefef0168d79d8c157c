  "content": "Twitter's chief executive, Dick Costolo, says talk of a $10bn (\u00a36.2bn) acquisition of the messaging company by Google is \"just a rumour\" and that the site is already making money. Speaking at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Costolo asked whether Google could afford a $10bn acquisition \u2013 following rumours that this was the price being considered by the search engine firm for the messaging startup. \"People write that stuff all the time \u2026 I don't know where these things come from, it's just a rumour.\" He fell short of an outright denial, however. Costolo also suggested that Twitter, which started operations in February 2006, will this year introduce a new method of making money, to add to its existing roster of promoted tweets, accounts and trends. However, he did not specify what that would be. His comments came as the online gaming company Zynga became the latest social media company to join the virtual gold rush. The maker of the phenomenally popular FarmVille game is reportedly holding discussions with investors about raising $250m in a deal that could value the three-year-old startup at $7bn to $9bn, according to the Wall Street Journal. Costolo, who took over as chief executive from Evan Williams, one of Twitter's co-founders, last October said Twitter was now regularly carrying 130m tweets a day, up from 100m at the end of 2010, and that at its peak in Japan at the new year there were 6,000 tweets per second. \"At the end of this year's Superbowl we saw 4,000 tweets per second,\" Costolo said. \"During the game there were sustained periods when it was 3,000 tweets per second. Just to give you some contrast, during the 2008 Superbowl we served 28 tweets per second.\" He said Twitter has settled on a mission statement, which is to \"instantly connect people everywhere to what's most meaningful to them\". He said that the notion that the site is simply for people to announce that they are going to the dentist missed its purpose: \"it makes no difference that there are 100m raindrops during a day. The point is that some will have meaning to me.\" The essence of Twitter's usefulness was the way that it links people socially, he said. While not revealing how many users Twitter had worldwide, Costolo said that 40% access it from mobile devices. He added that there had been \"dramatic increases\" in the number of users in Tunisia and Egypt before and during the recent upheavals there. But he said that it was important not to underestimate how it had been action by people which had made the difference in those countries, rather than the existence of social networking. \"There's been a lot of discussion about the importance of these platforms and that takes away from what these people [in the Middle East] have accomplished.\" Twitter is trying to make itself simpler to use, and get incorporated into smartphones so that it is easy to use. He said that there were no plans to introduce a Twitter-branded smartphone, and that he was not worried about competitors \u2013 \"only lack of execution\". The initial analyst reaction was mixed. Eden Zoller, at Ovum, said: \"Twitter quoted figures on healthy growth and use, which is good but not surprising. What it didn't provide was concrete details on was how effective its nascent businesses are proving to be in driving revenues \u2013 lots of case studies of cool brands using Twitter but no hard line on the margins this brings to Twitter. \"Partnerships were mooted \u2013 cue Google and Facebook \u2013 but Twitter once again demurred. In our view partnerships that go beyond integration deals would be a good move for the company's future prospects, which are growing in terms of numbers but not much else. \"We expected more, for example what Twitter is doing to build its application ecosystem, given the importance of apps in adding value to the service and the fact that a growing number of Twitter users interact with the service via apps. We also hoped Twitter would show that it intends to leverage mobile location better than it is, and likewise search. \"Both have the potential to add further value to the service and also have business model potential, for instance in social commerce scenarios of the sort being driven by Foursquare among others.\""
