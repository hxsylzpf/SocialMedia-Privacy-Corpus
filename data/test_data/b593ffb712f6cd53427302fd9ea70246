  "content": "Leading up to its launch in October, British social TV startup Zeebox attracted plenty of attention within the television industry. Its iPad app was hailed as innovative and disruptive: a second-screen electronic programme guide (EPG) that used Facebook and Twitter to guide people's viewing choices by what their friends and the wider world were watching and tweeting about. It has been interesting to watch the response from iPad owners, expressed through their reviews on the App Store. Dozens of five-star reviews hail it as \"awesome\", \"amazing\" and \"the start of something very big\", while a decent number of one-star reviews wonder what all the fuss is about. \"I don't get it\", \"waste of time\" and \"Basically a TV guide that asks for your Facebook account, no thanks\" being three examples. Zeebox has divided opinion, in other words. Talk to founders Anthony Rose and Ernesto Schmitt, and it's clear that Zeebox in its current form is just the start of the company's ambitions, with plans to add new features that may convince some of those doubters - even if their confidence runs the risk of hardening the antipathy of others. \"The living room TV was the last dumb screen in the house,\" says Schmitt. \"The emergence of net-connected TVs; the mass proliferation of companion devices like smartphones, laptops and tablets; and people's expectations that entertainment will be socially connected felt like a perfect storm. The time was right to revolutionise TV.\" One reason for some of the more negative reactions to Zeebox v1.0 may be that it doesn't feel as revolutionary as it's been built up to be. It's a well-designed EPG that lets you see what people are tweeting about a given show, and if you have enough Facebook friends who have the app and are actively using it, lets you connect with them too. The potentially revolutionary stuff is what's coming in the next few months, though. Starting with a feature called Showtime, which will make its debut on 28 November through a partnership with Channel 4, based on its new scripted reality show Desperate Scousewives. \"Showtime is a tool that allows broadcasters to use our platform to plug in their own content,\" says Schmitt. That includes a Twitter visualisation mini-app, tweets from the cast, videos, information on the soundtrack, a Google Map of the show's key Liverpool locations, and a \"Scouse Glossary\" for viewers who are struggling with some of the slang. \"Broadcasters can choose what they want to do: it's a new plugin architecture that allows them to take over and augment Zeebox, owning the space with their own content,\" says Rose. \"We're also seeing production companies developing the skills to use this plugin architecture, and you'll see quite a few programmes over the coming months starting to take advantage of this.\" The pitch to broadcasters and producers is that making this content for Zeebox is - in the longer term at least - a better bet than splashing out on their own standalone apps for individual shows. Zeebox isn't alone in this idea: Shazam, Umami and Yahoo's IntoNow are three other firms working with similar ideas. Showtime was added to Zeebox's iPad app in its v1.1.0 update, which went live on 23 November. Alongside it was another new feature called Starwatch, which Rose says taps into the hundreds of celebrities who are tweeting about their own TV viewing habits. \"It totally reinterprets the way Twitter is used,\" he says. \"We made a list of about 400 celebrities, from Alan Sugar and Stephen Fry to politicians, Radio 5 Live sports hosts and so on. And when they tweet around a programme, our servers follow them and hashtag it, then assign them to that programme in Zeebox and show their icon in the interface.\" In other words, Zeebox users watching a show - The X Factor, say \u2013 will be able to see which celebrities are also watching and tweeting about it. Or, indeed, watching and tweeting about something on another channel. \"When Stephen Fry tweets about a programme, thousands of people might flip to that show,\" says Rose. \"Celebrities can become the TV schedulers of the future by saying 'I'm watching this' and that going out to the Twitter audience.\" Social features are key to Zeebox, but one of the ongoing criticisms of this kind of app comes from people who don't want their TV viewing to have social networking imposed upon it. Rose admits that plenty of people aren't attracted by the idea, although he notes that this may be partly generational \u2013 \"some people over 35 are a bit scared of it, but people under 35 can't get enough of it\". He stresses that Zeebox will not force its user to log in to Facebook, and points to its private viewing mode, which is used when someone doesn't want to share what they're watching with friends or the wider world. But he is bullish in his belief that people should not write off the idea of social TV before they have tried it. \"If you haven't tried a companion viewing app because you think it'll detract from your viewing, try it and you'll see,\" he says. \"To diss is peremptorially is just stupid. Check it out to see if it's going to work for you. It may be better or worse for different shows, but even if it only enhances a third of your viewing, that's good.\" What comes after Showtime and Starwatch? An iPhone version is almost ready for release, with Android to follow afterwards. After that? E-commerce. Zeebox is working on ways to help people buy the products they see in TV shows and adverts from within its app. \"We'll be using video recognition to recognise ads on TV, so for something like Nike you'll be able to buy the product from your second screen with a few clicks. But this can apply to the songs playing on TV, and links to catch-up content.\" Getting Zeebox to integrate more tightly with personal video recorders (PVRs) and video-on-demand services is on the company's agenda for 2012, too. One question for Rose is how Zeebox views the TV strategies of Google and Apple, with the former working on improving its Google TV platform after an unpromising start, and the latter strongly rumoured to be working on its own television set for 2012. Rose does not mince his words when it comes to Google TV. \"Google continues to not understand the television space: it's entering it like a technology company rather than as a content company,\" he says. \"If you look at the homepage of Google TV, it's a set of app buttons. People need to switch on and see content. Fundamentally Google are thinking as software engineers, and not as people who really watch television. But maybe someone else will make a great Google TV app \u2013 a Spotify for television \u2013 that will change this.\" And Apple? Rose has much less to say on this score, given the lack of information on what the company has planned: \"It's a complete enigma.\" Even so, his enthusiasm for the potential of companion apps \u2013 and Zeebox in particular \u2013 is unbounded. \"This is really the TV of the future, and it's not science fiction. It's happening right now. Second screen is really going to move the tectonic plates around for television.\"",
