  "content": "That old saw about not blaming your tools for bad workmanship springs to my mind whenever people complain about Twitter. I cannot see how a wonderful facility, a digital blessing to our generation, should be blamed because people happen to use it irresponsibly. In the aftermath of the Newsnight drama, when thousands of people without the slightest proof decided to tweet, falsely, that Lord McAlpine was a child abuser, it was regarded as Twitter's fault. No it wasn't. It was entirely the fault of the people who misused it, either out of ignorance of the law or, worse still, because they thought they could get away with it. Rightly, McAlpine is pursuing them through the courts and, sportingly, taking only nominal sums from most of them (which he will pass on to charity). He was wise enough not to do what some think he should have done: sue Twitter itself. As I write in my column in today's London Evening Standard: \"It would be as pointless for a defamed man to sue Twitter because of a libellous tweet as it would be for a stabbing victim to sue a kitchen shop because it sold his attacker the knife.\" I believe McAlpine has done everyone a favour by reminding us of the dangers of tapping out 140-character character assassinations. Twitter users are not above the law. Incidentally, in my Standard article I refer to the Dominic Behan song, McAlpine's Fusiliers. It was written about the Irish men who worked for Lord McAlpine's grandfather, Sir Robert, who was nicknamed \"Concrete Bob.\" The version above, here on YouTube, is as good as any.",
