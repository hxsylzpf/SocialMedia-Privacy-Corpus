  "content": "My initial reaction when the picture of Charles Saatchi holding Nigella by the throat landed on my desk was one of disbelief. The images were incredibly disturbing. Of course we realised we had a very powerful story that would set the news agenda, although none of us could have predicted how much it would affect people. We're used to seeing hundreds of paparazzi images every day, but these were in a different league. Potentially they showed criminal behaviour. What we were seeing was a woman apparently being violently abused in a very public place. We had long discussions about privacy issues, as we do now on so many stories. One issue was the effect it might have on Nigella's children. Our debate kept coming back to what was going on behind closed doors if Saatchi was able to behave like this in public. We concluded that there was a genuine public interest in the pictures. We couldn't think of any circumstances in which his behaviour could be justified. But in case there was, we took the decision to go to both parties well before publication. We heard nothing back. We had no idea what the argument was about and, frankly, it's irrelevant. Charles Saatchi felt he had the right to put his hands to his wife's throat, causing her distress in front of passersby and other diners. That is not acceptable. We wanted to put a domestic abuse hotline number in the article, but the legal advice we had was not to, as we could not be certain that it was domestic violence. The response was immediate. We had been waiting with a certain nervousness for the reaction from social media, but it was overwhelmingly in favour of our decision to publish. There were a couple of predictable attacks from anti-tabloid quarters, but by the time Nigella had walked out of her home on Sunday afternoon, suitcases in hand, they were silenced. Within a few days, domestic violence hotlines were recording a huge spike in numbers \u2013 a very positive reaction. One thing that struck me from the initial reaction to the photos was just how popular Nigella is. Do I feel responsible for \"Team Nigella\"? Not at all. We simply published an incredible set of news pictures. The public saw Nigella as the victim and supported her."
