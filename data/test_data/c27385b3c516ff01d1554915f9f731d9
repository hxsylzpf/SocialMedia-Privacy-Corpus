  "content": "\"They gave us the Beatles, we gave them data.gov\" is the title of the blogpost by Vivek Chundra Kundra, the US's chief information officer who is head of the US's data.gov - a title that one could take as being slightly pointed, yes? \"Taking a page from our efforts here in the Obama Administration, the United Kingdom today launched data.gov.uk \u2013 a site to aggregate datasets from the UK government. It is exciting to see the seeds of openness, accountability, and transparency taking root around the world.\" It certainly is. However, there seems to be a certain amount of one-up-datasetmanship going on here; possibly Kundra was stung by the claim on ReadWriteWeb that \"the UK's datastore puts data.gov to shame\". According to RWW, \"The UK government has been a big supporter of innovation built on top of public data. It sponsored a contest called Show Us a Better Way, giving cash prizes to people who came up with the best ideas for mashups they would like to create if they had access the right government data. Charles Arthur at the Guardian has good coverage of the UK's open data work - the Guardian has been working hard to open public data as well.\" \"The US government, on the other hand, has been lackluster in its move to open data to facilitate outside innovation.\" So given that Stephen Timms announced today that there are 2,500 datasets available (a number that was being revised with each version of the speech, I hear), Kundra apparently can't resist the temptation to put in a little correction: \"When we launched Data.gov here at the White House website in May 2009, we had just 47 datasets online. It was a modest start, but the growth we've seen has been phenomenal. Today, there are more than 168,000 datasets online, and federal agencies are poised to publish new high-value information this week as the next step in Administration's Open Government Initiative.\" 168,000 eh? That's a lot. My understanding though is that a visit to the US by Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt, including a White House visit, was key to getting the data.gov.uk site on track in the summer of 2009 - so Kundra can certainly take some of the reflected glory. Even if people at the data.gov.uk launch on Thursday did spend a fair bit of time tweaking the figurative nose of data.gov in the US. Then it all gets nice again and everyone's happy: \"The Federal Government does not have a monopoly on the best ideas. We are all part of an increasingly complex network of communities, ideas, and information. We applaud today's launch of data.gov.uk and look forward to working with the international community to ensure that people across the world are actively engaged in helping find the most innovative paths to solve some of the toughest problems we face. Moreover, we are pleased to see that other governments share the Administration's philosophy that data availability will help change how government operates and empower citizens to participate in making government services more effective, accessible, and transparent.\" Yeah. And we gave them the Beatles. And what did we get in return? High School Musical."
