  "content": "Many weeks ago, I agreed, on behalf of the middle-aged man band I'm in, to play a short set on a small stage at the Guardian Open Weekend. Like a far-off appointment to have a tooth pulled, this didn't seem terribly frightening on the day I put it in my diary, which, by coincidence, was a Christmas present from my dentist. But on the day itself, riding towards the event in a car containing half the band and two-thirds of our equipment, the whole thing is starting to feel like a miscalculated risk. The rest of the band have at various times taken issue with the way they are presented in this column. They object to repeated use of the phrase \"middle-aged man band\" and my habit of giving the impression that we are terrible. I fear they may see an audience made up of Guardian readers as an opportunity for revenge. My fears, it seems, are justified. During past performances, our lead singer has related a not entirely PC anecdote in which I figure as the first child ever adopted by Madonna. When I suggest that it might not be appropriate under the circumstances, he begins rehearsing it out loud in the poshest drawl he can muster. \"It's just not logical,\" I say, weakly. \"She's only five years older than me.\" The stage is set up in the main foyer, and all the seats facing it are full. I spent the morning at the festival and I know these chairs are constantly occupied by people resting their legs. Our success will be judged not by how many readers and colleagues turn up, but by how few we drive away. As I step on to the stage, I realise my hands are shaking. \"What are you doing up here?\" I think. \"You're almost as old as Madonna.\" In the end, we split the difference \u2013 the band is more than competent and I am more than terrible. At one point I get my thumb pick inextricably caught in the strings of my banjo and have to turn my back to the audience while I figure out how to retrieve my hand. Nevertheless, most of the crowd stay put, and a fair few come up afterwards to say we were not as bad as they'd been led to believe. A lot of people must think the banjo is supposed to sound like that. After many post-performance drinks, I am charged by the band with determining how we were actually received, because of my known talent for finding bad things people have said about me on social media. Just before bed, I turn on my computer and start scrolling through the day's tweets. The first mention I find says, \"You're pretty good at fishing for compliments.\" I ignore it, because I can't recall the incident to which it refers. The next says, \"Ha Ha.\" Twitter narratives unfold in reverse; I scroll backwards past \"There there, I'm sure you don't\" and \"Come on Tim!\" until I discover that at some point before midnight, when I was still in the guitarist's flat, drinking like a man with a freshly pulled tooth, I posted a tweet saying, \"Hi, I suck at everything I try in life :)\" The next morning I find the middle son watching TV with a friend who spent the night. \"Did you hack into my Twitter account to say that I suck at everything I try in life?\" I ask. \"With a smiley face?\" \"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" he says, beaming with pride and pointing to his friend. \"And it was his idea.\" When I speculate on all the options they must have considered and rejected before settling on that one, I can only admire their restraint."
