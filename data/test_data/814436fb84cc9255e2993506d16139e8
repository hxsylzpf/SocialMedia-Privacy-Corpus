  "content": "The BBC is partnering with London start-up iSporty to introduce social networking to BBC Sport's cycling website. A pilot scheme will invite users to create a profile of themselves, along with blogs, video and photo contributions. Features on the iSporty website also allow users to create calendars of events and join discussion forums. The BBC is trialing the tie-up with iSporty as part of a move to \"foster a community\" around popular sports, according to the BBC Sport assistant editor, Claire Stocks. \"This is part of the BBC's growing commitment to let go of its own content and become part of the wider web,\" she said. The iSporty founder, Chris Ward, said the website has a different objective to other sports sites focused on single sports, aiming to provide discussion and content sharing between fans with different interests. \"Brands have content on the web but people that play sport are not online surfers,\" he added. \"They don't visit on the off chance. They use the web to organise and socialise around their sport, debate the latest news, enter events and book travel.\" iSporty, which launched just three months ago, provides white-label social networking tools for a number of content partners and brands including Red Bull, Men's Health and 20th Century Fox, for the release of the Rocky Balboa DVD. The website was started with private investment and funding from London-based specialist investment firm NewMedia Spark. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
