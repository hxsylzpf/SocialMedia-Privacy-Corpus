  "content": "Poor LinkedIn. It just can't seem to catch a break. When news broke that the business social network's password database had been hacked, there came the dull roar online of \"Who cares?\" It became the target of snarky comments: \"Will we now be bombarded by unwanted emails,\" people asked? \"Oh, no wait \u2013 that's what LinkedIn does on any given day anyway!\" Where was the tea and sympathy? Like I said, poor LinkedIn. Long viewed as the ugly stepsister of social networking \u2013 Jack Donaghy, a fictional TV executive played by Alec Baldwin on the television series 30 Rock, once described a down-on-his-luck former rival thusly: \"He's on LinkedIn \u2026 He might as well be dead\" \u2013 this security breach will only send its cool stock plummeting even further. Launched back in 2003, it's never had the glamour of its too-cool-for-school network siblings. Even Bebo's cooler. The reason? LinkedIn is for work. Its existence \u2013 Wikipedia describes it as a \"professional social networking site\" \u2013 flies in the face of the norms of social networking. How many of us really want to share our non-working lives with the people we work with or would like to work with? It's so \u2026 awkward. If Twitter is the cool teenager smoking behind the bike sheds, and Facebook is a handy big brother, LinkedIn is your slightly sweaty colleague, shuffling awkwardly at the Christmas get-together. Like most Brits, I find it difficult to strike up conversation with a stranger unless I'm at a bus stop and the weather's doing something interesting (or not even that interesting \u2013 we're British). This makes networking a hellish experience. I've been to my fair share of events where I've had to force conversation out of the other person. It's draining, but at least there's often a bar and the sanctuary afforded by the loo and your smartphone. LinkedIn seems to me to be the natural home of the people who want to network, but don't want to dally by chatting. More like an anti-social network (couldn't resist, sorry). The recently leaked password link revealed depressing choices among the usual \"Password1\" and \"LinkedIn\": \"lasttry\", \"solonely\", \"indebt\", \"fireme\" and the succinct and quiet \"sadness\" reveal a lot about the nature of LinkedIn. Maybe LinkedIn's first error was to think professional networking was a good idea on which to build a social network. What to include on your profile? Your CV, certainly. A recommendation or two from a previous employer, sure: \"I found Bim to be a diligent and inventive worker during her time here. We were sad to see her go\", that sort of thing. Next, you connect with people. And here LinkedIn makes its second mistake: the sheer effort of connecting. First, an email goes to the person, bearing the message: \"I'd like to add you to my professional network.\" How desperately unsexy. I mean, how would you respond to such an invite in the real world? Exactly. Then come all the extras: Do you want to link your website to your profile? Uh, OK. How about your Twitter account? Hmm. Do I want potential bosses to know that I often go on extended tweet sprees about Chris Evans's (Captain America not TFI Friday) bum? There's the horribly depressing progress bar on the right of your profile page that tells you how complete your profile is (mine has been at 95% for the last several months), just like in online job application forms. This is the problem, LinkedIn \u2013 you're just not cute and breezy enough. In a world where I can dip in and out of conversations, without even having to join Twitter, LinkedIn feels a little too much like, well, like work. I already have a job for that; I don't need extra. Full disclosure: I'm on LinkedIn. In the many years I've been on it, I've used it to find the contact details of a freelance journalist I wanted to interview, and I've used it to get in contact with a uni mate I'd lost touch with. But it remains a largely useless tool for me. So why do I keep my LinkedIn account? Because even though I've never even had a sniff of a job offer through the site, as a freelancer, I can't chance it. What if, right this minute, a magazine editor is scouring my profile and thinking, \"She's perfect for the job!\" \u2022 Follow Comment is Free on Twitter @commentisfree"
