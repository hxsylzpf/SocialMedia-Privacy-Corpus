  "content": "Motorsport president Max Mosley denied in court today that he had been involved in a Nazi orgy, saying he could not think of anything less erotic. \"I can think of few things more unerotic than Nazi roleplay\", said Mosley, president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the governing body for formula one. Mosley is suing the News of the World for breach of privacy over allegations that he was involved in what the paper called a \"sick Nazi orgy\" with five prostitutes. Mosley, 68-year-old son of 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, rejected any suggestion that the sadomasochistic roleplay had Nazi overtones, saying this had no appeal for him. \"All my life I had it hanging over me with the undercurrent from my parents and the last thing I would want to do is for that to enter my sexual life,\" Mosley told Mr Justice Eady in the high court in London. Mosley, the FIA president since 1993, said the News of the World front-page story and website video had a \"devastating\" effect on his family. \"My wife and I have been married for more than 48 years and together more than 50 years since we were teenagers and she never knew this aspect of my life,\" Mosley said. \"That headline in the News of the World was completely and utterly devastating for her and there was nothing I could say. \"For my two sons, I don't think there is anything worse for a son to see in a newspaper article, especially in a newspaper like News of the World, the pictures they printed. I can think of nothing more undignified.\" Mosley looked slightly uncomfortable as he was asked to explain sadomasochism (S&amp;M) to the judge. He said that roleplay was an integral part of this because it provided a justification for the central activity of punishment. \"I fundamentally disagree with the suggestion that any of this is depraved or immoral. It's a perfectly harmless activity provided it's between consenting adults in private and nobody knows about it,\" he said. Mosley said that people that practise this get used to the pain and for him it was preferable to jumping into a cold swimming pool. To News of the World lawyer Mark Warby QC's suggestion that the level of violence was criminal, he said: \"That's absolutely absurd, [the] level of violence is very small and the drawing of blood was incidental like cutting yourself shaving.\" He said it was \"laughable\" to say it was criminal given that society condones piercing and tattoos and violent sports. Mosley said he tried not to be high profile and he did not believe his sexual life had anything to do with his job. \"If I were to, for example get caught drink driving or speeding I think that would be [relevant to the job]. \"I think things of the nature being discussed here are completely outside the scope of my work.\" Mosley said he would much prefer not to be in court discussing his sex life but he realised that was the price he had to pay for bringing an action. Earlier, Mosley's lawyer James Price QC said the story was a \"gross and indefensible intrusion\" on the 68-year-old's private life. Mr Price said the newspaper had made a \"shocking and entirely false\" suggestion that Mosley had played a concentration-camp commandant and a cowering death-camp inmate. \"We say this hyperbole is quite absurd as a description of what actually happened,\" Mr Price told the judge. \"It does not come well from the News of the World. The role of the News of the World as peeping Tom publishing for the amusement of the millions sits uncomfortably with its self-appointed role as arbitrator of the nation's morals. \"Everyone knows that the News of the World lives by sexual titillation. Everyone knows that the pontificating is just hypocritical. It would be funny if it were not so terribly harmful to the News of the World's victims.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
