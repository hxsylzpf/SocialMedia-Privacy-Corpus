  "content": "Jonathan Ross's Twitter followers and his twego (that's Twitter ego, to non-nerds) are growing by the day, and he provides more than a little entertainment for the twitterati. Latterly, he's been indulging in a little meme invention \u2013 that is the creation of trends and message fads that can take over for a few hours, at least. His meme? Suing the Telegraph. Or not. It all began with the Telegraph's piece quoting Front Row presenter and Guardian contributor Mark Lawson, who said Ross would find his BBC return \"pretty unbearable\" and that the presenter \"probably has the biggest PR problem any television person has had\". Ross wasn't pleased. \"Mark Lawson knows nothing,\" he declared. \"BBC 100% supportive and great guests confirmed for first four shows,\" and sure enough Tom Cruise was confirmed an hour later. But it was this tweet, a day earlier, that started things off: \"Will resume detective work later. Am off to sue The Telegraph. Bye.\" Look what he has started: \"Slow progress. Firefox now back to the way I want it. Sigh. What next? Re-install Photoshop? Meh. I'm off to sue the Telegraph.\" \"Right. Off to the pub. And to sue the Telegraph.\" \"Gritting my teeth and heading to Oliver! If it's not good I'll sue the Telegraph (although don't yet know why I would).\""
