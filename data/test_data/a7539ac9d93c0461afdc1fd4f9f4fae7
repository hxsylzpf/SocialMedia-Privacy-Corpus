  "content": "The Society of Editors is asking any editors who may have encountered problems with the new Human Rights Act, which came into force on October 2, to contact it. The move follows reports that a police force had told a local newspaper it can no longer release the names and addresses of people who have been charged before they have appeared in court. The Society of Editors would not reveal the name of the police force. The society's director, Bob Satchwell, said that on the whole he \"cautiously welcomed\" the Human Rights Act, believing that it would ultimately mean greater freedom of information. He pointed out that the act emphasises that Article 10 - protecting the freedom of the press - should be given precedence over Article eight, which protects the right to privacy. \"A lot of senior government law officers are saying that its going to be beneficial for the media,\" he said. Mr Satchwell said he was talking to the police force in question in an attempt to put the situation right. He added: \"What we are concerned about is that there are lots of organisations around the country who are going to have to be educated about what the act means.\" Last week the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir John Stevens, said that he wanted police forces across the country to co-operate with the media to counteract a growing \"suspicion\" between the two."
