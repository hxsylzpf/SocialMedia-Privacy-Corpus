  "content": "Few things happen on Anglesey these days without the national media being informed, so when two cars, including a police Range Rover piled high with luggage, were seen being driven off the island on Monday afternoon it was a fair bet that Prince William and his duchess were finally starting their honeymoon, 10 days after the royal wedding. Herewith starts the latest game of cat and mouse \u2013 with the couple the mice and the pursuing moggies, laden with cameras, trying to spot which particular hole they are bolting for. The Seychelles seems the winner. It's nice at this time of year, especially in a \u00a34,000 a night beach hotel. But events over the past few days indicate the paparazzi may not have things all their own way. A shot has already been aimed across their path with an official complaint by the Middleton family over publication of five-year-old photographs showing Kate Middleton and her younger sister, Pippa \u2013 and their mother, Carole \u2013 in bikinis relaxing on board a yacht while on holiday with William and others off Ibiza in 2006. They are eerily reminiscent of Princess Diana's last holiday with Dodi Fayed on a yacht in 1997. The pictures, supplied by a London freelance agency, are grainy, long-distance and clearly unauthorised and some have apparently been published before, but what has given them special resonance now with the tabloids \u2013 the News of the World, Mail on Sunday, Daily Mail and Daily Mirror published them \u2013 is that they include not just Kate Middleton, but also Pippa, who has become a sudden media star since wearing That Dress as bridesmaid at That Wedding. If one \"wisteria sister\" has married her prince, the second now also climbs into the sunlight. Even her bottom has its own appreciative website. What prompted the Middletons' complaint about the invasion of their privacy was not the lubricious commentary about Pippa's \"now world-famous rear admirable\" but probably the News of the World's decision to push things too far by publishing a picture showing a silhouette of one of her breasts as she took off her bikini top. The newspapers all trumpeted that their pictures were exclusive, or \"never seen before\", which may prove a strategic mistake, especially if they subsequently claim that, as pictures from the yacht party have been published before without complaint, they have not intruded into the family's privacy now. It is difficult to have it both ways. The fact that Pippa, who was 22 then and is 27 now, was not the focus of attention in those days is no excuse: she still has a right to privacy, particularly if the yacht was discreetly positioned. The Press Complaints Commission was insisting yesterday that the Middletons have as much right to a private life as any other members of the public \u2013 \"the same as everybody else, from prince to commoner, in terms of their expectation of privacy\" \u2013 but, of course, the Middletons are no longer just anybody, just as William was not any old student when the papers respected his privacy as a student at Eton, then St Andrews. The PCC has been quietly protecting them for some time, though it would hate to admit it and has only occasionally broken cover. Editors regularly get quiet letters of prior restraint and pointed reminders of the journalists' code of practice, which prohibits \"persistence in questioning, telephoning, pursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist, nor remaining on their property when asked to leave and must not follow them\". By and large that has meant that pictures such as one of Kate Middleton on a tennis court and another of her at a family Christmas, taken through a window, have not seen the light of day in Britain. On the one previous occasion that a formal complaint was lodged, against the Daily Mirror in March 2007 after it published a photograph of her in the street carrying a cup of coffee, the paper published a grovelling mea culpa, or in the PCC's terms \"a prompt, public expression of regret and admission of error\". Its editor, Richard Wallace, said then, only slightly querulously: \"We published an innocuous picture of Miss Middleton walking down the street with a cup of coffee. It was taken by a freelance photographer in circumstances where we were later told she felt harassed. We got it wrong and we sincerely regret that.\" But even in the past few weeks there have been other informal complaints. On 7 April, Carole and Pippa told the PCC that they had been harassed while out shopping in London by agency photographers riding mopeds, and even on the morning of the wedding itself the PCC was recording its satisfaction that the Daily Mail had withdrawn inaccurate references to James Middleton, Kate's brother, from a story on its website. The old strapline that the Sun likes to put on its exclusives to warn off rivals, \"Our lawyers are watching\", springs to mind. It is not only the press that likes to have its cake and eat it, however: no complaint has been received about pictures published in several papers last Friday showing Kate Middleton pushing a shopping trolley in the carpark outside the Anglesey Waitrose \u2013 pictures taken by several photographers according to the bylines. Was the calculation that they were taken in a public place, or that they happily conveyed the fiction that the duchess is really just a services' wife who knows all about doing the weekly shopping while her husband is hard at work rescuing walkers taken ill on Snowdonia? If so, that may be a step on from Princess Diana's early experience of married life in 1981 when she was photographed popping out to the shops to buy some sweets. The Queen called in editors to make a quiet plea for her daughter-in-law's privacy, only to be asked by Barry Askew, the editor of the News of the World, why they didn't just send out a servant to buy them? \"That was a pompous remark Mr Askew,\" Her Majesty remarked and he was ousted within weeks. Thirty years on, both sides are more savvy \u2013 but don't expect the media's fascination to be too constrained. However remote the honeymoon is, if there is a good enough picture there will be buyers somewhere."
