  "content": "Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow has been airing his views on the future of newspapers, paywalls, Google and the political power wielded by Rupert Murdoch and his son, James. Here are some nuggets from his lecture, and a question-and-answer session, at Edinburgh University on Friday evening: On newspapers: \"I would give the newspaper 25 years. Who's read the printed word on iPads? Fantastic, better than the printed word in fact. A newspaper on an iPad is absolutely fantastic.\" On paywalls: \"I don't think The Times online is the way to go, to be honest. The readership has plummeted despite the great amount of spin they have put on it... \"I pay for the FT online because I am a complete economic ignoramus - we're living in economically really challenging times, and the FT is good for that. But I will not pay for the Times online.\" On Google (plus Yahoo, Twitter and Facebook): \"They need us... as much as we need them. They can't really sustain new media without some quality content. We content providers, we hacks, we producers, we people of great excellence, we people who go out and hunt for information, and who hone it into a product that is consumable.\" On the Murdochs: \"They do have a very, very strong hold right now. I don't think it's a good idea. I feel very strongly that if people do want to exert influence on this country they should pay taxes.\" He said much, much more during the course of his lecture, part of a series entitled A changing media in a changing world.
