  "content": "Animal charity The Blue Cross is battling for a share of the vast online audience for anything related to pets; you only have to look at the success of I Can Has Cheezburger? to witness the power of the cats/internet combination, and the Blue Cross is trying to do something far more worthwhile. London-based Zak Akhimien is the web editor for the Blue Cross site allaboutpets.org.uk, which has notched up 7,000 members and 450,000 unique users in its first six months. Akhimien explains how he is trying to turn the web presence for the 111-year-old charity into a social network that provides support and advice for pet owners. Blue Cross web editor Zak Akhimien \u2022 Explain your business to my Mum \"All About Pets is a social network for pet lovers, where you can meet people to talk about pets, share pet care advice or download information from The Blue Cross.\" \u2022 How does that work? \"Members can create profiles for themselves and their pets, upload photos or links to videos, send messages or join groups. They can use the forum to post questions about pets or share their own advice, or download reliable pet care advice from The Blue Cross. Users can also find out about pet-friendly events in their area and get the latest in pet news.\" \u2022 How do you make money? \"Every service on All About Pets is completely free. Visitors who want to show their appreciation are welcome to click through to The Blue Cross website and make a donation to help the needy animals in our care.\" \u2022 Any weird business experiences so far? \"We created an online viral of a talking pet to help drive visitors to the site. You can pick a virtual pet or upload a picture of your own pet, then dress them up, choose backgrounds, tell them what to say and send them to your friends. We also created the world's first talking newshound which sat on AOL's pages and read the headlines in real time.\" \u2022 What's your background? \"I've come from a mixed media background, starting off in magazines and progressing to being a digital producer at the BBC and the charity Sense, before joining The Blue Cross earlier this year.\" \u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months? \"The site has over 7,000 members and we'd like to see this number grow to 20,000 in the next 12 months.\" \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? \"Encouraging members to interact socially and make full use of the functions on the site.\" \u2022 Name your closest competitors \"In the UK: Petstreet.co.uk, Petsgetslim.co.uk, Dogsblog.com.\" \u2022 Are we in the middle of a new dot com bubble? \"Lessons have been learned and the very nature of the internet and the way information is spread means it's unlikely the early unrealistic hype will be repeated. Then again I could be wrong...\" \u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch? \"Generic sites like Facebook try to be all things to all people but niche social networks are becoming more and more popular, with every function tailored to a particular audience.\" \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? \"We want All About Pets to be the place for pet lovers to talk and learn about pets. We'd like to grow the community and develop more functions to keep the site relevant and useful for our members, such as video hosting and podcasting, live veterinary advice and more.\" allaboutpets.org.uk What do you think of the site? \u2022 Is the Blue Cross right to try and establish the site as a niche social networking site? \u2022 Would it do better to work with existing sites for pet owners and existing social media tools? \u2022 What more could the site do to promote the charity virally?"
