  "content": "The Daily Mail has seized on the suggestion made by RMT union boss Bob Crow that emails should each be taxed a penny as a way of supporting the flagging Royal Mail. Richard Littlejohn dismisses the idea as one that would damage businesses already suffering from the downturn \u2013 but suggests taxing tweets instead. \"The money raised from Sarah Brown and Stephen Fry alone would pay off the national debt in under a fortnight.\" More curious still, Crow made the suggestion while being interviewed on 10 O'Clock Live by David Mitchell, so we're treated to the image of Littlejohn fuming and expleting his way through a full hour of youthfully irreverent TV somewhat at odds with Littlejohn's particular brand of politics.",
