  "content": "Baroness Buscombe, the Press Complaints Commission chairman, believes the recent circulation on Twitter of the names of celebrities alleged to have obtained gagging injunctions proves that a privacy law \"could not work\". Buscombe, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said it was \"fanciful\" to expect that privacy legislation could be effective \"in a world where technology is always ahead of the law\". Responding to Today presenter John Humphrys' question about the impact of the Twitter revelations, Buscombe said: \"You have hit the nail on the head as to why a statute, a privacy law, in my view could not work. \"It is fanciful to expect that something, a statute, could actually work in a world where technology is always ahead of the law and markets. So, whatever is put in place, the law could not keep up with it.\" However, Max Mosley, also interviewed on Today before he lost his European court legal bid to force newspapers to warn people before publishing stories exposing their private lives, dismissed the idea that the Twitter revelations mark the death of injunctions preventing the publication of stories. Mosley made a distinction between \"serious\" publications such as national newspapers, which could be served with gagging injunctions, and Twitter, which he said was only \"one step up\" from pub gossip. \"It's a very small number of people, completely different from a serious publication, a major national newspaper,\" he added. \"If Jemima Khan had not publicised it, it would have been seen by a very small number of people and most people would not have known it was going on.\" On Sunday Khan was erroneously named in a Twitter posting as having sought an injunction to prevent intimate photos being published. Mosley attributed the coverage the Twitter posting about gagging orders had received to \"hysteria in the press\", which was seeking an end to superinjunctions. Buscombe also argued that Mosley's plan for pre-notification of individuals that were the subject of expos\u00e9s \u2013 a concept the European court of human rights roundly rejected \u2013 would be impossible to implement and a threat to democracy and freedom of expression. \"Actually it is something I think would be quite difficult to enforce. To have a blanket rule of pre-notification really concerns me in terms of the crucial importance for journalists to go out there and investigate wrongdoing,\" he said. \"If an injunction is going to kick in every time, because someone doesn't want their whatever they have been up to \u2013 and sometimes serious wrongdoing \u2013 they can stop that going into the press, I think that would be a diminution of our democracy, never mind our freedom of expression.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
