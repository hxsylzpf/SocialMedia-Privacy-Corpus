  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission is to publish new guidelines for the media to protect the privacy of the prime minister's son, Leo Blair. Chairman Lord Wakeham said it was in everyone's interest to set stronger guidelines on stories affecting the children of high-profile public figures. The advice follows a request by Tony Blair, who was upset when unofficial photographs of his son's Christening appeared in the press. Speaking this morning on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Lord Wakeham said: \"Unless the press go absolutely mad, we should be reasonably all right about free expression in the newspapers. We will watch it very carefully.\" Lord Wakeham said existing guidelines were temporary in nature because they worked for a while but then quickly became out of date whenever a new situation arose. He added that he expected that the PCC would need to address a few problems arising from human rights legislation. \"The prime minister has asked me to produce some guidelines as to how the code ought to apply to children, to Leo in particular. We are just trying to put that together and we should be hopefully able to publish it fairly soon. It is not a new problem, but it needs to be redefined every now and again. We are not looking for perfection,\" said Lord Wakeham. \"What we are looking for are practical, working ways forward, so that it is reasonable on both sides. The public gets to know what it should know, newspapers get their stories, but at the same time privacy is not intruded on.\""
