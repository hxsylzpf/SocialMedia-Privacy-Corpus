  "content": "Cometh the glorious weather, cometh another TwiTrip. Our series of live Twitter-fuelled trips is building up a darn good portfolio, from Blackpool to Brighton via Leeds, Nottingham, Birmingham and Bristol. And this time, we're off to Oxford. This Friday, as per TwiTrip tradition, at some time around 1pm, I will be arriving at Oxford train station without a single plan. I will then inevitably pose like a hapless tourist in front of some kind of appropriate signeage, and after that, I'm yours. I've not been to Oxford since I was 16, so consider me a newbie. But I'm faintly aware of some academic associations, ancient pubs that refused to serve me beer at the time, and didn't Bill Clinton spend some time there? Anyway, I'm looking forward to your tips. Ideally, I like them fresh on the day, but if you want to send me any in advance, that's also lovely. I'm at @benjilanyado. See you then.",
