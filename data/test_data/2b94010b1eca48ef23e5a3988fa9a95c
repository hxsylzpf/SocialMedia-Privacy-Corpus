  "content": "The Sun and the News of the World have contributed to a \u00a337,500 payout to film star Sienna Miller for publishing \"intrusive\" photos of her. The settlement is believed to be the highest award for a photographic invasion of privacy. Miller took legal action in October after the papers used photos of her filming a nude scene for a forthcoming movie. News International subsidiary News Group Newspapers, the publisher of the News of The World and the Sun, and the Xposure Photo Agency, which supplied the pictures, are between them paying out \u00a337,500 in compensation, as well as meeting Miller's legal costs. They have also undertaken not to republish any of the photographs in question and have agreed to delete all copies of the images. Miller's solicitor, Mark Thomson of Carter-Ruck, said she was still pursuing a claim against the individual photographer who took the pictures. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857. For all other inquiries please call the main Guardian switchboard on 020 7278 2332. \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
