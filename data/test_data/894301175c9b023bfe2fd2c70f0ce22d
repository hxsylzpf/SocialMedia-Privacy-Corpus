  "content": "Mick Jagger has become the second celebrity in a week to seek an injunction to prevent details of his private life being made public. The Rolling Stone is hoping to stop his former chauffeur, Keith Badgery, disclosing \"any confidential and/or private information\" about him in his forthcoming autobiography, Baby You Can Drive My Car. However, interviews based on the book have already appeared in the News of the World, the Daily Mail and the Sunday Telegraph and the book's publisher, John Blake, said there was \"not really much more to come out\". Mr Blake said the section on Jagger only constituted \"one tiny chapter\" of Badgery's book, which features a number of celebrites, including Michael Jackson. Jagger is also seeking compensation from Badgery on the alleged grounds of breach of confidentiality and privacy. According to the Telegraph's legal editor, Joshua Rosenberg, the application for an injunction against the book was issued on May 31. The ageing rock star is the third celebrity this year to attempt to stop details of their private lifes becoming public. Last week Angus Deayton won a gagging order against the Mail on Sunday, which prevented the paper from publishing revelations that would apparently shock the TV star's closest friends. Earlier this year TV presenter Jamie Theakston tried - and failed - to stop the Sunday People running a story about his night in a \"torture chamber brothel\". Jagger's solicitor, Joyce Smyth, said the singer was not taking legal action against the newspapers concerned. She added that if his action against the chauffeur proved successful, Jagger would donate any damages to charity. Badgery revealed details of Jagger's \"sex secrets\" in interviews with the News of the World's Phil Taylor, the Daily Mail's Rebecca Hardy and the Sunday Telegraph's Helena de Bertodano."
