  "content": "The business social networking site LinkedIn has appointed a European managing director, heralding a new wave of European expansion. LinkedIn said Kevin Eyres, the former general manager of search engine Alta Vista, will head its European service from a new office in London. The company is already recruiting six more staff in sales, marketing and business development. However, technical development will remain based at the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California. LinkedIn has been benefiting from the growth of interest in social networking sites, along with rival services Facebook, Bebo and MySpace, but offers a more niche service for professionals that it hopes will tap into a more lucrative business demographic. Eyres said LinkedIn's strategy would be to target each country in Europe individually, with localised versions of the service under development. It has identified certain sectors, such as media and technology, as high priority because they have the highest number of users. LinkedIn now has 5 million users in Europe. It has big plans for growth in 2008 and will concentrate on the 25% of the population that fits its target demographic. Eyres said the site recruited 150 staff internationally during 2007 and plans to recruit another 150 this year. \"The site started with just 13 staff, and they all contacted everyone they knew,\" Eyres said. \"The whole business has been built virally - we didn't have anyone in a marketing role until 2007,\" he said. The launch of Open Social, a shared developer platform that works across a network of sites including Bebo and LinkedIn, has triggered up to 30 requests a day from developers keen to build tools for the site. \"The priority will be to add features and functions that are relevant for the business community,\" he said. \"People keep asking us if we're going to 'go social' - and the answer is no. It's about what adds long-term value. If we just wanted to make money we'd add photo sharing, but that's not what we're about. And it's not even about driving page views. We want tools that will help make professionals more productive.\" Industry commentators have been predicting that LinkedIn will be bought by a major media firm, with some tipping Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation as a potential buyer. Other reports from Davos, where LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman has been speaking this week, suggest that the company would prefer to float on the stock market than to be bought out. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.
