  "content": "Max Mosley, the former president of Formula One's governing body FIA, is to challenge the law of privacy in the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. Mosley, whose private sexual practices became news in July last year, says the \u00a360,000 damages he received from the News of the World is not an adequate remedy. He wants editors obliged to contact the subject of their revelations before publishing articles that could invade privacy. \"I think it's wrong in a civilised society that a tabloid editor can destroy a family and wreck a life without being answerable to anybody,\" he said. The law allows newspapers to publish stories about public figures that may infringe privacy, if there is a public interest. The NoW published under the headline \"F1 boss has sick Nazi orgy with 5 hookers\". Mosley learned of it the day it was published, and says going through the courts had a \"very bad effect\" on him and his family, because a victim \"has to publicise all over again the very thing they are trying to keep private. If I had been notified, at least I could have challenged it in front of an independent person.\" The changes he wants might undermine the right to freedom of expression."
