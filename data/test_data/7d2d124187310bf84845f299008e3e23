  "content": "Trevor Noah \u2013 the surprise choice to succeed Jon Stewart as high-profile host of satirical news program The Daily Show \u2013 has come under fire for a series of controversial tweets he posted before his appointment. The South African comedian \u2013 son of a Swiss-German father and half-Jewish South African mother \u2013 was criticised for having made tasteless jokes about Jews and women, raising questions among Daily Show fans about whether the comedian is right for the role. Noah played into antisemitic tropes by tweeting that \"behind every successful Rap Billionaire is a double as rich Jewish man\", and also made light of the Holocaust by posting: In 2012 he tweeted about the soccer player Lionel Messi: And he also joked about domestic violence in the same year, posting: Noah responded on Tuesday, tweeting: \"Twitter does not have enough characters to respond to all the characters on Twitter.\" He later deleted the tweet. The offending tweets, first highlighted by BuzzFeed's Tom Gara, are mostly from 2011 and 2012. Gara said on Twitter: \"I retweet not in anger. But it's an impressive rise for a dude who three years ago was replying to Uberfacts tweets with dick jokes.\" Gara also dug up a stream of crude jokes about women. The response to the revelations have been mixed, with some Daily Show viewers upset over at Comedy Central's choice of replacement. Others defended the comedian. Comedy Central did not respond for comment."
