  "content": "Actor James Franco claimed that he invented the Oscars selfie that electrified social networks during the Academy award ceremony earlier this month. During an interview on NBC's Today show, Franco \u2013 who was once named \"the selfie king\" \u2013 said that he had pioneered the idea during his ill-fated gig hosting the awards with Anne Hathaway in 2011. \"I took some videos and selfies at my Oscars and I got criticised for it,\" he said.\" \"Now [Ellen DeGeneres is] getting a lot of attention for hers. I don't get it.\" His theory? \"\"I guess maybe I didn't include Meryl Streep and Bradley Cooper in my Oscar selfies, so maybe that's why it went wrong,\" DeGeneres' celebrated selfie, which was taken by American Hustle star Bradley Cooper and managed to shoehorn in Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts among others broke social media records by being retweeted over a million times in an hour. (It currently stands at 3.4m retweets.) \u2022 Oscars 2014: Ellen DeGeneres' selfie and the best of the rest",
