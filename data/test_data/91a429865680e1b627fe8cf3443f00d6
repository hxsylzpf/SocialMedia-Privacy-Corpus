  "content": "Any company which grows as fast as Facebook is bound to attract interest from venture capitalists, and these people tend to be neoconservatives by definition - so what's new (With friends like these..., G2, January 14)? The reality is nobody on Facebook really pays much attention to the advertising around the edges of the page: their eyes focus elsewhere. We will eventually all get bored of logging on as Facebook pales into yesterday's fad. The real suckers may turn out to be the venture capitalists who have paid over the odds for shares in Facebook and the multinational companies which pay millions of dollars to advertise on its pages. Here's hoping. Anyway, the article inspired me to create a new group on Facebook: \"Companies which advertise on Facebook are wasting their money!\" Let's see if Facebook has the courage not to censor it. Thomas Quinton London Tom Hodgkinson is correct in suggesting that if friends are geographically close then meeting face to face is the way to do it. But the benefit of Facebook is the discovery of people with similar views and interests around the world. It also provides another platform to communicate with distant family and friends. As for advertising, I would highly recommend the AdBlock plug-in for Firefox. When I use Facebook I see very few adverts. Two other aspects work against advertisers. First, many people sign up to Facebook and never or rarely use it. Second, people add accounts for their pets and other fake accounts. I'm fairly sure the guinea pigs owned by my Battleship friend 200 miles away don't drink Coca-Cola, but I'll be sure to ask her. Steven Lilley Halifax, West Yorkshire Surely the best thing to do if you don't want to be bombarded with adverts is pretend to be 95? I bet those youth-seeking advertisers will leave you well alone then. Facebook is very easy to subvert; in fact, it's rather touchingly naive that founders of this truly evil empire assume we all tell them the truth. I don't. Do you? Laura Marcus Leek, Staffordshire I'm thrilled that the first thing my husband did after reading the article was to close his Facebook account. Hurrah. Amanda Banham Saffron Walden, Essex Your front-page headline says \"FBI wants instant access to British identity data\" (Janurary 15). Surely a waste of time and money given the CIA can poke anyone on the Facebook site they bankroll to the tune of $12.5m? Russell Cavanagh Sheffield"
