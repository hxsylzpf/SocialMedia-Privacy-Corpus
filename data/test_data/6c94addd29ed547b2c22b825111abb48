  "content": "Noises off might appear to be a forward-thinking blog, at ease with any development the internet can throw at it. But beneath this urbane exterior is a reactionary conservative howling to get out. And nothing brings out the drooling technophobe in it more than Twitter. Blogs are at their best when they give people a chance to explore things in a detailed and nuanced way, free from the constraints of word limits, commercial imperatives and editorialising. Twitter, however, allows you to say almost nothing in 140 characters. (In this debate, I tend to side with the Onion.) Still, a post by Simon Ogden on the Next Stage blog might persuade me to change my mind. After Twittering \"If you figure out how to fix theatre today, let me know\", he received a whole range of responses. Despite their brevity, some are really rather good. I particularly like brovermania's \"Small, affordable venues, cheap tickets, short plays, beer\" and happierman's \"make it affordable. make it often. make it interactive\". In other news, it is often said that one of theatre's strengths is its capacity to respond quickly to current affairs. Yet it seems that not everyone agrees. The Playgoer has come across a quote from Stephen Sondheim, who declared that a show need not be relevant to front-page news: \"It's relevant if it moves you \u2026 It's worth reviving because it's worth reviving.\" The fetish for \"relevancy\" can be very harmful for the development of our theatre culture. By focusing on the speed of a response to something rather than the complexity or nuance of that response, we risk allowing the debate to become simplistic. Newspapers are the ideal place to discuss in detail the specifics of events as they happen. Surely the role of the theatre should be to explore the complex forces that underlie those events \u2013 and that takes time. One wonders if Sondheim might be interested in a recent discovery that Isaac Butler has made: the Musical Theatre Dictionary. It gathers together all of the lingo that you might hear backstage at a musical. It makes for an interesting read \u2013 especially if you don't know your \"Audra\" from your \"Annie\" or your \"sitzprobe\" from your \"split centre\". On the subject of musicals, here's something interesting for deaf audiences. Ken Davenport at the Producer's Perspective has discovered Michael DiMartino, who specialises in signing (not singing) along to all your favourite showtunes. Here is his fittingly camp version of Rhythm in Me, from Davenport's show Altar Boyz. Finally, it looks like silly season has finally descended on the blogosphere. Whether they're discussing Spike Milligan or Pakistani Daleks, electric sheep or singing box-office staff, it seems that the heat has begun to frazzle bloggers' brains. In this spirit, I leave you with what must surely be one of the best sites on the web for theatre-related comedy: the story of the miserable Swedish playwright August Strindberg and his small, round, pink friend Helium. Enjoy.",
