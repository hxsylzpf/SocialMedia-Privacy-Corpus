  "content": "The head of the internet search engine Google has vowed to protect the privacy of web surfers against the US government. As Americans delivered a sweeping midterm election defeat for the Republican administration, Eric Schmidt strongly criticised the White House's attitude towards privacy at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, where the world's most powerful internet players are meeting this week to discuss the future of the medium. Earlier this year, Google overturned a government subpoena that attempted to force dozens of internet companies to make available huge banks of data on web users' habits. The government claimed it wanted access to records of internet searches and online activity to help identify suspected terrorists and observe dangerous patterns of behaviour. A federal judge ruled that the move was illegal, and Mr Schmidt said surfers were right to take their anger out on officials. \"This was a complete violation of our users' rights,\" Mr Schmidt told the summit. \"We, as a society, came to a rational outcome, and if we don't like it we can replace the people who pass those laws.\" Elsewhere at the conference, it emerged that Google - widely seen as the most powerful force in the internet business - could face competition from an unlikely source. Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, said he was expanding the company's portfolio of services to include selling online storage and computing power. Google is rumoured to be working on a virtual storage product, GDrive, which would allow individuals and businesses to store all their files on the internet. But Amazon, which helped revolutionise e-commerce in the 1990s, is moving quickly into technical support areas, bringing it into competition with some of Silicon Valley's biggest names. The new services from Amazon enable small businesses and internet companies of all sizes to buy computing power and storage on a pay-as-you-go basis over the internet, rather than investing heavily in hardware. Many analysts fear Amazon's plans would divert its focus away from the core business but Mr Bezos said the move to sell computing power made perfect sense. \"This is actually what we've been doing for 11 years at Amazon,\" he said. \"We're doing it because we're good at it, and it will be a financially appealing business.\" Mr Bezos said Amazon had huge amounts of computing power but it was hurt by unprofitable downtime. By selling spare capacity to customers, he said the business had found a way to reduce overheads and provide a useful service. \"The biggest cost for these services is not power or the cost of servers, it's the lack of utilisation,\" he said. \"Building this massive infrastructure but only using it 17% of the time is like buying a Boeing 747 and leaving it sitting on the runway.\" The revelations over the government's demands for internet data emerged as the White House was already under fire for allowing the National Security Agency to tap telephone lines of suspected terrorists without warrants. The administration's privacy-invading tactics caused a furore, particularly when it emerged that many online companies, including Microsoft and AOL, had been prepared to capitulate.",
