  "content": "A leading media lawyer has written to the Press Complaints Commission urging it to take action over the publication of photographs of Prince William's girlfriend out shopping. Peter Crawford, who represented Amanda Holden in her privacy battle with the Daily Star, believes photographs of Kate Middleton published in the London Evening Standard last week may breach the PCC's codes on privacy. Although he does not represent Ms Middleton, Mr Crawford is asking the press watchdog to \"take pro-active steps\" to investigate whether the publication of the photographs broke its rules. The PCC normally only acts when it receives a complaint from the subject of an article or picture, and is not thought to have received a complaint from the woman. But it can intervene of its own accord if it believes the code has been breached. \"I do not know whether Miss Middleton has complained to the commission about the publication of the pictures or whether others may have done so on her behalf but I do feel she has strong grounds for bringing a complaint,\" Mr Crawford wrote in his letter to the PCC chairman, Sir Christopher Meyer. The PCC code states that \"it is unacceptable to photograph individuals in private places without their consent\" and defines private places as \"public or private property where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy\". The photographs, first published in the Standard and later in the Sun and the Daily Mail, showed Ms Middleton on a No 19 bus and in a shop. Mr Crawford said he had written to the Evening Standard editor, Veronica Wadley, to protest but had been told his letter would not be published for \"policy\" reasons. The Standard declined to comment to MediaGuardian.co.uk. In 2001 Mr Crawford helped Holden and her then husband Les Dennis win a record \u00a340,000 settlement from the Daily Star over photographs of the couple at a private villa in Tuscany. The couple sued the paper under the Human Rights Act after the pictures appeared on the front page of the Star. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
