  "content": "Carlton Cole has admitted a Football Association disciplinary charge relating to comments he made on Twitter during the England verses Ghana friendly on 29 March. In comments that were later removed from the social networking site, the West Ham United striker said: \"Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap! Hahahaha. The only way to get out safely is to wear an England jersey and paint your face w/the St. George's flag!\" Cole later said the comments were a joke. He has admitted the improper conduct charge and requested a personal hearing, to be heard no later than 21 April. Cole is likely to face a fine, although there is no precedent for allegedly racist comments expressed via Twitter. The then Liverpool striker Ryan Babel was fined \u00a310,000 in January after re-tweeting an image of the referee Howard Webb in a Manchester United shirt."
