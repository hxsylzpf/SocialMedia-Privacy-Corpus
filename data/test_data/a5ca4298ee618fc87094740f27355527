  "content": "John Yates, the Met police assistant commissioner, appears to have tried to drop a well-measured portion of mud into the waters of the phone-hacking story. In all his comments about the scale of the problem, Yates referred only to the activities of Clive Goodman, the News of the World's royal reporter, who was sent to prison in January 2007 for hacking phones. Goodman, he told us, had worked with the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire on \"hundreds of potential targets\", only some of whom had then been successfully hacked. As a reflection of the involvement of one single man in the dark art of phone-tapping, that is a spectacular scale of activity. But as an answer to the Guardian's story, it looks very much like an attempt to avoid giving any answer at all. The Guardian's story is not about Clive Goodman. It is about the activities of News of the World journalists generally. Nobody is suggesting that Goodman alone hacked into thousands of phones. It was one of Yates's own very senior colleagues, speaking directly to the Guardian, who told us that the News of the World as a paper had been involved in hacking \"thousands\" of phones. That estimate was supported by a second, separate source who had had access to the Scotland Yard inquiry and who told us it involved \"two or three thousand'' phones. Twenty-fours hours after we published the comments from those two sources, the News of the World had made no challenge at all to those figures. Neither of these sources was talking about what Clive Goodman alone got up to. And it is, to put it mildly, disappointing that Yates should choose to do so. Goodman was the royal reporter: he had no reason to be investigating the lives of politicians, sports personalities, actors and TV presenters. For example, in the case which we know most about, that of Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers Association, we know for certain that his phone was hacked by Glenn Mulcaire and we know for certain that several News of the World journalists were involved. We know their names - and none of them was Clive Goodman. We also know that Scotland Yard know all this. The muddying of water goes a little further. The Guardian reported that Scotland Yard had failed to alert all those whose phones were targeted. Yates (albeit still talking only about Goodman's activities) said that in most of the cases which they had looked at, there was insufficient evidence to be sure that hacking had occurred. And, so in those cases, they did not alert the targets. John Prescott, Tessa Jowell and Boris Johnson fall exactly into that grey area. There is no doubt at all that Glenn Mulcaire, acting for the News of the World, targeted Prescott (for example, in May 2006) and Jowell (for example, in March 2006) and Johnson (for example, in April 2006). And there is no doubt that Mulcaire was in the business of hacking phones. Whether or not Mulcaire succeeded in hacking into their phone messages is something which Scotland Yard cannot be sure about \u2013 because they never went to him to start an investigation. There is a great deal of the picture that remains hard to see: about the hacking of phones and the material which was gathered by Scotland Yard; about the \"blagging\" of confidential data, such as bank statements and tax records, and the material which was gathered by the information commissioner. Mud in the water does not help us to see it."
