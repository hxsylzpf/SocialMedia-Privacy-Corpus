  "content": "Less than a week after the US Library of Congress established the \"jailbreaking\" of Apple iPhones as \"fair use\", a plucky hacker yesterday launched a browser-based service to do just that. JailbreakMe 2.0 will \"jailbreak\" \u2013 unlock from restrictions imposed by the manufacturer \u2013 the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad when visited from the device. Last week the Copyright Office at the Library of Congress ruled in favour of the Electronic Frontier Foundation in deeming that the jailbreaking of mobile devices is not illegal, an argument that Apple contested. During the hearing, a spokesperson for the EFF estimated that \"more than a million\" iPhone owners have already unlocked their devices \"in order to change wireless providers\". Now customers climbing the walls of Apple's well-documented \"walled garden\" approach to devices could easily become unburdened, with the number of jailbroken devices likely to significantly increase. Before browser-based unlocking \u2013 JailbreakMe is thought to be the first website to offer such a service \u2013 users had to download an application to their computer desktop and go from there. Early problems are being reported by those using the service. At the time of writing, both MMS and Facetime (the latter iPhone 4 only) are said to be disabled. Apple has always insisted restrictions placed on its devices \u2013 such as those that disallow certain applications entry to the App Store \u2013 are necessary to protect the consumer, warning that jailbreaking voids a device's warranty. A statement released by the company after last week's case read: \"Apple's goal has always been to ensure that our customers have a great experience with their iPhone and we know that jailbreaking can severely degrade the experience. As we've said before, the vast majority of customers do not jailbreak their iPhones as this can violate the warranty and can cause the iPhone to become unstable and not work reliably.\" Unlocked Apple devices can be returned to out-of-the-box state by clicking \"Restore\" when connected to iTunes. The legality of jailbreaking in the UK is less clear than that in the US because of the lack of legal precedent set inside the EU. Andres Guadamuz, an IT law lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, told Wired UK: \"Although you might be breaking Apple's terms and conditions and voiding your warranty, I just can't see how a judge would rule against it.\" So why, after paying a small fortune for one of Apple's devices, would you void your warranty and jailbreak? Well, partly because in most cases the handset can be easily and quickly returned to its non-jailbroken state, and partly because doing so can fundamentally transform your using of it. Of course, when you have taken the plunge your device is significantly less insulated from malicious \"worms\" previously weeded out by Apple. It's your call \u2013 but what do the readers think? Commenter Jaxxstorm warns against this particular jailbreak, saying: \"this site is a target for mailicous hackers. If anyone has a DNS vulnerability which they've held back they could redirect the jailbreakme site to a different webserver and deliver a malicious payload. All hell could break loose.\" Smashy79 says they're happy with their non-jailbroken iPhone 4, adding: \"I tried it with my old 3G, but so many of the apps were so unstable, that it took something away from the experience, as I'd install an app and just use it with baited breath, waiting for it to crash.\" Tehwalrus sees the point in jailbreaking for app developers, but isn't convinced it's necessary for \"ordinary users,\" \"apart from being able to install buggy apps.\" Petehindle reflects on his experiences of jailbreaking the iPhone 3G: \"No wonder these applications [post-jailbreaking] can't be got via Apple, as they are either useless or worthless [...] \"There do seem to be three useful applications, only two of which are legal: a tethering app (to use the 3G connection when out and about - of which I think O2 might have something to say), a wireless syncing app, and a bluetooth keyboard app. None of these applications are free, and seeing as they aren't mission critical for me I don't think I'll chance paying for dodgy software. \"Am I glad I jailbroke my phone? Not really, it was pointless [...] Maybe Jailbreak will grow up and be something useful in the future, but right now it's just for nerds.\" Are you planning to jailbreak using JailbreakMe?
