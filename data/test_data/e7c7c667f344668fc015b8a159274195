  "content": "It was 11.05pm and the queue outside the exclusive Embassy nightclub in Mayfair, London, was getting restless. A young man nervously adjusted his tie as a blond woman scanned the list of names on her clipboard. Two young women flounced away after being refused entry. But one phrase could guarantee immediate passage past the velvet cordon: \"I'm ASW.\" ASW, or A Small World to the uninitiated, is an invitation-only social networking site for the international jetset - think Facebook for Forbes list - that lets only the most elite, connected, and moneyed into its ranks. Sipping on a mojito and looking through the window at the line of hopefuls standing miserably outside, Nicola Cavallo, an investment banker from Milan, explained the attraction. \"Everyone gets access to Facebook, but only a small number are invited to join ASW,\" he said. \"ASW is the best place to find the best people and the best parties.\" Julia Hausman, an investment analyst from German, explained that she recently skipped the waiting list for a \u00a34,000 Hermes Birkin bag thanks to her ASW membership. \"I still use Facebook, but to be honest ASW is just a little more exclusive,\" she said. In a world where more than 90 million people are on Facebook, ASW is part of a new wave of niche social networking sites springing up in cyberspace, said Mike Butcher, editor of technology website TechCrunch UK. \"We're a few years into the social networking phenomenon now and what we are increasingly seeing are sites that attract a niche audience by meeting particular needs,\" he said. \"There is definitely a trend towards luxury and exclusivity that hasn't been seen before.\" And although the audiences of sites such as ASW may be small, they are desirable. \"In normal circumstances advertisers are mainly interested in numbers, which is why Facebook is so attractive, but ASW provides access to highly influential people in an elite hothouse and that is worth a fortune,\" Butcher said. \"It's also a very powerful platform for building a brand.\" Founded four years ago, by Erik Wachtmeister, a former investment banker, ASW aims to provide a hidden corner of the internet where members - often affluent, educated and with multiple residences - can swap tips on everything from investing in Cambodia to partying in Uruguay without worrying about anything as crass as being poked, high-fived or spammed. Members have their own profile page. Free to join, its users are young, the average age is 32, with somewhere between 65% and 70% coming from Europe. Users who step out of line, by either contacting members they don't already know, aggressive marketing or celebrity-stalking (Tiger Woods and Naomi Campbell are among the glitterati) are banished. One of the site's main features is an active forum, and a quick browse around the threads leaves the visitor in little doubt that ASW is not only a small but also a different world. \"Buyer is looking to buy gold bars [bullion] by the metric ton. Must be 999.5 of fineness or better,\" reads one. Among the Bentleys and small hotels for sale in the high-end classifieds, a shopper looks for a \"150+ft yacht for the week of the SuperBowl in Tampa, FL\". On signing up to ASW, members are reminded of the site's maxim: \"We live in a small world, and we want to keep it that way.\" But since its inception the site has grown from 500 to about 325,000 users in more than 200 countries, and in recent months there has been growing dissent. A recent thread entitled \"Death of ASW\" sparked 8,600 responses. One consultant from Milan complained: \"Definitely ASW was a better place when I joined in September 2004 ... now you can find personal assistants/secretaries ... is this supposed to be an exclusive site???\" But Wachtmeister is confident the site can grow comfortably to a million users. In a recent interview he said: \"Our goal is to grow very, very carefully ... If we employ the right methodology, we can grow to a million people and still be as exclusive as we are today. The world is a big place.\" Back at the Embassy bar, Stor Skekare, a sharply dressed Swede, was unconvinced. \"I've had about four invitations but I turned them down,\" he says. \"Exclusive? As soon as people know about it - it's dead.\" To push the point home he asked: \"Did you manage to get into the site?\" Yes, we admitted. \"Exactly,\" he said. And turned away."
