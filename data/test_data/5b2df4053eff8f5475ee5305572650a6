  "content": "Isaac Newton's third law of physics notes that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. While the law is primarily about physics, 2015 shows it can be applied to social cohesion as well. The year started under the shadow of the Lindt cafe siege, which had shaken Sydney and the country just weeks before. The ensuing conversation about radicalisation and terrorism gave way to increased incidents of Islamophobic attacks and discrimination against Muslims, as proponents of tightening Australia's immigration system used the siege to air their grievances or criticise members of one religion for a perceived failure to integrate. But while some sections of society used the siege as an example of how multiculturalism had failed (the gunman Man Haron Monis was a refugee, after all), others took the opportunity to express solidarity with Australian Muslims. After seeing a veiled woman remove her headscarf on a train, Brisbane woman Rachel Jacobs unwittingly started a movement. She approached the woman and offered to walk her to her destination. The resulting #illridewithyou hashtag trended worldwide on Twitter. The Labor spokeswoman on multicultural affairs, Michelle Rowland, says technology has been used to vilify and divide, as well as challenge intolerant attitudes. \"It works both ways,\" she tells Guardian Australia. Rather than social media, the biggest driver of the national conversation about the role of Islam in stopping terrorism and radicalisation is what politicians say. Muslims were outraged when Tony Abbott said in February that he wished more Islamic leaders referred to Islam as a religious of peace, and meant it. Many saw the then prime minister's \"Team Australia\" approach to social cohesion as deeply divisive and welcomed the change in tone brought about by Abbott's successor, Malcolm Turnbull, who stressed mutual respect as the key element in debates on terrorism. Turnbull's ascension did little to stop conservative members of the Coalition from voicing concern about Islam's role in modern Australian society. Some pointed the finger of blame for terrorism squarely at the country's Muslim population. By the year's end, Abbott \u2013 now a backbencher unencumbered by cabinet solidarity \u2013 had reignited the debate, stating that \"all cultures are not equal\" and Islam needed to reform in the same way that Christianity had. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation chief, Duncan Lewis, asked a couple of MPs to tone down the rhetoric, fearing the immoderate language used by some politicians would have a detrimental impact on national security. The minister in charge of the multiculturalism portfolio, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, is scathing of the direction the debate has taken. \"A simplistic approach which just says, you know, a reform of Islam [is needed] does not recognise the complexity of the issue here,\" she tells Guardian Australia. \"The continued megaphone commentary does not assist the complexity of the issues we are now facing.\" The racial discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says 2015 has represented a test of leadership for politicians. \"It is not helpful for elected representatives to make public statements that feed fear and hatred,\" he tells Guardian Australia. He dismisses Abbott's comments on Islam, saying: \"I don't agree with them and I don't think they represent the views of mainstream Australia\". The past year has also witnessed the rise of ultra rightwing movements such as Reclaim Australia and the Australian Liberty Alliance (ALA), the local offshoot of a party inspired by the Dutch far-right MP Geert Wilders. Wilders took aim at Australian multiculturalism when he arrived in the country for the ALA's launch, warning that the country should abandon the policy or risk ending up like the European Union. The perceived failure of multiculturalism was a key theme at far-right protests throughout 2015. At Reclaim Australia rallies, protesters decried the death of the \"Australian way of life\" blaming \"Islamification\". Similar concerns were raised during demonstrations against the proposed building of a mosque in Bendigo, Victoria. Community leaders had feared violent protests during the 10th anniversary of the 2005 Cronulla riots, but the commemoration ended with a barbecue that was attended by just 50 people, after a police injunction stopped the protest from going ahead. \"People think they have licence to speak publicly on bigotry,\" Soutphommasane says. \"Our challenge [in 2016] is to rein things back in.\" With 50% of Australians either born overseas, or having one or both parents born overseas, modern Australia looks very different from the one supporters of parties such as Reclaim Australia, the Party for Freedom and the United Patriots Front are trying to protect. \"Social cohesion is the sum of millions of successful settlement journeys,\" Fierravanti-Wells says. \"We have welcomed 7.5 million migrants since World War II, including 825,000 under our humanitarian program. We do it well. \"In Australia, we have one of the highest incidents of uptake of citizenship. About 80% of eligible people in Australia take up citizenship. \"Multicultural Australia is now mainstream Australia.\" But mainstream Australia was forced to examine its own prejudices during the year, after the AFL legend and former Australian of the year Adam Goodes was subjected to constant booing and criticism on and off the field. Some public figures argued that the booing on the field was not racist, although social media comments after Goodes was named a brand ambassador for department store David Jones proved that a small but vocal element of racism existed. By and large, those comments were shouted down by other social media users, but the damage had already already done. Confronting the country's prejudices towards Indigenous Australians will loom large again in 2016, as it prepares for a debate on constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people. A referendum to change the constitution is slated for 2017, and while the question has not yet been settled, there is a big push from Indigenous groups to include new racial non-discrimination clauses in the nation's founding document. Australia's first federal minister of Indigenous heritage, Ken Wyatt, watered down the hopes in September, saying \"Australia is not ready for that\". The executive director of the Australian Multicultural Foundation, Hass Dellal, says the public displays of racism and prejudice witnessed in 2015 do not reflect mainstream Australia. \"Agendas tend to be governed by the minorities who don't support multiculturalism,\" Dellal says. \"Cultural diversity or multiculturalism is not a philosophy; it's a way of life.\" It is a way of life that most Australians accept and welcome. While racism and hatred sometimes bubble to the surface, most Australians are tolerant and embrace diversity. A survey by the Scanlon Foundation, published in October, found that 86% of Australians thought multiculturalism was good for the country. An increasing number \u2013 41% in 2015 compared with 32% in 2007 \u2013 believed government money should be given to ethnic groups for programs that maintained their cultural and religious identity. Dellal says there is too much focus on what divides cultures and religions, rather than the things people have in common. \"Why aren't we focusing on those elements?\" he asks. \"What makes us unique is focusing on what binds us, what unites us.\" He says we have \"lost sight\" of what makes Australia a successful multicultural society. Fierravanti-Wells disagrees, saying Australia's success lies in its specialised and well-established settlement programs. \"It's often been the story of our migration that what you don't know, you fear, and what you fear, you blame for all sorts of things,\" she says. \"In the end, social cohesion is the glue that binds us together, and many ways I believe that we have faced the challenges in Australia that have been wrought by [extremist group Isis, also known as] Daesh much much better than other countries. We have a well-established framework of migration which respects a set of common values.\" Despite the rise in Islamophobia, Australians showed they had considerable sympathy for the thousands of asylum seekers fleeing the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. An outpouring of grief over photos of dead toddler Aylan Kurdi created momentum for the country to do more to help. Abbott's decision to allow a one-off intake of 12,000 Syrian and Iraqi refugees over and above the existing humanitarian intake was, in many ways, initiated by the public. \"It was almost a case of politicians catching up with community sentiment on that one,\" Rowland says. The $900m bill to resettle the 12,000 refugees, revealed in December's budget update, caused few ripples, even in a tough economic environment in which other areas of government spending have been slashed. Soutphommasane warns against taking an overly positive \"Pollyanna\" view of social cohesion. \"It would be foolish to be too optimistic or too defeatist,\" he says, adding that predictions of multiculturalism's \"terminal decline\" are baseless. \"There's no doubt that there are challenges at the moment, but the strength of our multiculturalism shouldn't be undermined,\" Soutphommasane says. \"We are dealing with profound challenges, but from a position of strength.\" Fierravanti-Wells agrees, noting that Australian society has faced bumps in the road before, but has always been able to draw on its reserves to get through. Rowland has faith in the people, and in the country's laws on inclusion and diversity, which have not changed despite the often heavy-handed rhetoric espoused by individual politicians. \"Our legislative structure has remained fairly consistent,\" she says. Dellal has been heartened by the pushback from mainstream society when racism is publicly exposed. \"For every negative reaction, there was a positive reaction from the whole of community,\" he says. But he thinks debate on multiculturalism and what it means to be Australian should not be gagged. \"Let's talk about the challenges and what's uncomfortable to talk about. We are ready for that.\""
