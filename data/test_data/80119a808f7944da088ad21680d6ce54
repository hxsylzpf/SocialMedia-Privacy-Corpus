  "content": "The News of the World has been criticised by the press complaints commission for harassing a lesbian weather presenter after it was revealed she was planning to bring up a baby with her female partner. Judith Tonner, who works for BBC Scotland, complained to the press watchdog about an article in the Scottish edition of the newspaper last July headlined: \"Gay BBC weather girl is having DIY baby\". Tonner complained the article was \"intrusive in its intimate coverage of her pregnancy\" and \"pejorative in its reference to her sexuality\". She told the PCC the attention had been particularly upsetting because she had suffered a miscarriage the previous year and had told the newspaper of her ordeal. She also claimed the newspaper harassed her by persistently seeking her comments after a reporter, who turned up at her home, had been asked to leave her alone. Defending the article, the News of the World said Tonner's pregnancy was well known, physically obvious and could not be considered a private matter. It added the manner of conception had been a subject of considerable public interest and insisted its article was not prurient or pejorative about Tonner's sexuality. The newspaper pointed out Tonner had subsequently been happy to pose with other mothers for a photograph for a national newspaper and denied she had asked its reporter to leave the matter alone. The PCC found the News of the World guilty of harassing Tonner by approaching her for comment after she had asked to be left alone and agreed the newspaper article breached her privacy. Although it conceded stories about same-sex parenting have a public interest element, the watchdog said this had to be balanced with an individual's right to privacy. It said: \"In this case, the commission considered that while the reporting of the fact of the pregnancy was not intrusive, some of the references - such as to the detailed description of the method of conception and the fact the complainant had previously had a miscarriage (a matter regarding an individual's health) when it should have been obvious she had revealed the fact of the miscarriage to the newspaper on a confidential basis - were.\" However, the PCC rejected complaints that the News of the World had intruded into Tonner's grief and discriminated against her. It pointed out Tonner's miscarriage, although tragic, had occurred in the previous year and ruled its code on intrusion into grief had not been breached. The regulator said the newspaper had referred to Tonner's sexuality in a factual way that was justified by the nature of the story."
