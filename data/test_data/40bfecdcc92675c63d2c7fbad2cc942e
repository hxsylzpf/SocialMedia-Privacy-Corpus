  "content": "The News of the World was right to publish the expos\u00e9 of formula one boss Max Mosley's sex parties and would have been justified even if there had not been any alleged Nazi overtones, the newspaper's editor told the high court today. Mosley is suing the News of the World for breach of privacy over the publication of articles, photographs and video footage showing his participation in two sadomasochistic sex parties in a flat in Chelsea on March 8 and 28. Colin Myler, the News of the World editor, said: \"There was more than enough to have a reasonable expectation that this was a Nazi or concentration camp scenario played out over five hours with five girls with Mr Mosley.\" Myler told Mr Justice Eady in the high court today that he believed it was a legitimate story to publish, given Mosley's professional position and the fact the he was the son of British Fascist leader Oswald Mosley. \"Given Mr Mosley was an elected member and head of formula one industry and sports and the fact he spent five hours with five girls in a brutal orgy [is] rather significant given who he is both in terms of his professional position and his antecedents within his family,\" he added. \"This was absolutely a troubling situation and one I believe had legitimate public interest and one I believe was legitimate to publish.\" Under cross-examination, Myler acknowledged Mosley had not courted publicity for his private life. But he said it was not possible for a man in his position to shy away from publicity altogether, adding that you \"can't be head of formula one and hide under a bushel\". Myler told the court the News of the World would consider it justifiable to film Mosley having an S&amp;M sex orgy with five prostitutes even if there had not been the alleged Nazi dimension. He accepted that it was an invasion of privacy to secretly film someone having sex, adding that it had happened to him personally and he had not liked it, but said it was justified in a matter of great public interest. Earlier, the court heard evidence from four of the five women present at the two sex parties, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Woman B, who is German, vehemently denied the S&amp;M scenes in which she and Mosley paid prison guards had any Nazi overtones. \"I'm very upset and offended and it is an insult and an offence if a newspaper equates German with Nazi,\" she told the court. \"My grandparents were not members of the [Nazi] party. It makes me so cross and angry. No person on the planet can make me do something like that and our friend never suggested that.\" Woman B said she did not pick up on Woman A saying the word \"Aryan\" during the scene shown in the News of the World video. Initially she suggested this did not have a Nazi connotation and could be taken to refer merely to a \"blonde and blue-eyed woman or person\". But under cross-examination Woman B acknowledged it had a specific meaning and she had never heard it used in any other context. Woman B said that \"schwarzer\" referred to black hair colour and did not have a racial meaning either in the context of the video, or in Bavaria where she was from. She added that her German Luftwaffe jacket and cap was purchased from Camden market in London to wear at a concert. Woman C, who played a witness in the first scene in the video, where Mosley was a submissive character; and a prisoner in the second scene where he was dominant, said she had never heard the word \"Aryan\" and did not know what it meant until today. \"I have no interest in history. I've heard of World War 2 but I couldn't tell you anything about it. I've heard of Nazi but the only thing I associate with it is the swastika,\" she said. The case continues. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
