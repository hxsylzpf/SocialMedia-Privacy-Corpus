(Search on #lizjones if you missed the brouhaha \u2013 and if you must, read the offending article on the Daily Mail site here. It really is extraordinary.) Pakistan players Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were jailed for their part in the spot-fixing which occurred in the Test match between England and Pakistan at Lord's last year. Butt's agent Mazhar Majeed was also jailed. Below is a taste of the reaction on Twitter. [Please note: the rest of this column is put together using Storify, which is not viewable on m.guardian.co.uk. It can also take a while to load on guardian.co.uk.
