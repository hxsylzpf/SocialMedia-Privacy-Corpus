  "content": "The Daily Mail has hit back furiously at TV presenter Anna Ford following the rejection of her complaint about the paper's use of photographs of her in a bikini. In a pungent leader today, the paper waited just one sentence before putting the boot in to denounce Ford's journalistic abilities. \"The Mail has high regard for Anna Ford. Although not a proper journalist, with her good looks and elegance she has - as a reader of TV news - given enormous pleasure to millions over the years,\" it said. Ford is likely to take great umbrage at the suggestion she is not a \"proper\" journalist - she has worked in TV news since 1977 when she joined News at Ten. The paper has taken a particular pleasure in the high court's decision earlier this week not to allow a judicial review of press watchdogs' decision to reject Ford's complaint about a paparazzi shot of her sunbathing on a beach in Majorca. The newspaper published the shots originally, prompting her complaint to the press complaints commission on the grounds that the pictures invaded her privacy. The paper pointed out today that it published the pictures because Ford had courted publicity over the years through countless interviews and posing for innumerable pictures. It said it published the pictures, which were \"flattering\", because of her celebrity status. And it is furious that Ford lashed out at the PCC after it ruled out her complaint, branding it a \"weak pussycat\" of a regulator. The Mail admits newspapers still have \"much to do to improve its image\" but says critics of the press \"do their case scant justice by denying the PCC has made great strides in improving standards in the press over the past few years\". In a final flourish, the Mail turned its guns once more on Ford. \"If Ms Ford wants a real example of a weak pussycat; she should consider the pathetic record of regulation in her own industry. \"Toothless, supine broadcasting regulators, such as the Independent Television Commission, have presided over a sickening decline in standards -as demonstrated by the Brass Eye debacle. \"The luscious lipped Ms Ford is the kind of liberal whose defining characteristic is: 'Don't do what we do - do what we say.' \"If, however, she's looking for something really worthwhile to campaign against, she could do worse than try to clean up the cesspit in her own industry's backyard.\" Related stories 31.07.2001: Commission 'ineffective' say media lawyers 31.07.2001: Ford attacks 'pussycat' PCC 31.07.2001: Newsreader loses PCC case 31.07.2001: PCC rejects 'pussycat' jibe MediaGuardian.co.uk special report Press and privacy"
