  "content": "ON HIS COMEDY PARTNER HUGH LAURIE IN \"HOUSE\" One of the hardest things to do is act smart. But you actually believe that he is intelligent (2006) ASKED BY HIS SCHOOL CAREERS OFFICER WHAT JOB HE ENVISAGED FOR HIMSELF School Careers Officer (1973) ON TECHNOLOGY I have never had fewer than 10 working Macs on the go since the late 80s (2007) TO AN INTERVIEWER ON TV-AM Not wishing \u2013 in any way \u2013 to correct you, but it is pronounced Worcester, not Wooster\u2026 in the same way that it's Woodhouse not Wodehouse (1992) ON LIVING IN SWAFFHAM IN NORFOLK You see it all. You see your hoody pikey chavvies, you see your happy-slapping. But it's leavened by a bit of fluffy Englishness and damp tweed. It's just what it should be (2007) ON CONVERSATION AT CRICKET MATCHES You don't get people going round saying: \"Did it work for you?\" and \"It seems to me there's a sense in which\u2026\", like those awful scum on late-night BBC2 shows (1999) ON TECHNICAL PROBLEMS My life is a shattered bowl of arse (2009) HOSTING A CHARITY EVENT As the Archbishop of Canterbury likes to say: \"That's enough tedious wank. Let's party!\" (1991) ON PHYSICAL CONGRESS Sex does not enrich or deepen a relationship \u2013 it permanently cheapens and destabilises it (1985) 15 YEARS BEFORE \"STEPHEN FRY ON AMERICA\" I get terribly depressed with the English obsession with America. These wasted little people with their baseball hats, who usually live in Newport Pagnell, who say: \"Did you watch the Bears game yesterday?\" Oh go away, go and live there, for God's sake (1992) ON HIS DEMEANOUR I have a smug air that I've done everything short of cutting my face open to try and get rid of (2009) ON WEIGHT GAIN I am currently developing myself for digital widescreen (1999) AFTER BEING TOLD, BY ONE OF ALMOST ONE MILLION FOLLOWERS, THAT HIS TWEETS WERE \"A BIT BORING\" You've convinced me. I'm obviously not good enough. I retire from Twitter. Bye everyone (2009) HOSTING \"QI\" Welcome to QI, the show that rhymes with Stephen Fry (2006)",
