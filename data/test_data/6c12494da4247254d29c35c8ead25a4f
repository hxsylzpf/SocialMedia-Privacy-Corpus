  "content": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday July 7 2005 Lindsay Lohan was not the star of the 2001 film The Princess Diaries - Anne Hathaway took the leading role in that - although she did sing the title song for last year's The Princess Diaries 2. Detectives in Los Angeles are investigating whether they can rein in a new breed of paparazzi with criminal charges following a spate of \"hyper-aggressive\" incidents involving Hollywood stars. The police say they are acting because they believe that photographers hunting for the \"money shot\" are increasingly out of control. \"The concern is that ... someone is going to get hurt or killed,\" said a spokesperson for the LA County district attorney's \"target crimes\" division. The investigation was prompted by an incident last week when a photographer's car rammed into the Mercedes driven by the actor Lindsay Lohan in Hollywood. As the star of Freaky Friday and The Princess Diaries stopped her car, three other paparazzi arrived on the scene. The LAPD are now examining whether they may start charging photographers and their agencies with \"conspiracy\" - a felony and thus a much more serious offence than the \"misdemeanours\" they are usually charged with. To do so, the police need to prove that the photographers were working together to engineer situations in which the targeted celebrity would react in an angry or distressed way. Lieutenant Paul Vernon of the LAPD told the Guardian that while paparazzi had previously worked alone, many now appeared to be coordinating their activities. \"If there has been battery or false imprisonment to get the attention of the celebrity and get the 'money shot', if we can show that they conspired to commit a misdemeanour, that is a felony.\" Mr Vernon said \"blocking a person's path on the sidewalk is false imprisonment\" and that if a group of photographers boxed an actor in, either on foot or with their cars, that could be construed as conspiracy. Ms Lohan isn't the only actor with cause for complaint. Reese Witherspoon, the star of Legally Blonde, told the New York Times that she had recently been hemmed in by photographers as she tried to leave her gym, and that one of them had tried to ram her car. \"That had never happened before,\" she said. \"It's starting to feel chaotic and lawless.\" However, the paparazzi seem unrepentant. The semi-truce that followed Princess Diana's death during a pursuit by photographers has long since ended. Alan Croll, the lawyer representing the Fame Pictures agency, whose photographer was arrested in the Lohan incident, said those concerned understood that they were reporters with cameras and that \"their job is not to create stories, provoke celebrities or initiate physical contact\". He added: \"They do a difficult job and bring pictures of celebrities to the public, which is clearly something the public wants.\" Even some veteran photographers concede that the market is more competitive than ever. \"When I started 30 years ago there were probably only 10 of us and now there are going on 200,\" said Frank Griffin of Bauer-Griffin, which describes itself as the Hollywood Hunt club and specialises in such shots. He said many of those now involved were from the \"renegade element - a lot of people think they are a photographer just because they have a camera in their hand\". But of the actors who had complained about being hunted, he said: \"Would they rather trade their $10m-a-picture life for a normal job? \"The person being pursued is the one who chooses to live in a goldfish bowl. Unfortunately, they've kick-started the train and they can't stop it from rolling.\" Mr Griffin said the police in LA tended to side with the celebrities. \"We've got to be squeaky clean,\" he said, saying that a colleague had once been fined $1,000 for littering while on a stake-out. He said there was always interest in such stories, right across the press spectrum: \"We lead, you follow.\" And he said that he did not feel that there was a necessity for an extension of the law to protect celebrities from harassment. There are laws in place to protect those people, poor dears, who only make $10m a picture.\""
