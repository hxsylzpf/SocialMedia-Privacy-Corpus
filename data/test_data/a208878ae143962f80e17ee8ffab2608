  "content": "Once upon a time, not that long ago, those who spoke up for the importance of personal privacy were easily painted as paranoid cranks. No more. The right to privacy is now de rigueur with the public, press and politicians of all stripes. The sad truth is that over the past decade that little bit of personal space that we used to take for granted has been gradually readjusted, realigned and reduced to a fraction of its former size. Last week we saw Reversing the Rise of the Surveillance State, a Conservative paper which proposed such laudable policies as scrapping the ID card scheme, reducing the number of giant central databases, removing innocents from the DNA database and restricting local authorities' use of insidious surveillance powers. The paper, which reads like a shopping list of the government's missed opportunities, has been widely welcomed and certainly spells out vital steps towards turning the tide for personal privacy in the UK. While it's gratifying to see the centre right wholeheartedly embracing the importance of something so central to human dignity, it's disappointing to see that the stubborn commitment to scrapping the Human Rights Act still remains. The act and its contents have been our best defence against injustices of all kinds. Its greatest strength or weakness \u2013 depending where you stand \u2013 is that it protects and serves everyone; white or black, old or young, citizen or migrant. It's just not enough to defend the rights of free-born Englishmen if you won't afford protection to everyone in your land. Which assault on all of our liberties, from ID cards to summary extradition, hasn't been directed at the most marginalised first? Calls for British rights for British workers must be treated with extreme caution \u2013 our freedoms aren't a pick and mix to be chosen or dropped on a populist whim. Yes, this country has a strong (if mixed) tradition of fairness, but the Magna Carta contains no right to a private life. It took continental judges, with strong memories of the Nazis and the Stasi, to rule that blanket retention of innocents' DNA is wrong and must be abandoned. It is very good news that privacy is becoming a more popular human right, but it does not stand in isolation. It is part of a precious bundle of values, each inseparable from the others, each as important. On Tuesday, at Liberty's Liberal Democrats' conference fringe, I will be interviewing their party leader Nick Clegg. The Liberal Democrats have long campaigned on the human rights ticket but I hope to press him on detail and priorities as we head towards the next general election, the kind of political period in which core values are challenged. There are all sorts of tests of economic recovery and even more of leadership but the simplest test of a commitment to liberty is whether you defend it with a brave and even hand."
