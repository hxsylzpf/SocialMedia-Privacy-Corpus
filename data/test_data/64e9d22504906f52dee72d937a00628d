  "content": "Following fashion week on Twitter can be a somewhat dispiriting experience - does no one ever dislike anything? There's only so much unbridled joy at a maxi skirt or gushing over the use of lurex a person can take. Any at all, you might wisely point out. However this week a new star has emerged. No, it's not the faux-profound musings of Karl Lagerfeld [sample tweet: 'Luxury is the income tax of vanity. But it is so pleasant'] or even the Chinese-fortune-cookie wisdom of Carine Roitfeld ['when you're holding too tight, you're losing everything']. This particular tweeter is @MichaelHogan, whose #madeuplfwtweets are extremely funny, and often rather hard to distinguish from the real thing ... Here are some of the finest - but do go and follow him OMFG, working class passer-by called my look \"Care In The Community\". Reminds me why I hate civilians. Ugly, narrow minds #madeuplfwtweetss Debating with posse whether Paul Smith has most boring name in fashion. Or is it Jones? Browns? I know, we're totes mad! #madeuplfwtweets So stoked for Burberry... Prosum? Person? Portion? Dimsum? Who cares! J'aime Christopher Biggins' fash-fwd luxe designs #madeuplfwtweets Curve-hugging body-con dresses at Erdem with impressionist prints. Monets too tight to mention #madeuplfwtweets"
