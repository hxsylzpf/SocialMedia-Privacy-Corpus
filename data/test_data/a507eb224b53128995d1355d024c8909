  "content": "Step aside @rupertmurdoch \u2013 Richard Desmond has joined Twitter, under the moniker @DigiDesmond. Monkey is a little late to the party, as the Channel 5 and Express Newspapers owner actually made his Twitter debut on Friday. But perhaps we can claim a wee smidgeon of credit for the genesis of his Twitter handle (is that wise? Ed) \u2013 Monkey reported a couple of months back that Desmond had told MediaGuardian he was now \"Digi Des\" rather than \"Dirty Des\". So far, the recent digital convert has been uncharacteristically restrained, with just a couple of tweets, one congratulating Murdoch on his \"cost-cutting\" Baby Shard move \u2013 which will put News Corp staff just over the Thames from Desmond's Northern &amp; Shell HQ. But once Digi Des gets the hang of following people, Monkey confidently expects \"Ginger, get the popcorn!\" moments with old sparring partner @Lord_Sugar."
