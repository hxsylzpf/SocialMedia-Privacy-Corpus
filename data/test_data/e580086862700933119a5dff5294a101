  "content": "From the 10 to 13 September, Twitter festivals took place all over the world, bringing people together for some charity and fun. There were 22 UK cities in the project Twestival Local. Twitterers played murder mystery games, had drinks, ate cupcakes, discussed the future of the internet, listened to concerts, got to know each other, gave an introduction to Twitter newbies, organised collaborative writing projects, danced wildly and had fun. In short: From Cornwall over Cardiff to Brighton they were highly creative. Watch them having a blast and making the world a better place in our picture gallery.",
