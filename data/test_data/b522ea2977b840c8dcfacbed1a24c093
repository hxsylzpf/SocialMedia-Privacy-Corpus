  "content": "The former home secretary, Jacqui Smith, reached a \"flawed decision\" when she disregarded powerful medical evidence in the case of computer hacker Gary McKinnon, who is facing extradition to the US, the high court heard today. McKinnon, who suffers from Asperger's syndrome, could easily be tried in this country, the court heard, thus avoiding the risk that he might commit suicide if jailed in the US. McKinnon, 43, from north London, is resisting extradition to stand trial for hacking into the US defence department and Nasa computer systems in 2001 and 2002. A judicial review of the home secretary's ruling heard that he could face a sentence of up to 12 years if convicted. Edward Fitzgerald QC, for McKinnon, told Lord Justice Stanley Burnton and Mr Justice Wilkie that evidence of McKinnon's medical condition had been given to Smith to demonstrate that extraditing him could lead to serious psychological problems. \"She [Smith] erred in law and reached a flawed decision in response to the medical evidence,\" he said. \"She underestimated and misrepresented the gravity of the situation without obtaining evidence of her own, made no inquiries and sought no assurance as to the grant of bail before, and repatriation after, trial in the US.\" Fitzgerald also told the court that the home secretary had failed to take account of \"the reasonable alternative\" of prosecution in this country, where McKinnon could face up to five years' imprisonment for offences under the computer misuse act. McKinnon had already agreed to plead guilty to such offences, an option which the director of public prosecutions had turned down \u2013 a decision which was now itself a subject of judicial review. The hearing is due to be concluded tomorrow and judgment is likely to be reserved."
