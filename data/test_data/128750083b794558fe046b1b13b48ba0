  "content": "Target's chief information officer Beth Jacob resigned Wednesday as the retailer struggles in the wake of a massive pre-Christmas data breach. Jacob, who had been with the company since 2008, is the first high-profile executive to leave the company since hackers compromised the details of an estimated 40m credit and debit card holders who had shopped at the store. Target chairman Gregg Steinhafel said the company will search for an interim chief information officer who can help guide the company through an overhaul of its systems. Hackers gained access to Target's computer systems by stealing the credentials of a refrigeration contractor. The breach \u2013 possibly the largest ever \u2013 ran for three weeks beginning with the Black Friday shopping weekend in late November, the start of the Christmas shopping season. While the breach compromised details of 40m credit and debit cards hackers may have been able to get the personal details, including phone numbers, email and addresses, of 70m Target customers \u2013 a number equivalent to 29% of the US population. \"We are undertaking an overhaul of our information security and compliance structure and practices at Target,\" Steinhafel said in an emailed statement. In January, two people were arrested close to the Mexican border with 96 credit cards cloned with account information from Target customers' accounts. However subsequent reports suggested the two were tangentially connected to the hack. An investigation into the breach is ongoing. According to Brian Krebs, the security expert who broke the target story on his blog Krebs on Security, Target's attackers may have gained access via a poorly secured feature built into a widely used IT management software product running on the retailer's internal network. The attack latched on to Target's point-of-sale registers allowing the criminals to steal credit and debit card data as people passed through the retailers tills. The criminals set up a central repository within Target's internal network that hoovered up from all of the data from infected registers. The massive credit card breach has tested the banking system and led to a backlog of new orders for credit cards. Last month Steinhafel said the company's sales had \"softened meaningfully following our December announcement of a data breach. As we plan for the new fiscal year, we will continue to work tirelessly to win back the confidence of our guests and deliver irresistible merchandise and offers, and we are encouraged that sales trends have improved in recent weeks\"."
