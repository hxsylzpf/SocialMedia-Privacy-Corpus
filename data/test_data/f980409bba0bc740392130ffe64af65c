  "content": "Microsoft will be adding a raft of social networking features to its online Xbox Live service with the next Dashboard update. According to the press release: With the prevalence of social media websites such as MySpace and FaceBook, this type of capability has largely come to be expected from consumers as a means to relate in an online community. ... When the Fall Dashboard update is distributed on December 4, the new default setting on Xbox LIVE will be active, enabling members to see the Friends lists of other Xbox LIVE members. Friends lists are an important feature of sites like Facebook, MySpace and other connectivity providers. It's a clever move for Microsoft in advance of the anticipated library of features rumoured for PlayStation's upcoming social titles, Home and Little Big Planet. The community is already strong on these sites. It will interesting to watch what else they offer, and how they grapple with the inevitable privacy issues. More on this as it arises. Via Kotaku."
