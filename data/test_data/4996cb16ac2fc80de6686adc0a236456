  "content": "There is always sadness when a newspaper closes, and that's certainly true of the Prestwich Advertiser, which was terminated this week by Trinity Mirror. It even prompted one fan, who tweets as @Missus_IP (MrsInsidePrestwich), to make the YouTube tribute above, which calls it \"a sad day for journalism.\" I would guess that the heartstring-tugging version of \"Time to say goodbye\" is by Andrea Bocelli. Spot those memorable headlines: \"Lettuce all go to the garden show\"\u2026 \"Milk misery for pupils as weather is 'too wet for cows'\" and the wonderfully improbable, but fascinating, \"Black Death could return to Prestwich.\" Trinity Mirror explained the the closure was due to \"rising production costs and the challenging economy, both of which have made the Advertiser no longer commercially viable.\" That's the reality.
