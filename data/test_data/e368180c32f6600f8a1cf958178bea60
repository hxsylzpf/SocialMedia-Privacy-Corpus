  "content": "Last week, I saw my daughter smiling at home because she was wearing her mum's high-heeled shoes, eight sizes too big for her. I learned that my favourite band (Dreadzone, not well known but their album Second Light was one of John Peel's top 20 of all time) have an upcoming gig in Guildford, where my mate Jim happens to have set up a brewery. I was sickened to read the Guardian reports of remarks from the accused in the Delhi rape trial. Last week, I was in Barcelona and on my phone and in my feed; all of this came to me. This is what algorithms do. The algorithms that shape our lives are not sentient machines; they are programmes designed by people for people. They are here to serve us and to help us navigate the near-limitless options, as well as the unique pressures, of modern life. But it all starts with what people are doing \u2013 and we are doing a lot. When it comes to media, the number of things we create, watch or share is staggering. On Facebook alone 3bn videos will be viewed globally today. In less than three years, Instagram has grown to a community of 300 million people posting 70m images a day. WhatsApp has grown even faster, with 800m people sending 30bn messages every day. We need intelligent filters that help us understand what is valuable. The algorithm isn't king, but it is an incredibly effective way of making things make sense and organising the stuff that emerges because of our behaviour. The algorithm is simply a discovery mechanism. Discovery is king. We've seen this in Facebook's evolution from your friend's diary, to the world's biggest photo-sharing app, to the globe's most powerful content discovery platform. That's where feeds, driven by algorithms, become necessary. And what changed the importance of feeds in people's lives is mobile. Facebook's news feed arrived roughly a year before the iPhone. It was the iPhone, more than any other piece of technology, that ushered in the era of a mobile, visual web and the tsunami of content that came with it. But it was the environment that gave rise to the technology, not the other way around. The amount of content we're creating and that's available to us is exponentially greater than it has ever been \u2013 and it's only going to accelerate. As our attention has fragmented across different platforms our communications have become more bite-sized \u2013 easy to post and quick to read. We live in a world of visual communication, of snaps, tweets, posts, stickers, gifs and selfies. Every day people are finding and sharing new ways to express themselves (I'm a big fan of stickers, especially adventure time) and how they feel about the world around them. And yet, while new modes of consumption will continue to be created, our ability to consume information won't keep pace. Content grows; time is constant. Time, then, has becomes an incredibly precious commodity. People choose where to spend it carefully, so the fact they're choosing to spend it on feed-based platforms such as Facebook is significant. In return, the responsibility of platforms is to not squander that time. That means helping people discover the things they care about, surfacing the content that counts. More than ever, we want everything in our lives to be as personalised as our playlists, whether it's news stories, videos or even ads. What we can now do, thanks to algorithms, is give people exactly this: a sense of scaled intimacy that's more relevant and more enjoyable than at any other time in history. Some see the algorithm as a potentially threatening force that's become almost too successful \u2013 too disruptive \u2013 when, in fact, I believe the real enemies of progress are habit and inertia. And that's understandable. We're all coming of age on screens, all finding our feet in this new era. No one knows what the future will hold but people, not technology, will be the best guide. And people are moving incredibly fast \u2013 moving towards mobile, towards relevancy and towards visual ways of expressing themselves. These cumulative behaviours make people the masters of the algorithms that are there to serve them. To paraphrase, if the algorithm is king, then people are king kong.
