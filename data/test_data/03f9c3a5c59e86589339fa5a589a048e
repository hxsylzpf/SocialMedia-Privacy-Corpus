  "content": "Barristers have clearly missed a trick. All those years they spend honing their skills of forensic examination, argument and compendious legal knowledge are for naught. All they need do, apparently, is pack the jury with the pliant ciphers that the Law Commission seems to believe make up 12 good people and true these days. How else can you explain its proposal for a new criminal offence with which to threaten jurors so easily influenced by what they dig up on the internet? The Law Commission says jurors who deliberately research cases should face up to two years in prison in a suggested reform of the current law of contempt of court. You might be forgiven for believing their stance is justified in light of recent well-publicised cases of juror misbehaviour. We have seen: \u2022 One case abandoned when a juror dug up details of previous sex offence accusations against a defendant \u2013 she was jailed. \u2022 A juror jailed for Facebook \"friending\" a defendant she had just acquitted while co-defendants were still being tried \u2013 jailed. \u2022 A juror jailed for admitting on Facebook he was pleased to be trying a paedophile who he intended to find guilty, or words to that effect. \u2022 Another juror jailed for Googling background on a trial that he was worried would drag on. \u2022 A juror dismissed after she asked her Facebook friends to help her decide the verdict. What a catalogue of disasters to see justice so derailed, you might think. But wait, there were 17,786 jury trials in England and Wales in 2011. Unless huge numbers of jurors are covering up their illicit internet activity, legislation hardly seems justified given the minuscule nature of the problem. The latest research into jury behaviour hardly supports the position being taken by the Law Commission. A study by UCL, which is ongoing, found \"only a very small proportion of jurors used the internet in ways that could be legally problematic\". The Law Commission says that the new offence will bring clarity for jurors \u2013 and they are correct in thinking there is a need for greater clarity \u2013 just wrong in how they aim to bring it about. The UCL study found that a quarter of jurors were confused about what they could and could not do on the internet. Some even thought they were not allowed to check their email during the trial. You do not achieve clarity by threatening jurors with a new offence. The time taken to legislate would be far better spent on producing new, clear written guidelines for jurors and guidance for judges on the nature of the warning they give at the start of the trial concerning internet research. I have heard that warning in court many times. It is variable at best, and often dashed off before the jurors have fully settled into their seats. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, but unless jurors are given proper guidance then the legislation will not achieve its purpose. The link above for the Theodora Dallas case is a report of her taking her case to Europe, arguing that she was not given clear warnings about using the internet. There is a worrying trend developing that suggests juries are too easily swayed; that they cannot cope with long complex cases. Such ideas lead to the suggestion that for certain cases, judges sitting alone should replace a juror. This is a dangerous path to tread. Who are these jurors so weak-willed that the merest whiff of internet prejudice has them delivering a verdict? If you or I can see through prejudicial material online or in print, how can we be so arrogant as to presume the woman or man sitting next to us in the jury box cannot do the same? Judges have always believed juries could be trusted to use their common sense and weigh the evidence properly. In the trial of the Kray twins in 1969, when the spectre of prejudice to Ronnie and Reggie was raised, Mr Justice (later Lord Justice) Lawton said: \"I have enough confidence in my fellow countrymen to think that they have got newspapers sized up \u2026 and they are capable in normal circumstances of looking at a matter fairly and without prejudice even though they have to disregard what they have read in a newspaper \u2026 It is a matter of human experience and certainly a matter of experience for those who practise in the criminal courts first that the public's recollection is short, and secondly, that the drama, if I may use that term, of a trial almost always has the effect of excluding from recollection that which went before.\" If they have the sense to ignore newspapers, they can ignore Twitter too. Google may have improved recollection, but it should not diminish our trust in jurors to the point that we need to threaten them with a new criminal offence.
