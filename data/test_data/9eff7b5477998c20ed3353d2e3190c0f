  "content": "Dyson Heydon's revelation that he only reads emails that have been printed out for him has been received with incredulity and amusement on Twitter. On Monday, Heydon dismissed applications that he disqualify himself from the royal commission into trade unions, following a row over a plan to speak at a Liberal party fundraiser. Much of the unions' call for Heydon to stand down was based on emails exchanged between Heydon and the organisers of the Sir Garfield Barwick address, which identified that it was a Liberal party event. In his reasons for dismissing the unions' applications, Heydon explained that he owned no computer, and that all his email correspondence was carried out by his personal assistant. \"It is notorious among the legal profession that I am incapable of sending or receiving emails,\" he said. \"The consequence is that I read emails only after they have been printed out for me.\" Despite attorney general George Brandis's attempt to downplay it, Twitter was understandably rather gripped by the news.",
