  "content": "David Shing, the man who helps figure out future trends for AOL, is fed up with Facebook and Twitter. In fact he has told his bosses that defriending and unfollowing are going to be the next big thing as users realise that the increasing \"noise\" on social networks is counterproductive. \"The web is so overwhelming, so then it becomes underwhelming [because] it's so hard to find anything,\" he says. He believes the new challenge for both individuals and marketers trying to promote their brands using social networks is to stop adding to the noise. \"If I have 2,000 friends on Facebook or Twitter, how do I work out which one will actually pick me up in the airport? Social tools can help us but then also hinder us, they dehumanise what we do. We need to make the web more human. It needs to enrich your offline life.\" Shing, speaking at the Dublin Web Summit, believes new F8 applications on Facebook that enable users to automatically share music tracks, video or even newspaper articles could be counterproductive and encourage far too much clutter. \"I don't want people to know that I still listen to Dolly Parton,\" said Shing. \"I want to be more in control of my digital footprint, not less. I'm no longer 11 years old so I'm not in a popularity contest.\" For the record Shing is 41 and has only 700 followers on Twitter and a similar number of friends on Facebook. He doesn't tweet much because he's still trying to figure out its value. \"Facebook is about your real friends and Twitter is about who you would like to be friends. For example I am friends with Yoko Ono on Twitter and she's tweeted me back, but that's it, she's not really a friend. \"People are going to start defriending people who constantly tweet and post on Facebook with rubbish info,\" he said. Similarly for brands, he said it's very dangerous for companies to get involved on social networks unless they can guarantee a meaningful conversation. \"If I invite a brand into my home, there better be a good reason for them to come in.\" Shing, who spent three years in London heading AOL Europe's marketing before moving to New York to be its \"digital prophet\", believes the future is all about the \"attention economy\" \u2013 a world in which content is valuable enough to dwell on and more likely to be curated by friends than pushed by \"in-your-face advertisers\". Or as Joe Fernandez from Klout.com \u2013 a kind of page ranking service for people \u2013 put it: \"The web has shifted from being page-centric to people-centric.\" He believes companies also need to get back to basics and treat early adopters more seriously. \"We need to focus on them and look after them. If you don't they are going to go somewhere else as we saw with the bum rush from MySpace.\""
