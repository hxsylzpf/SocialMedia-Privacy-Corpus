  "content": "Monkey has been weeping for a number of reasons this morning after reading the website of the Denver-based Rocky Mountain News. Going straight to the top of our Inappropriate Use of Technology chart is Rocky reporter Berny Morson, who filed live Twitter updates to the Rocky website from the funeral of three-year-old Marten Kudlis, who was killed earlier this month when two trucks crashed into the Baskin Robbins ice-cream shop in Aurora, Colorado, where the unfortunate toddler was inside with his mother. Monkey wishes the whole thing was some kind of sick ruse, unfortunately it doesn't appear as if it is."
