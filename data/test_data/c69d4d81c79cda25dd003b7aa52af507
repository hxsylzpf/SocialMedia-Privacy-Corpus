  "content": "The enquiry \"do you like hospital food?\" marks the pinnacle of humour for many a bully. If the threat of physical violence isn't bad enough, the thought of having to endure NHS catering is even worse. Australians seem to have a better time of it - their hospital grub seems to be of a standard Gordon Ramsay wouldn't complain about - but around the world, from Poland to Japan, the food that patients are expected to consume appears to be on a level just one rung above what you'd give to a cat, as evidenced by a plate delivered at a German university hospital. Here the grim cavalcade of seriously terrible food is revealed in a series of photographs and reviews that like similar site Airline Meals (airlinemeals.net) are oddly fascinating.",
