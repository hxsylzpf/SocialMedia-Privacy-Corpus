  "content": "Last Wednesday Riven Vincent, a regular contributor to the forums of the parenting website Mumsnet, posted words of despair. She wrote that she had asked social services to take her severely disabled six-year-old daughter, Celyn, into care. \"We get six hours' respite a week,\" she wrote. \"I can't cope.\" The following morning, Celyn's face was on the front page of national newspapers \u2013 a vivid example of one of the people the spending cuts will hit hardest. David Cameron, who had promised that he would not do anything to harm disabled children, was caught \u2013 and still remains \u2013 on the back foot. According to some critics of the site, that's just where Mumsnet's 600,000 members like their politicians to be \u2013 if not on their knees. Charities working with disabled children have thanked Mumsnet for the publicity it has generated. Other commentators, however, while sympathetic to Celyn's family, are less than enchanted with the sight of the mummy-warriors marching forth yet again, exercising an influence they believe is disproportionate to their numbers. Certainly, Mumsnet attracts an extraordinary degree of venom. It has been labelled censorious, moralising, smug, vicious, bullying and sanctimonious, and accused of having members who are rude, dogmatic and as \"thick as mincemeat\" who remain immersed for hours in the subjects of weaning, nappies and nipples. Ever since politicians began courting the site as a way in to new media, murmurs of complaint on the blogosphere have grown into a roar. \"What the hell does Mumsnet think it is?\" seems to be the gist. And how does it manage to pull the strings of publicity so effectively? Justine Roberts, as its co-founder and now chief executive, is the most likely candidate for the role of puppeteer-in-chief. Her mother, Elizabeth, said of Justine in an interview: \"When talents were being handed out, she got more than her fair share. But her school reports all complained she messed about\u2026 She was the ringleader of a very noisy gang, and in a way she still is.\" Roberts is 43 years old, a former economist and sports correspondent, a Liverpool supporter, and a mother of four. She has a strong sense of humour, an infectious laugh and a very clear idea of how Mumsnet works. For those who choose to leave their prejudices at the door of \"Mumsnet Towers\" in north London, it's not all that difficult to understand its success as an online community and pressure group. In 1999, Justine and her husband, Ian Katz, now deputy editor of the Guardian, took their one-year-old twins on a holiday advertised as being family-friendly. \"The twins had diarrhoea and we didn't bring enough nappies. The man sitting next to us on the plane was passing us paper cups to catch the vomit,\" says Roberts. \"The holiday was so not family-friendly. And that's when the idea for Mumsnet was conceived.\" She and her co-founder, Carrie Longton, a television producer, decided on a website \"to make parents' lives easier by pooling knowledge, experience and support\". Roberts and a handful of university friends worked out of her back bedroom; it was five years before they could pay themselves a modest salary. \"If anyone knows how to make a profit out of the free internet, let us know,\" she jokes. Eleven years after Mumsnet's birth, some now see Roberts as a matriarchal Cromwell leading a righteous army of middle-class mums into war. Campaigns so far include a drive against the sexualisation of children; improved care for women who miscarry; and the perennial push for more family-friendly employers (a Mumsnet Jobs Club opens in the spring). Recently, Mumsnet triumphed in a battle over a \u00a31.25m billboard campaign that declared, in one of a series of deliberately provocative statements intended to demonstrate the power of outdoor advertising, that \"career women make bad mothers\" (the poster was withdrawn). It has also tussled with Gina Ford, the parenting guru, who complained about insults posted about her on Mumsnet forums (the case was settled out of court). And most recently, it has challenged EastEnders over a storyline in which a mother who loses her baby to a cot death steals another child. \"A large number of Mumsnet people who'd suffered a bereavement felt strongly that they had a right to complain to an organisation to which they pay a licence fee, and which almost boasts that it educates via its storylines,\" Roberts says. \"They wanted Mumsnet to register the complaint. We didn't ask anyone to edit the storyline: that was the BBC's decision. \"We are very anti the idea of censorship generally. We run a site based on freedom of speech. I knew we would attract a lot of criticism, but sometimes it's still the right thing to do.\" Mumsnet draws 25,000 postings and a million hits a day. Apart from its popular chatrooms, it offers books and guides, and asks Mumsnetters to test products and interview stars and politicians. The site's members tend to be aged between 25 and 45 and come from all over the UK. They are more likely to live in the city; 75% of them have degrees; and their income tends to be slightly above average. In short, they mirror the path of women who have moved into further education since the 1970s. \"We also have a large proportion who would rather chew off their right arm than call themselves middle class,\" Roberts says. Social interaction on the site is often robust and blunt, and sometimes funny. Cruelty is not allowed; \"insensitivity\" is. \"Get the doormat tattoo off your head,\" one woman is instructed briskly. Critics detect a gang mentality that they say is reinforced by Mumsnet's own acronyms and slang \u2013 for instance, \"DH\" (darling husband), \"baby dancing\" (sex with a husband), and \"norks\", which, Mumsnet user \"Norkybutnice\" explains, means \"breasts\". It's strange, but hardly in the same league as Masonic rites and rituals. So why the resentment? \"I understand it,\" Roberts says. \"We have the highest-profile voice for women online. People who aren't mothers probably think: 'Hang on, that doesn't represent me at all.' I wish there were other voices out there that got as much profile as us. But there's also another level to the resentment, which is basic misogyny. Mothers are expected to behave in a certain way. They are not expected to talk about sex, or swear, or have opinions that challenge the stereotype.\" When Mumsnet tackles issues outside parenting, such as the economy or nuclear power, Roberts says, the tweets grow ever more offensive \u2013 for example: \"Britain is going to the dogs. Those being the ones in charge of Mumsnet.\" Roberts has been described as having \"a haggard face with dried-up ovaries\". Still, you can't travel in the wild west and complain about the bullets; the internet is rough. Roberts says she feels more frustrated than anything else. \"In any one day, Mumsnetters are called sanctimonious and prim \u2013 and then shrill leftwing harridan harpies. With more than 25,000 postings, you can find the prejudice you seek.\" What Mumsnet probably does epitomise is whatever the \"big society\" is supposed to mean, Roberts adds \u2013 \"people organising themselves to help each other, show small kindnesses and be communal.\" Riven Vincent illustrates her point. If you follow the thread, within minutes of her first despairing post, dozens of members moved rapidly from giving verbal support to offering practical help, supplying \"Dave's\" (David Cameron's) fax and address details, Facebooking and tweeting celebrities and politicians, asking them to act. Mumsnet is, in part, an online mutual aid society. One single mother who announced on the site that she had swallowed an overdose of pills was tracked down; members organised childcare and raised \u00a32,000. It is also a home of virtual protest, but members are equally drawn from the three major parties, so a consensus is not always forged. \"Our members are a 24/7 focus group. If we're not too sure about what path to take, we consult with them,\" Roberts says. \"And they show us the way. We are conduits, not leaders.\" Roberts works full-time but the majority of the staff of 32 are part-time. Her mother says that her daughter and son-in-law live on the edge. Roberts laughs: \"By which she means, we're always late.\" Her mother also says that her twin granddaughters wrote a letter to Justine that read: \"You and Dad are never here. All we want is to be with you.\" Roberts chuckles again. \"The girls write a letter a day. It's usually espousing some injustice such as 'why my telephone shouldn't be confiscated'. I see a great deal of my children. The only person I don't see much of is my husband.\" She smiles. The Mumsnet Rules, co-written by Roberts, will be published in May. The organisation also has expansion plans. \"If I'm proud of anything,\" Roberts says, \"it's that we've given a public voice to those who didn't have one before. The most popular forum on Mumsnet is called 'Am I being unreasonable?', which says a lot about women's guilt and insecurities. I'd guess on a men's website it would probably be called 'You are being unreasonable'. There's still a lot of work to be done.\" \u2022 The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the Record column, Sunday 30 January 2011. We maintained that breastfeeding Mumsnet members tended to call their breasts \"nookies\", with one user giving herself the epithet \"Nookiebutnice\". Generally, site users affectionately nickname breasts \"norks\" and the member calls herself \"Norkybutnice\". \"Nork\", a 1950s Australian slang term, derives from New South Wales, where the prominent udders on a cow advertised Norco, the North Coast Dairy Co-operative."
