  "content": "Last year's Oscars saw viewing figures on the rise thanks to the presence of all-singing, all-dancing host Hugh Jackman and sequences involving the stars of High School Musical and Mamma Mia! This year it looks like March's 82nd Annual Academy Awards may be set for even more razzle dazzle, after producer Adam Shankman took to Twitter to invite suggestions from his 48,000 or so followers. Their response: give us more High School Musical, appearances by Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart (stars of the hugely popular Twilight franchise), and dance routines from regulars on US reality show So You Think You Can Dance, on which Shankman is a judge. According to Hollywood Reporter, the exchange has rather put the wind up those who made the decision to put the director of Hairspray and 17 Again in charge, as they prefer to keep details of the ceremony under wraps until closer to the date. On Sunday Shankman wrote on Twitter: \"Curious: what and who do u wanna see on the oscars? What would make u watch?\" A barrage of tweets bounced back. \"If Rob and Kristen present an award together, or even just Kristen since she wasn't invited (rude!) last yr, I'd 4 sure watch,\" one of Shankman's followers said. Another wrote: \"I will watch the Oscars no matter what, but my excitement factor will be ten-fold if you have SYTYCD [So You Think You Can Dance] alumns in the show.\" In fact the response was so virulent that Shankman was later forced to play down hopes of a pop culture takeover of the awards. \"We will C if thr R musical #s :).,\" he tweeted. \"I h8 musical #'s in shows when they don't make sense. I'm choreographing, so the dancers will be amazing.\" He later added, in response to a minority of followers outraged at the idea of a two-hour song and dance marathon: \"I promise that the glamour and sense of occasion will be present! It's the oscRs for god sakes! I'm good at this. They are going to be great.\" Next year's Oscars are taking place on March 7 at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, with joint hosts Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin. Neither is an obvious match for Jackman, a former Broadway musical performer, when it comes to natty dance moves and crowdpleasing ditties, but on current evidence, they may just want to consider packing their jazz shoes.",
