  "content": "With Skype interviews, online CVs and social media, keeping up to date with new ways of job hunting can be overwhelming. \"I was invited to a Skype interview recently and when the connection broke I completely froze and didn't know how to deal with it,\" says recent graduate Stuart Bell*. Likewise, University of Surrey graduate Sophia Brown* was surprised to find her interviewer had looked at her social media account. \"She asked me questions about things I'd mentioned on Twitter \u2013 which I hadn't even considered preparing for.\" And it pays to get familiar with new technologies \u2013 42% of companies are now using video interviews to recruit roles, while 45% of employers now use social media to screen job candidates. Jobseekers are also increasingly using online profiles to find jobs, with 34% using Twitter to make first contact with employers. So, how should you prepare for 21st-century job hunting? If you would like to find out \u2013 join us on Wednesday 25 November from 1\u20133pm BST for a live chat with the experts.
