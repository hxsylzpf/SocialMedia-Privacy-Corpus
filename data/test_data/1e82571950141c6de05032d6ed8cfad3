  "content": "On the surface of it, the incident is entirely trivial: in a thoughtless moment, a police officer on a surveillance helicopter decides to tweet a photo of a celebrity he's spotted (in this case Michael McIntyre), briefly adding the Metropolitan police to the ranks of London paparazzi. The Met's snap had a few features a standard press photo lacks, though, including an exact timestamp, location data, and a vantage point from an expensive and taxpayer-funded aerial spot. Online reaction to the photograph was predictably bad \u2013 why are police invading the privacy of someone who's doing nothing wrong? \u2013 and was followed by questioning whether the photo breached the Data Protection Act, which it may well have done. But what the picture really serves to do is to remind us that surveillance \u2013 whether of photos, data, phone records or emails \u2013 is a human activity, despite the technology involved and the safeguards we're endlessly told about. People in the police and in intelligence agencies are still people, and have all the human failings and fallibilities the rest of us do. The difference is the sheer scale of information available to them: police forces in the UK have access to photography, to movements of cars through numberplate-recognition technology, to phone records without any judicial oversight through the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), and more. Intelligence agencies hoover up even more information than that. The debate around surveillance powers tends to focus on the serious risks our culture of over-collection poses: at the tinfoil hat end, whether such quantities of data would allow some future government to bring an end to liberal democracy; or at the more realistic end, the dangers of overactive algorithms and false positives leading to the pursuit, monitoring, arrest or worse of innocent people. But we shouldn't forget this human factor either. When one GCHQ webcam monitoring programme sucked up huge volumes of adult content \u2013 making the UK government the accidental owner of perhaps the world's largest collection of amateur porn \u2013 staff had to be politely reminded as to policies of sharing content with colleagues. Multiple staff over at GCHQ's close ally, the US National Security Agency, have been disciplined or even dismissed after using the surveillance tools of the world's largest superpower to keep tabs on their spouses \u2013 or exes. And council staff have often landed themselves in trouble for using their own surveillance powers and databases \u2013 which, as the Daily Mail often laments, are routinely used to spy on \"bin offenders\" \u2013 to keep tabs on celebrities in their patch. Surveillance advocates are keen to paint a rigorous, automated, algorithmic system free from human foibles and only ever dedicated to keeping us all safe. This week's helicopter snap, like the incidents before it, remind us that the reality is rather messier. That's likely the attitude of many of the staff, most of the time. People get nosey, people get bored, people get hung up over their exes, and people show off. We can only hope they get caught when they do so. Most of us don't need to fear being snapped from on high. But as we hand over ever more information about ourselves, often with little to no say in the matter, it's worth remembering the rare and memorable cases when it comes to light, and wondering who's looking at our private information \u2013 and why."
