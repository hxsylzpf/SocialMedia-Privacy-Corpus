  "content": "The story Wimbledon washout Murray mound? Henman hill? Rusedski ridge? Name it after whichever British tennis super-flop you choose, it won't stop the authorities closing it down in the rain. Much to the disappointment of middle Britain, Wimbledon's big screen had its power cut during Andy's big first game. Calls of an over-zealous attitude to public protection had the Health and Safety Executive screaming foul play: \"People have been walking up and down wet, grassy slopes for years without catastrophic consequences,\" wrote the chair of the HSE in an open letter. \"Health and safety excuses are becoming as much a feature of our sporting calendar as the rain,\" she added. It must have had some impact: the hill's been open ever since. Huzzah! The stat 121,420... \u2026 more state school pupils receive free school meals than in 2007. According to the Department for Education, 18% of pupils are now eligible, compared with 16% three years ago. The news came on the same day the annual world wealth report told us the number of people worth more than $1m in the UK has risen by 1.4% to 454,000. The quote David Cameron \"You do the fighting, I'll do the talking.\" A stark warning to defence chiefs that sweeping statements on morale and spending cuts will not be tolerated, unless they toe the party line, of course. The PM apparently hauled the dissenters \u2013 Chief of Defence Staff General Sir David Richards and one Air Chief Marshal Sir Simon Bryant \u2013 into No 10 for a severe dressing-down. The tweet @ebertchicago He may be the first film critic to win a Pulitzer, but when it comes to tact, Chicago Sun-Times writer Roger Ebert is rather lacking. Chipping in with his analysis on the car crash that killed Jackass star Ryan Dunn, Ebert tweeted: \"Friends don't let Jackasses drink and drive.\" Following widespread Twitter rebukes from Jackass fans, Ebert admitted he may have been \"too quick to tweet\".",
