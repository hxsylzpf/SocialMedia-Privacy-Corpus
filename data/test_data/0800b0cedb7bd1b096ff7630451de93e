  "content": "Australia's immigration department has announced the creation of a new taskforce to strengthen the handling of sensitive information following an embarrassing data breach involving the personal details of G20 world leaders. The Guardian revealed on Monday the immigration department had inadvertently disclosed the passport and visa details of world leaders attending the G20 summit in Brisbane - including US president Barack Obama, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian president Vladimir Putin - after an employee sent an email containing the details to a member of the Asian Cup local organising committee. The immigration department has been involved in several other serious privacy breaches since 2012, including the disclosure of details of almost 10,000 people in immigration detention, as well as breaches involving the loss of payroll data. A statement from the immigration department said: \"The department is making significant changes to its information management practices, following a number of external and internal reviews into its processes and practices. All recommendations from these reviews have been adopted.\" \"An External Accountability Task Force, specifically focused on strengthening privacy and information management, has been established within the department's integrity, security and assurance division.\" The data breach relating to the G20 world leaders occurred when an employee accidentally sent an email to the wrong person using the auto-complete function in Microsoft Outlook. But the department recommended the world leaders not be notified of the breach. The Guardian reported on Wednesday that a similar privacy breach occurred in 2012 with a visa applicant's personal details, but in that case the individual affected was notified. The department's statement said: \"As outlined in the released documents, decisions on whether or not to notify individuals or groups whose information was released are based on a case-by-case risk assessment. \"This risk assessment takes into account a range of factors, including the known distribution of the material, whether it could be retrieved, deciphered or readily understood if found, and likelihood of harm being suffered as a result of the breach.\" Australia's opposition party has asked the commonwealth ombudsman to investigate the department's handling of personal information, and has called on prime minister Tony Abbott to explain how the breach occurred. The former immigration minister Scott Morrison, who was notified of the G20 breach at the time he oversaw the portfolio, said the breach was \"highly regrettable.\""
