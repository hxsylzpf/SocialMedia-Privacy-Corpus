  "content": "The big story You'd think a man who formed a band called 30 Off Foot of Grunts would have a way with words, right? Not right. This week, Russell Crowe set tongues wagging on Twitter by calling the Jewish tradition of male circumcision \"barbaric and stupid\", adding: \"Hygienic? Why don't you sew up your ass then?\" After waking to find the tabloids going nuts, he removed the posts and tweeted: \"I have a deep and abiding love for all people of all nationalities. I'm very sorry that I have said things on here that have caused distress.\" Jewish film-maker Eli Roth, who's directing Crowe in The Man With the Iron Fists, leapt in to lend Russell his PR muscle by chuckling that it was all a joke.
