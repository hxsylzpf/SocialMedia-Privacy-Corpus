  "content": "A California politician who condemned Google's plans for a free email service as a \"Faustian bargain\" that undermines privacy has begun drafting legislation to stop Gmail in its tracks. The search engine giant announced on April 1 in a light-hearted press release that it was planning to offer users a free email account with an unprecedented amount of storage. Democratic state senator Liz Figueroa fears the California-based firm's plans to scan customers' emails and insert targeted advertisements is a \"misbegotten idea\" that \"undermines the most fundamental aspect of communication - the expectation of privacy\". \"We think it's an absolute invasion of privacy. It's like having a massive billboard in the middle of your home,\" she told the Reuters news agency. Senator Figueroa said she decided to act yesterday after she received no reply to a letter of protest she sent to Google on April 4. She warned in the letter: \"I cannot urge you strongly enough to abandon this misbegotten idea. I believe you are embarking on a disaster of enormous proportions, for yourself and for all of your customers.\" Google told Reuters it had received the letter and would \"take it into consideration as we build the best possible webmail service for our users\". The Gmail service will offer users one gigabyte of email storage for free. Its main rivals, Hotmail and Yahoo, both currently charge UK customers \u00a339.99 for a tenth of the storage than Gmail is set to provide. In return, Gmail subscribers will have to consent to allow Google's computers to scan their emails for key words and insert relevant advertisements in them. This would mean that someone emailing a friend about their plans to visit New York, for example, could receive advertisements for nearby hotels. Google has also faced a barrage of criticism from 28 privacy and civil liberties groups, who penned an open letter to its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, calling for the suspension of Gmail until privacy concerns were addressed. One of the signatories, the UK-based group Privacy International, also lodged a complaint with the information commissioner about the matter. In a statement to Guardian Unlimited, Google said it had \"the highest regard\" for the privacy of users' information, adding that it was confident Gmail was \"fully compliant with data protection laws worldwide\". \"Google actively solicits user feedback on our privacy policies - if they can be made clearer or otherwise improved, we want to hear about it,\" the statement read. \"We look forward to a detailed dialogue with data protection authorities across Europe to ensure their concerns are heard and resolved.\" Gmail is currently being tested by a small group of users, and Google has not announced a launch date for the service. A Google source told Guardian Unlimited last week the company was surprised by the level of criticism it faced for a product that was still undergoing trials. The Google site describes Gmail is an \"experiment in a new kind of webmail\", and does not put a date on when it will become a full-blown service. The privately owned company is expected to float on the stock market later this year with an initial public offering of up to $25bn (\u00a313.5bn). Senator Figueroa has a track record in fighting the consumer's corner on privacy issues. She wrote California's Do Not Call law, which allows people to register their telephone number in order to stop receiving telemarketing calls."
