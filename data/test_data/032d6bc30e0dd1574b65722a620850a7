  "content": "Labour has launched a YouTube ad attacking David Cameron that is aimed at Facebook and Twitter users. The ad features clips from news broadcasts designed to show the Conservatives' track record over the last five years. It includes clips mentioning tuition fees, food banks, and the bedroom tax, concluding with a clip of David Cameron saying \"imagine what we could do with five more\". It debuted on BuzzFeed News on Thursday morning. The social media campaign's launch is designed to coincide with the \"challengers debate\", which features Ed Miliband alongside Ukip leader Nigel Farage, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, Green leader Natalie Bennet and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. The Conservatives have spent extensively on social media ads on YouTube and Facebook, which are not subject to the same spending restrictions as ads in traditional media. BuzzFeed has made a significant push on its election coverage, which has included a live video interview with David Cameron streamed over Facebook last month.",
