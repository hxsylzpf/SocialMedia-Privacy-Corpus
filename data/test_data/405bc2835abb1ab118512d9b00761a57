  "content": "Genuine excuse of the week Turns out Lil Wayne's toothache wasn't just a ruse to avoid prison; he had to get eight root canals done. Pop a cap on those molars! Video of the week Baloji Feat Konono No 1: Karibu. Belgian MC takes trip to Kinshasa. Live And Let Die meets City Of God, but with wrestling. What's not to like? Web 2.0 use of the week pleaserobme.com picks up Tweets from anyone who's just announced that they've left their homes. Consider it a warning rather than a service. This Week's Best Use Of RZA As A Tennis Judge The Wu man calls the shots as Jake Gyllenhaal whacks a ball around in Vampire Weekend's new video. Take note Wimbledon! Most Disappointing Sequel Title Of The Week The sequel to Wall Street is called Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. What, they didn't like Wall Street: Gordon's Alive? Legal high of the week First Ed Norton does stoner comedy Leaves Of Grass (playing twin brothers), now Natalie Portman's producing a girl-friendly weed movie called Best Buds. Must be something in the, um, air. Bombshell of the week \"He looks like a very nice dancer, but 'hunks' don't usually walk around with little dogs like that.\" The Daily Mail's Andrew Pierce reviews the tabloids' coverage of Cheryl Cole's alleged new love interest on Sky News.",
