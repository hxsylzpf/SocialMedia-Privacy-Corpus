  "content": "Users no longer have to take the time and effort to write \"dislike\" on Facebook posts about firings and deceased pets: the company now provides a selection of expressive images christened Reactions to use for a wider variety of occasions than simply hitting \"like\". The faces and a heart have names: Love, Haha, Wow, Sad or Angry. A video explaining the concept in greater depth was posted to Facebook's blog on Wednesday morning. Users simply hover a cursor or hold down a finger over the traditional upturned thumb and the new selection pops up. \"We understand that this is a big change, and want to be thoughtful about rolling this out,\" wrote Sammi Krug, Facebook's product manager, on the company blog. \"For more than a year we have been conducting global research including focus groups and surveys to determine what types of reactions people would want to use most. We also looked at how people are already commenting on posts and the top stickers and emoticons as signals for the types of reactions people are already using to determine which reactions to offer.\" The billion-daily-user-strong social network has been quietly market-testing Reactions since October; the worldwide rollout begins Wednesday and will likely be on every device that runs Facebook in the next few days. As of this writing it is not yet live on any of the apps on the most iOS phones in the Guardian office, though it was up and running on the mobile site and one iPhone 5S. On desktop, the button works so far works exclusively on posts, rather than comments, so it is not yet possible to \"angry\" arguing friends. Facebook will track the ways people use Reactions, and learn and iterate based on feedback. Reactions can't be removed at the moment. \"Over time we hope to learn how the different Reactions should be weighted differently by News Feed to do a better job of showing everyone the stories they most want to see,\" wrote Krug. Presumably, Facebook will also keep a close eye on people who \"haha\" one another's football team losses.",
