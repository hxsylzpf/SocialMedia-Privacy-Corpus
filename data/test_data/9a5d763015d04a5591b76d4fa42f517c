  "content": "The level of tax paid by some multinational companies operating in the UK and the schemes used to reduce the tax bills of wealthy individuals have been the subject of much recent debate, and expose a distorted concept of fairness and accountability. The Costs of Tax Abuse (PDF), by the Tax Justice Network, based on data from 145 countries, shows that tax evasion costs those nations $3.1tn annually. In the UK's case \u00a369.9bn is lost on a yearly basis in what the Tax Justice Network call the \"shadow economy\". That, they point out, represents 56% of the country's total healthcare spend. There is no regulatory or legislative barrier to corporations using techniques such as shifting profits to lower tax nations, manipulating figures to produce a loss in the UK and directing turnover to offices in tax havens. They're entirely legal practices and Britain seems legislatively impotent in addressing them. Executives commenting on tax \"efficiency\" schemes often suggest they have a moral obligation to maximise shareholder value rather than a moral obligation to pay a fair level of tax. While companies do exist to make a profit, the theory behind free market capitalism is that profits trickle down to the whole of society. This exposes a contradictory culture between corporations, reliant on consumers to buy their products, and the expectations of the tax payer, especially in an economic environment of welfare cuts, high unemployment and real wage stagnation. None of the companies involved in tax avoidance allegations has acted unlawfully, but the difference between the letter and the spirit of the law is an interpretation that often sits at odds with a company's brand image. They are often \"young\" companies purporting to embody lifestyle values, beyond consumer goods alone. Starbucks emphasises its commitment to corporate responsibility via Fairtrade suppliers and environmental standards. Google's mantra is do no evil \u2013 but does \"evil\" only refer to illegal behaviour, or is it a relative concept to those of fairness and accountability? In November 2012, the Public Accounts Committee began an enquiry into tax avoidance, following public outcry that companies had avoided nearly \u00a3900m of tax. Appearing before MPs, executives for Google, Amazon and Starbucks confirmed they had used favourable European tax jurisdictions for their UK businesses. Starbucks, for example, which has 800 outlets in UK, had reportedly paid no corporation tax up until 2012. It reported that it was making a loss in the UK despite reporting in 2007 a 15% operating profit rate. In the UK, Google has \u00a32.5bn sales, yet paid \u00a33.4m in tax in 2012. While eBay only paid \u00a31m in tax in 2011-12, despite \u00a3800m in sales. Business as usual? Accounting and accountability These are just some examples among many. There is a stark contrast with the ethical corporate image projected by these firms and the reality. They are not prepared to pay for the social infrastructure that taxation provides. Despite George Osborne's emphasis on targeting tax avoidance and evasion, recent government efforts have been nowhere near strong enough. Consumers are starting to vote with their wallets. A recent ComRes survey found a third of those surveyed said they were boycotting a company's products or services because they felt it wasn't paying its fair share of tax. In December 2012 Starbucks bowed to pressure and announced it would pay extra tax, amounting to around \u00a320m, over the next two years. However, although a petition demanded that Google pay its \"fair share\" of tax attracted nearly 40,000 signatures in just two days in August 2012, Google has declined to revise its tax practices. Morality and markets The fundamental problem is one of morality. It would be far better if these companies were honest, admitting that their motives are driven by making as much profit as possible. Instead, in the absence of these terms of debate, this is a challenge for both corporate behaviour and standards set by regulators. \u2022 This article is an edited version of a piece to be published in The Virtue of Enterprise: Responsible business for a new economy, a ResPublica essay collection arguing for business to be more responsive to social and consumer needs in a new era of accountability and transparency.
