  "content": "The year is 2003. A 19-year-old who goes by the stage name Dizzee Rascal has just won the Mercury music prize, becoming the first grime artist in history to pick up the prestigious award. Five years later, London crashes and burns. And amid the political and economic turmoil, the cultural landscape changes for ever. Opportunities dry up, funding is harder to come by and finding a creative job gets tougher and tougher. A survey carried out earlier this year by arts organisation Create London, in conjunction with the Guardian, revealed that 88% of young artists have worked for free at some point in their career. So can you make it without an expensive education, a wealthy family or a TV talent show? A Guardian Live/Create London panel discussion, chaired by the Guardian's Kieran Yates, aimed to debate just that. Did DIY culture die with Northern Rock or is there a glimmer of hope for young artists who don't want to \"sell out\"? Although they come from different walks of life, every member of the panel said they had used the concept of DIY to make it: Slix. Part of legendary crew Ruff Sqwad, whose hit Together, featuring Wiley, was pioneering on the grime scene. Tim Brinkhurst. Manager of the group Young Fathers, who won the 2014 Mercury music prize. Alex Boateng. Marketing specialist at Island Records who has featured on mix tapes with Estelle and Kano. Femi Adeyemi. Founder of award-winning NTS Radio, an online radio station that brings together diverse voices from all over London. Zillah Minx. Musician and film-maker whose documentary She's a Punk Rocker offers an insightful female perspective on the DIY punk scene. Is it harder today? Much has changed since Minx was selling records from the back of her car in 1979. How does 2015 compare? \"I think it's much harder today,\" she said. \"Venues are closing down and young people today have nowhere to go. No more squats, no more raves. \"I'm a punk; I still have places to go. We're all punks together there. I don't know what it's like for young people \u2013 they don't have such a defined scene.\" Slix was less pessimistic, believing that although physical spaces were disappearing, the rise of social media gave young people unparalleled exposure. \"To people who have been in the industry for years, they think it's harder, but for 14-year-olds whose lives revolve around Facebook and Twitter, they have something different to say,\" he said. \"Make one track and you could go viral. Just look at Stormzy.\" Boateng seemed to agree. \"It's easier and harder at the same time,\" he said. \"It's easier to get yourself out there, but it's harder because the audience has a million things to choose from. With more distractions, artists are now competing for the audience's time.\" Yet the absence of physical spaces highlights a wider point about what Yates called \"structural power\" and \"aggressive\" government intervention. The Metropolitan police, for example, regularly ask promoters and licensees to fill out form 696. To the outsider, this appears to be a routine risk assessment. But the Met has used these bureaucratic hurdles to close down live events. Controversially, an earlier version of the form asked promoters to detail the ethnic groups expected to attend an event. Therein lies the paradox, said Boateng. \"Creativity is born out of frustration, hurt and oppression. Anger makes people do some amazing things. When you listen to an MC on BBC 1Xtra, no one's going to stop it. But on pirate radio, the police could shut you down any minute. The tension gives us angst and urgency. Anger breeds organic music.\" Slix agreed, drawing on his memories of growing up alongside Dizzee Rascal. \"He walked in one day and said, 'Eh, cuz, listen to this.' By track five I was in tears. I didn't understand how someone could take so many experiences and put it on one CD. Dizzee was so far ahead of the game.\" Adeyemi pointed out that Dizzee Rascal had inspired a generation. \"Looking at the talent coming through now, I feel very optimistic about DIY culture,\" he said. How to make it in the arts? Minx was cynical, saying: \"If you haven't got money, you're not getting anywhere.\" But Brinkhurst had some constructive advice. He believes young artists need to create a \"strong aesthetic within the practicalities of their own existence\". Of course money is important: funds, however limited, are available through bodies such as the Arts Council. But Brinkhurst cautioned young people: \"Being good and having money was never enough \u2013 PR is key.\" On the eve of May's general election, the Guardian's Jonathan Jones argued that \"five more years of the Conservatives will reduce the arts to a national joke\". But our panellists were more hopeful, although cautiously so. Can you make it on your own in the arts? Yes. Is there a magic formula? No. As Brinkhurst put it, \"DIY, but do it right.\" The rest, I'm afraid, is down to you: the musician. This Guardian Live event was run in conjunction with Create London.
