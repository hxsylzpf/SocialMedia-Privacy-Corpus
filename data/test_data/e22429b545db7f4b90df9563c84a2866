  "content": "\u2022 The headline news this morning is that Twitter - yes, Twitter - is profitable. What? Well, while it has often seemed that the startup du jour was operating with a business plan cribbed from the underpant gnomes, it seems that its recent deals with Microsoft and Google have netted income of a reported $25m. Tasty, though I suspect it's still a long way from justifying the $150m+ investment pumped into the company. \u2022 It's hard to move these days without bumping into somebody spouting \"open\" as their favourite buzzword. Open source. Open platforms. Open standards. Open bars. (Well, the last one doesn't happen as often as I'd like, but I can still hope). The one thing I know whenever a big company says it believes in \"being open\" is to try and find out exactly what it thinks that means. That's Google appears to be considering that question as it sees it. In a long and rather dense blog post, senior executive Jonathan Rosenberg outlines what \"the meaning of open\" is at Googleplex. The company's motivation is \"not altruistic\" he admits - and glosses over the more secretive aspects of its activities - but he suggests that open source, open standards and open internet access are all vital for its future. \u2022 And if that was a bit heavy, here's something to much about with while the office is quiet. If you play online games at all, you've probably tried your hand at one basketball simulation or another - but this basketball game takes things further by adding a multiplayer element. It updates after each shot to show you how you compare to other players around the world. That turns a brief dalliance into something very addictive.
