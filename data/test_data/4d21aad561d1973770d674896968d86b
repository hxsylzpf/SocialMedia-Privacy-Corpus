  "content": "Pippa Middleton is just a lassie whose sister has married a prince. It is now being alleged that she \"embarrassed\" the royal family because she was photographed in a car in Paris with one Romain Rabillard, as he aimed what appeared to be a semi-automatic pistol at a freelance photographer. Here's what Rabillard's brother, Marcy de Soultrait, told the Daily Mail: \"This gun affair is very silly. It was a children's toy that the driver had in his car \u2026 The paparazzo saw the toy and he knew it was a toy, he has said so. You English need to get over it. It was just a joke that has been blown out of all proportion.\" I couldn't care less about the royal family's embarrassment. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to create it for them. That's the funny thing, isn't it? The people who proclaim themselves most royalist are always the ones seeking the most slender of opportunities to put anyone connected with the royals, even highly tangentially, on their front pages, preferably with manufactured and entirely unnecessary outrage attached. Hypocrisy isn't illegal. But it is certainly one of many things the press makes a habit of railing against, even as it indulges in it."
