  "content": "Picture the scene: the gilded (yet suitably austere) presidential palace of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, ringing with exclamations of frustration as he tries to shoehorn his eight-hour orations into 140 characters. \"Ay, maldito sea!\" he swears. It may take a while to get the hang of this, so here's a few handy hints. Keep it brief Though often ridiculed, Twitter's 140-character convention is one of its biggest benefits. When we're all swamped with more email, text messages, phone calls, instant messaging and 24/7 multimedia than we can possibly consume, the brevity of that 140-digit limit is a breath of fresh air. It's a modern haiku. If your tweet overfloweth, try using a few ampersands, cutting out superfluous exclamation marks and killing those excessive adjectives. If you're still over, you can unveil the Twitterer's secret weapon, TwitLonger: \"When you talk too much for Twitter.\" Be yourself Hugo knows that social media are designed for individuals to talk to each other, which is why it doesn't really work when organisations try and use them as a conversational tool. You want to know who it is pressing the keys, and in this case it's @chavezcandanga. We have to assume he took that mantle because some miscreant had already \"adopted\" @Hugo_Chavez: \"Twitter! I am Hugo Ch\u00e1vez! You have awakened my bunghole, and now you must pay!\" Are you listening? Twitter is a powerful way of sharing information and ideas, but works best when that discussion flows both ways. They are listening to you, Hugo, but are you listening to them? We can see that 40,000 people are following you, but you are only following one. Must try harder. Dare we suggest you take a look at President Obama's account? Following 729,000 \u2026 Be funny Let them see your human side, Hugo. It can't be all bravado and chest thumping, can it? Show us how you enjoy the sound of birdsong in the morning, or maybe share a photograph of your grandchildren playing by the sea. Heck, you could even share a few jokes. What's hot in Venezuela these days? Don't tweet in anger We've all been there \u2013 drunk, angry, needing to get something off our chests. But do yourself a diplomatic favour and don't tweet in anger, Hugo, because whatever you tweet will be on the internet for ever. As a rule of thumb, don't tweet anything you wouldn't want your mother to read. Generally speaking, it is best not to tweet anything confidential, even in a private direct message. God forbid those comments about Catholics \"not walking in path of Christ\" or oil magnates' \"luxury chalets where they perform orgies\" should leak out. Oh, hang on \u2026",
