  "content": "The Golden Globe's presentation of the Cecil B DeMille award to Woody Allen, and its accompanying tribute, has been greeted with disdain by his former partner Mia Farrow and their son Ronan. As the tribute was announced, Farrow \u2013 who had been tweeting throughout the ceremony \u2013 posted: \"Time to grab some icecream &amp; switch over to #GIRLS\" before following up with \"Nite all\". Her and Allen's son Ronan \u2013 the subject of suggestions that his actual father may have been Frank Sinatra also tweeted his disgust: \"Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?\" Ronan Farrow's message is believed to be a reference to Allen and Mia Farrow's adopted daughter Dylan, who was the subject of allegations that Allen sexually molested her as a seven year old during Farrow and Allen's custody battle after their separation. No charges were ever brought. In October 2013 the same Vanity Fair article in which Ronan's paternity was questioned contained quotes from Dylan suggesting she believed the accusation to be true. Allen did not appear at the Globes to collect his award \"for outstanding contribution to entertainment\" in person, with Annie Hall star Diane Keaton performing the honours on his behalf."
