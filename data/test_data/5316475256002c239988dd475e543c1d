  "content": "What do you do if you can't get a loan because, let's say, a credit reference company has mixed up your personal details with those of somebody living many streets away? This was exactly the difficulty facing Paul Ticher and his partner Gill Taylor when they decided to remortgage with the Nationwide. Major credit reference company Experian had amalgamated their file with that of a complete stranger, also with the surname Taylor, who lived in a street with a similar name - but hundreds of yards away and with a totally different postcode. It meant that Nationwide was unable to release the funds, and this in turn cost Paul and Gill more than \u00a3150 in extra payments on their old mortgage. Faced with the prospect of long and protracted correspondence with Experian, Ticher, a consultant and trainer on data protection issues for voluntary organisations, knew he had another route open to him. He used his rights under the Data Protection Act's Assessment procedures to ask the Information Commissioner to rule whether Experian was in breach of its legal data protection obligations. Three weeks later, the Information Commissioner's assessment came back, confirming Paul's view: Experian had indeed failed to comply with two data protection principles, requiring data to be accurate and relevant. 'Armed with that, I asked Experian to reimburse the money I had overpaid on my mortgage plus some money for associated distress,' Ticher says. Experian corrected the mistakes on the credit files and, even better, a a cheque for \u00a3300 came from the company a few weeks later. The Data Protection Act brought into UK law potentially powerful safeguards for personal data agreed at European level, but its operation remains a mystery to most people. Ticher believes the assessment process should be better known. 'It could be valuable in lots of cases - look at all the utility companies that are messing up people's accounts, for example,' he says. 'Anyone who's lost money from inaccurate data could have a claim for compensation.' He is not alone in making use of the Act. Antoinette Carter parked briefly in an empty private car park in Notting Hill Gate one Sunday afternoon to drop clothes off in a nearby charity shop. When she returned she found the car clamped. 'When the security guard came to relieve me of the \u00a3100 clamp fee, he said he'd seen me on the CCTV monitor,' she says. She paid up, but as data protection officer for the British Council, she also knew what to do next. 'They had no CCTV sign anywhere. I wrote to the company, said that this amounted to unlawful processing, and received a refund in the post a few weeks later.' Charles Oppenheim, professor of information science at Loughborough University, has an even better story to tell. He has successfully used the Data Protection Act no less than three times to sort out bureaucratic bungling, including the occasion when the loss of his old mortgage records by Abbey National threatened to jeopardise his right to a \u00a320,000 endowment policy payout. 'I wrote to the data protection manager at Abbey National and said \"You're in breach of the Act\",' he says. 'It's a very powerful weapon against large organisations, which can act like juggernauts. It needs a lot more publicity.' The challenging task of upholding the law and promoting compliance with the eight official data processing principles takes place in an office block in Wilmslow, Cheshire, where the Information Commissioner is based. By general consensus hopelessly under-resourced for the task it faces, this public agency tries to achieve results by persuasion and pressure rather than by sanc tion. It has no power to award compensation for individuals who have suffered loss. Nevertheless, the Act requires the Commissioner to make formal assessments on request from individuals who believe that data protection principles, such as data accuracy or relevance, have been breached. 'We're trying to ensure that there's good public awareness of this,' says Jonathan Bamford, assistant commissioner at the agency. He says that requests for assessment are more likely to be dealt with quickly if individuals can show that they have already tried to get companies to sort out problems and errors. He also points out that there is a right under the Act to claim compensation through the courts if people can demonstrate they have suffered damage and distress. 'The good thing about the right to assessment is that, by making a judgment, we're giving people a mechanism for them to show to the court - for them to say \"I suffered loss, therefore please award me compensation\",' he says. However, very few people appear to be using this facility. Last year, the Information Commissioner dealt with only 12,000 assessments, a figure which also includes initial public inquiries falling outside the provisions of the Act. Perhaps significantly, 20% of these assessments and inquiries concerned credit reference files, an area to which the Information Commissioner is devoting considerable resources. As Ticher's case demonstrates, invoking the assessment procedure can resolve problems without the need for court action. 'I'm really pleased with the way the system worked. 'The mechanism did seem to be there, even if it is slightly creaky, to get things sorted out,' he says. How to get your own back Adapt a letter like this to your circumstances: Data Protection Manager, The Too Big Corporation, London. Dear Sir/Madam, I have today received a letter from your organisation (ref XXXXX), threatening court action for an unpaid bill of \u00a3500. I have already advised your organisation on several occasions, most recently in my letter of 1 October, that you are confusing me with another person with a similar name. It is my opinion that you are clearly in breach of data protection principles 3 (data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive) and 4 (data must be accurate). Unless I have an adequate response from you within 14 days, I intend to contact the Information Commissioner and ask formally for an assessment to be carried out, under section 42 of the Data Protection Act 1998. I have also suffered direct financial loss and associated distress as a result of your mistake, and I reserve the right in due course to discuss compensation with you for this, as provided for under the terms of the Data Protection Act. Yours faithfully"
