  "content": "Formula one boss Max Mosley is preparing to launch a libel action against the News of the World following his privacy case victory against the tabloid yesterday, according to reports. The Times today reported that Mosley's lawyers were preparing action over the claim that Mosley took part in a \"sick Nazi orgy\". London law firm Steeles refused to comment when contacted by MediaGuardian.co.uk. But a source at the firm said \"there would be a time to talk about other things but that time is not now.\" The high court yesterday awarded Mosley \u00a360,000 in damages after ruling there was no evidence to suggest the sadomasochistic sex session he admitted taking part in had Nazi connotations. The Times said Mosley's lawyers were likely to focus on the News of the World but could also include actions in France and Germany. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857. For all other inquiries please call the main Guardian switchboard on 020 7278 2332. \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
