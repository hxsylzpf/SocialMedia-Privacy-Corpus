  "content": "A quick burst of 7 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Armenia: Citizens urged to write Wikipedia entry each - BBC News The national campaign - One Armenian, One Article - aims to raise the number and quality of articles in the Armenian language and promote the culture, an ad on EU Armenia TV says. It could even be competing with Georgia and Azerbaijan in the Wikipedia stakes. Maybe we need something like this for the coverage of notable female figures from science and history? One man, one woman. Ok, the slogan needs work. HTC's profit up, but no sign of recovery just yet &gt;&gt;&gt; CNET The Taiwan-based mobile device maker on Thursday reported (PDF) revenue of NT$65.1 billion ($2.2 billion), down from the NT$70.7 billion it generated during the same period last year. While that was a disappointment, the company was able to boost its profit to NT$2.3 billion ($76.5 million) after taxes. Lower revenue, higher profit. A leaner HTC we have on our hands, but is that enough to keep it on the straight and narrow? Dark net drugs adverts 'double in less than a year' - BBC News The number of listings offering illegal drugs for sale on the \"dark net\" appears to have more than doubled in less than a year, BBC News has learned. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) closed down the original online illegal drug market, Silk Road, in 2013. But new figures suggest the trade has actually increased since then. And other research indicates one in four British drug users has accessed hidden websites. Close one down, a dozen spring up in its place. Where have we heard that one before? Microsoft and pals applaud UK's 'Google Review' copyright move &gt;&gt;&gt; The Register The rest of Europe should follow the UK's example and get rid of copyright levies, says an EU trade group representing Microsoft, Apple, Samsung and thousands of others. Bashing a large competitor, whatever next. Martha Stewart: Why I love my drone &gt;&gt;&gt; TIME Last year, while celebrating my birthday in Maine, I was given a drone fitted with a high-definition camera. After a quick introduction to the mechanics of operating the contraption and a few words about its idiosyncrasies, I loaded the appropriate app on my iPad and went down to the beach. Well that was unexpected. Bet you didn't notice this tiny but revealing Facebook design change &gt;&gt;&gt; Quartz Facebook just made a barely perceptible change to its website. The notification icon at the top of its navigation bar is an image of a small globe, which used to show North and South America, no matter where you logged in from. Americans (and people looking at the iPhone app) still get that view, but now users in Asia, Africa, and Europe see an icon of the Eastern Hemisphere. Cute. 8 reasons that Bitcoiners are the worst possible advert for Bitcoin &gt;&gt;&gt; Us Vs Th3m Bitcoins: they get knocked down, then they get up again, but you're never going to keep them down! Well, at least according to their insanely passionate fanbase (probably including members of Chumbawumba, let's face it), who are convinced we should all give up boring old pounds and dollars, and use their exciting new cyber-money instead.
