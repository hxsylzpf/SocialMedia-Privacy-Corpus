  "content": "Plaudits to the parents of a Welsh teenager for protesting at her school's decision to install CCTV cameras in the toilets and connect them to a monitor in the staff room. Anthony and Tracy White from Llandysul, Ceredigion, described the cameras as an \"outrageous invasion\" of their daughter Jade's privacy, and have withdrawn her from school. Mr White said: \"The school is being pathetic. They don't need security cameras in toilets \u2013 certainly not in schools. \"The whole place is like they're on Big Brother. There are cameras all around the school, outside and in the corridors.\" The head of Ysgol Dyffryn Teifi, Aeron Rhys, said the cameras were installed after pupils \"expressed concern that the wash basin areas were not being respected by a small minority\" of children. Rhys claimed the cameras would target pupils involved in \"horseplay\" who misused paper towels and liquid soap. Can cameras in school toilets ever be justified \u2013 for example, to prevent bullying or violence? Or do they risk striking the wrong balance students' safety and their privacy?",
