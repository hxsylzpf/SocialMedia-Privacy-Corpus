  "content": "How much did Mark Zuckerberg reveal on CBS's 60 Minutes at the weekend? Very little. Interviewer Lesley Stahl started with an intro that could've been from Facebook for Dummies, and none of the answers revealed much that was new, or unexpected. Privacy: \"There's a sense that still, after all this time, you are not above board, that there's a hidden motive to invade our privacy take our information and use it to make money,\" asked Stahl. \"We never sell your information, and advertisers using the site never get access to your information,\" replied Zuckerberg. Some apps have shared data though, haven't they? \"It's against all of our policies for an app to ever share information. We shut them down if they do... Do we get it right all the time? No. But it's something we take seriously and every day we come to work and try to do a good job on this... It's an important thing for everyone to think about - privacy and making sure we have control of our information is one of the fundamental things on the internet.\" Redesign: 'Redesign' is a bit strong - there's been a minor tweak to profile pages that puts key information at the top of the page. Andrew Wallenstein on paidContent has been pretty blunt about the lack of newsworthiness of this; it smells like a minor peg been slapped on a general interview, and I can't help feeling there was a wasted opportunity here in poking a little deeper, or in some more unusual aspects of the company. Twelve engineers working to a tight deadline with dirty plates and toothpaste tubes on their desks... colourful, but not that enlightening. Zuckerberg is on home turf in the Facebook office, and though he seems much more confident in this interview compared to the last one three years ago his answers are media trained to the point of uselessness. The point of being chief executive is that you can say whatever you like. Could someone tell him? Google: Is Facebook on a collision course with Google? Does Facebook want to own the internet, through search? Zuckerberg is evasive again: \"People can use a product of any category either by themselves or with their friends - and most of the time people want to do those things with their friends.\" Part One: Part Two: The Social Network: Still talking about the film? Apparently so. Zuckerberg says it was wrong to characterise setting up Facebook as being about getting girls: \"I've been dating my girlfriend since before I started Facebook.\" We goet to see the real Winklevi twins walking and talking - and still bitter. The pair are appealing against the result of their case, which saw them settle out of court for $65m. They say it's about principle, and because Facebook misled them about the value of Facebook stock in the settlement. \"He pre-meditatively sandbagged us because he knew there wasn't room for two social networks at Harvard. When I was 19 I wouldn't have behaved that way,\" said one or other of them. They are, they admitted, both on Facebook. Another thing the film misrepresented, said Zuckerberg, was the importance of the Winklevoss case in the history of the firm. \"They make it seem like the lawsuit is such a big part of Facebook's history but I probably spent less than two weeks of my time worrying about this lawsuit at all. This has never been a big deal to Facebook or its evolution.\" Kara Swisher has a cameo; she disapprovingly says the Winklevi \"got $65m for one medium idea they never could have made into anything\". Stahl asks Zuckerberg to grade himself as chief executive, which of course he avoids. \"We've made a lot of mistakes along the way, possibly every mistake we could've made along the way. The most famous one was in 2006 when we had the opportunity to sell the company to Yahoo. A lot of people thought we should sell.\" Isn't it all about the IPO now? Stahl didn't mention this, but that is widely expected to happen in 2012. Current value estimated at $35-$50bn; Zuckerberg's personal wealth estimated at $6.9bn. \"A lot of people building startups or companies think that selling the company or going public is this end point - that you win when you go public. That's just not how I see it.\"",
