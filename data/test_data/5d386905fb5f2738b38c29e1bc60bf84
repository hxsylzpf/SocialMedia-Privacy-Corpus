  "content": "A US comedian upset by a journalist's tweets about his performance was arrested after allegedly assaulting him. Jokes told by Dan Nainan at the annual charity event in Washington, DC's funniest celebrity contest, did not impress Josh Rogin, a reporter with the Daily Beast. So, during Nainan's set, he tweeted a couple of critical comments, such as \"Dan Nainan was funny until he dusted off his 2005 Katrina jokes in a gratingly bad [George W Bush] impression\" and \"Dan Nainan makes his umpteenth joke about how Asians can't distinguish between letters 'L' and 'R.' Election, erection we get it.\" After he stepped off stage, Nainan approached Rogin and, according to the journalist (and a journalistic colleague), he punched him twice. Nainan was unavailable to comment, however, because he was led away by police - in handcuffs. Sources: New York magazine/US News &amp; World Report/Huffington Post",
