  "content": "Ever since he took over the editorship of the News of the World four years ago, Andy Coulson has been regarded as the golden boy of Wapping and the man most likely to be the next editor of the Sun. He took charge of the News of the World, the country's biggest-selling newspaper, at the tender age of 34, replacing Rebekah Wade when she took the reins at the Sun. Until today, it seemed almost inevitable that he would follow in her footsteps a second time and one day be given the most influential job in Rupert Murdoch's newspaper empire. His progress so far has suggested only one conclusion: apart from a brief two-month stint at the Daily Mail, he had spent his entire career at News International. Coulson came from the same showbiz journalism pedigree as another former News of the World man, Piers Morgan. Like Morgan, he edited the Sun's showbiz column Bizarre, a high-profile berth that propelled his meteoric rise. And long before Rupert Murdoch was convinced that the internet would be the future, he set up www.page3.com - the first part of the News International online empire to turn a profit. These early successes were rewarded with a plum promotion in 2000 to become Wade's deputy at the News of the World. When he got his chance to fill the hot seat three years later, Coulson cemented his reputation with a string of scoops, from David Blunkett's resignation and Mark Oaten's misadventures to exclusives about David Beckham and Sven-Goran Eriksson. A hat-trick of sex scandals involving Beckham, Eriksson and Blunkett landed the paper the coveted newspaper of the year award at the 2005 British Press Awards. But in spite of the scoops, the paper's circulation fell during his tenure, in common with rivals in the highly competitive Sunday tabloid market. A row with PR guru Max Clifford over the paper's treatment of one of his clients, Kerry Katona, also dried up one source of front-page stories. Ultimately, it was the prosecution - and today's jail sentence - of former royal editor Clive Goodman that cast a shadow over his reign and halted the golden boy's apparently inexorable rise. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
