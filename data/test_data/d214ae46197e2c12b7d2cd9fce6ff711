  "content": "Naomi Campbell has \"schemed and manipulated her public reputation and now must face the consequences,\" the high court was told today. Summing up his arguments in court today, Desmond Browne, QC for the Mirror, said the article over which the model was suing the newspaper did not show her in an unfavourable light. He said Campbell was simply annoyed her drug addiction had been exposed, not her privacy. The Streatham-born, 31-year-old model is claiming damages from the Mirror for an article that appeared last year that revealed she was a drug addict and a member of Narcotics Anonymous. It was accompanied by a photograph of her leaving the drugs counselling clinic. The Mirror QC has already accused Campbell of telling \"whoppers\" and misleading people about her drug habits. And today Mr Browne, who had earlier in the week said Campbell had \"lied on a grandiose scale both before coming into this court and during the course of her evidence\" explained that the paper had not admonished her for seeking treatment. On the contrary, he said, the Mirror had been sympathetic. \"People regard Narcotics Anonymous as a responsible form of therapy. There is no stigma attached to Narcotics Anonymous,\" he said. He drew a parallel between attending NA and staying at The Priory clinic in Roehampton, south west London, which a witness had referred to as having \"all the social stigma of skiing in Gstaad\". And Mr Browne tried to destroy Campbell's argument that she had stopped going to Narcotics Anonymous as a result of the expos\u00e9. Giving evidence on Monday, Campbell explained she had to move to America to escape the prying eye of the British press while she recovered from her addiction. She said while she had attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings in England every day before the story's publication, she had been to only four since, although she had attended meetings in \"America, Australia, Japan, Italy, France, Hungary, Czechoslovakia\". Mr Browne said today she was insecure not because of what the Mirror had done, per se, but because of her feeling that someone had betrayed her. \"Naomi Campbell constantly homed in on the feeling of insecurity that there was a mole at Narcotics Anonymous. I would accept that she was entitled to think that there may have been,\" he said. \"And she may have been right. If it were true, and it is a big if, that she felt unable to go to Narcotics Anonymous she would have suffered the same damage if without publication the Mirror had gone to her and said you should know there is someone leaking information. \"This had nothing to do with the details of her attendances. If nothing had been published she would have had exactly the same feelings of insecurity. \"What upset her was the revelation that she was a drug addict and nothing else.\" The newspaper claims that she was not entitled to the same privacy \"as the normal man or woman in the street\" who did not use the media to put forward a commercial image of themselves or talk about very intimate areas of their lives as, it claimed, Miss Campbell had done. Mr Justice Morland commented: \"Except she has lost the secret that she wanted to keep secret.\" Mr Browne said that assumed that there was secrecy or privacy in her attendance at NA which went someway beyond the anonymity she attached to NA. He said it was \"glib\" of Miss Campbell's side to argue that if the newspaper was right, Narcotics Anonymous would have to be re-christened \"Narcotics Public\". He said that the model's claim in confidentiality \"does not get off the ground\" and that there was \"wilful and dishonest\" exaggeration of the degree of her distress. On the issue of any damages Mr Browne added: \"We say that there is no question of substantial distress. Even if she was caused distress by the exposure of her addiction it did not last for more than five minutes.\" Earlier in the case the court how Campbell had told a Sunday Times journalist she was worried about the article for no more than five minutes. \"Miss Campbell has schemed, has manipulated her public reputation in the ways I submitted to you yesterday and now she must face the consequences, we say,\" said Mr Browne. Mr Browne also referred to the Radio 1 presenter's Jamie Theakston case with the the Mirror sister newspaper, the Sunday People. The radio and TV star tried to get an injunction to prevent the People's expose of his night in a Mayfair brothel. He was refused but the judge has yet to publish his grounds for his decision. Mr Justice Michael Morland, who is presiding over Campbell's action, said today he may delay his judgement until the Theakston ruling is issued."
