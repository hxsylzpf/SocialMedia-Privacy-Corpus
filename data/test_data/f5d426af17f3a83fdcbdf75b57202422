  "content": "AOL is understood to have found a buyer for Bebo, the struggling social network it bought for $850m just over two years ago. A report by technology blog Mashable said sources confirmed a potential deal but did not name the buyer. The giant technology network completed a strategic review of the site last month, and had told employees its intention was to close or sell the social network. Once the only social network that mattered to UK teens, Bebo was rapidly overtaken as Facebook expanded outside the US. AOL has not announced a deal, but also not denied one. AOL bought Bebo at the peak of its popularity in 2008 in an $850m (\u00a3750m) deal that reportedly netted nearly \u00a3300m for the British founder, Michael Birch, and his American wife. Bebo's then chief executive Joanna Shields managed a slick campaign to sell the company, focusing on attractive but ultimately low impact media projects such as Kate Modern. But after the deal was signed, AOL struggled to exploit the potential of the then three-year-old media site. A former executive told the Guardian the young site needed continued investment, but without adequate funding from AOL, the site stalled and lost ground to Facebook. The source told the Guardian that any potential buyer would be likely to pay far below AOL's acquisition price, and could be planning to strip out the site's core user data to reinforce an existing advertising platform. A reporter from the private equity blog PEHub speculated that the buyer is in Southern California. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
