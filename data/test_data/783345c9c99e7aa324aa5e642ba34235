  "content": "The home secretary was accused of backtracking today as she unveiled a revised timetable for the introduction of national identity cards. Jacqui Smith said identity cards for UK citizens working in sensitive locations would be introduced from 2009, and for people renewing their passports from 2011 - at least a year later than originally planned. She also said that from 2011 people renewing a passport would not automatically have to get an identity card, as originally mooted, but would instead have the option of collating their biometric details onto their passport. The Tories claimed the announcement, made in a speech and a ministerial statement to parliament, meant the national roll-out of identity cards had been put on hold. They also said the proposals breached a promise made by Charles Clarke, the former home secretary, not to make ID cards compulsory without a vote by MPs. But Smith insisted that she was injecting \"new momentum\" into the scheme. Under the proposals in the today's national identity scheme delivery plan: \u0095 Foreigners from outside Europe will start being issued with compulsory identity cards from November, with people likely to abuse the visa rules being targeted first \u0095 All foreigners from outside Europe applying for permission to enter or remain in the UK will have to have a card by 2011 \u0095 Britons working in high-risk locations, such as airports, will start being required to get identity cards from the second half of 2009 \u0095 Young people, especially students, will be allowed to apply for an identity card from 2010. Later in 2010 the scheme will be open to voluntary applicants of any age \u0095 From 2011/12 anyone applying for or renewing a passport will have to have their details included on the national identity register. But they will not have to have a card In her speech, Smith said she wanted \"as many people as possible to enjoy the public good of the identity scheme, as quickly as is practicable\". In response to public concerns about information on the register being lost or stolen, she said the government was designing a register \"with separate databases holding personal biographic details physically and technologically separately from biometric fingerprints and photographs\". Home Office officials said this would make it \"incredibly difficult for anyone to steal or exploit another's identity\". Smith said she expected that people would want to get an identity card because they would recognise the benefits. \"It is inconceivable, indeed, that in today's world people should not have a single, simple safe way of securing and verifying their identity,\" she said. She predicted that the popularity of the scheme would lead to it being fully rolled out by 2017, two years earlier than planned. But she also repeated the government's commitment not to make the scheme compulsory without another vote in parliament. David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said: \"Serial scandals of loss of data have destroyed people's belief in this white elephant, while major commercial companies clearly have no confidence in the project. \"Jacqui Smith should ditch the bluster and own up to the reality that this project is as far away from fruition as it has ever been.\" Dominic Grieve, the shadow attorney general, claimed the government had abandoned its plans for a national roll-out of identity cards and said today's announcements, involving cards being given to particular groups, were \"a publicity gimmick\". Grieve told Sky News: \"They are trying to identify groups where the public might say it's very good that they have identity cards.\" He claimed the government had no particular interest in the cards themselves but were more interested in the national identity database. The Conservatives were opposed to this because they did not think it was necessary, he said. \"The sensible thing to do is to use the up to \u00a318bn that we estimate that the scheme is going to cost to have better border patrols and more police. \"This will be far more productive in reducing crime and increasing our security than an national identity database.\""
