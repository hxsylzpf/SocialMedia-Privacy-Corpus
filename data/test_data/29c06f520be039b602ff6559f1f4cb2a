  "content": "Pssst ... have I got a deal for you! Send me a cheque for \u00a310 and I will sell you a 0.000001 per cent interest in NetworkerColumns Ltd, a privately held company which produces copious quantities of mildly irritating prose. I will then release a press statement announcing that we are both partners in a \u00a31bn company! Daft, isn't it? Well, it's exactly the same logic that has led the mainstream media to hail Facebook as a $15bn company - that is to say, the fifth-most valuable internet company after Google, eBay, Yahoo and Amazon. What happened is that Microsoft, after months of secret negotiations, announced it was paying $240m for a 1.6 per cent stake in Facebook. Multiply 240 million by 100, divide by 1.6 and out pops the 'valuation'. It's nonsense on stilts on several grounds. Firstly, the only rational reason for valuing Facebook at $15bn would be if its growth and revenue potentials were on a par with Google's. The harsh truth is that they're not. As the Economist pointed out in an acerbic comment last week, fantasies about Facebook's future growth are based on assuming that Metcalfe's Law - which says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users - applies to social networking sites. The problem with that assumption is that social networks probably lose value once they go beyond a certain size. They become vulnerable to Groucho's Law, which says that once everyone is allowed in, some people want to leave. Or, worse still, no longer wish to join. We're already seeing that with the launch of, for example, exclusive social networking sites such as aSmallWorld.net. That doesn't mean Facebook might not, in time, grow into quite a substantial business, just that it's unlikely to be the next Google. Microsoft wasn't the only small investor in Facebook. Industry rumours suggest two hedge funds paid equivalent amounts for similar stakes, meaning the site scooped up over $700m in cash. It was badly needed, because the service is buckling under the load of its recent growth, as anyone who has tried to upload photos to it recently will testify: it urgently needs better server infrastructure, better technical management and more software expertise; this cash infusion will help provide all three. And what does Microsoft gets for its money? Officially, the chance to sell internet ads for Facebook outside the United States. Unofficially, the chance to spit in Google's corporate eye. Magic Touch Purely in the interests of research you understand, I laid out \u00a3189 and took possession of the latest gizmo to emerge from the Steve Jobs Reality Distortion Field. It's the iPod Touch, and you can think of it as the Apple iPhone without all that annoying stuff for making voice calls. It has the same elegant glass-and-stainless-steel construction and the same touch-based user interface. As a colleague of mine said: who would have thought 10 years ago that Unix machines would wind up looking like this? The device plays music of course; that's why it's called an iPod. But that's the least interesting thing about it. The Touch is in fact the best hand-held browsing machine we have yet seen. Its capacity to render web pages and make them easily readable is simply astounding. And it does wi-fi like a native. Driving through town the other evening, I watched it pick up one domestic wireless network after another - and identify which were locked and which were not.Sending and receiving email with Google Mail was a cinch. Likewise buying music from iTunes and books from Amazon. And YouTube videos look much better on it than on a computer screen. There are some downsides, of course. The glass surface gets greasy (it is a touch interface, after all), so there will be a market for smart screen-cleaners. And there is the irritation that comes from having to admit that maybe Steve Jobs was right about the revolutionary impact of the iPhone/Touch technology. For decades, the Holy Grail of the computing industry has been the UND - the Ultimate Networked Device - because the only way to harness the potential of a ubiquitous internet is to have a small device that can always provide a window on to it. Various industries fantasised that their technology might be the basis for such a device. Newspapers, for example, thought it would be 'electronic paper', ie, a lightweight, foldable, high-resolution display. The mobile phone industry fantasised it would be a phone. Television executives fondly imagined that the magical device would be a TV. And so on ... The new iPod makes one think that perhaps, like the drunk searching for his keys under a streetlamp, we were all looking in the wrong place. As the French might say, le UND est arrive! And it plays music too. john.naughton@observer.co.uk",
