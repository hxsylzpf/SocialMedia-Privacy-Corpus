  "content": "Helicopter parents who hover over their children's lives long after they leave home are now turning to social networking sites to keep in touch with their offspring and meddle in their university life from afar, a new survey has found. According to a government commissioned poll published today, three-quarters of parents believe the latest technologies make it easier for them to keep in touch with their student children during term time. While it used to be impossible to get through on the one landline in student halls a decade ago, a poll of 1,000 parents for the Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills showed that 75% of them believe text messaging, Facebook and Skype helps them communicate more easily with their offspring. Over half of parents (52%) rely on mobile phones to stay in touch and 35% use emails, while 44% still use a landline telephone . Nearly a quarter of parents (23%) use social networking sites and internet telephony (16%) as their main way of contacting their children. Of these, nearly two-thirds (64%) are \"friends\" with their children on Facebook \u2014 enabling them to have regular contact and updates on their children's lives when they are away from home. One in ten (10%) have set up a blog to communicate with their children and 12% are using webcams. The survey found that parents living in Worcester have embraced social networking the most, with 83% becoming \"friends\" with their student children in order to stay in touch, compared with only a third (33%) of parents from Bristol. Parents in Norwich are particularly interested in using new technology to contact their student children \u2013 92% use it regularly, compared with 85% of parents in both London and Sheffield. Parents in Leicester and Oxford had higher than the average UK parent's use of text messaging, internet phones, social networking sites and emails to keep in touch with their student children. The higher education minister, David Lammy, said: \"With record numbers of young people going to university, more and more families are using new ways of communicating to stay connected with their children whilst away from home. \"New technologies have made a big impact on all our lives and as students return from the Christmas break, it's never been easier for mums and dads to stay in touch and updated on their child's progress.\"",
