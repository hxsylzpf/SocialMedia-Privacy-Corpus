  "content": "Circumstances prompt me to revisit article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, on privacy. Though this was also the subject of yesterday's blog, even as I wrote it two striking events \u2013 one in fact an important non-event \u2013 vindicated it. In the Queen's Speech there was no bill empowering the authorities to monitor all mobile telephone and email traffic in the UK; such a bill had been mooted, and I railed against it here; but it has been dropped. That was the welcome non-event. The other took place in a corner of Europe where, to our shame, we have to go for protection of our liberties because our own country will not do it for us. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled unanimously that the British practice of collecting and indefinitely keeping DNA and fingerprint data of everyone suspected of a crime, including those not charged and those acquitted, violates the right to privacy. The court used blunt language; it stated that it was \"struck by the blanket and indiscriminate nature\" of the British practice, which \"constitutes a disproportionate interference in the applicants' right for respect to private life and cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society\". Quite. There is almost certainly a connection between the Strasbourg ruling and the shelving of the communications monitoring bill; we might be getting the signal that a limit has been reached. Britain has the unpalatable reputation of leading the world in intrusions upon its citizens; we are the most snooped upon of all states, and a major reason is that we are practically a parliamentary tyranny \u2013 a single vote majority in the House of Commons can deprive us of rights in a moment. We have the House of Lords to thank for the fact that matters are not vastly worse with our civil liberties \u2013 think 42 days' detention, for example \u2013 which makes one wonder whether we are still willing to make it a clone of the House of Commons, with party whips rubber-stamping the latter's genius ideas. Naturally enough home secretary Jacqui Smith expressed her disappointment at the Strasbourg ruling, furthering her reputation as a worthy successor to David Blunkett, whom she follows as one of the most illiberal home secretaries this country has seen since the execrated 'Jix', Sir William Joynson-Hicks, in the 1920s. Jix's distaste for the Roaring Twenties lifestyle prompted him to crack down on nightclubs and to censor books by DH Lawrence and Radclyffe Hall. How different the political left was in those days! The Labour Monthly magazine for 1929 ran an article beginning: The deputation of strictly moral nobodies which waited upon Sir William Joynson-Hicks the other week may not have been aware of it but they were a sign and a portent. They urged him, fresh from suppressing a not-quite-published novel, to persevere in his self-appointed task of purging both the literature of the land and the night life of London from anything that \"might offend these my little ones\" \u2013 as the home secretary himself somewhat blasphemously quoted recently. And the piece went on to say: Before the war your patriotic Briton prided himself upon nothing so much as that Britain was the \"land of liberty\" \u2026 The continent, cluttered-up with its passport offices and its secret police, pointed the contrast; while Russia under the Tsars, with its censorship, its espionage, its raids, and its arrests for political offences, seemed, in good British eyes, the epitome of tyrannical abominations. Well, well. Who would have thought that a 1929 Labour article would, in describing the continent of then, come so close to describing the Britain of now, and under a Labour government at that. How wretchedly prescient. In Roy Jenkins in the 1960s we had the best home secretary this country has seen; his remarkable book The Labour Case (1959) would be a text of correction for Smith and Brown if they read it \u2013 and a reminder to the rest of us how authoritarian is the Blunkett Version \u2013 for that is the infected source from which Labour home policy has flowed. As Jenkins argued in that 1959 book, the first duty of a Labour government, when in office, is to observe \"the need for the state to do less to restrict personal freedom.\" And among the other desiderata for it, he went on to say, is the creation of \"a climate of opinion which is favourable to gaiety, tolerance and beauty, and unfavourable to puritanical restriction, to petty-minded disapproval, to hypocrisy and to a dreary, ugly pattern of life. A determined drive in these three directions would do as much to promote human happiness as all the 'political' legislation which any government is likely to introduce ... In the long run these things will be more important than even the most perfect of economic policies.\" When Jenkins introduced Prevention of Terrorism legislation in 1974 its full title was \"Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Bill\", with a sunset clause making it expire after a year unless renewed by parliament. That is how things should be with all liberty-interfering laws: automatically furnished with a sunset clause, requiring debate every time its renewal is mooted. Puritanical and petty-minded folk blame Jenkins for the alleged moral collapse of British society in the 1960s and since. Doubtless he was flattered by the attribution of such magical powers. But the threatened collapse of our liberties has not taken any magical powers: only authoritarian instincts and lack of principles to constrain them. And the acid is corrosive, leaking out into all spheres: for example, Ms Smith and her cohort of Erinnyes shrieking their victory in the lap-dancing clubs case (because \u2013 horrors \u2013 there is s*x and n*d*ty in the offing!) are one more portent of the return of Jix. AC Grayling will continue with a daily blog on the UDHR through to the 60th anniversary itself on December 10. The Guardian is the media partner for The Convention on Modern Liberty, taking place on Saturday February 28 2009, which will debate these and other issues. You can buy tickets here",
