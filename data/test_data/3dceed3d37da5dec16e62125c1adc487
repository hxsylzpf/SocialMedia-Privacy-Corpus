  "content": "JK Rowling has said that she felt \"duped and angry\" at the prime minister's rejection of a central recommendation of the Leveson inquiry, the statutory underpinning of a new independent press regulator. In an article for the Guardian, the Harry Potter author said she had \"thought long and hard\" about the possible consequences to her family of giving evidence to the Leveson inquiry and \"finally decided to do so because I have made every possible attempt to protect my children's privacy under the present system, and failed\". But she argued that without statutory underpinning, any new self-regulation would not work. \"If the prime minister did not wish to change the regulatory system even to the moderate, balanced and proportionate extent proposed by Lord Leveson, I am at a loss to understand why so much public money has been spent and why so many people have been asked to relive extremely painful episodes on the stand in front of millions. \"Having taken David Cameron's assurances in good faith at the outset of the inquiry he set up, I am merely one among many who feel duped and angry in its wake.\" The victims of press intrusion have refused to meet the culture secretary, Maria Miller, in anger over Cameron's reaction to the report. Miller asked to meet some victims last week, but she instead met leading figures in the Hacked Off campaign, Evan Harris and Brian Cathcart. The two pressed her to explain why the Conservatives were rejecting Leveson's proposals on statutory underpinning on principle. Harris said: \"No victim was willing to meet her and some were too angry to do so.\" The former Liberal Democrat MP also challenged the prime minister to explain why he was now opposed to underpinning by law in principle, when he had not expressed that view in his evidence to the Leveson inquiry or in the many meetings he held with victims' families. Launching a petition for implementation of the Leveson inquiry, Gerry McCann, the father of Madeleine McCann, urged the government to adopt the proposals, saying: \"This is an opportunity for our politicians to redeem themselves a bit. \"Clearly the public want it, there's been a public inquiry, a judicial review, and I think the recommendations should be implemented, there's no good reason why they shouldn't be so \u2026 that's my view and I think it's the view of most of the victims.\" \"Politicians respond to the electorate. It's the public that are the key here and I think that there is overwhelming support for this.\" Miller, speaking on the BBC, said: \"We believe absolutely on a principled basis that having underpinning legislation is not the right way to go forward, that it does leave us open to, in the future, having a piece of legislation that could be used to undermine free speech.\" She said, however, she would work with the leaders of other parties to draw up a draft bill implementing the full Leveson proposals. The Liberal Democrats issued a statement stressing that the exercise would be undertaken with an open mind, and not to prove the idea was unworkable. There had been suggestions that the culture department had already decided from previous internal work that the draft clauses would inevitably mushroom into unwieldy state regulation of the media. Miller is expected to publish drafts within a fortnight. The cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, would oversee the drafting process as an honest broker. Downing Street stressed that the newspaper industry needed to come forward with its own plans for regulation \"within months\". It was also made clear that if the industry failed to agree on an acceptable revised package, then \"the legislative stick remains an option\". Downing Street expressed frustration at the failure of some newspapers to report the degree to which Leveson had exonerated the cabinet from striking commercial deals with newspaper proprietors to win their political support. With a Commons debate on Monday, Labour tried to show flexibility to secure cross-party agreement, saying it was happy to discuss Liberal Democrat concerns about aspects of Leveson. A Labour official said: \"We want parliament to take a decision in principle \u2013 and before the end of January \u2013 that we will implement the central recommendations of the report. Parliament will have a duty to scrutinise the legislation that will then be required to ensure it is effective and fair. For instance, Lord Leveson recommended that the independent regulation be recognised by Ofcom and it is our preferred option.\" Some people, including Nick Clegg, have reservations about this role being given to OfCom. \"Lord Leveson's report accepts this role could be performed by another body but believes this role must be guaranteed by law. It is right that other options for the appropriate regulatory body backed by law are considered as we build a consensus across parties for the implementation of his central recommendations. \"Similarly, some have expressed reservations about the measures relating to data protection. This has already been raised in the cross-party talks and we are showing we are serious in our desire to build a consensus by agreeing it is right for parliament to look at the detail of these proposals.\" Conor Burns, the Tory MP behind the letter opposing any statutory underpinning, defended the prime minister's stance, saying: \"It's not about it being extreme; it's about the two positions being incompatible. \"You cannot have self-regulation of the press and have legislation at the same time. And those of us who take a very strong view on this make this point, that the government, the state, got out of the business of regulating the press in 1695, and if we pass laws to regulate the press, what is to stop a future government coming back and extending those laws of regulation? The free press is the cornerstone of a free society. \"The Leveson report states that if a newspaper refused to participate in the self-regulatory business, they would then be referred and regulated by Ofcom. It's the beginning of a process of the state being involved in deciding who can and cannot print newspapers in this country.\" Lord Hunt, the Press Complaints Committee chairman, said people needed to \"calm down for a moment, read it all through and then unite on the common ground\". He said the new regulatory body \u2013 replacing the PCC \u2013 should have powers to give \"proportionate\" fines, rather than the \u00a31m outlined in the Leveson report. Hunt said he wanted to play a part in setting up the new body, and that it could include people from the media industry, but that they should be former editors and those no longer working as journalists. \"You do need people from the industry if you are to have proper self-regulatory structures,\" he said.",
