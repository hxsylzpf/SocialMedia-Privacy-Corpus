  "content": "If you're aged between 13-33, chances are you're more digitally-savvy and globally aware than your parents. This is a perfect fit for charities, as research shows many young jobseekers don't just need passion \u2013 but digital skills too. \"I love the kind of people who work at the intersection of digital and development. I find this bunch to be consistently seeking, experimenting and reflecting,\" says Linda Raftree, founder of Kurante, a company that advises charities on technology in development. So if you want to work in global development and are a keen blogger, digital graduate or IT specialist, what digital roles are out there? And how can students and graduates break into this new sector? Web editor Writing content across online platforms is a key role for charities. \"Digital NGO professionals need one skill: writing. They need to know how to write tightly \u2013 and tell a story,\" says Christopher Endean, head of digital content at the Gavi alliance. Web roles in charities often require writing and editing skills. Sally O'Connor, head of digital at ActionAid UK, says they are essential. \"The digital team have to be ready to respond to the changing news agenda, for example if there is a disaster or emergency the digital team have to get this message out across web as soon as possible without diluting the message. \"When I'm recruiting at ActionAid the main criteria for me is that candidates show they understand good content \u2026 I look for evidence of a keen interest in blogging and social media,\" she says. Data expert There is also a role for data experts and academics in digital communications, as NGOs are beginning to use datasets for their work. \"I worked with an academic who collated mobile phone use in conflict zones and found that a rise in calls could predict disruptions of violence,\" says Michael Hammer, executive director of Intrac, a company that provides digital training for international NGOs. \"There are huge amounts of data which are useful to development work \u2013 it's just about finding new and creative ways of applying them.\" One way to find work in this field is to approach an organisation with a new data idea, according to Hammer. \"Rather than applying for internships, graduates should go to organisations with a great idea and say 'can you give me the space to develop it?' ... people need to become more enterprising with their own ideas.\" Zara Rahman, who founded the Open Development Toolkit, advises aspiring data experts to connect with organisations online. \"Use Twitter to get to know the community, organisations or area you're most interested in, write on topics that interest you, and attend events wherever possible.\" Multimedia producer For charities, providing compelling content to audiences is essential, says O'Connor. If your skills lie in editing video or audio, a multimedia role may be for you \u2013 charities need people with this skillset to help produce shareable online campaigns. \"NGOs can now record life stories in much more vivid detail \u2013 faces and relationships can be captured with greater ease than before. So there is a role for people with multimedia editing skills to help tell these stories,\" says Hammer. Emerson Povey, Amnesty International UK's communities editor, advises students gain real-world experience in media production before pursuing this career: \"Whether that's through volunteering with similar organisations or getting communications experience through student media and multimedia outlets.\" Social media editor Perhaps the biggest change to NGO communications in the past 10 years is the rise of social media. \"In communications, development professionals used to derive perspective on behalf of people in developing countries. Now these people can speak for themselves,\" says Hammer. O'Connor agrees: \"The ability to capture and publish images instantaneously across the web has empowered huge numbers of people whose voices weren't previously heard to tell their own stories to global audiences in real time: it's changed the way we get insights into people's lives, and document conflict and inequality.\" To work in this this sector, Andy Jackson, digital content manager at Christian Aid, says candidates must be able to engage with audiences by creating online conversations, and have a knack for storytelling. IT programmer/developer \"A common misconception is that people need a background in development to work for a development organisation,\" says Suzy Vickers, communications manager for WaterAid. The sector also attracts IT specialists who wish to use their skills to give something back. According to Hammer there are two types of people who go into digital development work: \"Those who have experience of the issue and ideas but lack digital skills, and IT experts who have the digital skills but may lack exposure to the issue.\" These two roles complement each other, and as charity digital budgets increase, website programmers and developers are becoming crucial to international aid work. For this digital role, a computing degree or industry experience is essential. Raftree sums up her top tips for people looking to secure one of the many new digital roles emerging in global development: \"Follow your passion and it will lead you to where you need to be. Find gaps that no one is filling and make yourself the most useful person possible.\" Editor's note: do you have a digital role in a development organisation?
