  "content": "Are the new government proposals to relax the rules preventing government departments sharing information on citizens another step toward the surveillance society? This morning's story that the move will be given a high-profile introduction by the prime minister today also exercised the Independent and the Sun. Mr Blair will announce the formation of five \"citizen panels\" with 100 members in each to examine greater exchange of personal data. John Hutton, the secretary of state for work and pensions, announced the change in a television interview yesterday when he said: \"The government already stores vast amounts of data about individual citizens but actually doesn't share it terribly intelligently across various government agencies.\" While some of those attending this morning's editorial conference could see the potential benefits of a truly intelligent system, especially in the health service, there was overriding suspicion about the security of sensitive personal information. Although this initiative is billed as simply allowing existing IT systems to talk to each other plans for a super database are still there in the background. It was suggested that this was another one of those tactical political moves to wrongfoot the Tories and the Lib Dems and make them appear in public as opposers of modernism and commonsense policies to make government more accessible to ordinary people. But the technical problems of large-scale government (and private) systems have not been solved. In some quarters the debacle of the NHS system is being talked about as the greatest IT disaster in the world. The argument about whether centralising information in one great database is more efficient has still not been settled. If the Home Office can't control the information about crimes committed by citizens abroad, which is still on paper, what hope is there for guaranteeing secure electronically-held data, asked one. And ministers give conflicting views on other proposed systems. Take ID cards, for instance. There are random predictions from different ministers about their function, about the size of the database, about its contents, and about who will be able to access it and what other databases it will talk to. The uncertainty is unsettling. As well as the problem of security the question of accuracy won't go away. It is an old chestnut about intelligence files but can just as easily apply to any other database: when inaccurate or erroneous information is entered how can it be challenged and how many parts of a system can access it and even replicate it in separate files? Governments of any hue may have an overwhelming temptation to link whatever information they have -- whether it is health, income, or security -- to make things simpler for themselves. At the same time, though, nobody has complained much about the predominance of CCTV cameras on our streets. Google and similar search engines have mines of information about our behaviour and preferences, as have store cards and loyalty schemes, banks and credit agencies. Maybe people just aren't too worried about the information held on them in the information age?",
