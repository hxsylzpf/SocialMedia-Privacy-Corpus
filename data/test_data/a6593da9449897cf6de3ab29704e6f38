  "content": "The government was owed nearly \u00a3600m in bad debts last year, according to a comprehensive database of the nation's finances released by the Treasury today. The largest release of government data in UK history revealed tens of millions of pounds lost in unpaid student loans and overpaid benefits at a time when the Labour government was getting to grips with the scale of the crisis of the public sector deficit. The data also showed that spending on consultants, in every case sanctioned by ministers, amounted to \u00a31.8bn in the last financial year. The figure suggests a substantial rise on the previous year, when official estimates put the bill at \u00a31.5bn, after several years in which Labour had reduced the consultancy bill in efficiency savings. The information, released from the Treasury spending database known as the Combined Online Information System (Coins), covers the last year of the Labour government. It is the first time the government's accounting books have been published, and follows a long-running campaign by the Guardian and campaigners for open government. The debts owed to the government included \u00a3337m at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, \u00a3285m of which came from student loans, and \u00a3241m owed to the Department for Work and Pensions, some in overpaid benefits. Initial analysis shows the government incurred a \u00a31.8bn bill for employing consultants. The Department of Health spent most (\u00a3480.4m), followed by the Department for International Development (\u00a3288.1m) and the Home Office (\u00a3194.1m). The total bill came to \u00a31,809,676,000. A broad analysis of monthly expenditure across the government in the 12 months to March this year adds some weight to the theory that the outgoing Labour government upped its spending ahead of the election \u2013 though Whitehall sources suggested that an upturn in spending in the months before the election was called in April could also be explained by departments spending their budgets before the end of the financial year. In April 2009 the monthly expenditure on resourcing the country via all government departments was \u00a354.3bn, compared with almost \u00a360bn in March this year. The data also shows the annual phenomenon of government spending activity dropping markedly during the August summer holidays \u2013 last year down to \u00a344.1bn. Initial analysis shows the government incurred a \u00a31.8bn bill for employing consultants. The Department of Health spent most (\u00a3480.4m) followed by the Department for International Development (\u00a3288.1m) and the Home Office (\u00a3194.1m). The total bill came to \u00a31,809,676,000. The debts owed to the government included \u00a3337m at the department of Business, Innovation and Skills, \u00a3285m of which came from in student loans, and \u00a3241m owed to the Department of Work and Pensions, some in overpaid benefits. Many of the labels on spending in the database are vague, raising more questions than they answer and developers analysing the data warned that in some cases it could be incomplete. The cabinet office spent \u00a36.8m on goods and services alone for members of the European parliament, for example, but it does not specify what these were. Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury said: \"For too long the previous government acted as if the public had no right to know where their hard earned taxes were spent. Today we have lifted that veil of secrecy by releasing detailed spending figures dating back to 2008.\""
