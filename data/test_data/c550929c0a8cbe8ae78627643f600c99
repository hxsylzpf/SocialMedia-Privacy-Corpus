  "content": "@LambethPalace ABC: the truth of God is the most comforting and joyful presence we can imagine, and also the most disorienting and demanding #CSWC The Archbishop of Canterbury's office live tweets the final Christmas Day address by Rowan Williams. The #CSWC hashtag stands for Christmas Starts with Christ. @JohnSentamu Now for Christmas lunch followed by Her Majesty's Christmas message. May I wish you all a wonderful Christmas. The Archbishop of York, whose sermon was also live tweeted, settles down to the rest of his Christmas Day @pontifex What family Christmas tradition from your childhood do you still remember? ... The cribs that we built in our home gave me much pleasure. We added figures each year and used moss for decoration. The pope keeps matters domestic for his first festive season on Twitter. @Richard Dawkins Just sang Christmas Carols on ship off South Georgia. Unfortunately included bogus carols such as the loathsome Jingle Bells &amp; Rudolph Even famous atheists a long way from home want their Christmases traditional. @Number10gov Photo: our Chief Mouser Larry the Cat shows off his new Santa hat: #xmas2remember David Cameron's official account brings followers a photo of a resigned Larry just about tolerating a festive hat on his head. @richardpbacon I spilled some gin onto the amplifier for my TV &amp; DVD player surround kit. It no longer works. Have you got a spare amp? Or some spare gin? @TrendsMapUK #socks is now trending in United Kingdom An automated feed of what's happening live on Twitter shows some things never change @professorgreen If you aren't wearing a Christmas jumper today, re-evaluate your entire life The London rapper's festive messages were also trending heavily on Christmas Day, most re-tweeted thousands of times @rioferdy5 Spent \u00a350 on batteries today, screwdriver hasn't been put down for 2hours ... the getting toys out and un-screwing them isn't annoying much! The Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand gives his Christmas lament @KaliaSimpson I didn't want an iPad mini. I just wanted @justinbieber tickets. :( #sad One of dozens of messages re-tweeted by the US writer Jon Hendren, or @fart, who specialises in rounding up ungrateful Christmas tweets"
