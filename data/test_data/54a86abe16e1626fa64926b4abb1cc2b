  "content": "The Max Mosley case is seen as crucial in determining the strength of an emerging privacy law based on article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. If Naomi Campbell's partial victory over the Daily Mirror created the risk of a privacy law \"by the back door\", it was forced wide open by Canadian folk singer Loreena McKennitt's successful case against a former friend who wrote a book about her in 2005, in which the judge said anything to do with relationships and sex could be protected. The News of the World will argue that the alleged Nazi element to the orgy and Mosley's position in motor racing made its disclosure in the public interest. But Mr Justice Eady has tended towards upholding privacy over freedom of speech. Newspaper lawyers fear that a verdict for Mosley will be another block in building case law that could count against them. There is another key issue. Because there had been a run of public figures gagging newspapers by successfully applying for injunctions prior to publication, the News of the World chose not to put the allegations to Mosley. That is unlikely to play favourably with the judge."
