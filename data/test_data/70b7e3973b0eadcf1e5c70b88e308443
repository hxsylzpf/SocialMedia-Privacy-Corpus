  "content": "The CIA has become the latest target of self-styled \"pirate ninja\" hackers LulzSec. The Central Intelligence Agency website was unavailable for a few minutes on Wednesday evening as the group announced the attack via Twitter: \"Tango down \u2013 cia.gov \u2013 for the lulz\". \"We are looking into these reports,\" a CIA spokeswoman said. The hackers, who describe themselves as \"the world's leaders in high-quality entertainment at your expense\", have gained international notoriety this month with a series of security breaches. Over the weekend LulzSec broke into a public website of the US Senate and released data stolen from the legislative body's computer servers. Last week they hacked the website of an unnamed NHS organisation \u2013 one of England's primary care trusts. The Department of Health said no patient's medical records were accessed during the incident, which it described it as \"a local issue\" and \"quite a low-level\" lapse in IT security. Earlier this month LulzSec broke into the website of Sony Pictures Entertainment and exposed information from 37,000 users, including names, passwords, birthdates and email addresses. It also hacked into a webserver belonging to Nintendo in the US. The name of the group is derived from \"LOL\" (laugh out loud) and \"security\". In Malaysia, at least 51 state-linked websites have been hit by cyber-attacks in recent days, the country's telecommunications regulator has confirmed. The sites are believed to have been targeted by the Anonymous group of hackers, who had threatened to disrupt Malaysian sites in protest at a crackdown on entertainment piracy."
