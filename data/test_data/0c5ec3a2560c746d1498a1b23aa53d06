  "content": "Militant Medical Nurse Description: \"This angel is pissed off. My name is Nurse Anne and I am here to talk about hospital nursing in the NHS. I am a staff nurse who is sick of working in impossible conditions.\" Sample post: \"They admit too many patients for the staffing levels to cope with and then everyone acts all surprised when people suffer and die. I have been overwhelmed and tried to refuse admissions to my ward. They came anyway. They dump them anywhere. They make us wake stable patients up at 4am to move beds, so that they can admit an acute patient from A&amp;E onto my ward. Targets might get breached otherwise!!!\" Dr Crippin Description: \"The trials and tribulations, the pleasures and pitfalls of family medicine in the modern British National Health Service.\" Sample post: \"Are patients dying unnecessarily in hospital because investigations that should have been done have not been done? Emphatically, yes. And it gets worse. The doctors are now under so much pressure to get patients out of hospital as soon as possible, that the patients sometimes do not have time to die in hospital. They die in the nursing home to which they have been unceremoniously returned.\" The Magistrate's Blog Description: \"Musings and Snippets from an English Magistrate. This blog is anonymous, and Bystander's views are his and his alone.\" Sample post: \"And isn't that just what happens with a court-ordered apology, or the current parliamentary fiasco? Almost anyone will say an insincere 'sorry' when they hope it will avert the loss of liberty, or a bag of sweets, or even a seat in Parliament.\" Taxi Tales Description: \"Tales of the life and times of a taxi driver\" Sample post: \"The guy I picked up from one of the town's main nightclubs was well drunk.... part way through the journey he suddenly woke up, sat up as straight as he could, mumbled something, opened the door and jumped out of the car. \"I stopped to make sure he was okay after he decided to jump out of a moving car and after a bit of sorting out it transpires he thought he was in an aeroplane and was ready to parachute out.\" Frank Chalk Description: \"Find out what really goes on in a modern comprehensive.\" Sample post: \"Have you had enough of gobby, pig ignorant pupils who know full well that they can do what they like in your lessons? Do you find yourself harbouring violent thoughts towards them and their wretched parents? Is the endless stream of new and ever more bizarre initiatives from the SLT getting you down to the point where you feel you can take no more?\" Random Acts Of Reality, trying to kill as few people as possible Description: \"Welcome to Random Acts Of Reality, a Blog based in London, England, written by an EMT [emergency medical technician] working for the London Ambulance Service.\" Sample post: \"All I can see is the back of her head, some blood and the shattered windscreen. All I can feel is her head, neck and shoulders and yet something tells me that she is slipping into unconsciousness. \"Cramped up in the back of the low roof van a firefighter appears beside me, he's trying to remove the metal plate that separates the two sections of the van and I have to wriggle to the side to let him see how securely it is fixed. He tells me it's going to take some time before the roof can come off.\"",
