  "content": "What's your favourite piece of technology, and how has it improved your life? At the moment my favourite is my Nokia E71 mobile phone. It's more or less similar to a BlackBerry. Ever since I've had it, it's made my life so much easier with access to emails and the net and all the other bits and bobs. When was the last time you used it, and what for? I used it five minutes ago to send an email. I'm using it all the time, either as a phone or to do email and other stuff. It's handy for Facebook and Twitter as well. What additional features would you add to it if you could? Sky+ TV \u2013 all the channels, that would be really good. Do you think it will be obsolete in 10 years' time? Probably. There are already watch-phones and stuff like that, so sooner or later we won't have to carry anything at all \u2013 we'll all have tiny gadgets in our ears. What always frustrates you about technology in general? Even though all of us have the latest phone or camera or computer or whatever, none of them are perfect \u2013 they always crash or go wrong. Sometimes they're not very helpful, such as the sat-nav not knowing where you are just as you need it. If you had one tip to give about getting the best out of new technology, what would it be? I'd say to have a look at the manual before you go ahead and use it, depending on what piece of technology it is. There's always so many options, and it's good to know what you're dealing with. Do you consider yourself to be a luddite or a nerd? I think I'm kind of in between. I do try to keep up, but I wouldn't say I'm a super-nerd. I do try my best, though. What's the most expensive piece of technology you've ever owned? Probably \u2026 hmmmm, does that include a car? Then probably my Audi A3 Sport. Mac or PC, and why? Definitely Mac \u2013 being a musician and making music, there's only one way to go. Mac's always been the leader in the creative fields, be it graphic design or video and music production. Do you still buy physical media such as CDs and DVDs, or do you download? What was your last purchase? I do a bit of both, really. I get sent loads of music for my radio show, whether it's MP3s or CDs. I buy CDs and DVDs, and download music \u2013 legally, of course. I'm not completely away from the physical media yet. I bought a few DVDs the other day \u2013 Transformers, the cartoon, I bought the box set. Robot butlers \u2013 a good idea or not? I'd say probably not \u2013 just because of the fact that technology can still malfunction, and you don't want a butler malfunctioning at the wrong time. What piece of technology would you most like to own? A time machine or a teleport machine \u2013 or one that does both. I think that could be handy.",
