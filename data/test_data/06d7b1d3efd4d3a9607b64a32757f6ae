I've joined the panel, alongside David Heath MP, Simon Davies, Shami Chakrabarti and Baroness Sue Miller, among others. We will be working to suggest extra safeguards the government can introduce to protect the rights of individuals, and hope to produce a report in the spring. The state now demands more information from people than at any time in history \u2013 what aspects of the government's use, abuse or retention of private data worry you most?"
