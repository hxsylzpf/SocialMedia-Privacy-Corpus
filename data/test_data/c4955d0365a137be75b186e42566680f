  "content": "I was tucking into a greasy burger a few weeks ago in Covent Garden's trendy MEATmarket when a crowd of hip young things wandered in. \"That guy's wearing Google Glass,\" my girlfriend observed, nodding at one of the party. \"No way,\" I said, craning my neck to see while trying to remain nonchalant. It was true. The man by the bar had a pair of neat, curious glasses on, and was remarkably casual about the fact. We finished our food speculating about the gadget and how he'd managed to blag a pair. Upon leaving I couldn't help myself and had to ask the wearer. \"Are they \u2026 ?\" \"Yes, they are.\" \"How did you manage to get a pair? Are they good?\" \"I worked on the project. And yeah, they're great.\" \"Cool. Er, is this being filmed?\" His party laughed and he assured me it wasn't recording. I thought nothing more of it and wandered home, trying to figure out whether I was jealous or concerned. Glass is undoubtedly going to be enormous. Tech evangelist Robert Scoble has already proclaimed he \"will never live a day of [his] life without it\" and has enthused about the candid snaps of his kids that Glass seamlessly collects for him. Google's own promo video shows a continuous Glass eye view of people playing sports, dancing and riding rollercoasters, all captured by Glass's built-in camera. As a gadget this is clearly hugely powerful, but as a social tool, what's it good for? It already feels like we're constantly archiving data for a documentary nobody's making (or, indeed, watching). A single visit to a major museum or gallery will confirm it: witness the crowds snapping their own versions of the Mona Lisa, to later show to whom? When do we sit down with these hours of collected footage and actually consume them? Do we need to be constantly feeding data to the bottomless cloud? It's like we're trying to validate our life experiences by obsessively documenting each moment of them as they happen. Everyone has a friend (or three) who frequently pulls out their smartphone and disappears from the pub, living room or even bedroom for a while. Imagine that friend now wears Google Glass: you won't even know when they're bored of you and watching YouTube clips instead. An enterprising procrastinator might build an app that can keep track of the conversation for you, indicating the most appropriate time to throw in a sympathetic \"Mmm, that's a pain\", to a mate having a moan. Glass makes use of Google Now to notify you about calendar appointments or travel conditions, just when you need them. It's the role of a computer to make mundane, repetitive tasks easier for us. Google might just have invented a gadget that makes thought and spontaneity automatable, too. I don't think the chap in the burger bar was filming me, although if footage of a mustard-splattered bearded bloke turns up on YouTube I'll eat my words. What I keep coming back to, though, is whether putting ourselves behind Glass will make us like those museum pieces: snapped, shared, but solitary."
