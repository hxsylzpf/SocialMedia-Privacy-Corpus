  "content": "Daniel Radcliffe may have millions of teenage fans thanks to his starring role in the Harry Potter movies. But don't expect to see him on Facebook or Twitter any time soon; indeed, he thinks that stars who play their lives out on social media shouldn't expect privacy. The Telegraph reports that the 24-year-old actor told Sky News: \"I don't have Twitter and I don't have Facebook and I think that makes things a lot easier. Because if you go on Twitter and tell everybody what you're doing moment to moment and then claim you want a private life, then no one is going to take that request seriously.\" However, that doesn't mean Radcliffe is absent from Twitter or Facebook \u2013 a brief search reveals dozen of unofficial fan club accounts offering news about the star, from the Netherlands to Thailand to Brazil, with tens of thousands of followers.",
