  "content": "Name: Conversation Topics. Age: Brand new. Appearance: Sudden, unexpected. Like you just open the Facebook Messenger app on your phone and there it is, telling you that your friend visited their allotment on Sunday and suggesting you talk to them about it. That's funny. I did visit my allotment on Sunday. How was it? Good. We had a decent crop of late raspberries, and finally got the paths weeded and covered. Any artichokes? Yes, as a matter of fact. There's a second crop coming through, which I didn't expect and \u2026 Wait a minute. How did you know about the artichokes? How do you even know I have an allotment? Conversation Topics! What? It says here that you visited your allotment 49 hours ago. It's a Conversation Topic. No it's not. It's my life. Let's talk about your life. I see you listened to some Kate Bush yesterday. Do you like her later stuff? Stop it! This is creepy. I'm just trying to have a friendly conversation. Yeah, but it makes me feel as if I'm being spied on. Well, your phone records this stuff and/or you post it to Facebook, so now I see it whenever I open its Messenger app. It seems like a good way to break the ice. I like the ice the way it is. So you mean everyone who opens Messenger can see this information about me? Not everyone. Not yet anyway. Conversation Topics appears to be a new feature launched quietly by Facebook for a few users. One reported seeing places his friends recently visited. Another saw details of the events they planned to attend or the music they were listening to. Did the friends know this? I don't think so. Although I presume they had allowed the information to be shared among their Facebook network. I should hope so! Still, the whole idea of Facebook suggesting what my friends and I should talk about is weird. It wants to increase user engagement. Why doesn't it just programme some of its famous chatbots to compare weekends? Chatbots don't spend money. Conversation Topic: Is Facebook a raving monster gradually trying to take ownership of people's lives? Conversation Topic: Do you think some people in Silicon Valley might be more comfortable with computers than human beings?"
