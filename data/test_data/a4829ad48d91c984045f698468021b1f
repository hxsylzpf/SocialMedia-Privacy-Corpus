  "content": "The Daily Mail may face prosecution in Spain for invading the privacy of a minor. It follows the paper's publication of pictures of a 10-year-old girl who had a baby with her 13-year-old cousin. Elena Chiritescu, a Romanian immigrant to Spain - and described by the Mail as a \"gipsy girl\" - gave birth to a daughter on 26 October. The father was identified as Gheorghe Mecic. According to a report on an English-language news website in Andalucia, the Seville prosecutors' office has contacted the Spanish attorney general in Madrid to explore whether legal action could, or should, be taken against the paper. Last week Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Segarra, Seville's chief prosecutor, made a request to the media to stop publishing pictures of the family's home. She also announced she was taking legal action against a newspaper in C\u00e1diz that had printed the first photos of the child. The Mail first revealed the birth on 2 November, but had few details. It was its follow-up five days later, with pictures of the couple, that appears to have upset the Seville legal authorities. The Mail did not run a picture of the baby. Source: The Olive Press"
