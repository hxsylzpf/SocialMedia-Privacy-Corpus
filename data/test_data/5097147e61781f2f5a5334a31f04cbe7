  "content": "The BBC journalist who brought #piegate to the televisual masses became the latest victim of a crackdown on the press on Wednesday when he had his Westminster pass withdrawn \u2013 thus sparking an immediate Twitter storm as well as questions in the house. Paul Lambert, a longstanding BBC producer known to lobby journalists as \"Gobby\", ran afoul of the serjeant at arms's office, which is responsible for parliamentary security, when he filmed activist Jonny May-Bowles throwing a plate of shaving foam in Rupert Murdoch's face on Tuesday. Along with other TV cameramen at the Commons culture, media and sport select committee hearing, he is understood to have followed the police and May-Bowles along Westminster corridors, something outlawed by parliamentary rules. An internet campaign, #savegobby, was launched after veteran political reporter Paul Waugh wrote about the issue on his PoliticsHome blog. Within an hour the hashtag was trending, attracting the attention of members of the culture select committee, and by 6.30pm it was reported on Twitter that the pass had been reinstated. Louise Mensch, the Conservative MP who was questioning Murdoch when May-Bowles attacked, tweeted: \"I agree with the #SaveGobby campaign. Right to report yesterday's extraordinary breach. Now is no time to curtail freedom of the press.\" Mensch subsequently raised the matter in the Commons debate on phone hacking. In a statement the BBC said it was \"looking into this matter with the house authorities and we hope it can be resolved as soon as possible\". The parliamentary press office had no comment. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
