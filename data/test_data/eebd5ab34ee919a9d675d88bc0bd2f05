  "content": "Welcome to European Data Protection Day! One wonders how the British government and its thousands of incompetent agencies plan to mark this solemn date in the Euro-calendar. Perhaps a great merger of databases and a mass exchange of solemn vows between systems, a digital version of one of those weddings presided over by the Rev Sun Myung Moon? Or maybe a huge leak to top the HRMC loss of 25 million people's details will suffice? It's anyone's guess. Mine is that Data Protection Day is unlikely to be much celebrated in a civil service that is pushing for the transformational government project and is behind the universally condemned merger of databases proposed in the coroners and justice bill by Jack Straw. But the information commissioner, Richard Thomas, is trying hard to raise awareness and has had the cute idea that all the major stakeholders (God, have I come to hate that word) go along to One Great George Street in Westminster and sign the Personal Information Promise. There is something almost satirical about the 10-point promise which asks officials to sign up to key commitments that value the personal information entrusted to them and to make sure they respect that trust; to keep personal information to a minimum and to be open with individuals about how their information is used and who it is given to. For no member of this government or civil servant could possibly sign the Personal Information Promise because it directly goes against government policies of data sharing, of refusing the public access to personal files, of having no formal means to deal with the massive number of errors contained in the systems, of allowing foreign powers access to British databases, of scooping up and storing huge amounts of unnecessary data and regarding all information collected as the state's property. Every life in this country is being picked clean by this appalling government's appetite for increasing amounts of personal information. This week the children's database ContactPoint went live and gave direct access to our children's details to more than 350,000 people. A further 630,000 people will be able to apply for information. There is some kind of disaster waiting to happen here, but the symbolic point is that the government is not allowing parents access to their own child's data. Let us hope we see the cuddly children's minister, Ed Balls, take time out of his day to sign the information commissioner's pledge but somehow I doubt he will. If he does we must all wonder how the information commissioner proposes to keep people like him up to the mark and whether there is going to be any transparent process of accountability. The point is that the government and civil service couldn't care a damn about our information because they are sure that it belongs to them."
