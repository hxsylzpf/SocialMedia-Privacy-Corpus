  "content": "\u2022 The attempt to jumpstart MySpace continues, with the announcement of a number of changes to the company's executive team. Along with news head of revenue and HR, brothers Ali and Hadi Partovi - who joined the social network with the acquisition of their company iLike - will head up business development and technology respectively. The Wall Street Journal takes a look at how the site is trying to recover its cool. \u2022 Sales of virtual goods in America alone are about to hit $1bn, according to a new report from Inside Network (story from VentureBeat). That's a drop in the water compared to virtual currency, however, which - as a feature in this week's Technology Guardian points out are very big money indeed. \u2022 Talking of which, this week's Technology Guardian supplement has hit the streets - featuring our full interview with Martha Lane Fox, a look at Taiwan's trials of smart electricity grid and a bit of musing over the role of camera phones in our lives. All that and much more for \u00a31 from your newsagent, or online here. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed."
