  "content": "Here's a prophecy. One day people will hire social media managers just as they subcontract other bits of life that they can afford not to cope with. Like mowing the lawn, getting the car washed, or paying a cleaner. We live in an outsourcing world, and social media, despite its sociable name, is just another workload. Like work, it remunerates performance with countable rewards \u2013 friends, likes, followers, connections. As a result, it is possible to say with some confidence that social media is a discipline in which I do not excel. A week can go by quite easily, forgetting to tweet. In Facebook terms, I'm a baby: barely a year old. Some colleagues count their followers alphabetically, in Ks and Ms. I have only 779. I need help. For one month, I have enlisted a social media manager. I will hand them the keys to my Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn accounts. (Can someone please remind me to change the passwords when the month is up?) Whatever my managers suggest I post or say, I will obey. But first Daisy and Tayler Cresswell, co-founders and co-directors of Liberty842, an award-winning digital media agency, want to lay down the ground rules. Daisy and Tayler won't pretend to be me. If they tweet or post for me, they'll sign the posts. \"Authenticity,\" they say. \"It's all about authenticity.\" In return, I promise not to post when drunk and to avoid fights. \"Do you want a campaign or a quick win?\" asks Daisy. I like the sound of a quick win, but this turns out to be a rhetorical question. The Cresswells quote Lady Gaga's manager, who once said, \"I'd rather know the superfans, because they're the ones who'll buy.\" It is better to improve slowly and sustainably. We draw up a list of objectives: attracting more followers and greater engagement on Twitter, more likes on Facebook, more connections on LinkedIn and, ultimately, more views for my articles. The next step is a meeting that the Cresswells affectionately describe as \"The Interrogation\". \"We want to get under the skin of you,\" Daisy says. It's a process to which clients such as Gok Wan, Alan Carr and Shirley Conran have all submitted. There is coffee on the table in Daisy's kitchen, in a converted coach house in Brighton, to ease the pain. The Cresswells want to know five things I \"absolutely love\". Cake won't do. It has to be specific, like Battenberg circa 1989. This is tricky. The busier life has got, the less specific the interests. Seven years ago I might have said 1978 Salvatore Ferragamo or the late Henry James. Now getting dressed is a necessity and the James takes too long to read. I am a person of lapsed passions. Even Goodreads has dried up: always \"reading\", never \"read\". The problem with niche interests is that, cumulatively, they look odd. Crime fiction, the window displays of hardware shops, the animal poems of Ted Hughes, the career of Francesco Totti ... Daisy grabs a giant sheet of brown paper and tapes it to her wall. The marker begins squeaking its way through this labyrinth of small passions, linking them, starbursts of sub-passions spinning off each. A map is growing. \"Anything else?\" Daisy says. I can identify a fox trail purely by smell. I ride a two-wheel bike that seats three. I have an obsession with shoulder seams. Spaghetti. Duplicate receipt books. \"What I am picking up on is the attention to detail theme,\" Daisy says, standing back and looking at the infographic, which is a sort of biographic. \"There seems to be a thing there that is really rather lovely. It's about the humble, the appreciation of small things. God is in the detail, almost.\" She and Tayler will \"go away and research online communities; we recommend infiltrating those\". In addition, the Cresswells advise, \"Be entertaining! Be yourself \u2013 share with your followers what you're up to. Post photos of activity or places \u2013 and of yourself (if you can bear it). Provide links. Reply to people who have tweeted you. Check for spelling/grammar before you post.\" I am instructed to tweet at around 5pm: 40% of my followers are online. The Cresswells also advise I change my LinkedIn profile, which currently says I work for the Canadian Guardian. I have always thought of Twitter as a sort of muttering-to-self service in which one might occasionally be overheard. But the Cresswells want me to start conversations. After I write a piece entitled \"Are you stressing out your cat?\", the Cresswells create a graphic of a giant litter tray. They email me draft tweets, addressed to feline luminaries such as @MySadCat and @ChoupettesDiary (Karl Lagerfeld's cat). As in real life, when no one replies the silence is a bit embarrassing. Unlike in real life, it's probably best not to say the same thing again, louder. A third tweet is addressed to Sarah Millican, who takes 10 pictures a day of her cat. Maybe it's stressed, suggest the Cresswells. An email arrives from them saying only, \"Sarah Millican is on Twitter NOW\", and I hit \"tweet\". But Millican is silent. In total, the cat tweets are retweeted four times, three of them by my social media managers and their agency. The next day a content plan arrives. There is something excruciating about seeing a month's worth of tweets and Facebook posts laid out on a spreadsheet. Those small passions look even smaller in a grid. \"Finished 'The Killer Inside Me' for my new crime module. Won't sleep for a week. Anyone else read Jim Thompson? #books #reading #authors\" \"I love hardware shops. I love window displays. This shop just ticks all the boxes.\" (With a picture of a favourite hardware shop.) \"Tonight @stephenfry is talking @uniofeastanglia #literaryfestival. Sad to miss it. Live link: http://bit.ly/uealfsf #heyuea\" I'm not so keen on Fry, but I let it go. Is this what my voice sounds like when it's being ventriloquised? When Liberty842 handle celebrity accounts they post in the third person, and sign off each post or tweet themselves. The idea of the content plan is to give me a chance to approve posts in advance, so the managers can get on with the job of posting: \"review it and look at the wording \u2013 would you say those things and in that way?\" I delete \"Today would have been Samuel Taylor Coleridge's birthday! Here's one of his #inspirationalquotes!\" and \"Treat every route as though it was your first time. You'll be more likely to notice the road markings and layout #cycling\". This would rule out daydreaming. It is unguessable which posts or tweets will work. Last series, the most successful tweet from Alan Carr's Chatty Man account, which the Cresswells manage, was a picture of Carr's shoes. That one tweet had a 19% engagement rate well above the average engagement of 2.4% per post of the series as a whole. Nearly 7,000 people clicked on the image. Possibly with this in mind, one of the items on the content plan asks me to post a picture of my slippers. On Twitter, the text reads: \"I love fridays. Some people have dancin shoes. I've got writin slippers. They keep me at my desk. Anyone else do similar? #writing #author\" A selfie of my slippered feet \u2013 and by slippers I mean the carpet not the fairytale variety \u2013 is probably my most mortifying moment on social media. My feet look at least 20 years older than they are. On Twitter, this post has a 3.9% engagement rate \u2013 higher than Chatty Man's average! \u2013 and on Facebook it gets 14 likes including one from my brother. Even my family can't tell it's not me. \"I predicted a couple of years ago that the social media manager would become as ubiquitous as the personal chef,\" says Robin Carey, the founder of Social Media Today. A personal chef still sounds pretty unubiquitous. Won't social media managers be more popular than that? \"Actually it has already filtered down to the small business level,\" she says. As Carey points out, \"there wasn't a social media industry\" back in 2007 when she launched her site. \"It famously wouldn't monetise.\" Even Twitter had no advertising until 2010. Now there are agencies devoted to representing social media talent, celebrities are paid to tweet product, and a whole range of analytics businesses have sprung up. TV executives reportedly take into account social media profile when hiring talent. \"The most important thing if you want to maximise your presence is to begin to virtualise your actual relationships with people,\" Carey says. \"Something as simple as tweeting after you see a friend or colleague is a great device for building up your social media presence.\" Once, when she sent a friend flowers, the friend posted a photo of the bouquet on Facebook, meaning that \"the recipient was multiplied by dozens or hundreds\". After we speak, I follow Carey on Twitter and thank her for her time. She follows back. Still there is a lot to learn. The Cresswells enrol me on Twitter analytics site SocialBro, which draws my attention to followers who are suspected bots. One is the KV Massage Oil Shop. The other is my brother. The Cresswells sign me up to Unfollowers.com, which logs the disenchanted. Over the past few months, quite a few people I follow have unfollowed me. There is only one way to find out why, so I tweet three unfollowers and ask them for their email addresses. Then I email them and ask for their help with a piece on social media. First I phone Matt Z, whom I know only from his appearance in my follower list one day. \"Hi Matt! Thanks so much for your time on the phone. I was just wondering ... You followed me some months ago, and then you unfollowed me. Was there a reason why?\" There's a long pause. \"I don't actually remember unfollowing you,\" says Matt. \"I don't actually remember doing it.\" He is saying it twice, to buy some time. \"The only people I've unfollowed are self-promoting.\" That could be me, I suggest? (If I didn't fall into that category before, I probably will now.) Maybe Matt didn't like me tweeting links to articles. \"As far as I'm concerned,\" he says, \"that's a valuable tease for content.\" Later, Matt refollows. (Hello again, Matt.) Next I call Emma Gannon, who as social media editor for The Debrief and a followee of Lena Dunham, clearly understands social media. Like Matt, she unfollowed a couple of months ago. Can she remember why? \"Ohh nooo!\" she says. \"I don't actually remember that. I don't actually think it's because of a reason.\" Sometimes you can accidentally unfollow someone, she explains. Later, Emma refollows me. This job has turned into telesales for my Twitter feed. The last person I call, Michael Hitchcock, is chief executive of Beales department stores. He remembers neither following nor unfollowing me but thinks I may not have tweeted as much about retail as he hoped. There is little I can do for Michael, unless he is interested in hardware shops. One of the Cresswells' main pieces of advice is to include photographs in tweets and posts. When I visit the British street food awards, I'm instructed to tweet the event in photographs. This proves sage advice. An image of \"Millennium Square, Leeds, getting ready for the @BritStreetFood awards tonight\" generates seven retweets and nine favourites. It is my finest hour, with 86 engagements. When the piece on street food is published, Tayler advises me to thank all my interviewees on Twitter, using their handles. This is the equivalent of Carey's bouquet. My recipients are multiplying. Most respond by following and retweeting. I have 48 new followers. All month, the previously quiet telephone flashes with notifications \u2013 likes, replies, retweets, favourites, followers. I don't know if this is success but it's certainly busy. I think this is why Jennifer Lawrence wishes to avoid social media. Using my handle, Liberty842 makes contact with an event called @hackneyhardware, retweets an image of a bear meeting a boy dressed as a bear, Elmore Leonard's writing tips and a picture of female cyclist from 1895. Liberty842 tells me when it's National Poetry Day and advises I tweet lines from a favourite poem. After the Booker winner is announced, it directs me to \"a handy list of quotes\". One Sunday I lean out of bed and check the phone to discover I follow another 70 people \u2013 as if a whole street of new neighbours has moved into the house while I slept. The poster they designed for my \"polite cycling\" manifesto draws the novelist Linda Grant into conversation. And then the month is over. So have my social media managers made a difference? The statistics are persuasive. On LinkedIn my profile views have increased and I am in the top 30% of views for all my connections. This may be because I have updated my profile: quite a few people are congratulating me on my move from the Canadian Guardian to the Guardian. Ivan Jones, whom I don't know, writes, \"Well done! Good luck with it all. Best wishes, Ivan.\" Thanks, Ivan. On Twitter I have gained 72 followers net over the month (you know you've crossed a line when you count your followers net and gross). That compares with 51 over the previous month, a rise of nearly 50%. I have tweeted 139 times (compared with 56 times the previous month), attracting 211 engagements. These include retweets, favourites, profile clicks, URL clicks, hashtag clicks, detail expands, follows and email tweets. The five articles I published between 17 September and 17 October attracted 331,000 page views combined, compared with 126,742 page views for the previous five. It is impossible to identify how much of this increase, if any, is thanks to the social media managers. But it is irrefutable that in many ways, I am now better equipped for my social media life. When I'm ready to switch all the lights on again. Disclaimer: Don't hate me. This was an experiment. @CocozzaPaula",
