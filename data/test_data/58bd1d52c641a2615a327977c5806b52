  "content": "The lifting of the 40-year-old ban on taking photos during public tours of the White House on Wednesday led to a stream of filtered shots of the president's mansion making their way to social media. Using #WhiteHouseTour - a hashtag promoted by the White House - visitors documented the inside of the \"People's House\" for the first time in decades. Since Wednesday, more than 2,500 photos have been uploaded to Instagram under the hashtag. Some took the opportunity to share the royal hues of the Blue Room, while others enjoyed the White House dogs, who greeted visitors. Many took selfies and posed in front of presidential portraits. The move is a sign that Barack Obama and his wife Michelle believe the White House should be more open and accessible in the digital age. A spokesperson from the office of the First Lady said that the ban was put into place due to old flash photography and the damaging effect extreme flash could have on artwork. With changes in camera technology, the White House can lift the ban, according to the statement. \"We want guests to enjoy the People's House. Lifting this ban will allow visitors to keep the memories of their visit to the White House for a lifetime and share them with their family and friends.\" The White House still prohibits video cameras, cameras with detachable lenses and tablets, and accessories such as tripods, monopods and selfie sticks. Phone cameras and compact still cameras with a lens no longer than 3in (7.6 cm) are allowed. Frank Sesno, director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at the George Washington University, said the new rule is a \"terrific move on many levels.\" \"It's always a good thing when the White House opens up rather than closes down,\" he said. \"Visitors will be able to take pictures and capture images in the White House amidst all that history and share that through their social networks. Anything that elevates awareness of government and citizenship and history in this country is a very good thing.\" Sesno said the move was great for citizens, but that it would not change much for journalists and advocates pushing for a more open White House. \"It won't change anything, or make anything easier,\" he said. \"We're concerned about the fundamentals of transparency. This is for tourists and visitors.\""
