  "content": "\"Who would you rather date?\" asks BeLinked's Instagram feed. The man on the left slouching in a bean bag, clutching a games console controller, or the man on the right, buttoning up a slim-fitted black suit, pouting at the camera. BeLinked markets itself as a dating app for professionals. To qualify, you must be \"ambitious, career focused and excited about life,\" says founder and CEO Max Fischer. But it has gone a step further \u2013 the dating app \"unapologetically 'weeds out' the unemployed and those with dead-end jobs\", according to its press release. Niche online dating is not new but there has been criticism from the press about BeLinked's attitude towards \"undesirables\". Fischer has been quoted saying: \"if you are unemployed or 'between jobs' you really shouldn't be spending your time dating\". But despite the PR puff around claiming to exclude less suitable suitors, there's actually no fancy algorithm that favours those on a more successful career path than others. In fact, anyone with a professional LinkedIn account can use the app. LinkedIn has come under fire in recent years for facilitating unwanted contact from people searching for more than a business connection. In 2015, British barrister Charlotte Proudman's complaint went viral when she posted a sexist comment sent to her by a senior partner in a law firm over the platform. But Fischer, who is a former investment banker, has turned the network's potential for more intimate connections into a business. He got the idea when he was approached himself. \"I noticed a woman looking at my LinkedIn page on a regular basis, through the popular 'who's viewed your profile' feature,\" he says. \"So I decided to ask her for coffee. And it turned out to be a successful dating experience. \"I realised some of my friends had been on dates through LinkedIn too \u2026 I figured if Tinder could be built on Facebook [data], maybe I could build something similar on top of LinkedIn.\" Of course, BeLinked has the benefit of users having to opt into the service, presumably because they're single and looking for love. There is no official partnership with LinkedIn, but BeLinked has permission to access its API (application programmer interface). Fischer claims there's a higher quality of user, because of the calibre of professional using the network. Of LinkedIn's 467 million users worldwide, an estimated 44% have incomes over $75,000, and 75% earn more than $50,000. Half of all users have some form of higher education. Fischer went to high school with Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen and there are similarities in the apps' interfaces. With BeLinked, users sign in using their LinkedIn accounts and build a profile based on the information the network holds, such as their first name, industry, and profile picture. This can be personalised by adding an age, extra photos, hobbies and partner preferences. Users then swipe left or right on displayed profiles, depending on whether or not they are impressed, and are told if they have any LinkedIn connections in common. Since launching just over two years ago, the BeLinked app has been downloaded in more than 100 countries, although Fischer is reluctant to reveal how many users they have today. He does say members, on average, use the app more than three times a day, for seven minutes per session. London is their fourth biggest market, beaten only by New York, Los Angeles (where Fischer is based) and San Francisco. He believes it's most popular in large cities such as these, because it's part of the culture to consider someone's job before agreeing to date them. \"Everyone's trying to gauge who you are as a person,\" he adds. \"People could say that is superficial but I've never been on a date with a woman where they didn't ask me what I did for a living.\" BeLinked is Fischer's first foray into the startup market, an endeavour he says has been filled with challenges. The firm originally launched as LinkedUp in March 2014, but rebranded as BeLinked six months later to delineate the company from the LinkedIn platform. Fischer says he's found advice from mentors, including an ex-managing editor of Forbes, helpful in navigating the entrepreneurial process. \"You have to stay hopeful and keep believing \u2026 you'll make it to the other side,\" he says. \"There's definitely been days we thought the app would run out of money \u2026 and [in the early days] the servers couldn't handle the amount of traffic. It was a good problem to have, but still a problem.\" As far as niche dating apps go, Fischer feels BeLinked's criteria are easily met and have created \"a better atmosphere of users to date. If people are looking for something real, they absolutely [need to raise the bar]. What someone does for a living or where they went to school shows a lot about someone's psychology and how good a match they might be for you in terms of life values,\" he says. \"Someone's occupation is more than 80% of what they do during the waking hours of their week and it's what they talk about when they're done with their work. It's definitely much more than just knowing what someone looks like.\" Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox."
