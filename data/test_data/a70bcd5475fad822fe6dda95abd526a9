  "content": "Biz Stone must've been a bit overwhelmed to be invited onto The Colbert Report, but it was never going to be an easy ride. But his comments don't sound like a Google takeover is imminent. When he got a word in, the Twitter co-founder said the company will experiment with money-making streams this year. \"We're going to become a strong, profitable, independent company,\" he said. \"We recognising the difference right now between profit and value, and we're building value right now. Right now we're building on value, that means extending our service globally so that more people have access to this real-time network - and not just on the internet. There are 4bn mobile phones and when we network them together it is very transformative, especially when you realise that [Twitter] works both over texting and the web. \"As we grow that network it becomes more valuable, as we add new features, make it more robust... when we get to the point where we feel we have gotten there we will experimenting with revenue models. This is not unlike the way Google approached their revenue.\" \"We're going to start experimenting this year.\" Colbert started tweeting during one of Stone's answers, just to prove a point. \"So the 'Biz' in Biz Stone doesn't stand for 'business model', I assume?\" quipped Colbert, and it got worse from there. Stone tried to defend it by saying it was the messaging service we didn't know we needed until we had it. \"That sounds like the answer to a problem we didn't know we had until I invented the answer,\" said Colbert. \u2022 Update: The vice president of Gartner research, Jeff Mann, said the attraction of Twitter is a its rapidly growing vlume of real-time comments, news and opinion - growing at 6m tweets per day. \"The culture and ambitions of Twitter and Google match,\" he said. \"The Twitter founders sold Blogger to Google earlier and work on the same principle of build first, monetise later. Other tie-ins short of an acquisition could make sense, but would be harder to sustain since Twitter already uses such open interfaces. \"It will be hard to do something that others can't replicate. Now is the time for Twitter to sell. It is at the top of its hype range now. Monetising on its own would be a long, hard slog.\" And this is about as much comment as we can expect from the horse's mouth - Stone has commented to the speculation in a blog post: \"It should come as no surprise that Twitter engages in discussions with other companies regularly and on a variety of subjects. Our goal is to build a profitable, independent company and we're just getting started.\" So now you know."
