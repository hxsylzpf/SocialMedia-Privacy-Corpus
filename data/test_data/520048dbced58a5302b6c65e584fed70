  "content": "If you count among your interests \"keeping up with friends\" and \"being yourself\", you're in the target demographic for the new messaging app Peach, which bills itself as a \"fun, simple way\" of doing just that. The competitive edge of Peach, the latest venture from the Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann, is its compelling and clickable URL (\"I'm not on Facebook, you'll find me at Peach.cool\") and a couple of nifty features such as \"magic words\" \u2013 shortcuts to certain actions such as sharing a song you are listening to. Otherwise, Peach allows you to post and comment on status updates, share links and gifs, and do just about everything else you can on just about any social network. The difference is that elsewhere you might find more than just a handful of early-adopter friends to connect with. Peach is the latest social network (or maybe just one of the latest, since they are founded with such frequency) to set its sights on replacing Facebook \u2013 12 years old this year and used by 71% of online adults. Its founders will tell you that's not the goal, that they bring something new to the table, and to an extent that's true. But it's hard to imagine Path, App.net, Slack, Ello, Google+, MySpace, Bebo, WhatsApp, This., Hi5 and the rest of them turning down more than 50 million daily active users and a market value of nearly US$245bn (A$352bn). As critics of Facebook often remark, if you aren't paying, you're the product. So what \u2013 or who \u2013 are its alternatives selling? To the complete indifference of much of the internet, Google is continuing to tweak Google+, which, for a fleeting, forgettable moment in 2012, was the \"fastest-growing network thingy ever\" (the former vice-president Vic Gundotra's words). A major update in mid-November put greater focus on its \"communities\" and \"collections\", encouraging sharing and connecting over specific interests. The announcement on Google's own Google+ page was met with almost universal negativity from commenters, but not the obvious joke (\"*crickets*\"). They had liked it the way it was. \"I don't like G+ New update,\" wrote one user, speaking for at least the six others who had upvoted his comment. \"Keep Old G+\" If life on Google+ feels akin to the rediscovery of a Lazarus species, it is only evidence of my inattention, and Facebook's ubiquity. I had let my Google+ profile languish because my friends weren't active there. For others, the fact it wasn't Facebook was reason enough to stick around. Elizabeth, a 15-year-old Pennsylvania student active in Google+ community pages, says she \"barely ever\" uses her Facebook account: \"Google+ has completely replaced Facebook in my life except for [contacting] the generations that are older in my family.\" Another user, Erin, 14, says: \"Although not many of my friends are using Google+, I find it to be a good place to express myself.\" What appeals in particular? \"I find it to be classic, simple, and free social media that's not full of people posting ridiculous selfies or grinding videos.\" But a request for active Google+ user figures, both in the heady days of 2012 and now, the start of the new epoch, draws a blank. \"Unfortunately we don't have any stats to share,\" a spokeswoman says, as though Google does not have the means to find out. Ello, a social network spoken of with promise when it launched in beta mode in August 2014, is similarly cheerily blithe. \"The Ello Press Team\" thanks me \"for reaching out\", but says it does not \"disclose user numbers. ... Cheers!\" Ello, I learn in dusting off my own account (@elloellehunt \u2013 lol, indeed), seems to have changed tack since my last and only visit. I remember it as a minimalist, text-heavy space in black and white; I find it, as is so often the case with one-time flings, newly interested in photography. Once billed as the ad-free alternative to Facebook, it now resembles Tumblr, presenting users' images in high resolution for others to repost. But its chief selling point from 2014 \u2013 that it will never advertise to users or sell their data \u2013 remains. In March last year, it staged an NSFW [not safe for work] month to protest against censorship of social media platforms. On 4 July, it added its own \"bill of rights\". Like Google+, Ello has been holding on to a network of committed daily users long after many of the early adopters have slunk back to Facebook. In announcing his \"New Year's Revolutions\", the Ello chief executive, co-founder and designer toymaker Paul Budnitz said 2015 had been about foundation-building, and 2016 was time to \"blow the roof off\". In another post, he says expanding the community is less important than growing \"the right way\". Hugh, a 16-year-old Sydney student, seems like an archetypal Ello user: creative and tech-savvy. \"My friends aren't active on Ello, although it really isn't the point.\" Since joining in April 2015, he has used it as a platform for various personal projects, such as the @elloaustralia community, which he founded in December. His latest is @climatepatrol, where he intends to post a daily photograph of the Sydney sky. It's not his first photo-a-day project; he gave up on the first after eight days. But the success or failure of an idea is less important than trying it out, he says, and Ello is a supportive environment in which to do so. Samuel, a DJ from Montreal two weeks shy of his 18th birthday, says Ello is just \"much more enjoyable to use\" than other social networks: uncluttered, simple, creative. \"On Facebook, all I see is ads, people sharing things I'm simply not interested in, etc. It's just a board full of crap.\" Lui Ferreyra, an artist with 5,000 followers on Ello, says he feels \"more and more alienated by Facebook with its ads, private info snooping and incendiary memes\". But \"unfortunately not enough of my friends have hopped on Ello yet\". Samuel has \"only a handful\" of friends on the network, but its exclusivity is part of its appeal, he says. \"The second something becomes mainstream, it's not at all enjoyable any more.\" In the meantime, Facebook remains a necessary evil for him \u2013 \"because everything is on Facebook, you need [it] to keep up with the crowds\". Seeing the bustling communities in spaces I have taken for barren leads me to reconsider my own perfunctory, even lazy use of Facebook. I wonder if I am missing out on the golden era of Peach. \"Gidday,\" I post into the vacuum. The only response is from my early-adopter friend. It is nice to catch up. We haven't spoken since I last logged on to Ello.",
