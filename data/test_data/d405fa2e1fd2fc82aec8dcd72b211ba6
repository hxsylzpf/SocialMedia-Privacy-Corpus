  "content": "A former editor of the Sun will on Friday dismiss the press industry's proposed new watchdog as \"not up to snuff\", leaving the public potentially less able to seek proper redress for the excesses of newspapers. David Yelland will urge current editors to show \"a little chink of humility\" and compromise to bring their replacement for the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) closer to the press regulation reform proposals set out by Lord Justice Leveson a year ago. He is to say he fears that otherwise press regulation will be in a \"chaotic situation\" early next year when the PCC is replaced by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso). Yelland, who edited the Sun for four and a half years until January 2003 and is now a partner at the City PR firm Brunswick, will also take aim at newspaper editors in a speech marking the first anniversary of the publication of the Leveson report on press regulation. He will accuse them of misrepresenting Leveson's proposals, censoring public debate about the industry and reform of press regulation \u2013 \"one of the great political issues of our time\" \u2013 and pursuing their vested interest, which is \"unhealthy for the country and unhealthy for journalists\". \"Those in the industry need to realise that they can't simply set up a system that has many of the flaws of the old one, run by the same people that ran the old one,\" Yelland will say, delivering the first Leveson anniversary lecture, organised by Article 19 and the Media Standards Trust. \"One year on from publication of the Leveson report it looks as though the public may soon be worse off than they were before the whole inquiry started. \"This is not just because Ipso is not up to snuff; it is because the key means of access to legal redress in media cases is about to disappear next year \u2013 as conditional fee arrangements (CFAs) or no-win no-fees are going, probably by April.\" Yelland will add that if the government's royal charter to underpin a rival system of press regulation fails and Ipso replaces the PCC early next year as the industry intends, there will be a \"chaotic situation\", without all newspapers signed up and without the support of \"victims of press abuse, civil society groups and many others\". The loss of CFAs will leave legal redress affordable only by the wealthy. \"So the next Christopher Jefferies will not be able to challenge the newspapers that falsely accused him of murder. That, it seems to me, is both unjust and deeply depressing,\" Yelland will say. He will call instead for newspaper editors to understand that they have become a vested interest, which tries to \"shout down and bully anyone who had the temerity to challenge the party line\". \"It may be that the current editors accept a chink of light into the debate, a little chink of humility,\" Yelland will say. \"If they were to do that and Ipso was updated to come closer to the Leveson plan then maybe, just maybe, a solution could be found. \"It would be intolerable if this time next year, on the second anniversary of Leveson, the public was still worse off than it was before this entire mess started.\" Ipso is supported by most newspaper and magazine publishers, although the Guardian, Financial Times and Independent have yet to sign up. No publishers have yet signed up for the rival government press regulator underpinned by royal charter."
