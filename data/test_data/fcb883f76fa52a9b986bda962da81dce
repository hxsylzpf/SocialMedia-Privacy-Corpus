  "content": "Guardian Law is a year old. Pessimists could have foreseen some of the big developments in the legal world - particularly the planned cuts to legal aid and the increasingly tense relationship between judges and the government - but who would have predicted the rise of the superinjunction? We asked our regular writers for their predictions for the next year. Joshua Rozenberg The coming year will be marked by a steady deterioration in the provision of justice. Most court users will have to wait longer for hearings in ever more distant courtrooms; more court papers will go missing; more litigants-in-person - unable to obtain legal representation - will slow down the courts even further. The judges will find it increasingly difficult to cope without adequate resources and injustices will abound. Siobhain Butterworth Libel reform, privacy law and regulation of the press will continue to make headlines while debate about the government's draft defamation bill goes on in the background. Prior restraint will go out of fashion with celebrities who won't want to spend money on gagging orders that are routinely disregarded by online gossips. We will see, as a consequence, more litigation over media intrusions into the private lives of public figures and judges will be inclined to award very substantial damages - higher even than the \u00a360,000 awarded to Max Mosley - for breaches of article 8 rights. Alex Aldridge With undergraduate tuition fees rising to \u00a39,000 next year, there'll be plenty of anxious reflections about the legal profession attracting only the independently wealthy. Law firms and barristers' chambers are likely to respond by broadening the spread of universities from which they recruit, and launching sponsored degree initiatives in the style of accountancy firm KPMG. But don't expect too much: the emptiness of the profession's pronouncements on social mobility are notorious. Law may be \"open to all\" , but lawyers are more than seven times as likely to have been privately educated than members of the general population. Neil Rose Alternative business structures should come into being on October 6, and the uncertainty and speculation about the shape of the new legal order that has gripped the profession for several years will finally begin to harden into fact. Change seems inevitable, even though nothing happens quickly in the legal world. The threat of non-traditional competition is already encouraging new approaches to the practice of law. It will be a more than fascinating year Jon Robins Many happy returns! If \"access to justice is the hallmark of the civil society,\" what does that mean? That's the single issue I hope will \"grip\" legal discourse (but suspect it won't given this week's sparsely attended debate in the Commons). Not even one in three of us is now eligible for legal aid. That's before a potentially fatal triple-whammy heading this way: the government's plan to remove \u00a3350m from a \u00a32.1bn scheme, the ongoing collapse of the not-for-profit advice sector, and the uncertain experiment of the Jackson reforms. OK, not as sexy as superinjunctions - yawn - but it's an issue that genuinely goes to the heart of a civil \u2013 and indeed - civilised society. Maya Wolfe-Robinson In the past year, we've attempted to bring you the biggest domestic legal stories, shone a light on Europe's legal landscape and covered the increasing developments in international law. At our official launch party, Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf from the international court of justice welcomed the site's potential to translate the complex and convoluted language of international law and communicate it in an immediate way. As international law cements itself in the global discourse, its role will continue to grow. I look forward to trying to keep up, and hope I'll be helped by all the courts joining the ICC on Twitter. Ros Taylor The attorney general and the lord chief justice will have to decide whether jurors who Google defendants should be prosecuted - and jurors and (some) newspapers will have to decide whether they intend to obey the law on contempt of court. Divorcing couples will try settling their differences through mediation. Some won't manage it. Some will decide to stay together after all. David Cameron will somehow manage to ignore a couple of distasteful European court of human rights judgments without having to leave the Union. Thousands of people who would have received legal aid will not, but we will hear very little of their plight."
