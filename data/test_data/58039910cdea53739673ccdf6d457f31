  "content": "The acting chief of the Metropolitan police has said the Westminster attack and other terrorist atrocities across Europe are a wake-up call to the tech industry to put its \"house in order\". Craig Mackey, who was yards away from PC Keith Palmer as he was stabbed to death by Khalid Masood in the courtyard of the Palace of Westminster, said ethical statements put out by digital giants \"had to mean something\". Encrypted messaging apps including WhatsApp have come under increased scrutiny after it emerged Masood, who killed four people and was shot dead, may have communicated on the platform moments before the attack. Websites such as YouTube, owned by Google, have also faced criticism for hosting extremist material such as Isis propaganda videos. \"I think these sorts of incidents and the others we have seen in Europe are probably a bit of a wake-up call for the industry in terms of trying to understand what it means to put your own house in order,\" he said. \"If you're going to have ethical statements and talk about operating in an ethical way it actually has to mean something.\" Mackey told the London assembly's police and crime committee there was a \"truly enormous\" amount of digital information involved in terror investigations. \"Some of that would be in secure applications; some of that would be in a variety of formats that are more easy to analyse and work with,\" he said. \"We work hard with the industry to highlight some of the challenges of these very secure applications. \"It's a challenge when you're dealing with companies that are global by their very nature because they don't always operate under the same legal framework as us. But it is something we continually push for.\" Mackey said there was a team within the Met's special operations that took down material hosted in places the force could access. The acting commissioner, who is in the top job until the incoming chief, Cressida Dick, takes up the position, said there was a rise in Islamophobic hate crime the day after the Westminster attack but it was relatively small. \"We saw a slight uplift in what we call Islamophobic incidents the day after the event but small and far smaller than we have seen in previous events,\" he said. Mackey, who was treated as a key witness to the attack before resuming his duties as acting Met chief, opened the committee hearing by paying tribute to the victims and their families."
