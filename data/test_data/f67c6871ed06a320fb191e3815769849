  "content": "The governor of Wisconsin celebrated National Sandwich Day as he does most days: by eating a ham and cheese sandwich for lunch. The internet, dripping with disdain, asked the obvious question: why? Scott Walker's social media game and questionable preference for bland, grade-school sandwiches drew widespread derision across Twitter on Thursday . Walker says he brings a brown bag lunch of two sandwiches to work most days. Luckily for Twitter, Walker posted multiple photos across his various social media accounts. The second one he tweeted was sans-Saran Wrap. As the Huffington Post's Elise Foley noted, ham and cheese do appear to be a frequent lunch \u2013 and frequent social media fodder \u2013 in the Wisconsin state capitol building. Walker observed the important national holiday this time last year as well. Other questions besides Walker's milquetoast taste in lunches have dogged the once presidential candidate's political career. In September, the Guardian obtained leaked documents showing the complex influence of corporate cash on electoral politics. Multiple Wisconsin prosecutors investigated Walker's campaign committee for what they suspected were campaign finance violations. In October the supreme court declined to re-open the case. But at least we know what the man eats, right?"
