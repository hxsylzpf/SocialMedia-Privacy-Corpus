  "content": "Ten years ago you not could predict that such a large section of the audience at a Hansard Society debate entitled \"Civil liberties: are we placing ourselves at the mercy of the state?\" would be in their 20s. But looking round committee room eight in the House of Commons, I reckoned this group represented about half the people there, which confirms my impression over the last year or so that more and more young people want to attend live events where such issues as climate change, rights, liberty and government are discussed. To be honest I am not sure the middle-aged panel consisting of the former head of the Metropolitan police, Sir Ian Blair, Peter Oborne of the Daily Mail and me lived up to their expectations. Certainly, I felt the generation gap when it came to a question about legislation that threatens illegal filesharers having their internet connections turned off by the government. None of us reacted with anything like coherence to this major concern. The debate topic seemed simple enough and I thought it would follow predictable lines, with Blair favouring New Labour's laws and the power of the state, Oborne taking a robust Tory line on the big state and me cataloguing the vast number of intrusive and authoritarian measures brought in by the government. I was wrong. Blair stuck to the line in his new book, Policing Controversy, which he summarised here; that the police have a right to participate openly in the debate about terror laws where they can bring expertise to the table. He restated his belief in the use of successive terms of detention going up to 90 days in terror cases but wouldn't engage on the broader pattern in the powers endowed to the state by Labour. These I listed as the national DNA database, which despite the unanimous ruling of the European court of human rights retained the genetic profiles of the innocent; the plans to access the data of all communications; Police Forward Intelligence Teams building a database of legitimate protesters; the automatic number plate recognition system covering all major road and tracking \"tagged\" vehicles; the eBorders scheme that will collect and store information from all journeys across UK borders; the children's databases that prohibit access by parents; the Criminal Records Bureau checks of teenagers helping out at school; and the ID card scheme that will record all the major transaction of a person's life. There are many more but we each were only given seven minutes to speak. I managed to underline one point, which I think is crucial \u2013 we have moved into an era of official mistrust and suspicion that places the individual at a considerable disadvantage in relation to the state. I described this trend as morbid and concluded that mistrust of the public would be repaid with the people's mistrust of the state. The Hansard Society podcast will allow people to judge for themselves but it seemed to me that Blair dismissed most of this as being the concern of a \"wishy-washy liberal\". He went on to condemn the people who attended the Convention on Modern Liberty earlier this year as members of the chattering classes, which means that Lord Bingham, Sir Ken MacDonald, Lord Goldsmith, Philip Pullman and Sir David Varney, Lady Kennedy, Andrew Dismore MP, Dominic Grieve MP and Chris Huhne MP can all be written off as mere chatterers. It is so easy for a man like Blair to talk about the grave threats to our security and sweep aside broader concerns about the direction taken by government and society. If he wants the police to be openly consulted on terror laws the corollary seems to be that he takes a view on the bigger patterns in legislation. Much as I warmed to him, I think he could have addressed the question set by the Hansard Society. Lest I make myself the hero of my own report, I should point out that I arrived late in committee room eight, the very room where the denouement of my latest novel is set so I should have known where it was, delivered my speech dripping with sweat and fluffed the ending. My performance was far from perfect. But when it came to Oborne's contribution, I have to say I almost swallowed my tie. Suddenly Oborne, an old-style thinking Tory, was agreeing with Blair's wishy-washy analysis of liberal concerns. He felt there was no problem with the DNA database, could not see that it jeopardised the concept of innocence and couldn't decide whether he was for or against a compulsory national database. And he could not get his head around the profoundly sinister development in the Proceeds of Crime Act, which has been secretly extended by statutory instrument so that the assets of fare dodgers can be seized alongside those of drug barons and people smugglers \u2013 its original target. As far as Oborne was concerned everything seemed OK and we were nowhere near being \"at the mercy of the state\". I guess this is a fair enough conclusion if it were not the exact opposite of what he said in a video for the Convention on Modern Liberty, which begins with him saying \"liberty in modern Britain is under threat. The state is becoming increasingly totalitarian in its attitude to private individuals and organisations.\" Compare the podcast with the video and you will witness the political columnist of the Daily Mail having a splendid argument with himself. Despite everything, it was a great evening and I hope the Hansard Society puts on many more debates. The audience is out there.",
