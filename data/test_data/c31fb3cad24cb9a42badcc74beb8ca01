  "content": "It's been called the YouTube election but it could equally go down as the Twitter election, as tens of thousands of micro bloggers report their individual experiences of voting, on the Twitter vote report. \"Never before have voters had the ability to harness so much technology to empower themselves on Election Day,\" says Baltimore Sun. Most say voting is going smoothly. \"Nice and easy plus a bake sale!\" says Greg from Valley Stream, New York. But problems are being reported. \"I waited before they opened for 1.5 hr and had to wait as they fixed an issue with the vote counting machine,\" says michaelruby from Berkeley, California. \"Voting machines down in Florida,\" says philipn with a link to a video report of computer problems. But this being Twitter the site itself has had its share of computer problems, as it has become over loaded with users. And how are they voting? As Chris says: \"Twitter is Obama country.\""
