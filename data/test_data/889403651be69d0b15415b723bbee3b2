  "content": "In celebration of its eighth birthday, Twitter is offering users the chance to take a trip down memory lane, by looking up their very first tweet on the site. The company has launched First-Tweets.com, letting every user rediscover what was on their mind as they joined the social network. The results range from the banal: to the confused: Taking in the mandatory food tweets: (Jemima Kiss comments: \"I actually remember that lunch, it really was amazing\") And, very occasionally, something actually interesting: It's fair to say that the majority of twitter users didn't really have much of an idea what the site was when they signed up. But then, even the very first tweet ever was rather more inward looking than you'd get away with these days: At least most people's first tweets don't attract quite as much abuse as this one: What was your first tweet? How does it look in hindsight? Can you bear to find out?",
