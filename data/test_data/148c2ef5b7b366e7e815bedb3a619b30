  "content": "Memo: To all staff at Channel 8 From: Rupert Sawyer, chief executive Subject: A testimony from the very top An enthusiastic and inquisitive young member of the Channel 8 staff interrupted my tom yum soup break this week to ask me, \"Mr Sawyer, sir, what exactly is your job?\" Thank you, I thought to myself as I called security to have him removed from the building to have the gross insubordination beaten out of him \u2013 thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain \u2026 You see, while seemingly every insignificant Paul, Des and Harry of the media world appears to have had their day at court courtesy of Lord Justice Leveson \u2013 one name has remained suspiciously absent from the enquiry's list \u2013 that of a certain Rupert Sawyer CEO. And so, for those eager to know my thoughts on the role of a media tycoon, consider this my testimony. The truth is my job is as complex as a Doctor Who plot written by Steven Moffat and as difficult to understand as the appeal of Call the Midwife. I am the editor-in-chief of a huge number of titles, channels and websites ranging from the mid-market to the borderline pornographic \u2013 put bluntly, they're all just accessible, good-natured fun for real people. But who are those who call their validity into question and hope to \"regulate\" them? They are lords and lawyers who's idea of popular culture is a long-winded feature about Charles Dickens at 200 in the Telegraph or the Guardian. Firstly, one thing Dickens certainly is not, is 200 (he's deeply dead), and secondly, his work is a perfect example of why nothing created before 1950 is worth worrying about, it's rubbish. These busybodies don't understand how the real media world operates. They probably think an \"up-skirt\" is a costume in Downton Abbey and a tea bag is something you use to make a drink \u2013 they've probably never even heard of The Real Lord of the Rings, the groundbreaking Channel 8 ob-doc that follows the fortunes of a ferociously promiscuous homosexual owner of an East London second-hand jewellers \u2013 \"pawn by day, porn by night\". No, what these people don't see is that to keep Channel 8's many plates spinning I'm required to not only personally interfere in the editorial process of every one of my publications \u2013 I need to maintain consistency by imposing my own world view on my editors, writers, columnists and ancillary staff. Do you think Channel 8's pinup favourite Anna Shagalot really enjoys bathing in cream of tomato soup during Sex Chat Live? Do you think Daily Espresso financial columnist Gordon Hound personally believes the European Central Bank has a secret lair hiding Nazi war criminals underneath it? No \u2013 they do what I say, because that's how this business works. But where do you take your lead from, Rupert? I have two sources: popular micro-blog Twitter and ancient Vietnamese proverbs. First I find what the people are interested in, then I form an opinion for my publications on it. Allow me to demonstrate: Benedict Cumberbatch is trending on Twitter. My Vietnamese proverb-a-day toilet paper reads \"Kh\u00f4ng c\u00f3 v\u1ea5n \u0111\u1ec1 n\u00f3 l\u00e0 nh\u01b0 th\u1ebf n\u00e0o s\u1eafc n\u00e9t, m\u1ed9t con dao s\u1ebd kh\u00f4ng bao gi\u1edd c\u1eaft x\u1eed l\u00fd ri\u00eang c\u1ee7a n\u00f3\" (\"No matter how sharp it is, a knife will never cut its own handle.\") \u2013 the resulting angle: \"Sherlock to be axed in BBC budget cuts\". It really is very simple when you know how. Of course in the past I might have run this in the Daily Post or on the Channel 8 website \u2013 but today of course, people just want the facts \u2026 and fast. But while my competitors continue to ban their employees from saying anything useful on Twitter (and in some cases are reducing their own salaries voluntarily, I mean, what does that say about the state of your empire?) \u2013 I have a more forward thinking plan. That is why from today I insist that all Channel 8 journalists operate the \"tweet before you file\" protocol as standard. If there's news, we'll break it, and we'll worry about how to make money from it later \u2013 after all Hanoi wasn't built in a day. In addition I'd like to announce the immediate closure of the Channel 8 News website with the net loss of 150 jobs. Yes, my manifesto is simple. Keep the people happy, and do it fast. As long as you, my staff continue to follow that simple formula, you \u2013 and the company \u2013 will continue to prosper in these ever-increasingly turbulent times. You can keep your Leveson inquiry \u2013 nothing useful will come from that. Everything you need to know about running a media empire with high standards and impeccable ethics is laid out here, and just you remember that. Yours, Rupert PS I will be away next week as I'm attending a pro-celebrity cross-stitch event in Gibraltar PPS I cannot urge you enough NOT to buy my unofficial biography Digital Economy or Bust, published by my nemesis at the Guardian."
