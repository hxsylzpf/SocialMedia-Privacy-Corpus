  "content": "\u2022 National DNA database Profiles on four million people, over half of whom are innocent. Lists 39,000 children and nearly 40% of all young, black men in England under 35. Ruled unlawful by European court of human rights. \u2022 National identity register Designed to store biometric and administrative data linked to ID card use. Will contain an audit trail of citizens' interaction with services. Intelligence agencies and police get largely unrestricted access. \u2022 ContactPoint Index of all children in England. Complements the adult ID register. Inadequate security, privacy concerns and no effective opt-out. \u2022 NHS detailed care record Holds GP and hospital records in remote servers; care providers can add comments, without proper accountability. Secondary user service holds summaries of other treatments to help NHS research. Lack of opt-out contravenes human rights and data protection laws. \u2022 Common assessment framework Children's welfare needs; can include sensitive and subjective information. \u2022 ONSET Tries to predict which children could become criminals; triggered by referrals to a youth offending team. \u2022 Work and Pensions department data sharing To hold 85m records, will be one of the largest databases in Europe. Based on national insurance numbers. Could be linked to ID register. \u2022 Audit Commission's fraud scheme Under Serious and Organised Crime Act (2007) is absolved from confidentiality breaches. \u2022 Home Office's interception modernisation programme Will track all email, text and internet traffic; covers itemised phone bills and mobiles. \u2022 Treaty of Pr\u00fcm framework Allows law enforcement information to be shared between EU member states without proper data protection."
