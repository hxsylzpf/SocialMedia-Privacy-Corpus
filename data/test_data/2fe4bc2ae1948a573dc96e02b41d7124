  "content": "A senior Facebook executive has said that half its UK advertisers have no problem with the social networking website, despite the row over ads appearing on the British National Party group page. Owen Van Natta, the Facebook chief operating officer, told MediaGuardian.co.uk that the \"vast majority of content [on the site] is safe\" and advertisers \"want to be associated with it\". Mr Van Natta said that in response to a number of UK brands quitting the site last week after it emerged that their ads were appearing on the BNP's Facebook page, the company had introduced a fix allowing advertisers to opt out of the group section of the website. He added that the company had been surprised at the attention given to the story and said that no US advertiser had raised the problem. \"It's definitely confusing, and creates work for us in explaining what is really happening on the site,\" said Mr Van Natta. \"The vast majority of content is safe, and advertisers want to be associated with it,\" he added. Facebook has now introduced a \"small, easy, fix\", he said, that allows advertisers to opt out of the group section of the site completely. Mr Van Natta added that the site had informed all its UK advertisers and agencies about this development. \"Fundamentally we want to make sure that we give advertisers the same controls as users,\" he said. \"If there are areas of the site that they don't want to be on, that don't represent their brand image, we'll give them the opportunity not to show ads there. \"Some have chosen to opt out of groups and some have chosen to continue their campaign, but half of all companies in the UK have had no questions or queries about the issue and in the US it hasn't been a problem at all.\" Vodafone, First Direct, Halifax, Prudential, Virgin Media and the AA all pulled advertising from the site after the BNP page row erupted and the government instructed its advertising body, the Central Office of Information, to confirm that ads would not appear on social networking sites. A spokeswoman for Vodafone confirmed that the company's media buying agency had been informed that it could opt out of the group section on the site. The company was in \"continuous dialogue\" with Facebook about reintroducing its adverts, but would not give a date, she added. A spokeswoman for Virgin Media could not confirm when the firm would be advertising on Facebook again. But she said that Virgin Media was using it as an opportunity to \"step back and think of the issue at a higher level\". She added: \"We're encouraged to see some sites acknowledging that advertisers need extra measures so we can retain control over our brand online\". Facebook wants to continue its \"organic growth\" internationally by rolling out localised versions. Mr Van Natta would not detail which language versions are being developed for the site, but said the site would aim to \"fit the local experience and map closely to the culture\". That could mean developing and tailoring applications and features to appeal to different regional groups. Different social networking sites have had success in different markets, such as Orkut in Brazil and Friendster in south-east Asia. \"The most powerful and important differentiator is that Facebook is an intersection of real world lives, and maps to social norms. Part of that organic growth has been down to that authenticity,\" Mr Van Natta said. \"There's no room for fantasy or role play. The point is to give people a suit of productivity tools that enable them to communicate better.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
