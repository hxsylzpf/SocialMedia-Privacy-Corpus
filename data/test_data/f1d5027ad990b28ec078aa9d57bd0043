  "content": "If the first appearance of Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary on Twitter was part of the ongoing attempt to fashion his new, humble, non-macho image, it was not an unqualified success. Posing before his laptop in a green hat and leprechaun beard with his thumbs up, the signs were that O'Leary was never going to adopt quite the tone other companies take on Twitter. Using the official Ryanair Twitter account \u2013 its profile illustrated by six women in bikinis standing in front of a plane \u2013 O'Leary's early replies to female questioners included \"Nice pic. Phwoaaarr! MOL\", followed by references to the size of his \"balls\" and comparing himself to Jesus. Perhaps inspired by the ill-fated attempts of British Gas and the Bank of England to engage with customers and the public via social media, Ryanair advertised its chief executive's appearance for an hour-long Twitter chat under the hashtag #grillMOL. But replies only became easily visible to non-participants some 26 minutes into the chat when the airline got to grips with Twitter conventions and remembered its own hashtag. O'Leary has previously made no secret of his contempt for Twitter users. But, as the boss of an airline that spends a fraction of rivals' budgets on marketing, he has long understood the value of free publicity \u2013 good or bad. The appearance on Twitter marked a new stage in O'Leary's unlikely conversion from aviation's most hated man to a champion of customer service. At a shareholders meeting last month in Dublin, O'Leary conceded that the airline he had made in his image had a problem, and that Ryanair should make a new effort not to \"unnecessarily piss people off\". Despite the expectation of hostile tweets towards the boss of an airline renowned for upsetting its customers, O'Leary fielded almost as many compliments as abusive messages. He did, however, rule out following up his newfound interest in social media by joining Facebook, telling one questioner: \"Sorry, no friends so no Facebook for me.\" O'Leary had, on some counts, mellowed, at no point directly abusing his public, even when questioned about his airline's policy of charging \u00a340 to reprint boarding passes. O'Leary merely explained: \"Cos we want u to print it off before arriving at airport. Wud u show up w'out passport?\" But another Twitter user was even told a refund might be possible. \"Write to me at Ryanair HQ, Dublin Airport. You get refund if you entitled to it\". One questioner asked if he had read the book The Tipping Point, adding \"Would you agree you've reached the point where customers no longer trust you?\" O'Leary was typically bullish: \"Sorry, can't read, can barely write. 81m customers would disagree with you.\" For a man who has long claimed that the only true measure of customer satisfaction is how many people book, that figure remains the bottom line. As he put it: \"Call me genius, Jesus, Superman, or odious little s**t, whatever takes your fancy as long as you fly Ryanair!\""
