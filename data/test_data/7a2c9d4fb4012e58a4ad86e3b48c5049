  "content": "Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP, the world's largest advertising company, has struck a global partnership with Twitter to exploit user data for its clients. WPP said that the strategic partnership will focus on data and analytics \u2013 what the company calls its \"data-driven marketing\" approach \u2013 and comes weeks after French rival Publicis Groupe sealed an advertising deal potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Under the terms of the deal a range of WPP companies, from its market research division to global media buying arm Group M, will increase the amount of Twitter data they use to drive \"more effective campaigns, enhanced targeting and more real-time insight to clients\". \"Twitter's relevance continues to grow \u2013 not only as a social platform, but also as a window into consumer attitudes and behaviour in real time,\" said Sorrell, chief executive of WPP. \"We are delighted to announce this very wide-ranging strategic partnership and to ensure that Twitter data is a key ingredient in many of our disciplines. We look forward to leveraging the platform in a variety of ways for our clients around the world.\" The partnership will also see the launch of new data products and services, and the integration of Twitter data into various WPP media and analytical tools. \"As Twitter has grown, marketers are leveraging the platform for brand insights, relevant real-time messaging, and customer research,\" said Dick Costolo, chief executive of Twitter. WPP said that the partnership also reflects, and will help develop, Group M's advertising investment on behalf of clients on Twitter campaigns. In April Sorrell accused Twitter of being a \"media owner masquerading as a tech company\". He said that last year WPP spent about $500m of client ad money on AOL/Yahoo and about $200m on Facebook, a huge boost on the previous year's $200m. He said that the spend on Twitter was \"very much smaller\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
