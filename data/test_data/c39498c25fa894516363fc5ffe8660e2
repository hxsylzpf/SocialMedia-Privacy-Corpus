  "content": "I am highly concerned about the tweeter who picked Holden Caulfield as the fictional character they'd most like to marry. Do you really think he'd make good husband material? Because I don't. But put him alongside Christian Grey, or Legolas, or Edward Cullen \u2013 all other suggestions as the #FictionalCharactersIWantToMarry hashtag became one of the top trending topics on Twitter yesterday \u2013 and he starts to look a better option. At least Holden's not a violent sadist, or a vampire, or an elf. And he does love his sister. Female characters with whom tweeters were keen to walk down the aisle were in shorter supply, and one hopes those who mentioned Hermione Granger, Luna Lovegood or Dora the Explorer were tweeting from their parents' computers. But really, people \u2013 Sophie Neveu from the Da Vinci Code? Although I guess she is descended from the divine, which would add a bit of intrigue to the family tree. Wedding a fictional creation is an extremely serious issue, and one I've pondered before. Then, I mentioned Georgette Heyer heroes, Rhett Butler and Gilbert from Anne of Green Gables. Today, I'm feeling more in the mood for a bit of French piracy, topped off with a little philosophy. Enter Jean-Benoit Aub\u00e9ry, stage left. But how about you?"
