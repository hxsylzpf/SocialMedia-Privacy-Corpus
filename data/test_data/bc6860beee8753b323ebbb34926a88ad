  "content": "There's no shortage of choice if you want to search the web, but most people stick with one, or at most two. In the US, the most diverse market, the research company Compete gives the rankings as Google 74%, Yahoo 16%, Microsoft's Bing 6%, Ask 2% and AOL (powered by Google) 1%. That leaves about 1% for the rest to squabble over, though that still translates into 100m searches in one month alone \u2013 and that's only in the US. Worldwide, in the past quarter Google has more than 80% of searches, while Yahoo and Bing have 9% and 5% respectively, a situation Microsoft hopes to change next year. But there are many other search engines for the web. Altavista, Excite and Lycos \u2013 ancient names from the 1990s \u2013 collectively still have about 0.1% of the market globally. It's the new names, though, that are raising interest. Cuil, launched by ex-Googlers to great fanfare in July 2008, has gained little traction since. Wolfram Alpha describes itself as a \"web resource\" whose aim is to \"make the world's knowledge computable\" \u2013 in effect, be a search engine that can be accessed by computer programs rather than humans. Other specialist search engines include Scour, Clusty (which \"clusters\" results), and, for those who want a visual presentation, Kartoo. Nationally, Yandex in Russia and Baidu in China far exceed Google for market share, but are almost unused outside those countries. However, there is one \"search\" that Google covets more than any other: Twitter's. Though the archive of what has been said on the fast-growing message service now barely stretch back a fortnight, Google executives have repeatedly expressed a desire to integrate what Twitter knows about current events into their search engine. Rumours of a linkup persist; it will be interesting to see whether the Microsoft-Yahoo tie-up prompts Google into a similar marriage with Twitter."
