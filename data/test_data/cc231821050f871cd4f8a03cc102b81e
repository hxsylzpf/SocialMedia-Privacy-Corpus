  "content": "Reading on mobile? Click here to watch The Ashton Kutcher-starring biopic of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs has rather dropped off the radar after its premiere at Sundance - but now it's poked its head above the parapet as its August release date nears. Fittingly, for the life story of a tech pioneer, Jobs-the-film has found a way to break a little ground itself. Its new 15-second teaser trailer is the first ever to debut on picture-oriented social networking app Instagram, which only began sharing video a month ago. So what do you think? is this the wave of the future, or a road to nowhere? Leave your comments below."
