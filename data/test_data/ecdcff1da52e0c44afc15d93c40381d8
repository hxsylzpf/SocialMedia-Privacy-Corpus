  "content": "Things happen quickly on the internet, but even by the online world's lightning-fast standards, the past week has been something of a whirlwind for Facebook. First it spent an estimated $50m (\u00a330m) buying Silicon Valley startup FriendFeed, and then it struck a deal with news website the Huffington Post to create a \"social news\" site. Along the way it also finished a new iPhone application, a stripped-down \"Lite\" version and a new real-time search tool. For the staff at the company's offices in Palo Alto, California, things must be a blur. While the sudden frenzy might seem de rigeur for a household name that is rarely out of the headlines, this flurry of announcements is not just business as usual. In fact, it betrays what is really happening at Facebook: that the world's biggest social networking site is trying to take itself to the next level. Some of the company's actions are more prosaic than they may first appear. The Huffington Post, for example, is popular but not particularly mainstream \u2013 and it has been using Facebook's Connect service for some time. Similarly, while immediate reaction to the FriendFeed deal largely focused on the eyebrow-raising rivalry with Twitter, those close to the deal suggest it was actually about bolstering Facebook's engineering team with some heavy hitters (the quartet who founded the site are former Google employees responsible for launching widely respected products such as Gmail and Google Maps). Instead, the development that reveals most about Facebook's current mindset was not a splashy acquisition or a media deal: it was the accidental emergence of Facebook Lite \u2013 a leaner version of the site that is currently being tested in some countries. Thinking bigger When eagle-eyed users spotted the experimental interface and passed on details of its stripped-down look, the headlines again began to crow \u2013 almost inevitably \u2013 that the move was a rearguard action against Twitter. But while competition may certainly have a role to play, the company suggested it was actually an attempt to build a version of the site for users with slower internet connections. That idea may seem irrelevant to those of us who live a broadband lifestyle, but Justin Smith \u2013 who tracks the company's movements on the Inside Facebook blog \u2013 says that it makes perfect sense. \"Facebook, in its traditional version, is not a very light service,\" he says. \"It's a complex code base and there are a lot of things happening behind the scenes every time you pull up a page.\" \"I think that for a lot of users, the cost is actually on the consumption side \u2013 either they happen to live in a place with really slow connections, or in some cases they pay by the amount of data they consume. For those reasons, Facebook basically wanted to try and slim things down to make it easier to deliver and cheaper to consume. It makes a lot of sense to make it easier for those users for whom it is a hurdle \u2013 in the west it's not a very common one, except maybe on a mobile phone.\" The focus on users in emerging markets is yet another signal that the site \u2013 already surging forward with more than 250 million users \u2013 is thinking bigger still. Currently, most of those users are based in Europe or America, but while it is still growing strongly in countries such as the US and Britain \u2014 about a third of adults in the UK are now active on Facebook \u2014 it is clear that the numbers will hit a ceiling at some point. To counteract this future slowdown, the company is putting more effort into grabbing other opportunities in countries such as India, Brazil and Russia, which present huge new audiences that could keep the site growing even when users elsewhere get Facebooked out. So far, it has all the hallmarks of a big push. Earlier this year the company took out a $100m loan from a Californian financing group to build new server farms, while Moscow-based investor Digital Sky Technologies has pumped $300m into the company in recent months, betting that it can have a big impact in Russia. And two weeks ago, the company's young founder, Mark Zuckerberg, took some time out of a holiday in the jungles of the Amazon to spend time talking to Brazilian audiences. Alongside him was Javier Olivan, the company's international manager and one of those tasked with bringing Facebook to millions more people around the world. He suggests that the Brazilian visit was typical of Facebook's activities when it sees a chance to expand. \"We're trying to do things in countries where we start seeing traction,\" he says. \"For example in Brazil, where the number of users doubled in the past three months, we want to make sure people understand what Facebook's all about. That's why Mark spent some time there visiting some of the partners and doing some press.\" The site is also seeing rapid expansion in Asia, with significant growth in the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and elsewhere. Growth in China (which has an estimated 400,000 Facebook users) is hampered because the site is largely blocked by the government \u2013 but in India there are already 3.75 million users, up 388% in the past year. Already the dominant player across most of the world, the site is now making significant ground where rivals \u2013 such as Friendster, Hi-5 and Google's Orkut \u2013 have traditionally been stronger.Having such large audiences to pilfer presents Facebook with a massive chance to keep its momentum up, but staff soon discovered that they were turned off by the difficulty of using the site over dial-up connections. Securing a future \"The Facebook Lite idea actually came up from just observing how users were using the product in those countries where the majority of people have very slow connections,\" says Olivan. \"We thought the levels of activity when they are using the site were so much lower compared with other places \u2013 then we realised, by testing the product from the market, that it's just sometimes not as fast as in from other places.\" It is not the only effort that Facebook is making \u2013 there are significant marketing and partnerships taking place, as well as the effort to translate the site into more than 60 languages. But it is indicative that Facebook's executives are taking their future seriously. For them, aiming for the next 250 million users is not just a hubristic gamble to become the world's biggest website \u2013 it is an attempt to secure a future for Facebook that lasts beyond the mayfly lifespan of most social networking sites. With profitability still somewhere beyond the horizon, and the notoriously mercurial history of many big websites at the front of their minds, Zuckerberg and his team are hoping that they can build Facebook so big that it becomes part of the fabric of the web \u2013 and that means being anywhere and everywhere in the world that they can. \"Facebook wants to be the pipes that you use to share information with your friends, no matter where you are,\" says Justin Smith. \"If they're able to become that across a majority of sites, that's a pretty powerful place to be: then they'll start being the No 1 generator of traffic \u2013 and potentially commerce \u2013 to a variety of companies.\"",
