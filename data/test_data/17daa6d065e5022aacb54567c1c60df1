  "content": "People who know Rob Delaney \u2013 his 954,000 Twitter followers included \u2013 know him as a comedian gifted in the art of hilarity in 140 characters or less. But with the release of his first book Mother. Wife. Sister. Human. Warrior. Falcon. Yardstick. Turban. Cabbage. Tuesday, Delaney will soon be known as a writer, one who turned his teenage binge drinking and mid-twenties struggle with alcoholism into comedy. The book \u2013 we'll call it 'MWSHWFYTC' \u2013 is a speed read that takes the reader from Delaney's native Marblehead, Massachusetts in the early 1990s to present-day Los Angeles, where he lives with his wife and two sons. The years in between, though, are where Delaney's prose is at its most powerful. The comical (if dangerous) bouts of binge drinking suddenly crash into Delaney's rock bottom, which involves a hospital, rehab and a halfway house. Many pages of his book are strewn with profanity, fart jokes or comments about genitalia; you'll finish the book knowing more about his personal evolution in masturbatory habits than his courtship with his wife. The language is stronger than the typical memoir of triumph over struggle, but then again, not every writer can weave body fluids and body parts into a touching essay about a battle with depression, or three halfway house buddies who never made it out. Those vignettes bookending his battles are less engaging, but Delaney's unflinching description of addiction and depression should be required reading for those who've ever struggled with either disease. Here are some standout lessons from Delaney's book: Cheesecake = Nobel Peace Prize Later in the book readers will find that food plays a big part in Delaney's recovery, but his love for carbohydrates shows itself early on in dinners out with his family \u2013 namely, when they'd go get cheesecake afterwards. \"It makes me physically sick to think that Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize, yet the name of the inventor of cheesecake isn't tatooed on Dick Cheney's face.\" Everyone's first encounter with booze is weird Delaney's first time getting drunk involved getting pushed into pushes and coerced into smoking a joint by a man wearing a swastika T-shirt. Later, Delaney spotted him in the local newspaper. \"He'd been arrested for spray-painting the names of concentration camps all over a temple in town.\" Things basically go downhill from there. Bedwetting is not just for kids Bedwetting is a problem usually nipped in the bud in early childhood; however, for Delaney, it continued through puberty and, then, through his heavy drinking phase. Bungee jumping off the Manhattan Bridge used to be possible Delaney doesn't seem to mind heights, as readers will discover a few times while reading this book. But the best example is when he covertly jumps off the Manhattan Bridge in the late 1990', two years before 9/11. \"We didn't imagine anyone would be too upset that we were turning a piece of vital metropolitan infrastructure into an amusement park ride and making it partially invisible to air traffic,\" he writes. Rehab can be really nice After a blacked out car crash, Delaney is transported to Las Encinas, a Pasadena rehab facility. There's a low point when patients watch the Sandra Bullock movie 28 Days, but otherwise he describes his surroundings as peaceful. \"I fit right the fuck in, and I was once again grateful my outsides matched my insides for the first time in a long time,\" he says. Halfway house living can be like a dorm without the kegs His essay on the halfway house and the people he met while living there is the point in the book where laugh-out-loud funny suddenly turns tear-jerkingly sad. His description of the owner of the halfway house owner: \"He was like a blue-collar angel; just a good guy in the trenches of life, getting dirty and helping people.\" Depression is not like the commercials describe Delaney negates some common ideas about depression, which should come as a relief to anyone who's struggled with identifying the disease. He describes it as the absence of emotion. \"I am vocal about my depression now because it was so fucking Satanically awful that I view it as one of my life's primary missions to help other people understand and overcome it.\" Get a hepatitis vaccine Delaney contracted hepatitis A while working for MTV, but makes the wise point that he's lucky it wasn't B or C. \"So if you're test-driving hepatitises, may I recommend hepatitis A? It really is the Cadillac of hepatitises.\" It's okay not to choose sides in the cats v dogs debate Whatever readers are looking for in this book, it won't be a decisive end to the cats v dogs debate. Delaney likes both. \"More than once I've been driving, seen a cat on the sidewalk, stopped and rolled down my window, and the cat's run up and let me reach out my window and pet it. We have an understanding.\" The golden rule of parenting is to die before your kids Delaney's simple mission as a parent is to keep his son alive long enough so that he can die first. This involves preparing his offspring for everything life can throw his way, things \"which can range in pleasurability from eating a fresh key lime pie you made yourself after a rewarding sixty-nine session with a new love, all the way to having to pay for back surgery with three credit cards because you couldn't afford the COBRA payments on the health insurance you lost when you were laid off from you job as a teacher.\""
