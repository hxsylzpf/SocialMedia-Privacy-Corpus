  "content": "The battle to save BBC 6 Music may have just turned ugly. Supporters of the threatened digital station, which has been earmarked for closure by BBC bosses, claimed a direct hit on the corporation last night after a three minute segment of a song from 6 Music intruded into Radio 4 scheduling. The track by The Undertones took over the airwaves at the end of the news at 7pm and just before The Archers, prompting a frenzy of tweets applauding the rumoured act of \"guerrilla broadcasting\". Twitter was abuzz with suggestions it was a hijack by disgruntled BBC 6 Music employees who have so far seen their appeals for the station to be saved rebuffed by BBC director general Mark Thompson. The BBC played down suggestions that rogue elements were at work: \"Owing to a technical error Radio 4 transmission was lost for approximately 3 minutes this evening shortly after 7pm. We are very sorry to listeners for loss of service.\" On Twitter members of the Save 6 Music campaign were in no doubt Radio 4's impromptu foray into music was a deliberate act of digital sabotage. Thompson said he will close 6 Music and the Asian Network at the end of 2011. His announcement prompted furious response from loyal listeners of the eight-year-old music station, who say its distinctive output should be preserved. Nearly 8,000 listeners complained to the BBC after the announcement and DJs Richard Bacon, Phil Jupitus and Jarvis Cocker rallied to the station's defence. The BBC has opened a public consultation on the proposed closure. Sir Michael Lyons, the trust chairman, has hinted that a big public backlash could force the corporation to climb down."
