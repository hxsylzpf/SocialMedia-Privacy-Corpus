  "content": "We all know Facebook targets its advertising at individuals. If you click \"like\" on a charity appeal, you might start to see ads for Red Cross. If you change your relationship status to \"engaged\", ads for wedding venues start popping up in the sidebar. We may not know the algorithm, but it's difficult not to see a cause and effect. But have you ever felt like Facebook might be looking at you a bit too closely? Have you ever checked out the specs on an Ikea bookshelf, only to have an ad for the very same bookshelf pop up on Facebook? Have you ever seen an ad on the Facebook sidebar that seems to be tailored so specifically to you that you wondered... how did they know that? We'd like to hear your stories and experiences of Facebook advertising getting too close for comfort. Feel free to share photos, videos and screenshots via GuardianWitness \u2013 but please make sure they don't contain anyone else's personal information. We are hoping to investigate your submissions, and use the most interesting ones in our coverage. GuardianWitness is the home of user-generated content on the Guardian. Contribute your video, pictures and stories, and browse news, reviews and creations submitted by others. Posts will be reviewed prior to publication on GuardianWitness, and the best pieces will feature on the Guardian site.",
