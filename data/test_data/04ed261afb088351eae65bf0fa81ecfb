  "content": "Kanye West has pledged to leak 18 new songs before the end of the year, releasing a new track every weekend until Christmas. Dubbed \"good Fridays\", the series will draw from the rapper's upcoming album, due in November, and collaborations with others. \"We look at the game completely different now,\" West explained. \"It's about the fans.\" Even before the announcement of his plans, West had been leaking one song a week for the past fortnight. See Me Now, featuring Beyonc\u00e9, was dropped unexpectedly on 11 August, with Jay-Z's new Power remix popping up on West's website on 19 August. (The latter has since been taken offline, cited as an IFPI copyright violation.) Judging from his Twitter account, West is really pushing himself \u2013 overdosing on retweets, recording sessions and late-night brainstorming. \"[Producer] Swizz [Beats] looked at me the other night and said, 'Man are you getting sleep?'\" West tweeted. \"I told him I can't sleep. My people need this new music.\" From there, he moved into his new music pledge. \"I'm calling it good Fridays. Yall know every Friday yall gone have a new joint from our family. ... No more holding back.\" Although the broad strokes are clear, West's plans are still a little hazy. Some outlets have assumed \"good Fridays\" is another way of writing \"GOOD Fridays\", meaning exclusive songs from West's GOOD Music label. \"It may be my song it may be a new Jay song etc,\" West tweeted, leaving some wiggle-room as to which Jay he was referring to \u2013 Jay-Z, Jay Electronica or, er, Jay-Jay Johanson. As West has a new album coming out, tentatively entitled Dark Twisted Fantasy, this could even mean that West plans to leak the entire record. West's other recent projects include songs for a solo album by Pusha T, of Clipse, collaborations with Bon Iver, and that nightmare-inducing Justin Bieber/Raekwon team-up. West has also alluded to work with Mos Def, Pharrell, and a movie \"based around\" his new album. Shot in Prague, we understand unicorns are involved. Kanye West's last album was 2008's desolate, Auto-Tune-heavy 808s &amp; Heartbreak."
