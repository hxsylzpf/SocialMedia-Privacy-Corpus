  "content": "When Jonathan Ross is helping with the kids' homework, when Jamie Oliver bakes, when any of my 75 closest pals have coffee, I know about it - instantly. Why? Because, like at least 100,000 Brits, I Twitter. I Twitter from bed before I get up; when I arrive at work; when something happens; when nothing happens. Once I chain-smoked, now I chain-Twitter. It was easy to sneer at techies for Twittering, but thanks to the popularity of celebrity Twitterers, we're all at it; exchanging tweet nothings with the likes of Bj\u00f6rk and Britney Spears, Morrissey and Tina Fey, Lily Allen and the king of Brit-Twitterers himself, Stephen Fry. But what if you crave something more cultured from the new darling of web 2.0? What if celebrity tittle-tattle and updates on your best friend's lunch menu isn't enough? When my inbox greeted me with the news \"Yoko Ono is now following you on Twitter\" it got me thinking. Firstly that I'd have to up my game and swap micro-blogging from meetings for intelligent, interesting tweets that summed up life and all that in 140 perfect characters. Secondly, well \u2013 just what exactly are artists doing on Twitter? Sharing the mundane and the magic like the rest of us, or exploring a new form to find new ideas? Cynics will chirp that Twitter is just another in a long line of fads providing new ways to market, promote and generally whore oneself to the world. The rest of us might ask whether artists who Twitter are grinding away at some of those elitist notions about the way art is created (in private studios) and for who (the very few who can afford to buy it). Can following an artist as they create a new work democratise art or simply demystify the creative process behind it \u2013 or both? One week and a lot of tweets later, I've compiled a who's who of the twart world. The twartists Yoko Ono Perfectly well suited to the medium, each 140 character Yoko tweet is its own mini-performance, starring a warm, fuzzy message of love and optimism. Blissed-out art-hippy vibes. An Xiao This New York conceptual artist uses Twitter as \"a scrapbook, a way to capture thoughts and share them\", believing that the 140-character limit enforces \"a discipline of thought and economy of language that encourages sharp ideas\". She also creates Twitter-based artworks. Doc Pop A recent 24-hour comic challenge saw this San Francisco-based cartoonist (moonlighting as a nerdcore rapper and pro yo-yo champ) collaborate with Twitter followers, working their tweets into each page of his comic. See the results here. NaomiPinUp An ICA commission called Dogs' Ears gave birth to \"twoofing\" \u2013 tweeting as a dog, that is. Digital, audio and visual artist Julie Freeman is the brains behind the bark, with a few chums on board to help out, including diva pup NaomiPinUp (otherwise known as poet Naomi Woodis). Find out more here. The twart institutions The Brooklyn Museum (@1stfans) This subscription-only Twitter channel aims to \"bring the gallery out of the gallery\" with monthly new twartworks by artists it commissions to create unique, Twitter-friendly art. The Tate Where American museums, galleries and libraries, (The Smithsonian, The Met, MOMA) have led, our art goliaths are following. The Tate tweets extensively about events and new web content. In contrast, the Saatchi Gallery's channel (with over 100 followers), is shamefully empty at the moment. Mediascot New Media Scotland is dedicated to engaging artists and audiences through (you guessed it) new media. Its programme of Twart residencies has seen code poetry from @Netwurker, micro-fiction from Hannu Rajaniemi and a micro-serialised story from writer Charlotte Allan. Keep an eye out for a \"top secret\" twart project marking the organisation's 10th birthday this summer. TheArtsCatalyst The Arts Catalyst commissions art that experimentally and critically engages with science. Their channel combines the intellectual rigour of science with the imagination of art \u2013 an apt philosophy for a twart channel. The critic ArtFagCity Paddy Johnson is a New York critic and art blogger who feeds bite-size art news, reviews and gossip to the Twitterverse. High-profile UK critics have been slower off the mark but the Big Apple's art scene is well served - check out hustlerculture, glowlab and ArtMacguffin for more The imposter Jenny Holzer Each tweet is a Holzer-esque slogan. This is widely acknowledged to be a fake or, more generously, \"homage\". Suspiciously, the only person Jen is following is 14-years dead Guy Debord. No it's not her, but does it matter?",
