  "content": "Tinder, the dating app which has turned \"swipe right\" into a legitimate expression of romantic interest, has made its first acquisition, taking over messaging app Tappy. Tappy, which will now cease to exist as a stand alone entity, marketed itself as a messaging app which was the antidote to texting. Similar to Snapchat, users would begin a dialogue by sending photographs to one another which disappeared after a period of time. In Tappy's case, 24 hours. Unlike Snapchat, however, Tappy allowed users to start a message thread with photographs to create a visual dialogue. Launched in July 2014, Tappy promised: \"It's like having a live chat room attached to your fun and wacky moments.\" It's thought that Los Angeles-based Tinder \u2013 which has grown rapidly in popularity since its launch in 2011, to the point where it makes more than 15 million \"matches\" a day (October 2014) \u2013 will use its acquisition of Tappy to improve its Tinder Moments service. Tinder Moments allows users to send self-destructing photos to those they have matched with, but interestingly not in private messages. Sean Rad, co-founder and CEO of Tinder told TechCrunch: \"We're very good at connecting people, but there's this 'what happens after that?' moment that we want to improve. \"We not only want to get better at the way we use criteria to connect people, but we want to broaden the reasons for connecting in the first place. \"The Tappy team will help us tackle both fronts, the pre-match experience of creating that first connection and the post-match experience of communicating with that person.\" Tappy, which was co-founded by Brian Norgard and Dan Gould, received $10m in funding from Los Angeles based start-up Chill (also founded by Norgard). The terms of the deal have not been disclosed. On joining the Tinder team, Norgard said: \"The chance to work with Sean was too strong of a draw because we knew that if we could couple Tappy DNA with Tinder DNA that we can do awesome stuff. \"Messaging has gotten very overheated, and this gives us the chance to lead from the front.\" \u2022 Tinder: the 'painfully honest' dating app with wider social ambitions"
