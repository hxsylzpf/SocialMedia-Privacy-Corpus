  "content": "The Sun has stolen a march on Heather Mills McCartney's threat to sue the paper by asking her to \"tick the boxes\" on a series of allegations the paper has made about the former model. Today's paper tells readers that the estranged wife of former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney is planning to take legal action against the Sun. However, the story on page four says: \"It is not clear what exactly she plans to sue us about.\" The paper then asks Mills McCartney: \"Come on Heather, what exactly did we get wrong? Is it that you're a ...\" Underneath the open question, the Sun lists six allegations about the former model, with a blank box beside each one. The words beside the boxes read: \"Hooker, Liar, Porn Star, Fantasist, Trouble Maker, Shoplifter\". The paper then asks the former model to \"tick appropriate boxes\" as to which, if any, of the allegations the Sun has made are untrue. Mills McCartney's solicitors announced yesterday she is planning to sue three newspapers over \"false, damaging and immensely upsetting\" statements in stories about her divorce from Sir Paul. Her law firm, Mishcon de Reya, said legal proceedings had already been started against the Daily Mail and the London Evening Standard, and action would soon be taken against the Sun. The storm over the McCartneys' increasingly bitter divorce escalated last week when parts of Mills McCartney's cross-petition for divorce, containing lurid and damaging allegations about Sir Paul's behaviour, were leaked to the press. Each is seeking a divorce decree on the grounds of the other's unreasonable behaviour, after a four-year marriage which produced a daughter, Beatrice, now three. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
