  "content": "New Zealand police have decided not to press charges against a freelance cameraman who recorded a private conversation involving prime minister John Key and a political ally. Key claimed the recording of his discussion with John Banks during the run-up to last November's general election was illegal (as I reported here). Cameraman Brad Ambrose had left a recording device running on a cafe table while Key met with a political ally, John Banks. Key had earlier met with media at the cafe. The recording was leaked online and included a couple of coarse comments by Key. Key's party went on to win the election but fell short of an outright majority. Police assistant commissioner Malcolm Burgess said that although there was a clear case against Ambrose, a warning was sufficient because he had no previous criminal record and had written letters of regret to Key and Banks.
