  "content": "As mobile phones and apps have become increasingly central to one's college experience in the past few years, a new type of app has emerged: the anonymous kind. In 2013 the app Yik Yak was created. In 2015, it's being used at more than 2,000 colleges and universities worldwide, according to its founders Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington. The concept was simple. You open the app \u2013 easily distinguished by the picture of an animated yak and the turquoise background \u2013 and hundreds of statuses pop up from people within a 1.5-mile radius of you. You peruse them, upvote the ones you like, downvote the ones you don't, and comment on one or two. Then, if you're feeling creative you post a status of your own, or a \"yak\" as it's known to the Yik Yak world. The wittier your post, the more upvotes you might receive and the more reputation points, or \"yakarma\" you earn. And all of this is done with no names. Following the creation of Yik Yak, a trend emerged: college students like to share their opinions but not have their names attached. This year, another app known as Whatsgoodly is picking up on the trend. The anonymous location-based polling app created in 2014 allows people to create questions with multiple-choice answers and view statistics on responses without any attribution. Students are also expressing interest in older anonymous apps like Whisper, where people in the same area anonymously share their thoughts and like and reply to others' posts. David Ryan Polgar, a digital lifestyle expert, likes to call the shift from previous generations of apps and social media to anonymous apps the \"keep the internet weird movement\". \"For many people, major social media platforms are losing their sense of surprise,\" he said. \"Everyday people are curating their content as if they are running for political office. Well, most politicians are boring. We don't want our news feed to be boring.\" He believes that anonymous apps are \"an add-on to one's social life\" rather than replacing other social media tools and apps that are already out there like Facebook and Twitter. \"The rise of anonymous apps is most likely in part a reaction to the countless reputations the public has seen ruined by an ill-humored tweet or insensitive photo shared online,\" he said. \"Millennials in particular are being told about the dangers of what they post online, and the importance of shaping a positive digital footprint. Anonymous apps offer an enticing outlet with less danger.\" Kristen Gardner, a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh, agrees. She said college students worry about what they post online because of what \"can be traced back to them\". \"College students, on the one hand, are trying to act professional and trying to be adults, but they're really experiencing a lot of drama and weird things that they want to talk about,\" she said. Danielle Jacobson, a sophomore at Johns Hopkins University has found anonymous apps a great place to express herself and \"to post stuff that's not within your stereotype\". She normally refrains from posting silly or funny things on Facebook and has said friends are surprised when she shows them her humorous posts on Yik Yak. Adam Halper, co-founder and CEO of Whatsgoodly said the goal of the polling app is to \"bring back the moderate voice\" rather than those that are \"willing to scream the loudest and silence everyone else\". He added that the app is meant to \"give everyone an equal voice\". The apps also provide an easy way to tune into the mood on campus. Mariana Alfaro, a sophomore at Northwestern University, found the apps helpful when she first moved to Evanston, Illinois from San Salvador, El Salvador. As an international student, she said she \"didn't really get a lot about American campus culture\" and the apps provided a resource to consult. \"It was like a little bit of a guide without having to ask questions. It was like, this is what's going on in greek life, this is what's going on in this part of campus. This is what this means,\" she said. \"It did help me get in tune without having to ask obvious questions.\" Despite their growing popularity, anonymous apps have also faced great criticism. Jacobson said she's seen polls on Whatsgoodly that list women and ask \"who's the hottest girl here or who's the most overrated girl?\". According to the Daily Beast, questions on Whatsgoodly at the University of Pennsylvania have included: \"Which Theta girl gives the best blowjobs?\", \"Does the United States have a 'rape culture'?\", and \"Best cleaning ladies: foreign or not foreign?\" And much in the way anonymous internet comments bring out many views that folks would never say with attribution, a similar strain of commentary has emerged on anonymous apps. \"People definitely harass other people on there and it brings out the racism and sexism that you don't realize everyone's got brewing inside of them on campus and they'll just say really offensive things,\" Gardner said. Yik Yak has tried to minimize bullying and targeting of specific individuals by partnering \"with a company that specializes in identifying threatening or offensive content through natural language processing\". They have banned the use of names in questions and they allow students to upvote or downvote statuses depending on whether they like them or not. Jacobson said that if a status receives 5 down votes, it is removed from the main feed but that \"Whatsgoodly still has stuff to work on in regards to that\". Halper admitted that Whatsgoodly was initially unprepared for the fast-escalating demands of monitoring the app. He added: \"There were cases where there was cyberbullying that was able to slip through our cracks.\" But they plan to outsource their monitoring \"to a firm that specializes in scaleable content management\" in the fall. Jacobson believes the apps will get over these growing pains: \"I kind of think they get a bad reputation for obvious reasons, but I also think they can be pretty harmless because they've taken precautions\". Alfaro, on the other hand, deleted Yik Yak from her phone after she saw statuses that she \"definitely didn't like\" and were \"really rude\". She found that it \"started to get to be a little too much\"."
