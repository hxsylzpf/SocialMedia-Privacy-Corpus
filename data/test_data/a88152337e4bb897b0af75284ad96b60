  "content": "The BBC's controller of comedy commissioning has said he would welcome Frankie Boyle back to the corporation but admitted the controversial comic's tweets made it more difficult for him to work in broadcasting. Shane Allen, who championed Boyle in his previous job as Channel 4 head of comedy, said he had been wrongly stereotyped as an \"offence machine\". But he refused to further discuss Boyle's most controversial joke \u2013 about Katie Price's disabled son in a 2011 episode of Channel 4's Tramadol Nights \u2013 saying only that \"everything was referred up to [Channel 4 chief executive] David Abraham\". \"Frankie's been on Radio 4, I have seen him in the building. He's not a pariah,\" Allen told a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch on Tuesday. Allen admitted that stars who made controversial comments on social media networks such as Twitter made it more difficult for them to come to work for the BBC. Channel 4 appeared to distance itself from Boyle after he made controversial jokes about Paralympic athletes on Twitter last year. Allen said: \"There's a difficulty and this goes across every talent. There's been a few examples of people who have got into trouble for their off-screen communications. \"There was stuff in Tramadol Nights that got taken out that to me was too difficult to justify. But we don't have any control and nor should we have any control over what people do in their social media life. That's caused a bit of repression in terms of what people do.\" Allen said another Twitter furore involving the comic would immediately be characterised as \"the BBC's Frankie Boyle says something horrific on Twitter\". He added: \"We don't and nor should we say to Frankie Boyle: 'Do you know what, could you stop tweeting in case you do a programme for the BBC and it reflects badly on the programme because the story will be the BBC's Frankie Boyle says something horrible about the Queen?' That's censorship.\" Allen compared Boyle's treatment to criticism of Billy Connolly, now considered to be something of a national treasure, in the 1970s. \"Billy Connolly was an outcast, he was this hate figure because he would do jokes about criticism,\" said Allen. \"If it is nasty comedy which is not done with intelligence and a purpose then I think you can't defend it. But I do think Frankie has something to say. \"He is bright, he gives us an alternate view of the world. His core is this libertarian mindset, not a million miles away from Charlie Brooker. He is seen as this offence machine whereas he is actually a really good writer.\" Allen announced a new comedy, Puppy Love, set in a dog training class, written by the creators of acclaimed Jo Brand sitcom Getting On. But Getting On, which aired on BBC4 and won Bafta and Royal Television Society Awards, will not return. Count Arthur Strong, the Radio 4 sitcom which transferred to BBC2 on Monday night, has already been commissioned for a second series. It was watched by just under 1 million viewers on Monday night. Allen said: \"I think it's a brilliant show, full of big jokes. It's Marmite for some people, they think it's not their thing. I think it's a quintessential show like Miranda, it's something you could see on BBC1.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
