  "content": "For some people it will be a relief. But for hundreds of thousands of online followers of the actor Ashton Kutcher's voluminous Twitter updates, the news that he may quit the site will come as a disappointment. Kutcher, who is married to Demi Moore, has collected nearly 2 million followers on Twitterand is the most high-profile celebrity user of the microblogging phenomenon. But plans by Twitter to help launch a television show have outraged Kutcher and other stars. Details of the project are a closely guarded secret, but it appears to be a reality show that celebrities fear may encourage members of the public to stalk them. In a brief announcement, Twitter's partners, Reveille and Brillstein Entertainment, said only that the show's \"revolutionary\" new format would involve \"putting ordinary people on the trail of celebrities\". That was enough for Kutcher, who tweeted: \"Wow I hope this isn't true. I really don't like being sold out. May have to take a Twitter hiatus.\" Later, in response to a query from a fan explaining his fears, he said: \"I don't want to be stalked!!!\" His wife quickly followed suit, no doubt fearing an invasion of her privacy on top of that regularly caused on Twitter by her own postings and that of her husband. \"Our Twitter time may come to a quick and sad end,\" she tweeted, only a few days after posting a photograph of herself minus a front tooth during dental surgery. Other stars also said they might leave. An exodus of celebrity users would be bad news for Twitter, which is still trying to work out how to become profitable despite the enormous amount of publicity it generates.",
