  "content": "In a few weeks, the Iowa caucuses will officially kick off the 2012 campaign for president and we'll begin to get answers to the questions that obsess our political press: who's gonna win? What is the winning strategy? We're equally obsessed with a different question: how can Americans get a \"win\" in the election of 2012? Meaning: the kind of dialogue they deserve, a campaign that connects to their deepest concerns and helps them make sense of the cascading problems now before the United States. And if you share our obsession, you can help us get started or follow along. Presidential elections are a race \u2013 a marathon, as the exhausted candidate often says. They are national spectacles, not around the edges but at their core. Elections are comedies, too, a rolling entertainment. And so there has to be a place for horse race polls, game day coverage, personality journalism, political carnival, and even for front-page stories on the guy who cuts the candidate's hair. But we think it will be a loss for the public, and the press, if no revision is made in the master narrative for election coverage, which treats politics as a strategic game in order to ask \u2013 endlessly \u2013 what it's going to take to win in 2012. That engine is by now exhausted. It cannot do the work we need the press to do if Americans are going to get the kind of debate they deserve. But what are the alternatives? In 2008, the two of us teamed up with the Huffington Post to try to improve election coverage by broadening participation in it. We called that project OffTheBus. It relied on the public, people who were not political journalists, and thus not inside the campaign bubble. \"Who's gonna win?\" was not their typical starting point. More like: where and how does this campaign touch my life? They covered those connecting points from small towns to big cities, offered a look inside their local campaign HQs, analyzed campaign expenditure data, sifted through campaign material for trends and anomalies, and profiled almost all of the so-called \"super delegates\", who had a big role in the nomination battle that Barack Obama won. Just as Obama's campaign empowered the grassroots, OffTheBus \"let the roots guide its coverage.\" OffTheBus brought networking methods to campaign reporting and commentary. We eventually enlisted 12,000 people, partly on the strength of a simple idea: democracy is about participating, so let's extend that principle to the campaign news system and see if we can make it work. We learned that there's great potential in this kind journalism \u2013 imagine the expertise and observational powers of 12,000 pairs of eyes and ears \u2013 but also a long way to go. Fortunately, the Hufffington Post is going to continue with OffTheBus in 2012. We look forward to seeing what they do with it. Meanwhile, we have another idea. We want to go right at the problem of an exhausted master narrative. It's time to attempt a replacement \u2013 or replacements. So that is what Guardian US and NYU's Studio 20 program in journalism are going to do in 2012, using some of what we learned from OffTheBus and also from the Guardian's own experiments in pro-am and crowdsourced journalism. The alternative to \"who's going to win in the game of getting elected?\" is, we think, a \"citizens agenda\" approach to campaign coverage. It starts with a question: what do voters want the candidates to be discussing as they compete with each other in 2012? If we can get enough people to answer to that question, we'll have an alternative to election coverage as usual. The Guardian's over-arching commitment to an open and collaborative newsroom makes it a natural home for the citizens agenda. It recently unveiled guardiannews.com, announced its plans to report for a US audience, and has begun staffing up (We're looking for a social media editor and a community coordinator). Here's how Janine Gibson, editor-in-chief of Guardian US, puts it: \"Although the Guardian has had talented correspondents in the US for some time now and has covered many elections here, they have always been foreign correspondents, reporting back for a UK audience. Now we've launched in the US and are publishing to US readers, we wanted to make sure our coverage was distinctive and added something to the general noise and swirl of an election campaign. Our starting position was, 'We're new in town. How could we possibly pretend to know what the US electorate wants to hear from its prospective representatives?' Best, in that circumstance, to ask the question, we thought.\" The citizens agenda is a simple concept, and our approach is fairly straightforward: we aim to identify and articulate the citizens agenda, and to help set up the Guardian for its general election coverage by experimenting with citizens agenda features and approaches. Studio 20 students will work alongside the Guardian's journalists in brainstorming, designing and managing features on guardiannews.com through early May 2012. Together, we will arrive at the picture of how people want journalists to cover the election through a number of traditional and non-traditional methods, including sampling science, internet polling, web forms, social media, old fashioned reporting, discussions and debates, experimental features, plus staff and user-generated content. Starting in late January, when students are back in session and the primaries are presumably winding down, we will launch our first features. Between February and May, we will iterate and edit our approach. Working parallel to the Guardian's project will be local newsrooms doing essentially the same thing, but for statewide and local elections. The Media News and Journal Register companies, under the joint management of Digital First Media, plan to develop the citizens agenda approach in their own election coverage, collaborating with the Guardian on the best ways to discern what voters want the campaign to be about. We hope that other local news organisations will want to join in as the experiment takes shape. The more that do, the better our chances for learning how to do it right. \"For any local news organisation to be successful down the road, it needs to engage its citizens in meaningful ways, and to me, this is a perfect example of how we can and should do that,\" said Jim Brady, editor-in-chief of Digital First Media. \"I think the partnership with the Guardian is a model for national-local media partnerships that I hope will continue to evolve. The Guardian will take on the huge national piece of the citizens agenda, and at Journal Register Company and MediaNews Group papers, we'll localise it. So, in every city or town where we have a news organisation, we'll be able to find out what citizens are most interested in discussing and try and get them the answers they need to make an informed decision when they show up to vote.\" The initial goal of this kind of journalism is to expose the demand for news and views around problems the voters see as real and urgent. In other words, what do you want the candidates to be discussing as they compete for votes in 2012? Or, what should this campaign be about? Social media and the two-way nature of the Internet make it possible to ask that question of many more people than you could reach in a poll, although polling is important for reliability. The answers that come in form the basis for the citizens agenda. It won't be a single issue, of course, but a basket of top concerns broadly shared by respondents \u2013 six to ten, or perhaps as many as a dozen priorities that originate not with journalists or campaign managers, but with voters. Some may be different from the issues the operatives see as advantageous to their candidate, or maybe not. The point is that we won't know until we ask. Once synthesised, the citizens agenda can be used as an alternative starting point for the Guardian's campaign journalism. When the candidates speak, their promises and agendas are mapped against the citizens agenda. Reporters assigned to cover the campaign can dig deep on the items that make up the citizen's agenda. In questioning the candidates, the Guardian will ask about things that flow from that agenda. Explainers should try to clarify and demystify the problems named in the citizens agenda. What the voters want the candidates to be discussing is not a static thing, nor is it easy to determine. So we will have to keep working at it until we get it right, which is part of the reason the Guardian is collaborating with a journalism school. This is an experiment. Last spring, Studio 20 worked with ProPublica.org on how to create better explainers. That project will feed into this one. The ultimate goal of a citizens agenda is to bring the candidates to it, so that what people want the candidates to be discussing is actually addressed. Campaign coverage gains a clear purpose: information and access that is useful to people in getting their priorities addressed. That's a goal worth obsessing about. So, now it's your turn: how do you recommend we get started? Where do we look for inspiration? And what do you see as the campaigns' core issues?
