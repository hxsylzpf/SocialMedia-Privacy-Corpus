  "content": "Having an online presence is essential for the success of many small businesses today. According to serial entrepreneur James Caan, a good website lends credibility to your business. Not having one gives a bad impression to prospective clients, he says. Importantly, it is about letting potential customers know you exist and social media is a great way to drive traffic to your site. As Julia Bramble, founder of social media consultancy Bramble Buzz, explains in a Guardian article: \"If businesses haven't got the right [social media] presence then they're really going to be missing out, because customers are expecting to find businesses and brands on there.\" But going online isn't just about marketing and PR. Some retailers are utilising online marketplaces and e-commerce sites, such as Etsy.com and Alibaba.com, to boost profits. With so many options available at the click of a mouse, how do you know what's right for your business? Which is the best route to grow your SME's online presence? To help you navigate a digital path to success online, we've put together a panel of experts to share their experiences, tips and suggestions on everything from targeted advertising on Facebook and launching a viral marketing campaign on Twitter to creating your own website and using online marketplaces.
