  "content": "The story Randy monks Although it may chime like a debauched concoction of Peter Stringfellow's idle daydreaming, the ex-lap dancing nuns and limousine-renting monks of Santa Croce monastery in Rome were, until this week, operating with relative impunity. It took an intervention from the pope himself to put an end to the fun, with the Vatican ordering the eviction of around 20 monks from the monastery under Benedict XVI's campaign against \"loose living\". The monastery holds some of the most sacred relics of the Christian faith including splinters from the crucifix and thorns from Christ's crown. Perhaps more interestingly it was also where Madonna (pop star not mother of aforementioned son of God) went to pray on a visit to the Italian capital in 2008. The statistic You're 42 times more likely . . . To be stopped and searched at a UK airport if your skin is not white. Terrorism laws, now over a decade old, may have given police a licence to over-zealously pick out non-white faces passing through departures and arrivals. But despite these accusations of ethnic profiling, a police spokesman said officers \"do not single out particular ethnic groups for examination.\" The quote Sir Alex Ferguson \"We'll get him. We'll ban him on Friday.\" If the courts fail, just do it yourself! Fergie seeks to ban a meddling journalist from tonight's Champions League final after he asked one too many questions (or one in total) about Ryan Giggs at a press conference this week. Sir Al was blissfully unaware that his request to censor the reporter was being recorded by prying press microphones. The tweet @amnesty Proof that the power of Twitter goes beyond breaking superinjunctions, human rights group Amnesty International ensured the release of an Azerbaijani newspaper editor, locked up under \"trumped up\" defamation charges, via a mass tweet to the country's leader, President Aliyev or @presidentaz, as you'll find him online. Over 800 tweeters reiterated Amnesty's call to \"Free Eynulla Fatullayev!\" who has now been returned home after an incarceration that lasted over three years."
