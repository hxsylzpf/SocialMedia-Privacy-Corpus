  "content": "You know the most irritating thing? When you're trying to say something a little tentative? Like asking a question, but when you, like, want affirmation instead of an actual answer, because \u2013 duh \u2013 you know the answer, otherwise you wouldn't have said it. Hello? Well, it's hard to write these things out \u2026 It's really easy to say them, though. I'm like, all the time \u2026 And then this once I was tweeting \u2026 And that was a bit like being a teenager in that 140 characters was a big effort; a major gesture towards the world. But it wasn't unfriendly. And if I had been a teenager still, I couldn't have shown this by raising my voice a semitone at the end of the sentence. And that's called uptalk \u2026 People who aren't middle-aged, I mean, people under 30, seem to do it all the time. It's useful. And of course it's incredibly irritating if it sounds like a question. But it isn't a question. It's a way of asking someone to be interested without making eye contact. It signals it's their turn to speak, but they don't have if they don't want to. It's like, manners for people who haven't got any \u2026 So when you type, how do you signal uptalk? And I just realised, exactly as I did it. You put an ellipsis at the end of the sentence, and that makes it trail away \u2026 And it says it's your turn to type something, if you want to. And that's really sensible and really useful, and it's only old people who don't understand it.",
