  "content": "Brittni Lyn, a young mother in Texas, became a social media sensation after she shared the story of some fun in her yard that took a turn for the bizarre on Saturday. Briitni was having a water balloon fight in front of her home with her daughter when a passerby hollered at her for wearing a bikini and showing off the \"disguisting marks\" on her stomach to the world. According to her post on Tumblr, Brittni responded by saying: \"I love every part of my body, every flaw, every imperfection, &amp; every stretch mark. Simply because it represents my journey of becoming not only a woman, but a mother. Have a blessed day.\" She went on to say how disappointed she was that the person who said that to her was a fellow woman and that: \"I am finally at a point in my life where I feel &amp; believe that I am beautiful &amp; I will be damned if anyone tries to tell me otherwise! I am a proud Mama w/stretch marks! Oh well!\" Women and mothers from around America (and the world) have written to Brittni to thank her for sharing her story and standing up for \"real women\" and mothers. Have you ever been criticised for your appearance? How did you respond?"
