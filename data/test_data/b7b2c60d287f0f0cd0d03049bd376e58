  "content": "The Silicon Valley executive who advised women to \"lean in\" to get ahead in the workplace is now cashing in. Sheryl Sandberg, the second in command at Facebook, has sold 2.4m shares in the company worth $91m (\u00a351m). Sandberg sold the shares \u2013 5% of her total holdings in Facebook \u2013 amid growing optimism that the firm is getting to grips with the challenge of selling adverts on smart phones and tablet computers. The stock was sold for an average of $38 a share without her knowledge of the timing, under a pre-arranged plan used by executives to avoid accusations of insider trading. The $38 mark is a significant milestone, as it was the flotation price when the tech company made its much hyped stock market debut in May 2012. The IPO was labelled a disaster as the stock plummeted to just $10 at one point. In recent weeks, Facebook has staged a remarkable comeback, with a big fillip in late July when its second quarter figures soared above market expectations. Sandberg, who worked for economist Larry Summers at the US Treasury before moving to Google, joined Facebook in 2008 as its chief operating officer to help founder Mark Zuckerberg build advertising from its millions of users. In December she sold \u00a350m worth of stock. The 43-year-old executive, reported to be worth $400m, got her equity in Facebook after negotiating with Zuckerberg. But she said she only asked for more money after her husband and brother-in-law pushed her to negotiate for a bigger pay cheque. \"No man would take the first offer,\" she told the Guardian earlier this year. \"I felt like I needed a justification for doing it. And it turns out that's what the data says: men can negotiate without apology or justification. It's expected. If women negotiate, they need to justify it. It can't be that you want more for you. Because that's what men get to do.\"",
