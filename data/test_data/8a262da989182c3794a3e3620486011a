  "content": "The News of the World and the Daily Mail have sent private apologies to the England football manager Fabio Capello after publishing photographs of him on a beach with his wife while on holiday in Italy. Capello has received apologies from the two newspapers for publishing the pictures, which appeared despite an intervention from the Press Complaints Commission informing them of the England manager's request for privacy. The two titles have also agreed to make \"substantial donations\" to a charity chosen by the Capellos, the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. The Mail is understood to have paid \u00a310,000 to the charity. On 17 September, the PCC circulated to newspapers concerns expressed by Capello and the Football Association about the presence of photographers during his holiday. However, three days later, on Sunday 20 September, the News of the World published images of Capello and his wife on a beach and the Daily Mail published similar photographs on the Monday. \"Both newspapers accepted that internal procedures \u2013 warning of Mr Capello's concerns \u2013 had failed and that the pictures were published in error,\" the PCC said in a statement. \"Following complaints, they have apologised to the Capellos, given undertakings for the future, and \u2013 at the request of the Capellos \u2013 made substantial donations to the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation.\" The pictures showed the 63-year-old and wife Laura visiting a hot thermal spring in Italy and plastering themselves with a mud pack. The News of the World ran a story with the subhead \"England coach gets mucky with missus\". After the News of the World ran its story and pictures over two pages, with a reference on page one, the Football Association sent an additional warning on the Sunday afternoon to all national newspapers. But the Daily Mail ran its story on Monday despite the two warnings, under the headline \"Ooze a pretty boy then? Fabio takes a mudbath\". MediaGuardian.co.uk understands that it would have been difficult to mount any defence against a privacy action brought by Laura Capello, who has never sought publicity. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
