  "content": "Earlier this week Tim Rutten in the LA Times wrote a column called Private e-mail is public, which documented the story of Farnaz Fassihi. Fassihi is a Middle East correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, whose regular private email to a group of friends somehow made it into the public domain. In it, she made a rather damning assessment of the situation in Iraq and since the publication of this email, it's been announced that she's going on an extended vacation. (more at Editor &amp; Publisher and New York Observer, for starters) Whatever the details behind this move, it points to one thing: the emergence of private correspondence into the public domain is getting more common. So how do we deal with it? Do you consider everything you write on email to be public? And if you don't, should you?"
