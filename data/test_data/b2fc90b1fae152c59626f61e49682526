  "content": "We are on the verge of a momentous judgment by the European Court of Human Rights. According to today's Independent on Sunday, the court's judges will rule this week on Max Mosley's petition to make it a legal requirement for newspapers to inform people in advance that they intend to publish an article about them. This \"prior notification\" amendment to the privacy section of human rights law follows the News of the World's invasion of Mosley's privacy in March 2008, when the paper revealed his sexual liaison with five women. He was not contacted before publication of the story in print, which was accompanied by the online posting of video footage. Mosley sued for breach of privacy and was awarded \u00a360,000 by the high court. But, as Mosley went on to point out, once something that is private is published, no court can erase it from the public mind. \"The only effective remedy is to prevent publication,\" he wrote in a Guardian comment earlier this year. \"But the court can only do this if the victim knows and alerts a judge. This is why prior notification is essential.\" If the European court supports Mosley it would be regarded as a landmark ruling with implications for all newspaper investigations that involve people's personal lives. It would be a severe blow especially to tabloid kiss'n'tell stories, which have already been choked off by the use of gagging orders (or so-called superinjunctions) The editors of more serious newspapers also opposed Mosley's petition, arguing that prior notification would have a chilling effect on press freedom. However, Mosley has always countered that journalists investigating stories of genuine public interest would be able to make a case for publication. Mosley has also said that it would involve only a small number of cases. Most of the time, newspapers do contact people in advance of publication. Whatever the court's decision this week, whether for or against Mosley, I imagine there will be an appeal. Source: Independent on Sunday"
