But for every Justin Bieber, there's a bright spark like the 16-year-old boy in the Netherlands who has been arrested by Dutch police on suspicion of bringing down the Mastercard website, as part of the ongoing co-ordinated cyber attacks on companies that have been making things difficult for WikiLeaks. We've all done things we probably shouldn't have as teenagers (albeit not, perhaps, quite as high-tech or illegal) \u2013 so what's your worst misdemeanour? Did you skip off school? Have an embarrassing hobby? Bring down the website of a multinational company? And do you regret doing it or did it make you the person you are today?",
