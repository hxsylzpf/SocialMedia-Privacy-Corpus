  "content": "Nick Davies The Guardian journalist who revealed in 2009 the News of the World had secretly paid almost \u00a31m to Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, and two others also broke the news in July that Milly Dowler's phone had been hacked by the paper. The latter revelation prompted a wave of public revulsion that led directly to the title's closure. Davies gave evidence to the Commons culture, media and sport select committee in 2009, revealing the existence of the \"for Neville\" email, and has written a book on newspaper practices and culture called Flat Earth News. Davies is currently writing a book on the phone-hacking affair and its ramifications. Paul McMullan One of the few former News of the World journalists to claim on the record that phone hacking was rife at the newspaper, he told the Guardian's Nick Davies in September 2010 that \"[Andy] Coulson would certainly be well aware that the practice was pretty widespread\". A former features editor at the title, McMullan now runs a pub in Dover. He was himself the victim of a tabloid-style sting earlier this year, when Hugh Grant secretly taped him claiming that Rebekah Brooks, who was then chief executive of News International, also knew hacking was taking place. McMullan will be quizzed about the conversation with the actor, highlights of which were published in the New Statesman, when he appears at the Leveson inquiry. Richard Peppiatt Peppiatt achieved instant notoriety when he sent a resignation letter to Daily Star owner Richard Desmond protesting about the paper's \"anti-Muslim\" coverage. \"If you can't see that words matter, you should go back to running porn magazines,\" he told the billionaire businessman. Peppiatt is now a self-styled campaigner for press standards, who has claimed tabloid newsrooms at papers other than the Star are characterised by a culture of bullying. He told a seminar organised by Leveson last month: \"Journalists aren't, for the most part, bad people. But, like all humans, they adjust to their environment, and, like in all competitive industries, those who adjust best, go furthest.\" He describes himself as a \"recovering tabloid hack\" who is now \"fighting the good fight for press reform\"."
