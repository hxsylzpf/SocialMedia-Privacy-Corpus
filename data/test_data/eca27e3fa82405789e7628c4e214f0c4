  "content": "The next Social Innovation Camp is brewing nicely. More than 100 life-changing ideas have been submitted and the final six, picked for development at the final camp, to be held between December 5-7 at the Young Foundation in Bethnal Green. You can vote for one final seventh idea until midnight this Sunday. The first six include Going Postal, an anti junk mail tool, the international volunteering tool Useful Visitors, a city transport guide for disabled people called AccessCity, the care management tool Visualising Community Need, an Etsy-style marketplace for vegetables called Vegsy and Good Gym, which tries to encourage people to exercise while doing good deeds for others, rather than pointlessly lifting weights in the gym. That last 'people's choice' project will be chosen from these four, but it's up to you to vote: \u2022 Footsie - A collaborative carbon-reducing tool for businesses. \u2022 One Click Organisations - A legal support tool for new organisations. \u2022 Prepare to die - Taboo-tackling site that helps you prepare for your death. \u2022 Carbon Co-op - Allows people to collaborate on money-saving and environmentally friendly technologies. The winner of that last, seventh place will be announced on Monday... MediaGuardian.co.uk is the media partner for Social Innovation Camp"
