  "content": "Home secretary Theresa May is being asked to assist in a landmark court case over police alleged use of anti-terror laws to access journalists' phone records without their knowledge. The test case has been brought by News Group Newspapers and the Sun's political editor Tom Newton Dunn after the police obtained his phone records in the wake of the Plebgate scandal. It is alleged the police breached his human rights when they used current counter-terror legislation, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), to justify their decision to obtain the phone records. The request by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), an independent body sitting at the high court, comes after mounting concerns among privacy groups over the draft surveillance laws unveiled by May on Thursday. May will not appear personally but the Home Office solicitors will have to be instructed as to her view of the police decision to use the counter-terror laws in this instance. The case was heard at the high court four months ago and a judgment was expected in October, but this has now been delayed to give the Home Office an opportunity to put arguments forward on the justification for the use of RIPA. The police used RIPA in an attempt to discover who leaked the claim that then cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell called police officers \"plebs\" when leaving Downing Street in 2012. Police studied a week's worth of the phone records of the Sun's political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, and two other reporters, Anthony France and Craig Woodhouse, and also obtained records for two newsdesk landlines, the IPT was told in July. The case highlights the competing tensions between security needs and confidentiality and the IPT ruling could have an impact on the upcoming legislation if it finds in favour of Newton Dunn. In July, News Group Newspapers argued at the IPT that the Metropolitan police had used \"coercive legal powers\", normally reserved for criminal investigations and counter-terrorism operations, to try and identify moles in the force. The paper's barrister said the Met should have first come to the publisher seeking more information short of naming the source, which it had already refused to do. Failing that, it should have applied to a judge under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 giving the paper an opportunity to challenge their behind-the-scenes request for phone records. The police defended their actions, saying it was \"not in the business of signposting what our next move should be\" in its hunt for the paper's source. The use of RIPA to snoop on journalists was widely seen as an abuse of the legislation and contrary to European laws and led to the Home Office changing the rules to ensure journalists' sources are protected. A spokesman for the Home Office said it recognised the importance of journalistic confidentiality and a revised code of practice had been introduced earlier this year requiring any requests aimed at identifying journalists sources' to be approved by a judge. It said this would be enshrined in the new legislation.",
