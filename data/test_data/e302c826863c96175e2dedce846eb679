  "content": "It looks like Google and Britain's information commissioner are heading for a pasting from MPs later this week. The admission by the internet giant that its Street View vehicles downloaded computer passwords and emails is to be debated by MPs on Thursday. Robert Halfon, the Tory MP for Harlow, has secured a debate in the wake of the disclosure in the Sunday Telegraph that Google downloaded personal date from wireless networks while taking pictures of Britain's streets. This is what Halfon says: I believe we're potentially sleepwalking into a privatised surveillance society. Ordinary people have no protection against big companies on the internet \u2013 as the recent Street View fiasco has shown. I feel very strongly about this, and have been campaigning on it in the House of Commons since I was elected. Halfon is also critical of Christopher Graham, the information commissioner: The UK information commissioner has been lily-livered. When its officers first investigated this outrage, they visited Google's headquarters, had a nice chat with its senior executives, went through their computers and decided to do nothing. These corporations need to be taught that advancing the technological wonder that is the Internet is one thing. Trampling over the individual's right to privacy is quite another. This Thursday's debate is important, because it is the first chance that parliament has had to hold Google and other internet companies to account. This is what the information commissioner's office said in response to the Sunday Telegraph story: Earlier this year the ICO visited Google's premises to make a preliminary assessment of the \"pay-load\" data it inadvertently collected whilst developing Google Street View. Whilst the information we saw at the time did not include meaningful personal details that could be linked to an identifiable person, we have continued to liaise with, and await the findings of, the investigations carried out by our international counterparts. Now that these findings are starting to emerge, we understand that Google has accepted that in some instances entire URLs and emails have been captured. We will be making enquires to see whether this information relates to the data inadvertently captured in the UK, before deciding on the necessary course of action, including a consideration of the need to use our enforcement powers.",
