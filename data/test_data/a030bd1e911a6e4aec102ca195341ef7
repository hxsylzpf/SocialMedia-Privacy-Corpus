Maybe this is because they don't really like your friends, or maybe it's because they actually have real friends with whom they like to go out in real life. It may be worth checking to see if they're secretly seeing one of your online \"friends\". 1-30 You have a few carefully chosen friends on Facebook. Correction: everyone you know is your friend on Facebook \u2013 you just don't know many people. Your partner also knows exactly the same number of people, possibly because you met through a very specialist fan group such as brass-rubbing. 0 You both have a life that doesn't involve gluing your heads to a computer. Less than 0 Your partner has many, many friends online, very few of whom you share. In fact, it's likely that you've never heard of or met most of them. The normal view you have of your partner is the back of their head and you have to go online to check their emotional status. Your relationship will soon be over \u2013 or it is already.",
