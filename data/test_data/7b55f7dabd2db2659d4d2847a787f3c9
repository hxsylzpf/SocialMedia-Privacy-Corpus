  "content": "MPs and open data advocates have attacked the government's selloff of postcode data in the privatisation of Royal Mail, and warned that it could presage similar rows if the land registry is part-privatised. The Guardian understands though that the decision followed intense lobbying by Tory sources of the business secretary, Vince Cable, to sell off the information rather than making it free for public use, in order to increase the value of Royal Mail ahead of its selloff. But one expert in the field says that the value put on the file - of more than \u00a3500m - is vastly overstated after his own company reproduced it in its entirety for the 2011 Census in a one-off project for just \u00a310m. A report from the Public Administration Select Committee has slammed the selloff of the Postcode Address File (PAF), which contains data connecting the 1.8m postcodes in the UK to each of 28m postal addresses, saying that it doubted some of the assurances given by ministers including Michael Fallon, the Conservative MP who is minister for Business and Enterprise, about continued access to versions of PAF. \"The PAF should have been retained as a public data set, as a national asset, free to all, for the benefit and the widest benefit of the UK economy,\" the MPs say in a damning remark. \"Its disposal for a short-term gain will impede economic innovation and growth.\" 'Unacceptable and unnecessary' The PASC calls that \"an unacceptable and unnecessary consequence of privatisation\". After unsuccessfully lobbying against the sale of PAF with the Royal Mail, open data advocates now fear that the government will try to sell the Land Registry, which holds data about house prices and land ownership, with a similar effect of creating a barrier to open data use. PAF is used by thousands of businesses to target sales and marketing efforts and also for mapping, insurance premium calculations, identification and other uses. But it has been controversial since the Labour government and more recently the coalition government began promoting the concept of open data because it is collected by a publicly owned body, Royal Mail, and uses information provided by local authorities and the Ordnance Survey - both of which are also public sector. But the Guardian understands that there was substantial pressure to sell the PAF along with the Royal Mail. Michael Fallon, who gave evidence to the PASC, told it that the PAF was \"an integral part of the Royal Mail; it is a fundamental operating asset on which the business depends. It is the Royal Mail which collects the data and makes sure it is up to data.\" He said that Royal Mail \"incurs considerable costs in collecting and maintaining this data\u2026 It is only reasonable that they should be able to recover some of those costs from the companies that use this data.\" The selloff was condemned by Keith Dugmore, of the Demographics User Group (DUG), an independent body supported by the Cabinet Office which advises government on best practices for use of open data. \"It's a disaster,\" he told the Guardian. \"Retaining ownership of this data is vital because otherwise you're spending public money to create a private asset.\" And Jacqui Taylor of Flyingbinary, which works on open data, warned the committee that \"there is no guarantee on future prices of PAF data once Royal Mail is in private sector hands.\" Compares badly to Ordnance Survey data In a statement, Royal Mail said that it \"recognises the importance that PAF plays as a vital dataset supporting and sustaining key parts of the UK economy and we are committed to its widespread availability at a fair price\". Royal Mail says that it receives \u00a327m annually from licensing of PAF, but that it costs \u00a324.5m to collect, check and sell it - leaving it with a profit margin of just \u00a32.5m, or about 9%. An Ofcom review in February 2013 reported that Royal Mail estimated that there are 3,000 changes per day to PAF - which translates to about 1.2m changes per year. But the basis for claiming those costs was questioned by Robert Barr, a professor of geographic information systems at Liverpool University, whose company Manchester Geomatics worked with Lockheed Martin and the Office for National Statistics to create a national address database for the 2011 census separate of the PAF. \"It took 1/20th of that amount to do the data matching,\" Barr told the Guardian. He also said that the cost of upkeep put on the PAF by Royal Mail compared poorly with the costs of the Ordnance Survey, which is responsible for mapping all of Britain, with a national topographic database of 500m objects which sees thousands of changes per day - yet has a budget of \u00a3142m annually. Barr pointed out that in Holland, the government was forced to buy back its equivalent of PAF after privatisation because it needed it for public projects. The PASC notes in its report that despite the expansion of the availability of open data about government spending, \"there is no sign of the promised emergence of an army of armchair auditors\" - citizens who would check spending figures. But it noted that open data releases are often piecemeal and vary by department. It calls for the government to make far more data open, and to make early publication a priority ahead of certainty of accuracy in favour of revision where errors are found."
