  "content": "Freelance journalist Robin Ackroyd won a major victory today in his battle not to disclose the source of a story involving Moors murderer Ian Brady. Three appeal court judges overturned a high court ruling last October that Mr Ackroyd should identify any employee of Ashworth Special Hospital in Merseyside, who gave him confidential information about Brady's treatment there. Mr Justice Gray gave a summary judgment that Mr Ackroyd had no defence to the hospital trust's application after the Daily Mirror, which published the article, lost a similar battle over disclosure. Now Mr Ackroyd can argue his case at trial if the trust decides to take the case - which has already cost it \u00a3120,000 in legal fees - back to the high court. The hospital first took action against the Daily Mirror, which published the story in June 1999. The article did not carry Mr Ackroyd's byline. After the Mirror finally lost the case at the House of Lords, Mr Ackroyd admitted he was the author of the story and the order against the Mirror to divulge the information was applied to him."
