  "content": "Leading British and American companies face being dragged into an emerging fraud scandal at a call centre company in India. V-Angels, a Delhi-based outsourcing company that handles customer inquiries for telecoms firms in the West, has reported a number of employees to the police for allegedly stealing highly confidential customer data. Som Mandal, V-Angels' lawyer, confirmed that the firm had made a police complaint. He declined to identify V-Angels' clients, citing commercial confidentiality, but confirmed that they include 'half a dozen blue chip companies in Britain and the US'. BT, Cable &amp; Wireless and Vodafone all have substantial outsourcing operations in India but each denied this weekend that it had any contracts with V-Angels. Although nobody has yet been found guilty of wrongdoing, the affair will raise fears about cyber crime and data protection in India. Earlier this summer a worker at HSBC's data processing centre in Bangalore was charged with using British customers' personal details to raid their online accounts. Last year staff at another call centre were accused of stealing thousands of dollars from Citibank customers. Numerous banks and utility companies have moved their call centres to India, where labour costs are cheaper. The trend has been criticised by the Amicus union and some customers who have complained about poor service."
