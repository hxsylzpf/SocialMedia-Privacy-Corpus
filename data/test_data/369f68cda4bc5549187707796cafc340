  "content": "Lawyers for Ashley Cole are recruiting people who read the Sun and News of the World to act as witnesses for the football star in his libel action against the two papers. Law firm Teacher Stern Selby has launched a special online survey at Ashleycolesurvey.com that asks readers if they read any of the series of stories in the two papers in the between February 12 and 19, claiming that a \"well known DJ\" had taken part in \"perverted\" and \"debauched romps\" with two unnamed Premiership footballers. Cole sued the two papers for defamation after internet sites and chat rooms named him as one of the footballers in the story. The survey asks readers if they identified any of the unnamed men in the stories and also asks if readers used the internet to seek out the identity of the unnamed men. \"There are two reasons I have used the internet to facilitate a survey,\" said Cole's lawyer, Graham Shear. \"Firstly it allows me identity a group of possible witnesses from hopefully a broad base of people. \"And secondly it has enabled me to do it soon after the publication of articles about which we complained, so that the issues and articles are fresh in people minds.\" The website also asks if readers wrote any blogs about the issues, discussed it with friends or received any texts about it. TSS Law has taken out an advertising link the website on PinkNews.co.uk, the gay news website that has run stories about the News of the World story. The PinkNews.co.uk editor, Ben Cohen, said that the site was carrying a story and an advert linking to the survey because it had been the first to carry the original version of the doctored photograph that the News of the World ran to accompany its story. The website showed the News of the World photograph had an identical silhouette to a photograph of Cole and Choice FM DJ Masterstepz, who has joined Cole's legal action. The website estimates that more than 900 blogs have linked to or posted the photograph showing Cole and the DJ Masterstepz together at a Choice FM party. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
