  "content": "Buzzfeed, the social media website celebrated for its cat listicles, has moved into profit, with its founder declaring it is going to be one of the \"biggest sites on the web\" in a year's time. In what should be required reading for any newspaper or magazine editor or commercial manager paid to worry about the future of journalism, Buzzfeed founder Jonah Peretti has spelt out his vision of a future in which his creation will be \"leading news source for the social, media, mobile world\". Some of his memo to staff will make depressing reading for newspaper journalists. He talks of building the site's \"long form features\" and describes the company's potential to become \"a defining company, the role the traditional media companies played decades ago\". \"We don't have the trust the traditional news brands have won over the past 100 years, but we are working hard to earn it, and it won't take us 100 years to get there,\" said Peretti. In the memo, which itself comprises a list of the company's plans, he revealed that Buzzfeed had record traffic of 85 million unique visitors in August, triple what it was 12 months ago and eight times the traffic it had two years previously. \"By this time next year, we should be one of the biggest sites on the web,\" he said. \"We also booked record profit in August. We've gone from zero revenue four years ago to a profitable company with over 300 employees.\" Peretti added that \"despite the struggles of the traditional media, there remains an insatiable desire for great reporting, entertaining content and powerful storytelling\" and detailed plans to set up a newsroom to make the most of the \"opportunity to be the leading news source for the social, mobile, world\". Buzzfeed's iPhone app, is consistently in the top five in the news category, he said. Buzzfeed has recruited three heavy hitters to help in this: Steve Kanell, former editor of Spin, is to head up what he calls \"long form features\" and pioneer the \"social future of narrative journalism\"; while the Guardian's former Moscow correspondent, Miriam Elder, has been building a team of foreign correspondents. Lisa Tozzi, a former deputy editor on the New York Times's newsdesk, has been hired to run Buzzfeed's breaking news service. Peretti's zeal and determination to reinvent the wheel is probably the worst nightmare for newspapers and other print outlets struggling to adapt to the fast-changing consumer behaviour of the mobile and social media era. \"We will stay away from anything that requires adopting a legacy business model, even a lucrative one like cable syndication fees or primetime TV ads,\" said Peretti. Buzzfeed had more than 100m mobile visits in August and Peretti said this was no accident. \"We are fortunate enough we don't have the slideshows, banner ads, a complicated site design. \"We are lucky that 100% of our advertising is social content marketing \u2026 and we are lucky that our audience is young and embraced mobile content sooner than the general public\". Luck isn't good enough, he admitted, and Buzzfeed will be investing heavily in mobile technology. Also out in the brave new Buzzfeed world are traditional editorial, commercial and tech silos. Innovation in its video and graphic formats can only come from interdisciplinary efforts combining product, tech and editorial staff who will get together in weekly \"canary ops\" meetings, Peretti said. \"We are just scratching the surface of possible formats.\" This article was amended on September 6. The original headline said that Buzzfeed moved into profit four years after launch. It launched in 2006. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
