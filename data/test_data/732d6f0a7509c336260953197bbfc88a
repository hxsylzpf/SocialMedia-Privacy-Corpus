  "content": "I see Rupert Murdoch has come up with a foolproof method to ensure that the United States is safe from terrorism. In a tweet offering advice to the American president, he wrote: \"Obama facing enormous opposition in accepting refugees. Maybe make special exception for proven Christians\" Oh yes he did. Does the News Corp boss not realise that this is just the kind of response to terrorism that the terrorists seek to provoke? Ostracising all Muslims by refusing them sanctuary on the grounds that that they are potential terrorists is likely to be counter-productive. And, incidentally, is it not unChristian? I note that the editor of Newsnight, Ian Katz, tongue firmly in cheek, tweeted back to Murdoch: \"Interesting idea... will you come and talk about it on @BBCNewsnight\". But he didn't take up the offer. He obviously prefers to let his wisdom shine through in 140 characters. I am also queasy about the Tuesday editorial in Murdoch's favourite newspaper, the Sun, which called on British-based Muslims to prove their opposition to \"the jihadis\" by marching through London with placards saying \"not in our name\". Rightly, the paper points out that Isis \"seeks to establish violent, oppressive fundamentalism as the only true faith and to divide Muslims from non-Muslims.\" But I wonder whether the Sun realises that its message is similar: the effect of treating Muslims, all Muslims, as some kind of homogenous entity (and as a thing apart) is more likely to foment divisions with non-Muslims and alienate Muslims still further. Although I am sure this was not the Sun's intention, and that its motive was sincere, its demand for Muslims to demonstrate their opposition to terrorism is problematic."
