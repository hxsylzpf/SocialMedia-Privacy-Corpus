  "content": "Imagine the worst thing that could ever happen. Picture it in your head. Feel the pain. Now if you've conjured up the image of logging on to Facebook to discover you have ZERO FRIENDS, this film is likely to have you texting wtf to everyone you know. Omg it's another #social #media #horror, following the obnoxious Unfriended (2015); this time, another pretty vacant girl finds her digital and physical lives, like, totally ruined after deciding to unfriend a creepy girl who is then determined to make her a pariah. It's slickly made but shoddily scripted, with sub-reality TV dialogue (\"This chick is just damaged\") and a range of unengaged, soapy performances. There is some fun to be had from the loud and nasty death scenes though, which allow us the pleasure of seeing self-absorbed Facebook addicts get gruesomely murdered. Teens might like.",
  "lead": "Following the obnoxious Unfriended, here is another shoddily scripted film in which vacant teenage Facebook addicts meet with gruesome endings"
