  "content": "The Guardian has hired Martin Belam, founder of the Mirror's now-defunct UsVsTh3m, as social and new formats editor. Belam will work on developing an integrated social strategy for the Guardian, working alongside the community team. Mary Hamilton, the Guardian's executive editor of audience, said: \"We are thrilled that Martin will be joining us. A hugely talented journalist and designer, he brings with him a wealth of invaluable experience and is the perfect person to lead our new social strategy and team.\" Belam said: \"It's a fabulous opportunity to look at new ways of digital storytelling and to help the Guardian reach new audiences, all backed with the kind of world-class journalism at the heart of the stories that you expect from the Guardian.\" Belam was one of the architects of Trinity Mirror's social media strategy expansion which saw the launch of social sharing site UsVsTh3m and data journalism project Ampp3d. Trinity Mirror moved to close the sites last May, with the loss of almost 30 roles, citing high running costs for low volume of traffic. Belam, who has previously worked at the Guardian as head of user experience, has also worked for Sony and the BBC."
