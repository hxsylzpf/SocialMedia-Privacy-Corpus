  "content": "Andrew Parker became the first ever MI5 boss to give a live interview this morning, choosing the Today programme to emphasise the importance of being able to collect and monitor electronic activity. On Tuesday, internet and social media bosses were invited for a chat with the home secretary, and now there are reports of a new counter-terrorism bill coming before parliament within weeks. Something is clearly up: it seems the snooper's charter, the bill that refuses to die, is back on the agenda of a government that expected to have its ambitions curtailed by coalition, and now finds itself unbound \u2013 or at least bound only by the slender size of its majority. The demand for legislation to extend the gathering and retention of meta-data from telecommunications, the internet and social media has recurred almost annually since 2008. To question it is not to underestimate the security threat that the UK faces. That is unquestionably serious: according to Mr Parker, six attempts have been foiled in the past 12 months, the highest number in his long career. But, as David Anderson, the watchdog on terrorism laws, said in his important report A question of trust last June, the law as it is currently framed is inadequate. It needs a complete overhaul, a view supported only 10 days after the report's publication when the investigatory powers tribunal upheld a complaint for the first time in its existence, accepting the argument of the human rights organisation Amnesty International that GCHQ had been intercepting and monitoring its communications without explicit safeguards. The reason why these repeated proposals ran into the ground owes something to the efforts of the Lib Dems, and backbenchers like David Davis and Tom Watson, in the coalition years. They challenged the security services' recurrent dream in which they will gain the uncontested legal power to monitor all forms of communication \u2013 phone calls, email and social media \u2013 to discover who talks to whom, and when and where, even if they can't find out what is said. This is a bitterly contested area, for a number of reasons, not least that many people are sceptical about how useful it will be to gather more such data, when most of the attacks of the past decade succeeded despite the security agencies being aware of concerns about the perpetrators' potential for terrorism. As libertarians like to say, it is not helpful to put more hay on the haystack when you're searching for a needle-sized object. Nonetheless a new law does have to be framed if Mr Anderson's criticism of the status quo as \"undemocratic, unnecessary and \u2013 in the long run \u2013 intolerable\" is to be met. The headlines were grabbed by his proposal that judges, rather than ministers, should authorise the interception of communications. But on gathering communications data, he painted with a broader brush. He \u2013 and the parliamentary intelligence and security committee \u2013 suggested that parliament should be allowed to judge the purpose of each intrusive power, that it should be clearly described and limited, and subject to demanding safeguards. That is a big ask. The security services may spell out their general powers, as they have done recently with computer hacking and snooping on lawyers, but they won't detail the programmes like Prism or Tempora that were revealed by the leaks of the CIA contractor Edward Snowden. The meeting between Theresa May and BT and other providers was intended to secure their help in drafting a workable bill. But the world revealed by Snowden two years ago is already a different place. Criminals and terrorists, as well as most legitimate businesses \u2013 banking in particular \u2013 depend more than ever on encrypted communications, that no amount of cooperation from the tech companies can easily decode. Mr Parker's suggestion in his BBC interview that communication carriers have an ethical obligation to report suspicious activity carries no weight if they are no more able to detect it than the security agencies. Surveillance is only one arm of the government's policy, but defeating the ideology in the long run will matter more. That makes Mr Anderson's annual report this morning criticising the latest attempt to redefine extremism to include not just violent but \"vocal or active opposition\" to fundamental British values all the more damaging. He warns that the introduction of what amounts to thought crime could do more harm than good. This is an intensely difficult process. It is not to be rushed. Mrs May should slow down and get it right.",
