  "content": "Though initial calls for preparation regarding Hurricane Sandy were written off as overly cautious, it seems that the northern mid-Atlantic of the US and its 60 million residents are in for a historic storm whose powerful winds and strong deluge of rain could cause serious damage and keep many people housebound for several days. Fortunately, the areas expected to be most affected have received warnings from the government well in advance of the storm and the internet is rife with tips on how best to prepare for the storm. While important, these tips fail to mention the other side of hurricane preparation: the things you'll need when power-outage induced boredom strikes and you've been holed up with the same two people for days in a two-bedroom apartment. But on the internet, the multitudes have shared the ridiculous ways they are preparing for the super storm. One of the cities expected to be hardest hit by the storm is New York, where public transportation shut down Sunday at 7pm and is expected to remain closed through Wednesday. The ability of its denizens to adequately prepare for such a weather event is in doubt: The five boroughs are also filled with millions of people accustomed to keeping their fridges fairly bare due to the multitude of opportunities to dine out and get delivery food. Their preparatory food purchases indicate as much: New Yorkers aren't the only ones taking an unorthodox approach to food prep: It also happens to be Halloween weekend, which means the hungover hoardes had to parse through quickly emptying-shelves at half their normal mental capacity in the hopes of securing proper preparatory goods. Occasionally, they were costumed. Finally, if there is one bit of preparation that unites all, it is the intent focus on securing alcohol."
