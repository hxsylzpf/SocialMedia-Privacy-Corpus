  "content": "Facebook has too many friends. After a week of frenzied speculation, the company has disclosed it may have to go public as the number of its shareholders threatens to rise above 500, the limit for a privately held US company. It made the disclosure in a 100-page private-placement memo now being distributed to potential investors. This week it announced it had received a new round of investment worth $500m (\u00a3322m), at a price that values the company at $50bn. The news comes as the social networking company LinkedIn also considers an initial public offering (IPO) amid investor clamour for the new generation of internet firms. LinkedIn connects 85 million professionals and was one of the first social-media sites to claim profitability. It is not commenting on the speculation but is reportedly considering a formal announcement. Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, recently said he was against an IPO. But he may be pushed into going public by an investigation being mounted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is reviewing trading in Facebook and other hot social media companies including Zynga, maker of the popular social media games Farmville and Cityville. Under US law, a private firm with more than 500 investors is obliged to start publishing detailed financial statements like a public company. The 500-shareholder rule in part pushed both Google and Microsoft to go public. Goldman Sachs and Russian investor Digital Sky Technologies are pumping $500m into Facebook. Since the announcement, Goldman's clients have inundated the bank with requests for Facebook shares. The bank is planning to use a so-called special purchase vehicle to invest in Facebook \u2013 a move meant to circumnavigate the 500 shareholder rule. Digital Sky Technologies has also worked hard with Facebook to keep the numbers below the 500 limit, buying out shareholders to reduce their number. But the memo suggests Zuckerberg believes the size of the firm and the demand for shares threatens Facebook's privacy. Facebook refused to comment on the issue. Likewise, a LinkedIn spokesman said: \"We don't comment on speculation. An IPO is one of many tactics that we could choose to pursue. We are focused on building our business and doing what is in the best long-term interest of LinkedIn members and shareholders.\" Facebook and LinkedIn's moves come amid a feeding frenzy for social media firms. Groupon, a social media firm that offers local business discounts, is raising $1bn in new funds, and recently rejected a $6bn takeover offer from Google. Zynga is also believed to be considering an IPO."
