  "content": "Rachel Reeves, the shadow cabinet member, has spoken of her humiliation at being dubbed \"boring, snoring\" by the editor of Newsnight in a Twitter gaffe following her appearance on the show earlier this week. In her first interview since the storm over the tweet by Ian Katz on Monday, Reeves said voters would prefer a \"chief secretary to the Treasury who can add up the numbers\" to someone displaying \"a fantastic sense of humour or great wit\". She was also critical of Katz, former deputy editor of the Guardian, who has been editing Newsnight for two weeks. \"It's no way to talk about your guests. If he wants to make a decision that he doesn't want to discuss issues [like low pay] then that's fine, but he should just have some common decency,\" she said. The programme on Monday also featured the Arctic Monkeys and former energy secretary Chris Huhne talking about his experience of prison. \"Maybe in between such fun and excitement I was a bit boring. But it's Newsnight. It's supposed to cover news,\" said Reeves, remarking that \"the relentless grind of poverty\" experienced by ordinary people was \"not that exciting\". But she said she would still go on the programme, \"because that's my job\". Katz has since apologised to Reeves and the Labour party for what he called an \"ill-judged remark\". He had meant to send the tweet in a private direct message but instead it was seen by 26,000 followers and prompted Labour claims that the episode undermined BBC claims to impartiality. Katz wrote, in conversation with another Twitter user: \"Tnks \u2026 except for boring snoring rachel reeves. Playout was fun tho, wasn't it? telly MUCH netter [sic] than snooooozepapers innit.\" The post prompted an apparently sarcastic reply from Reeves, who simply said \"thanks \u2026\". Katz oversaw his first Newsnight programme last week. He succeeded Peter Rippon, who left the programme following the Jimmy Savile crisis. Reeves said: \"Glamorous and exciting are probably not two things you would want from someone in charge of public finances. You want someone who's steady, who's serious, who's responsible \u2013 and I hope I tick those boxes. I'm not a pop star or a movie star or a comedian, so I'm going to continue to be serious about the issues, and take them seriously.\" Reeves said her civil servant husband had been furious and she admitted the comment had been preoccupying her. She had has spoken to Katz following his written apology. \"I just said obviously I accept your apology, but I told him how I felt. That I felt slightly humiliated and frustrated that this is now going to define my return to politics. \"I think if the biggest thing I have got to worry about is whether Ian Katz thinks I'm boring then I haven't got many problems, have I?\" She said people in her constituency \"have had a lot harder things happen to them this week. They've had to put something back in the supermarket or worry about whether they can afford for their kids to go on a school trip this week.\" Despite just wanting \"to forget about it\", Reeves seems resigned to the boring label sticking. \"If you Google Rachel Reeves I expect you'll find lots of references to whether I'm boring or not.\"",
