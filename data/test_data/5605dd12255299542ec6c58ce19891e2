  "content": "More than 10% of UK mobile phone users accessed social networking websites such as Facebook, Bebo and MySpace via their handsets at least once a month in the first quarter of 2008, according to research. Nielsen Mobile, which is part of research group Nielsen, found that 21 million UK mobile phone subscribers - of a total of almost 48 million - belong to a social networking website. Out of this 21 million around 5 million, or about 25%, used their mobile phone to visit a social networking website each month in the UK in the first quarter of this year. Facebookers were found to be far and away the most likely to use their mobiles to update profiles, with around 557,000 accessing the website each month on average during the first quarter this year, according to research company Neilsen Mobile, sister company Nielsen Online. MySpace was the next most popular for mobile social networking with 211,000 UK users accessing the website via their phones in the first quarter. Bebo was third, with 162,000 mobile networkers, Windows Live Spaces fourth with 109,000 and Flixster at 90,000 completing the top five. The top 10 most visited social networking websites by mobile users also included Friends Reunited, Where Are You Now?, Yahoo Groups, Faceparty and BBC Communities. \"Social networking is already a global phenomenon and mobile could be the next big thing in the space,\" said Kent Ferguson, the client services manager at Nielsen Mobile. \"There could be increased demand for mobile social networking driven by the flat fee price plans offered by the leading operators that give subscribers unlimited mobile internet access.\" The most popular mobile social networking pastime was sending messages or mail to other users, with 55% of UK users accessing their profile doing so. This was followed by reading mail or messages at 47%, viewing pictures at 33%, uploading photos at 29% and adding friends at 21%. The rest of the top 10 was made up of activities including receiving text alerts, viewing profiles, creating or updating a profile, uploading a video and participating in a chat room. \"In an effort to differentiate their offerings and pull ahead all the [social] networks are looking to what the mobile medium can offer, particularly when it comes to attracting 15- to 24-year-olds, a group highly representative among social networking addicts,\" said Alex Burmaster, the European internet analyst at Nielsen Online. Neilsen's survey is based on interviews with just over 10,000 UK mobile phone users. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
