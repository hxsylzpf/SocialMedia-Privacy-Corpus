  "content": "Piers Morgan, the editor of the Mirror, has hit out against Naomi Campbell, describing her attempt to brand one of his columnists racist as \"disgusting\" in the high court today. Taking the witness stand for the second time to defend his paper in the privacy action brought by the model, he said Campbell was badly mistaken if she thought the paper was prejudiced towards black people. He was responding to criticism yesterday when Campbell said the paper's reference to her as a \"chocolate soldier\" was a \"racist slur\". \"Can I just say that Naomi Campbell's attempt to portray us as racist is very offensive to my paper. The attempt to bring the race card into this is disgusting. \"We are all aware of what the phrase 'chocolate soldiers' means and there is no racist connotation,\" he said. Campbell was described as \"chocolate soldier\" by columnist Sue Carroll a week after the article exposing her attendance at Narcotics Anonymous appeared. Carroll was referring to Campbell's decision to don a fur coat despite her previous links with anti-fur lobbyists. There was frantic argument over the origins of the phrase \"chocolate soldier\" with the judge, Mr Justice Morland, suggesting it arose during the Boer war while Morgan and his defence team argued that it had been coined during the second world war and referred to someone who wilts in the heat and is ineffective. Campbell's representative, Andrew Caldecott, QC, put it to Mr Morgan that it could be deemed a racist term. \"Would you call her a chocolate soldier to her face?\" he asked. Morgan replied: \"I would have no problem in using a common phrase with no racist connotations to it.\" Morgan added: \"Are you saying the word 'chocolate' is racist? If I have a cup of hot chocolate am I being racist? Mr Caldecott pressed him again: \"Are you suggesting she knew the connotations of his phrase?\" Morgan replied: \"I do not know. But I certainly wouldn't take her word for it.\" Campbell's ability to tell the truth is a key point in the defence's case. Yesterday under cross-examination she admitted it was \"misleading and untrue\" to say she had never touched drugs. She is attempting to prove the newspaper invaded her right to privacy when it snapped her emerging from a Narcotics Anonymous clinic last year. Morgan was also asked how long he had known Carroll and whether she had ever displayed racist behavior. He said he had known her for \"over 12 years\". In response to the racist allegations, the editor said: \"No, it is a ridiculous asssertion; in fact, quite the opposite.\" Morgan had earlier reminded the court of the paper's impeccable race credentials. He pointed out that it had championed the cause of Damilola Taylor, the 10-year-old Nigerian murdered in Peckham last year, and that of Stephen Lawrence, the teenager killed in a racist attack in south London. \"I don't want to be seen to be using this to promote ourselves but I don't believe she [Campbell] was unaware of this phrase.\" He also pointed out that the Mirror sponsored the Race in the Media awards and had run many in-depth anti-racist articles.",
