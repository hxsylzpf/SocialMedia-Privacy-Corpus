  "content": "The Chinese authorities have issued instructions to the country's media outlets to stop posting foreign news reports without government permission. The New York-based press freedom watchdog, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), reports that the order was made by China's \"state administration of press publication, radio, film and television\". Its directive \"on strengthening control of media personnel's online activities\" states: \"Without authorisation, no kind of media outlets shall arbitrarily use media releases from overseas media agencies and media websites.\" Evidently, the Beijing authorities suddenly realised that officially approved social media sites, such as Twitter-alike Sina Weibo, had enabled journalists to avoid press censorship. This meant it was possible for users to read foreign reports about major events, like the Wenzhou train crash and the Southern Weekly censorship protest. The new directive also requires editors to \"quickly delete harmful information\" and demands that editors \"receive permission from their work units to set up professional weibo accounts.\" Furthermore, they \"must not post information on weibo that violates laws, regulations, or managing rules from their own media organisations. Without approval, they are not permitted to post any kind of information obtained through their professional activities.\" The CPJ believes this to be \"the first major censorship directive to be handed down under the new government of Premier Li Keqiang.\" Source: CPJ",
