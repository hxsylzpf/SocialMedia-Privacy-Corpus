  "content": "The Free Our Data campaign has scored a major victory, with the announcement by the government that it intends to make Ordnance Survey maps free for use online by any organisation \u2013 including commercial ones \u2013 at resolutions more detailed than commercial 1:25,000 Landranger maps from April next year. The announcement of the opening of a consultation on the plan by Gordon Brown at Downing Street on Tuesday, as part of a seminar on making public data public \u2013 set in the wider context of public service reform, under the \"Smarter Government\" umbrella \u2013 indicates that the ideas underpinning the campaign have now been taken on board at the highest levels of government. \"Mid-range\" maps, with resolutions from 1:10,000 upwards, will be made available for re-use, under the plans announced by the prime minister, along with information on postcode areas and electoral and council boundaries. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, who was recruited by the prime minister in June to help open up government data, said that the revised terms for use of OS maps would also remove the \"derived data\" problem, under which OS claims full copyright on any intellectual property that is created with reference to an OS map. Berners-Lee said that within government there had been repeated complaints about the derived data issue stifling the freeing up of data. \"As we went around [government departments] to ask them about data sets we got consistent pressure from them\u2009\u2026\u2009people would say, 'I've got this great data set but I can't put it up because the OS won't allow me to.' People were coming back to me about it again and again.\" The issue appears to have gone to the top of government to be resolved. \"I have to thank the prime minister for pushing this through,\" said Berners-Lee. Although OS maps are enormously respected for the quality of their cartography, the price of using them online \u2013 and the associated problems with licensing, which has in the past been onerous \u2013 has been a thorn in the side of many would-be web entrepreneurs. The Free Our Data campaign, which began in Guardian Technology in March 2006, has reported on multiple examples in which companies have cited costs and derived data as a reason for refraining from using OS maps. Tuesday's announcement should also douse speculation about whether OS was in line for privatisation \u2013 an option that some had thought was being considered by the Shareholder Executive, the arm of the Treasury which officially oversees it. \"I'm dwelling on the OS data because it's a jewel, and in fact OS is a jewel in government \u2013 it has tremendous expertise,\" said Berners-Lee. The decision to move forward with the consultation with so little parliamentary time left indicates that the Labour administration recognises the value of making data free as a potentially vote-winner. Although the Conservative party has made a number of indications that it sees the value of free data \u2013 such as the espousal by Boris Johnson of crime mapping (quickly taken up by the home secretary Jacqui Smith at the end of 2008) and David Cameron's announced intention to make councils provide standardised XML feeds of expenditure and decisions \u2013 it has not yet made any manifesto commitments to making public sector data free. The announcement is subject to a consultation period which begins in December so that OS customers can comment on the proposals. In a brief statement on its website, OS says it \"is committed to working with colleagues across government on developing these proposals.\" OS did not have a representative at the seminar. Government sources at the seminar at No 10 indicated that the concept of making non-personal government data free is now a standard consideration when examining datasets that have been collected. Gordon Brown said that the provision of free data meant that \"we are on the verge of a revolution that can transform public services and the public sector\" and that opening up the OS data was \"one of the first recommendations made by Sir Tim\". He also cited the Highways Agency's release of accident data for London, which had led to cycling blackspot maps, and information about where to find dentists. \"This is information that should always have been [the public's] but there wasn't a way to get it out there,\" he said. The moves indicate that the government has absorbed the lessons contained in a report written for the Treasury by a team at Cambridge University and published with the budget last year. That found that making OS's data free for everyone to use would cost government \u00a312m but bring commercial benefits worth \u00a3156m in total \u2013 which would thus make up in tax revenue the \"lost\" income to OS. The Guardian understands that the latest move has come through efforts by Liam Byrne, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who before he became an MP worked for a dot-com startup. Michael Nicholson of Intelligent Addressing, which has lobbied over OS's licensing practices relating to online and other maps, gave the news a cautious welcome: \"It's not the crown jewels [of mapping]. It's a real step in the right direction, but not quite far enough.\" A key issue, he said, would be that in future OS data \"should be made available to commercial companies in a way that's fair, and at a price that's fair\". Earlier this year OS had suggested a different strategy, after claiming in May that a \"free data\" model would cost the government \"between \u00a3500m and \u00a31bn\" over five years. It said that these figures emerged from an \"international study\" carried out internally, which compared costs and funding models at other mapping agencies in different countries. Sir Rob Margetts, recently appointed chair of OS, said that the calculations had been done with \"outside help\". OS said that its report was examined and agreed by an \"international expert\". But the text of the report, obtained by the Guardian under Freedom of Information requests, does not back up the claims of cost. A leaked presentation made to the previous minister in charge of OS which appeared on Wikileaks seems to show how the figures were arrived at \u2013 but those numbers are also open to doubt. OS has refused to comment on the leaked presentation. OS already makes maps available for use online, but any commercial use means substantial charges. Making \"mid-range detail\" OS maps available for free online use by commercial organisations is the most significant step in the government's use of online maps in many years.",
