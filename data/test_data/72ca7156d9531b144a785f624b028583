  "content": "The Sun may end up apologising to Stan Collymore again after the footballer complained to the Press Complaints Commission over a correction in the paper his lawyers say was inadequate. The tabloid newspaper, edited by Rebekah Wade, was found guilty by the PCC of a \"serious\" breach of its code of practice after it failed to make it explicit enough that a front-page \"confession\" by the footballer was faked. The paper printed the commission's adjudication on New Year's Eve - not traditionally a big sales day. It was reported in a 94-word story on the bottom right hand side of page two, under the headline \"Colly Rap\", with the full adjudication printed on page 32. Collymore's lawyers, David Price, say the headline was misleading and that the adjudication was not given the due prominence required by the PCC's code of practice. \"We are not happy about the prominence [given to the adjudication]\", said barrister Korieh Duodu of David Price. \"We don't feel the Sun has complied with the obligation to publish the adjudication with due prominence. We are going to be writing to the chairman of the PCC [Sir Christopher Meyer] about this and are considering the possibility of making a follow-up complaint.\" In its ruling, which was made before Christmas, the PCC said the Sun breached clause one of its code of practice, which deals with accuracy, and clause 10, which forbids newspapers from using subterfuge to get a story unless it is in the public interest. The front page story, which appeared on November 3, appeared to include a signed \"confession\" by Collymore in which he admitted he was a \"lying scumbag\" who had \"wasted his talent\". The story also claimed that Collymore had admitted to starting a fracas with six Bath rugby union players at a nightclub in Dublin the previous weekend. But it was only in the fifth paragraph of the story that the paper revealed that Collymore was tricked into signing the confession at a book signing. \"Knowing he would never sign the confession willingly, we got Sun girl Michelle Dickie, 19, to hand it to him at a book signing session at a WH Smith branch in Newcastle,\" it said. \"Collymore thought he was giving a fan an autograph and signed the piece of paper with 'best wishes' - not realising the confession was on the other side.\" In its ruling, the PCC said the story was \"entirely misleading\". It said the paper \"had not taken sufficient care to highlight the way in which the confession had been obtained. Its failure to do so was neither within the letter nor the spirit of the code and was a serious breach of clause one.\" The code says any publication judged to have breached the code \"must print the adjudication in full and with due prominence, including in the headline reference to the PCC\". The Sun declined to comment. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
