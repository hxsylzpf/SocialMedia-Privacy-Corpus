  "content": "Graeme Swann's explanation to Nottingham magistrates court about his charge of drink-driving \u2013 that he was on a 3am mission to rescue his pet cat Max from an untimely demise under the floorboards of his home \u2013 has been ridiculed by his England team-mate Kevin Pietersen. Pietersen, a Twitter novice, wrote: \"2 hours with @Swannyg66 this am and I'm still not having this 'cat' story!! Haha.\" Swann, whose case has been adjourned until 7 October, responded: \"Such a shame my teammates are so remedial in their 'banter'. Must be because they're all south African.\""
