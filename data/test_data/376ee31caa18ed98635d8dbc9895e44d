  "content": "Mr Justice Eady's recent drubbing by the House of Lords in the case of Jameel v Wall Street Journal does not seem to have deterred him from making bold judgments. However, an analysis of his decision last week in the case of CC v AB - to grant CC an injunction against AB from disclosing details of his identity and details of his affair with AB's wife - may not be as bold as it appears; rather the correct exposition of the developing law of privacy and confidence. The case concerns an alleged affair between a well-known sports figure and a woman whose husband may want to make the details of that affair public. In granting the injunction, Mr Justice Eady ruled that as CC's wife was receiving medical treatment for stress, her condition was quite likely to be made worse by press exposure. In coming to his conclusion, he seems to have rested on the argument of breach of confidence. He stated: \"Since it is not yet recognised that English domestic law offers an enforceable right to privacy as such, it [the claim] has been put on the basis that any such communication would be a breach of confidence\". It may be that the decision was formulated on this basis to bring it within the established principles of Argyll v Argyll, which protected the Duchess of Argyll from the publication of revelations about her marriage and also the case cited by Mr Justice Eady, Stephens v Avery, which protected the details of a lesbian relationship. While parliament has not fashioned an independent law of privacy, following the House of Lords decision in Naomi Campbell v MGN, Lord Justice Nicholls confirmed that the continuing use of the phrase \"duty of confidence\" and the description of information as confidential was not altogether comfortable. Importantly, he went on to state that the reasonable expectation of privacy has a threshold test which brings a balancing exercise into play. Once the information is identified as private the court must balance the claimant's interest in keeping the information private against the countervailing interests of the recipient in publishing it. These countervailing interests encapsulated the rights under Articles 8 and Articles 10 of the Human Rights Act which concern the respect for private and family life against the rights of freedom of expression. Whether recognising protection of confidentiality or the preservation of private information, the case of CC v AB appears to run contrary to the Court of Appeal in the A v B (Flitcroft v MGN Limited), where the footballer Garry Flitcroft failed to maintain an injunction granted earlier against the Sunday People preventing the newspaper from publishing the kiss and tell story of his two mistresses. Significantly that case was decided before the decision of the European Court in von Hannover v Germany where the constant publication of photographs of Princess Caroline von Hannover was found to amount to a breach of her Article 8 rights. Lord Justice Sedley in his recent Blackstone lecture said: \"Its implications for our own law are far-reaching. They make it extremely doubtful whether the Flitcroft case could now be decided as it was. They require the courts, as the limb of the state on whose custody the common law rests, to protect people's privacy against any incursions which are not justified by the free speech requirements of general public debate.\" Mr Justice Eady's decision in the case of CC v AB is in line with his decision in McKennitt v Ash, where he granted an injunction to the folk singer Loreena McKennitt against Niema Ash from publishing an unauthorised book about McKennitt, including details of her sexual relationships. The judge's development of a law of confidence and privacy, allows us to enjoy his Chaucerian reference to \"cuckholded husbands\". Were Chaucer trying to sell this modern-day Miller's Tale to the tabloids, it appears that the Human Rights Act would prevent it. \u00b7 Sarah Webb is head of defamation at Russell Jones &amp; Walker"
