  "content": "When I broke the neck of my sick cat and then made a handbag of her skin, I honestly had no idea of what I had got myself into. The project was an artwork entitled My dearest cat Pinkeltje, with which I wanted to launch a discussion about hypocrisy. We simultaneously keep animals both as part of our families and as a commodity to be consumed. We live in a culture where the origin of our food or clothing is seldom seen, and we hand our sick pets over to an expert to be given a lethal injection to end their suffering. Did you know that there is still disagreement about the so-called \"painless\" euthanasia performed by professional vets? People in rural areas \u2013 where they take such matters into their own hands \u2013 laugh at these tales from the city. So I uploaded a manual in which I described step by step \"how to kill your cat\", and how to turn it into a bag. I also gave presentations in which I described these acts. Outcry from the online world followed. Blogs and activist sites published stories about the \"atrocity\" I had committed. Chain mails rotated: \"A sick woman has murdered her cat as art and the bitch must die. Do not look at her website because she earns money on that.\" To them, the fact that I had also made a purse out of her skin showed my disrespect towards the animal kingdom all the more. In a matter of days, my mailbox was flooded with violent threats and death wishes. In four years, I have received about 100,000 responses. The senders came from all walks of life. I know this because many emails automatically included a signature with a link to a personal or company website. A combination of a false sense of anonymity and the idea that everything digital is \"not authentic\" makes sending hate mail easy. I had the impression that people who described graphically how they wanted to tear me apart, rape me and have me bleed to death would not say such things to my face. One morbidly obese woman who was very active on dieting forums cursed my hideous appearance. Amateur artists argued I was a failure of an artist. Animal rights activists cursed my work, believing it encouraged animal abuse. Frequently, you could guess \u2013 through the violent scenarios described \u2013 the most recent horror movie the sender had seen. I decided those threats had to be turned into a book. For almost a year, the editor Coralie Vogelaar studied the contents of my mailbox and researched the writers' identities online. The hate mails were categorised, and in total we defined 12 variations of content and format, which became the book's chapters. We published not only the hate mails, but also all the information we found on the Facebook profiles, Amazon wish lists, and YouTube accounts that were linked to the email addresses. The combination of the data often gave a very comprehensive picture of the \"private\" lives of these people. In some instances, we even found pictures of their houses on Google maps. Most of those menacing emails were sent by people who appeared quite normal: sweet-looking teenage girls, policemen, housewives, office workers. With only a few exceptions, these were not people you would expect to brawl, let alone issue a death threat. Publishing their details was a way to bring them to account: you want me dead, but who are you anyway? It also allowed for the concept of anonymity \u2013 something most web users take for granted \u2013 to be discussed. How public is your online information and how much harm can an online diary do when the whole world has access to your personal life? For me, those are important questions that should be given attention to in primary school. I would call the class \"Web ethics and a guide to privacy\" \u2013 and maybe add a little decency to the mix.",
