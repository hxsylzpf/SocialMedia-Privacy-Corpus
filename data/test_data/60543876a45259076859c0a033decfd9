  "content": "When a plane slid off the runway in Denver on Sunday, Twitter users were among the first to hear about it, because someone who was on the plane sent a tweet \u2013 a Twitter message \u2013 that said: \"Holy fucking shit I was just in a plane crash!\" Twitter users were also among the first to hear about terrorist attacks in Mumbai, earthquakes in California, and Heath Ledger's death. And as more people sign up, there will more likely be Twitter users around whenever something newsworthy happens. It's like having a wire service with millions of reporters. Twitter is a \"micro-blogging\" service, but it's a more like a combination of instant messaging, social networking and SMS on steroids. You send messages with up to 140-characters, from either a PC or a mobile phone. But instead of going to a single person, they go to anyone who wants to listen: your followers. You, in turn, receive the messages sent by all the people you follow. The result is a stream of messages that you can dip into whenever you like. Obviously, when most people answer the standard Twitter question \u2013 \"What are you doing?\" \u2013 they're not doing anything newsworthy. However, even a homely update such as \"am going to bed with wife to watch tv. Yay! i have a wife\" can be interesting, if only because it came from Jonathon Ross (wossy). One way to use Twitter is to follow the headline news services, such as the New York Times, CNN's Breaking News, and the BBC. The Guardian's Technology section has been tweeting stories for some time. Lots of blogs also have Twitter feeds, including Boing Boing, Lifehacker and TechCrunch. You can also follow other people in your field, which I do. There's no shortage of technology writers on Twitter, though not every topic is well served. There's just a handful of famous names, such as Stephen Fry, John Cleese, MC Hammer and Shaquille O'Neal, but you can expect more. Twitter offers a way to reach thousands of fans, and it's free. Don't be afraid to follow anybody who looks interesting. It's just as easy to un-follow them if you change your mind. You can also block people you don't want to follow you. But, as with Facebook, most people use Twitter to chat with friends and colleagues with both public and direct (private) messages. I signed up a week ago because the rest of the Guardian's Technology team was already using it. Twitter is spreading virally, like MSN Messenger and Facebook. It may infect you sooner than you think. Twitter is very easy to use: go to site, type text in box, press post. But it also has lots of supporting software and services, including the iTweet web site and desktop programs such as Twhirl and TweetDeck. You can search tweets at Twitter or at TweetScan, track your usage at TweetStats, find the Twitter elite at Twitter Grader, and so on. Finally, you can see what I'm twittering about at jackschofield"
