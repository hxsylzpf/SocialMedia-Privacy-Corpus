  "content": "Is there some kind of a mutual love-in going on between Scotland Yard and the News of the World that led the police to go easy on the newspaper over the phone-hacking scandal? The answer to that question goes to the heart of the delicate relationship between the police and the media \u2013 a relationship that directly affects the way in which the criminal justice system, in particular, and law and order in general, works in Britain. The roots of the problem go back to the early 1970s when Scotland Yard's then new commissioner, Sir Robert Mark, appointed with a brief to stamp out corruption in the police service, began by introducing an \"open door\" policy towards the press. He did this against a background of sleaze in an era when many, if not most, \"exclusive\" crime stories were obtained through the dubious means of crime reporters paying detectives for information. Mark's rationale was simple. For a largely unarmed police force of fewer than 200,000 to keep Britain within the law required a large degree of co-operation from the public \u2013 co-operation that could only be obtained through positive coverage in the media. The police are public servants and therefore, with very few specific exceptions, the public has a right to know what they are up to. He ordered that all his officers should henceforth give information, about matters within their own direct knowledge, freely to the media. It was a policy which became a blueprint for police/media relations throughout Britain and is still nominally in force today. The introduction of this new approach had a polarising effect. On the one hand the old school detectives brought up in the corrupt culture simply retrenched and refused to co-operate. In their eyes they had lost their power \u2013 their ability to manipulate the press. On the other hand a new generation of officers, emboldened by the support of their boss, seized the opportunity to develop closers ties with the press and in the process many of them became media stars in their own right. Gradually, over the years, those two positions have changed. The numbers of policemen who will do anything to see their name up in lights have dwindled and the hard men have gained the upper hand. They will pay lip service to the need for openness in the interests of good public relations but in reality they are intent on merely passing on snippets of information to news-hungry hacks only when it suits their own purposes. Throughout all this the News of the World has become something of a special case. In the upper echelons of Scotland Yard there is a recognition that, as the biggest-selling Sunday newspaper in the world, the paper wields enormous power and influence over a large number of readers. There is genuine admiration for the way in which the newspaper has successfully conducted undercover operations which have brought major criminals to book over the years. As a result there is undoubtedly a cosy relationship between the yard and all of Rupert Murdoch's News International titles. Several retired commissioners and senior officers have found space as columnists or regular writers in the Sun and the News of the World. There has always been an uneasy yet mutually useful relationship between the police and investigative journalists. The police have powers that allow them to cut through all manner of obstructions when it comes to probing crimes. But they do not have unlimited financial resources and therefore cannot always pursue lengthy inquiries, especially overseas. Wealthy newspapers such as the News of the World do have the resources and are not constrained in quite the same way that the police are by, for instance, judge's rulings and the rules of sub judice. The competitive nature of newspaper journalism, however, inevitably leads to temptations. As the desire for bigger and better exclusive stories intensifies there are those who are prepared to push the boundaries of legality in the pursuit of a \"scoop\". And, in the digital internet age, the technical means to snoop and breach the privacy of individuals has become all too easy. The suggestion of wholesale hacking which emerged during the trial of News of the World royal reporter Clive Goodman four years ago came as no surprise to the rest of Fleet Street. Among crime reporters there has long been a feeling of disquiet over the way the News of the World obtains some of its stories. Most newspapers nowadays would not pay public servants for information and almost all would refuse to break the law unless it could be clearly demonstrated that to do so would be directly in the public interest. Trawling through the private telephone conversations of royals, politicians and celebrities in the hope of picking up scandalous gossip is not seen as legitimate news gathering and the techniques of entrapment which led to the recent Pakistani match-fixing scandal, although grudgingly admired in this particular case, are derided as manufacturing the news. Very few such \"manufactured\" crimes exposed by the News of the World in recent years have actually led to a conviction."
