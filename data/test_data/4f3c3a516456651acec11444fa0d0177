  "content": "Instagram has threatened to shut down Madonna's photo-sharing account, claiming the singer has violated their community guidelines. Madonna posted her letter from \"the Instagram Team\" without offering any comments on its contents. \"Dear Madonna,\" it begins. \"It has come to our attention that your account on Instagram has violated our community guidelines \u2026 We ask that you: don't share photos that aren't yours [and] don't share photos that show nudity or mature content.\" The notice also cited two other rules, concerning \"photos of illegal content\" and \"photos that attack an individual or group\". It is not clear which of Madonna's photos provoked the ire of Instagram's monitors. Since launching her account in November, the singer has only posted 19 photos. Most of them are hardly controversial: self-shots of Madonna's lips, the image of a horse, a valentine from her daughter. But Madonna hasn't always been so demure. In one photo,there is a glimpse of the singer's cleavage. In another, shot during one of the Material Girl's recent concerts, her bottom features prominently. Still, none of this seems more tawdry than the average 19-year-old's Twitter-stream feed. More likely, Facebook-owned Instagram is leery of the photos Madonna has shared of painter Frida Kahlo. One of these was taken by Antonio Kahlo, the other by Lucienne Bloch. Madonna hasn't responded directly to Instagram's letter, leaving it to her 150,000-plus followers to comment on the notice. Last week, Billboard named Madonna the highest-earning musician of 2012, collecting almost $35m (\u00a323m) \u2013 most of it from concerts. She last topped the Billboard list in 2008."
