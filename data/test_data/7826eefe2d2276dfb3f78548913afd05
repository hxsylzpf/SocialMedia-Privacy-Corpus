  "content": "Sad news for anyone who has been following Maya Angelou on Twitter - it turns out that whoever it is that has been tweeting there, it certainly wasn't the award-winning poet and memoirist, as the LA Times has discovered. The author of such resonant lines as \"History, despite its wrenching pain/ Cannot be unlived, and if faced/ With courage, need not be lived again\", and \"If one is lucky, a solitary fantasy can totally transform one million realities\", has apparently been tweeting since 3 February, when he or she announced: \"Why hello everyone. This is Maya Angelou, I am sorry I can't be with you physically, but I am there in spirit.\" The tweeter has already garnered 2,579 followers, but according to Angelou's agent, the account is bogus. \"It's sad that this even goes on in our society,\" he told the LA Times. \"But anyone who reads it and knows her goes, 'Who the hell wrote this?' ... Let's put it this way. It's sophomoric versus doctoral.\" Fair enough, but I think I'll sign up as a follower anyway. I'm weirdly fascinated by the kind of person who would go to this much effort. Anyway, I'm ever so inspired by this morning's tweet, and am going to bear it in mind throughout the day: \"Let's remember something very important: It is as important to love ourselves as much as the world around us.\" Ah, the wisdom of Twitter ..."
