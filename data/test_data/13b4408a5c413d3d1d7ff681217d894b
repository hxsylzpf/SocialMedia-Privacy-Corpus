  "content": "If you've ever travelled to a city for business and found out afterwards that a friend or contact was also there, you'll want to know about Dopplr, a travel-focused social network. Dopplr is a London startup success, recently acquired by the mobile phone giant Nokia, which said the price was a \"fraction\" of the reported \u20ac10m-\u20ac15m. Dopplr allows you to easily see if you'll be crossing paths with people in your network when you travel. It will also show you if anyone in your network will be passing close to home. Like all good web 2.0 applications, it works with other services. You can invite people to join from your personal or work email contacts, and also invite friends on Facebook, Twitter and contacts on the photo-sharing service Flickr. Travellers add trips to the service via Google Calendar or Yahoo's Upcoming service, via email or even via Twitter, and can publish their itinerary on Facebook or the business network Xing. It has a nice iPhone application that can show you recommendations for restaurants, places to stay or attractions from other Dopplr users. For the environmentally conscious, there's also a carbon calculator that shows you the impact of your travel. Since Nokia bought Dopplr there has been speculation that the acquisition was really about buying the talent of its chief executive, Marko Ahtisaari, and its chief technology officer, Matt Biddulph. Yet Nokia has been keen to respond to the challenge of the iPhone and BlackBerry. Adding Dopplr to its Ovi Maps also takes on location-based social networks such as Foursquare and Google's Latitude. Whatever the future, Dopplr is part of the growing segment at the intersection of social networking, location and mobile."
