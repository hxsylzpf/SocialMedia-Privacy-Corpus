  "content": "Oh dear. The Guardian's HackGate revelations have prompted deployment of the R-word again, only days after George Osborne was \"relaxed\" about his expenses. Mid-morning and David Cameron is still \"relaxed\" about allegations that Andy Coulson, his director of communications, must \u2013 or should \u2013 have known about rampant abuse of phone interceptions when he was editor of the News of the World. He's confirmed him in his job. Cameron is a cool customer, but he should be fretting more than a bit. Coulson was either \"totally incompetent or aware,\" I've just heard publicist, Max Clifford, say on the radio. Plenty of others with scores to settle are saying the same thing, including John Prescott, a frequent target of NoW and Sun bullying. Of course, the Tory leader's confidence may be justified. In the Guardian Nick Davies explicitly writes that he does not know \"the extent of the personal knowledge\" of the scam on the part of Coulson or Rebekah Wade, another ex-NoW editor, now Rupert Murdoch's new chief executive. But, as we routinely see in tussles of this kind, information has a habit of trickling out in ways that eventually lead to resignations. It may be unfair, but to resign first and then fight to clear your name is often the best advice. It would be a loss for Cameron \u2013 Andy Coulson's a sharp chap. But so was Damian McBride after his fashion. Alastair Campbell was a scholar and a gent by comparison. But the party political angle is only part of this story. As MPs are complaining on the floor of the house as I type, a lot of people in public life \u2013 showbiz, sport, business as well as politics \u2013 seem to have had their phones (mostly their sex lives from what I can see) targeted. Charles Clarke, who has raged often enough against the press, complains that the Murdoch empire often behaves as if it is \"above the law.\" Speaker Bercow has granted an emergency question. That too is a welcome development. Speaker Martin granted too few. David Hanson, junior Home Office minister, is struggling to provide answers. It is a rare chance for MPs to whack the media back after months of torment over expenses. Outraged Labour MPs are sounding positively frisky for the first times in ages. News International above the law? It does occasionally give that distinct impression. The Met police, the feeble Press Complaints Commission (PCC), even courts that also went along with the suppression of significant evidence of wrong-doing in this case all have public-interest questions to answer. If openness and accountability is the right answer for politicians and bankers, so it is for the largely unaccountable media, especially the muscular end of the business, the one that intimidates a lot of people. Only the other week posters complained when I noted the way Rupert deploys his media to attack the BBC \u2013 thereby promoting his rival commercial interests. Okay, he's entitled to do it, but we're entitled to point it out. It is worth noting in passing that today's edition of the Jacko-soaked Sun carries not a line on Davies's allegations that I can see, though in a 24/7 news environment they were all over GU, radio and TV by 7pm. But Kelvin Mackenzie's column still begins: \"The revolting, criminally minded MPs who run our country ...\" Routine, cynical abuse, but the tone is hardly supportive of civic spirit among Sun readers, is it? And they wonder why they don't vote. The Times, still a pretty respectable paper, carries the main points on an inside page. Well done, I expect the staff are pretty cross since their own paper turned down the MPs' expenses CDs \u2013 which the Telegraph later got \u2013 precisely because company policy is not to pay for information (ho, ho). Much more interesting, the Mail carried only a short story, no byline, on an inside page. The reason journalists admire the Mail, often through gritted teeth, is that it is so professional. It almost never misses serious breaking stories. The downplay will be deliberate. What does it tell us? The Mail is generally less collusive with governments than most papers \u2013 especially Murdoch. But it must be aware that this sort of row \u2013 exploding the \"rogue operator\" defence that sent the NoW's royal reporter to jail \u2013 is bad for some of its working practices, too. This is partly about a culture war that puts the Guardian, the FT, Indy and the BBC \u2013 and their readers, listeners and viewers \u2013 on one side, the redtops and their allies on the other. Who are their allies? Very often the coppers, for a host of reasons. In the ranks they're more likely to be tabloid readers for one thing, and share the tabs' view of crime and criminals. The hapless Sir Ian Blair, late of the Met, was not that kind of copper: he's gone. But it is also about new invasive technologies. Newspapers rightly bang on about government intrusion via CCTV cameras, 42-day detention, databases, interception and the rest. They say less about their own tactics, which have less claim on the public interest defence \u2013 as distinct from what interests the (prurient) public. Today's Guardian list of NoW or Sun targets suggest that sexual activity of one kind or another is the most common thread \u2013 the Max Mosley sting, that sort of thing. Wayne Rooney's love life was a case where Merseyside police played a less than wholesome role. There's also the PCC. But to state again that it is a feeble regulator is seriously to scrape the barrel. This week politicians are voting, albeit reluctantly, to hire an external regulator for their wayward practices. What's sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander?"
