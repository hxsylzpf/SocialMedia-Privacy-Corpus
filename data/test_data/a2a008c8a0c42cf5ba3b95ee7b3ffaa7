  "content": "Dell stirred up a little commotion earlier today when it said that sales made through its DellOutlet Twitter account had earned the company around $2m. In fact, says Dell tweeter Stefanie N, it may be even more than that: We're also seeing that it's driving interest in new product as well. We're seeing people come from @DellOutlet on Twitter into the Dell.com/outlet site, and then ultimately decide to purchase a new system from elsewhere on Dell.com. If we factor those new system purchases that come from @DellOutlet, we're actually eclipsed $3 million in overall sales. This all sounds great for Dell and its public relations (it's going gangbusters, says the Register ), and equally good news for Twitter, making some wonder whether this is the sort of thing the site should be charging for. However, I think it's worth looking sceptically at the numbers. $2m is not even a drop in the ocean compared to Dell's overall sales of $12bn in the last three months (stat fans: Twitter is the sales channel for 0.008% of Dell stock) and overall the company's sales are taking a beating - down 23% for the most recent quarter. So it's worth considering whether this is actually about gaining customers, or just building a new relationship with customers Dell already has. Like the arguments over whether a music track downloaded illegally is a lost sale, we can ask whether every sale on Twitter is a sale gained, or just an existing customer who is using a different method to get what they're looking for (often with an extra discount). Ultimately, it's impossible to know without surveying Dell's customers. So, if you've bought through this method, let us know in the comments why: would you have bought Dell otherwise? It's worth trying to get to the bottom of these numbers to try and make some sense out of them before the marketing gurus start spinning the line that you can make millions from Twitter."
