  "content": "It may prompt some spluttering from the Pimms and cucumber sandwich brigade. But after a winter of negative headlines off the pitch and indifferent performances on it, the England and Wales Cricket Board has vowed to embrace Twitter, Facebook and other modern marketing tricks as part of a drive to expand the appeal of the sport during what will be its busiest summer ever. As the new county season starts today, the ECB has promised to fight the all-consuming popularity of football by taking advantage of a summer where there are no major international football tournaments to reach a wider audience and encourage newcomers to sample the sport. There is more at stake than simply boosting attendances. The ECB executives, criticised over their links with disgraced Texan billionaire Sir Allen Stanford, are hopeful that a successful summer will redeem their reputations, set the tone for a five-year strategic plan, and provide a new direction for a sport in flux. This summer will not only see the Ashes return to these shores for the first time since the triumphant summer of 2005 but, before that, the arrival of the West Indies for a short tour. In between, the ECB hopes the ICC World Twenty20 tournament in June will build on the popularity of the shorter format of the game. It emerged last week that supporters will be allowed to wear fancy dress at Lord's for the first time during the ICC World Twenty20 and organisers are hoping the charged atmosphere of the Indian Premier League and the county version of the Twenty20 game will translate to the international arena. \"This is the biggest summer of cricket ever to take place on these shores. This really is cricket's time. There's no World Cup, there's no European Championships, there's no Olympics,\" said the ECB's head of marketing, Will Collinson. The ECB has launched official Twitter, Facebook and YouTube channels in an effort to promote the game beyond its normal fanbase. Twelfth Man, a \"fan community\", will act as a focal point for fixtures, ticket information and debate. A \"Twelfth Man van\" will tour grounds to record footage of fans to be broadcast online and on big screens. Pete Ackerley, head of development at the ECB, said the sport had learned the lessons of the summer of 2005, when the exploits of Andrew Flintoff, Kevin Pietersen and Michael Vaughan in regaining the Ashes helped the sport achieve a huge boost in popularity before there was a structure in place to fully exploit it. Shaun Udal, the veteran Middlesex captain who was a surprise inclusion in the 30-man England squad for the ICC Twenty20 World Cup, said persuading those attracted by the thrills and spills of the Twenty20 game of the merits of the longer form could be hard. \"Twenty20 is the only form of the game that appeals to young children and ladies. To get them from a game that is over and done with in three hours to one that takes several days is going to be very difficult,\" he said. \"But in terms of trying to enjoy the summer, that will be easy. Twenty20 cricket sells itself - it's a great afternoon or evening out.\" Reflecting the shift in the balance of power in the cricket world towards the sub-continent since the last domestic Ashes series, Flintoff and Pietersen will begin this summer earning big money in the IPL, which is taking place in South Africa owing to security concerns. There are growing fears that the introduction of new competitions like the IPL and the crowded international calendar will continue to overshadow the county championship and other domestic competitions such as the NatWest Pro40, a limited-overs contest that will be ditched at the end of this season. But the ECB insists the high profile of the international game this summer can both encourage youngsters to take up the sport and boost attendances at county grounds. It will seek to link the international and county games under a marketing campaign and website with the tagline The Great Exhibition. Everyone who attends an international Twenty20, one-day international or Test match will receive a personalised email offering cut-price admission to their local county ground. The stakes are high for ECB chairman Giles Clarke and chief executive David Collier, who were heavily criticised for their alliance with Stanford, accused in January of a \"fraud of shocking magnitude\". Not only must they plot a course that maintains a balance between money-spinning international cricket and visibility for the county game, but they must prove their decision to hand exclusive live TV rights to Sky in a \u00a3300m deal was the right one. This summer will be the first time a domestic Ashes series has not been screened live on terrestrial television. It will take place against the backdrop of a government review of the legislation that governs which sports are placed on the \"crown jewels\" list of events of national importance that must be shown on free-to-air television. The ECB will point to statistics showing participation in the sport is up 24% in the past year, and county attendances by 7% on 2007, as evidence that its strategy of investing the Sky millions in grassroots cricket is working. But figures from Mintel published last month showed that interest in cricket among the general public was down by 5.8% during the same year. Those who criticised the lack of live coverage on free-to-air television have argued the sport will gradually lose its profile as a result. The ECB's marketing men hope a series of Cricket in the Park events in Cambridge, Derby, Liverpool, Southampton and London will help deflect any criticism. Fans will be able to follow the Ashes on big screens and take part in interactive games and attractions, including a Sky Sports coaching clinic.
