  "content": "Australia's privacy commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, has found the immigration department unlawfully disclosed the personal details of almost 10,000 asylum seekers in a damning report into a major data breach that has led to more than 1,600 complaints. In February Guardian Australia revealed the immigration department had inadvertently disclosed the personal details of almost 10,000 people in detention, sparking an investigation by the commissioner. The breach had widespread ramifications for asylum seekers in detention centres, some of whom have argued in a series of court cases that the exposure of their details has put them at risk if they are returned home. The commissioner's investigation, released on Wednesday, found the department breached two of the information privacy principles under the Privacy Act \u2013 disclosure of personal information and failing to have reasonable safeguards in place to protect information \u2013 as a result of a series of failures to adequately check and review documents that were published online. The report found: The department should have de-identified this type of sensitive personal information, which could have avoided such a serious breach of information The department took 13 days to request the information be removed from the Internet Archive after it was informed of the breach by Guardian Australia. This left the data publicly exposed for 16 days after the breach was reported. This finding directly contradicts claims made about the accessibility of the file by the immigration minister after the breach was reported The department had not appropriately trained department staff in how to publish material online and the policies in place were vague and did not carry sufficient instructions \"This incident was particularly concerning due to the vulnerability of the people involved,\" Pilgrim said. \"This breach may have been avoided if DIBP [Department of Immigration and Border Protection] had implemented processes to de-identify data in situations where the full data set was not needed,\" he said. Crucially, the report found that aspects of the department's information procedures and policies \"implied that it was aware of the risk of embedded personal information\". But these policies had a \"lack of detail\", and staff were not adequately trained in how to undertake the procedures of publishing information online. \"The commissioner concluded that these deficiencies in DIBP's policies, procedures and training failed to adequately mitigate against the risk of a data breach,\" the report said. \"In order for policies and procedures to constitute a reasonable security safeguard, those policies and processes must adequately address known risks.\" Pilgrim's report noted the department had taken steps to contain the breach, including removing the file, engaging a review by KPMG and attempting to remove the file from public search engines. The revelation that the document was available on the Internet Archive website for 13 days without any action from the department was also singled out by Pilgrim. \"The commissioner found that DIBP took some steps to contain the data breach and put in place processes to assess and respond to the data breach. However, there are areas where the execution of these processes could have been improved,\" the report said. \"The commissioner expressed concern about the length of time it took DIBP to detect the cached copy of the detention report on Archive.org and effect its removal.\" The existence of the Internet Archive file also raises concerns about comments made by the department's secretary, Martin Bowles, and the immigration minister, Scott Morrison. After Guardian Australia reported the breach both Morrison and Bowles disclosed the location of the file containing the personal information. Guardian Australia did not refer to the location or nature of the file to limit the impact of the breach. Morrison said in a release on 19 February he had been advised by the department that \"all possible channels to access this information are closed\". The file was still available almost two weeks later on the Internet Archive. The department had also told Pilgrim that it was rolling out more staff training and awareness campaigns to highlight changes to privacy law, and has now engaged KPMG for a second review of its handling of sensitive information, as well as an independent auditor. \"The commissioner noted that it is essential that DIBP put in place measures to ensure that its revised policies are supported with staff training in the new procedures, IT security, privacy and appropriate information handling practices, particularly in a digital context,\" the report said. The commissioner has closed the investigation, but the 1,600 individual complaints relating to the data breach will still need to be resolved separately."
