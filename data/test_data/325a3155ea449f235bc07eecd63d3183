  "content": "Bread Face, an anonymous 27-year-old Instagram user with tens of thousands of followers, began \"breadfacing\", or filming herself pressing her face into bread, six months ago. \"I breadfaced before the Instagram,\" Bread Face \u2013 the name on her account \u2013 told the Guardian. \"I figured someone else would enjoy it on the internet so I filmed it.\" The idea to mash her face into bread, Bread Face said, came from \"inside my brain\". \"I just thought it would feel good so I did it,\" she said. On Thursday, the New York Times reported on Bread Face. The attention, she says, has been overwhelming. \"I was a ball of anxiety once more and more people started following me,\" she said. \"I don't think I ventured outside the apartment that entire weekend.\" I wanted to get inside the mind of Bread Face. To do this I had to become Bread Face \u2013 and put my face in some bread. Was she denied bread as a youngster? Was she a promising baker whose career had been cut short? Did she actually hate bread and this was her way of exerting dominance? Was it an anti-carb thing? In any case, my own experiment began by purchasing three types of bread. Whole grain, raisin and cinnamon swirl, and sesame seed burger rolls. I opted for wholegrain bread first. It was 100% whole wheat, according to the packaging, with two slices providing 6g of dietary fiber. It was the healthiest of the breads on offer. I lined up two piles of three slices each. Taking a step back, I examined the bread. Then, hesitantly, I pressed my face into one of the stacks. The bread was fresh and gave way easily as my face pressed into it. It felt clean on my skin, although I did notice that the crusts were a little rough on my forehead. The experience was surprisingly refreshing, like lying face-first on a cool pillow. I nuzzled into the leavened brown loaf. Next up was the raisin cinnamon swirl. For this I again created two piles. This time I stacked the bread higher. Six slices of bread per pile. The raisin cinnamon swirl smelled quite strongly of cinnamon. Each slice contained 80 calories. It looked a bit sugary. I expected that the taller piles would provide more cushioning, and decided to adopt a more aggressive approach. I rammed my forehead into one pile of raisin cinnamon swirl, reducing it to half its height. So far so good. But when I pressed my face deeper into the bread I noticed that it was abrasive on my skin. I examined a slice of the raisin and cinnamon slice and attributed the discomfort to the bread not being as fresh as the wholegrain. Before Thursday, my experiences of dunking my face into my food had all been involuntary. Once, when I was a child, I was very tired while I was eating dinner. So tired that my face fell forward into my plate of meatballs and mashed potato. Another time, also when I was a child, I was eating egg, fries and baked beans at my friend's house. During the meal his older brother crept up behind me and pressed my face into the food. There were beans on my forehead and yolk on my face. I derived no pleasure from either of these experiences. But pressing my face into a pile of bread felt good. \"You have it in your beard actually,\" a colleague said as I lifted my head from the raisin and cinnamon swirl. I didn't care. I pushed what was left of the loaf to one side and reached for the next batch. That batch was eight sesame-topped hamburger buns. I was slightly concerned about the sesame seeds. Would they feel strange on my skin? Would they combine to provide a sandpaper effect? Would one get in my eye? It turns out they didn't do any of these things. The sesame seed hamburger buns were easily my favourite of the three loaves. The eight buns come packaged in a sort of square, with a pleasingly nose-sized gap in the middle. I wiggled my nose in there and pressed my face down firmly. It was wonderfully soft and soothing. I could have left my face in there all day. But I didn't leave my face in there all day. I withdrew it after about 40 seconds. Some of the sesame seeds had stuck to my face, but it seemed a small price to pay. I had wanted to understand Bread Face's urge to stick her face into bread. I didn't. But then I don't understand why people watch Two and a Half Men or do triathlons or wear chinos, either.",
