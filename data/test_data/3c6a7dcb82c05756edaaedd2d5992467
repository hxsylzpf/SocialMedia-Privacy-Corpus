  "content": "Pakistan today blocked Facebook indefinitely in response to public outrage over a competition on the social networking site that encourages people to post drawings of the prophet Muhammad. The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority, which controls internet access, directed service providers to block the website \"till further notice\" in compliance with a high court order obtained by a group of lawyers yesterday. The court action was triggered by a Facebook page entitled Everybody Draw Mohammad Day \u2014 May 20 which contains over 200 images, many of them certain to offend Muslims, who consider all depictions of the prophet to be blasphemous. As of today, the site had 5,000 followers and listed links to the pages of prominent critics of Islam such as the rightwing Dutch politician Geert Wilders and the Somali feminist Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The page says its objective is to encourage the \"free discussion of brutality of the radical aspects of Islam\" and invites members to submit drawings of the prophet Muhammad by tomorrow . Whatever its goals, the site's principal achievement may be to inflame Muslim opinion. Many of the 200 images already submitted depict Muhammad in a variety of unflattering poses and situations likely to offend even moderate Muslims. In one, a bearded face is superimposed over a bikini-clad body. Others had a distinctly political tinge, such as a stereotypical photos of Islamist protests or images of an airliner smashing into the World Trade Centre under the slogan \"Islam: a religion of peace.\" The page's creator, whose identity is not revealed, appears to anticipate an angry and possibly violent backlash, by inviting members to post \"death threats\" on the site's wall, or public forum. Anger over the site is focused in Pakistan, where it has been the subject of outraged media reports but as yet no street protests. In 2006, similar cartoons of Muhammad published in a Danish newspaper sparked deadly riots that left more than 50 people dead across the Muslim world, five of them in Pakistan. In Lahore, a prominent Islamist student group with links to the country's largest religious party, Jamaat-e-Islami, distributed leaflets calling for a boycott of Facebook. \"The west is conspiring against the honour of the prophet and of Muslims. The real purpose of freedom of speech is to provoke the sentiments of Muslims,\" it read. Shakir Husain of Creative Chaos, an internet company based in Karachi, said the ban was unlikely to succeed because it could be easily circumvented through the use of proxy servers. \"By banning this web page, it will just make people more curious. It's pouring petrol on a small fire that could become a lot bigger,\" he said. \"You can't police the internet. The Saudis have tried it, as have other governments, and all have failed. It's a waste of state money.\" The row over the Facebook group comes after a recent skit on the US comedy cartoon show South Park that depicted the prophet Muhammad, prompting some criticism in Pakistan. There was some speculation that the suspected Times square bomber Faisal Shahzad tried to explode his vehicle near the headquarters of Viacom, which owns Comedy Central. This is not the first time the Pakistan government has censored the internet. A variety of sites are already blocked including those of Sindhi and Baloch nationalists and members of the Ahmedi religious sect, which has suffered decades of discrimination. A video showing Pakistani soldiers beating civilians in the Swat Valley is also unavailable in Pakistan. Pornography, however, is widely available. According to Google, the mostly widely searched word in Pakistan is \"sex\", followed by \"education\". Pakistan has about 20 million internet users in a population of 170 million people.",
