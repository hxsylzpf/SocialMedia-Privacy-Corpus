The TV chef tweeted a recipe for \"Holiday Hotcake\", adding that it was \"the perfect recipe to show thanks for all your support &amp; to those who hashtag #teamNigella\". Twitter users retweeted the message, adding messages of support. The #teamNigella hashtag looked likely to trend at the time of writing; there were only a few mentions of #teamsaatchi."
