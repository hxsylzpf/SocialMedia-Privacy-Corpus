  "content": "Lenny Henry has hit out at the \"invasive, rapacious\" celebrity culture that led to allegations of a drunken binge with lap dancers and a blonde receptionist staying the night in his hotel room appearing in tabloid newspapers. The TV comic said the tales about his private life, which broke in the Sun in 1999 and were followed up by most of the tabloids, taught him that as a public figure it was necessary to \"keep your nose clean\". \"This is a very invasive, rapacious society and whatever you do is public knowledge the minute you've done it, so you have to keep your nose clean. Work - and go home,\" Henry said in an interview with this week's Radio Times. Merri Cheyne, the woman at the centre of the Sun's \"Lenny Henry's night with a blonde\" story, denied Henry had been unfaithful to his wife Dawn French but the intense tabloid interest in the story led to the star checking into London clinic the Priory. \"I don't know if I've been a bad guy, but I've been a human being. Be a better guy - that's the answer. I spent a week in the Priory at the height of that mayhem,\" Henry said. The allegations led the Daily Mirror to accuse the Sun of going on a mission \"to destroy the reputations of Britain's best-loved stars in as vicious a manner as possible\". In the same week, the Sun splashed with a damaging story about former England cricketer Ian Botham and published a photograph of the then Sophie Rhys Jones baring a breast. Henry also revealed that as a high profile black man he was still the target of racist abuse. \"There's still huge prejudice. If you're black and in the public eye, people write offensive missives. They seem to object to your existence. It's like hating a bus because it's red,\" Henry said. \"I've had shows with nine million viewers and if I've done some good, that's great, but I don't want to be didactic. \"I've been told judges are made to watch me so they understand black archetypes. God almighty! It's like saying, 'I want to know what young white people are like, so I'll watch Shooting Stars'. \"Comedy doesn't give you an idea of what people are like. You have to go down to your local boozer and say hello.\" Henry, whose career in comedy began when he won a New Faces talent contest at the age of 16, is starring in a second series of his award-winning BBC sketch show Lenny Henry in Pieces."
