  "content": "Even if it was initially intended as a warped joke, there's obviously nothing funny at all about Danny Dyer's advice to slash a woman's face so \"no one will want her\". The comment is devoid of wit, jam-packed full of misogyny. But one line in reports of the incident did raise a bitter laugh: Bauer Media's description of the comment as \"inappropriate and indefensible\", and its excuse that it had only appeared owing to \"an extremely regrettable production error\". If this was the result of an error, how does Zoo explain its other content? It has become a feature of Twitter that a particularly egregious comment or article will be singled out and provoke uproar, as the Daily Mail columnist Jan Moir and others have discovered. But while these storms can be useful \u2013 while we should, absolutely, be enraged about attempts to make light of domestic violence, as in this instance \u2013 they can obscure the bigger picture. As a non-Zoo reader, it would be easy to read the current stories and imagine this incident as an unfortunate, despicable one-off. In fact, it's simply a particularly nasty example of the usual content of a magazine that regularly tips from \"cheeky\" sexism into repellent misogyny. So, for instance, in this week's issue of Zoo, you find a competition asking women to \"send us your butt\" alongside multiple pictures of women bent over. There's a feature headlined: \"I turned my missus into a porn star\", which ends with \"5 cool things about your girl doing porn\". Number one? \"She doesn't moan about having anal sex any more\". In Dyer's column, he suggests he finds Cheryl Cole attractive, \"although it might be more of a sympathy f*** [their stars] these days\". And on a page entitled: \"The 21 Funniest Jokes of the Week\" \u2013 an unequivocal heading there \u2013 is a gag that echoes Dyer's comment. \"My ex came round last night,\" it reads. \"She was crying, so I told her to keep her chin up. It made it a lot easier to get the noose on.\" I'm glad that people have picked up on this comment, but I hope the anger won't flare up and die away as it usually does. This shouldn't be an excuse simply to lambast an individual \u2013 whether Dyer writes his column alone is unclear \u2013 but to take notice of a magazine, and a wider culture, that depicts women as meat. If anything positive was to come out of this stupid throwaway comment, it would be that.",
