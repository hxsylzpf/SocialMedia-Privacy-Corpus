  "content": "The English language is a growing concern. Every year, Collins gets a pile of free publicity by publicly announcing new additions to its dictionary (last year: Facebook (as a verb), poke (as an action on Facebook) and sub-prime (adjective)). The Oxford English Dictionary does the same, just at a more leisurely, scholarly pace. On YouTube, it's a fair bet there's a new acronym coined every second, AIYDBMGAHAL*. Not often, however, does anyone stop to ask whether this is a good thing, whether \u2013 to paraphrase Migrationwatch \u2013 the English language is full. The common line is that any new word is a good word. It shows a vibrant, playful language shaped by those who practice it. Another way of looking at it is that if you let everyone play with the national lexicon, someone eventually will break it. This is where the English project comes in. Perhaps the first collaboration of its kind between the English speaking union \u2013 a body that promotes the use of the language around the world \u2013 and Hampshire county council \u2013 the body that administers rubbish collection from Basingstoke to Fareham \u2013 it's a scheme intent on creating \"an innovatory 'language exposition' (or 'living museum')\". And if that means filling it with everyone's verbal castoffs, so be it. Other Guardian bloggers quicker off the mark than me have observed that one result of the project's plea for \"kitchen table lingo\" \u2013 words that exist only amongst your family and friends \u2013 has been a plethora of synonyms for \"remote control\". \"Podger\", \"blipper\", \"twitcher\" and \"melly\", they're all there. It seems like while the Eskimos may (or may not) have 50 words for snow, we have a similar number for the thing that makes Corrie come on. What good such a diversity of terms, or the compiling thereof, does anybody is not entirely clear. Certainly it gives the English project a headline and a web 2.0 thingummyjiggum, but do we really need any new words for the remote? Or indeed underpants (apparently called \"yupes\" among trainees at Sandhurst)? The criteria for kitchen table lingo is so low \u2013 it need only be spoken by three people apparently \u2013 that there's nothing to stop you and two specially selected mates from inventing a new one on a whim. Here's one I just came up with my mates Rosie and Tim. It's \"shagullibangbang\" and it means cheese. Of course I have no problem with people performing keen linguistic gymnastics, as long as it's conducted in the privacy of their own home. It's when it's done in public that it gets me. New words for new things sure, new words that offer fresh perspective on old things, great. But new language adopted just because it sounds different or, somehow, more modern (compounds, like sub-prime, are particularly hot right now) is, to me, a waste of space. Just a quick squint at the English project website with its talk of \"early pump-priming financial backing\" (from the University of Winchester no less) and \"an ambitious educational outreach function\" makes me wish less for a chronicling of new words that nobody needs, rather a more vigorous maintenance of those words we already have. And anyone who doesn't like that can go frizzle their eggblatt. *And if you don't believe me go and have a look"
