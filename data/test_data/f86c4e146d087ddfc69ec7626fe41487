  "content": "The Nursing and Midwifery Council has guidelines for interaction with patients via social media. Their code of conduct details the types of online behaviour that are inappropriate, and offers advice to nurses on how they should conduct themselves on social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. However, currently there are no similar guidelines for social workers and people who work in the social care sector. The question of how social workers should conduct themselves online is one that Claudia Megele, founder of the Twitter feed @SWSCmedia, addressed in a recent comment piece on e-professionalism. She argues that social care professionals should think about their audience, and consider the difference between their public and private personas. Her jointly-run twitter account, which hosts regular Twitter chats, has been championed by social workers as a great resource in social care, demonstrating how online platforms can also be used in the sector as a way to share ideas and best practice. However, should social workers be named or anonymous on Twitter? What are the advantages and risks of blogging and tweeting as a social worker? Can online platforms play a role in accessing service-users and educating people? And where should those in the profession turn to for guidance in the use of social media? These are just some of the questions that we will be addressing in our live discussion. Join us from noon until 2pm on Friday 27 April, or pose your questions on Twitter at @GdnSocialCare or by posting them below ahead of the debate.
