  "content": "Ah, Twitter. With your endless links, distractions and feral gangs of impassioned pop fans (I'm still feeling the wrath of Michael Jackson fans after posting a joke about him a week or two ago), you are indeed the writer's worst enemy. Just occasionally, though, Twitter is good for something and the #badwritingtips hashtag that has been trending on and off for the past two days has produced a plethora of barbed nuggets by and for writers, professional and amateur alike. Agents, book cover designers and publishers chipped in too. Many of the tweets were clearly born out of frustration at bad writing that succeeds, disdain for bad writing that fails and sarcasm towards trends in the publishing business as a whole. Others offered sage words on the process of getting published \u2013 or why many writers are likely to be rejected. \"Industry professionals who decline to read your work are puppets of The System. Tell them so, from their back garden at 3am\" wrote @JasonArnopp. Or, as @PhilipArdagh put it: \"Agents love it if you include a photocopy of your bottom with your introductory letter. It shows you're KOOKY!\" Personally, I (@benmyers1) am not at all jealous of Stephenie Meyer's \u2013 or indeed Martin Amis's - success, which is why I suggested wannabe novelists should \"Write about vampires, because it has never been done before and bloodsucking is a fresh, new metaphor for sexual penetration\". Or simply: \"Write a novel called 'Lionel Asbo'.\" And you suspect @EnoureUnReveur had Fifty Shades Of Grey in mind when she suggested \"Write lots of fan fiction. Then change the names of your characters and sell it.\" Not bad advice \u2013 but then she is 16 and apparently already agented. Some of the advice offered was practical in alerting first-time writers to the more obvious pitfalls to avoid in the use of plot, narrator, language and so forth. Even if it was dripping with the high levels of sarcasm one associates with a) writers, b) people on Twitter and especially c) writers on Twitter: \"Write in the fifth person.\" (@MyVogonPoetry) \"Use as many different synonyms for 'said' as possible, he ejaculated.\" (@stevehuff) \"Name your characters so it's really obvious who's good &amp; who's bad, i.e. Nickelback J Hitler\" (@brx0) \"A hitherto secret twin brother/sister with identical skills to dead protagonist makes a great franchise resurrection device\" (@TooFullToWrite) \"Try and write a novel with both magic and time travel \u2013 it's really easy to keep it simple\" (@prenticeweil) \"The best work is done sitting up till the small hours smoking fags and drinking strong black coffee until you can't think\" (@MelvinBurgess) \"Showcase your creativity with elaborate genital metaphors like 'her sweet cream-filled lady biscuit'.\" (@faustfatale) \"Second drafts are for sissies. First drafts are GOLD.\" (@MeganWhitmer) \"You don't need an editor\" (@amandadunn10) But @MelvinBurgess perhaps hit the nail on the head with a second piece of advice: \"Try to spend as long as you can on Twitter thinking up funny remarks every few minutes\". So, for that matter, did @AmosPosner who similarly noted: \"#badwritingtips is trending because two thirds of all people on Twitter at any time are writers who should be writing.\" You can't argue with that."
