  "content": "TV veteran Noel Edmonds might be used to be being in the spotlight, but he looks set to be outshone by a new rising star: his store mannequin. The Deal or No Deal presenter drives around London with a mannequin in the back seat of his black cab, as you do, to stop people flagging him down. The Daily Star reports that Candice, who is dressed by Noel's wife Liz, has now become something of a celebrity in her own right. The shop dummy has 18,000 Twitter followers and has received offers from fashion houses, record labels and retail outlets. Edmonds reckons there might also be potential for perfume (\"eau de la dummy\") and jewellery. Lets just hope it doesn't go the way of 1987 film Mannequin, which saw Sex and the City star Kim Cattrall playing a beautiful store dummy that comes to life, usually at night."
