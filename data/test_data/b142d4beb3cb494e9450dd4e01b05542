  "content": "The Sun has today published an apology for wrongly dating and locating the story it ran yesterday showing photographs of Prince Harry groping a girl's breast. News International's flagship daily tabloid also apologised to the girl in question, Natalie Pinkham, for publishing the pictures, which belonged to her, without her permission. The apology, on page six of today's Sun, reads: \"We accept that the nightclub was the Purple Nightclub and not Boujis as we said and the photographs were taken in autumn 2003 and not summer 2006. We apologise for the error. \"The Sun published the photographs in good faith but we apologise to Ms Natalie Pinkham, a close friend of both Prince William and Prince Harry, for publishing them without permission and for any embarrassment or offence their publication caused.\" In its apology, the Sun went on to say that it would make a donation to a charity of Ms Pinkham's choice. But while the three-sentence apology appears on page six, a new story about Prince Harry - \"Is Harry the wildest prince in history?\" - is flagged up on the front page and covers the centre spread with photos of the prince drinking, smooching and giving a one-finger salute. The article about Prince Harry's antics boasts that yesterday's story - for which it has apologised today - was an exclusive. Saying that \"we love his playboy ways\", today's piece reads: \"Whether he smokes, drinks, enjoys lap-dancing or, as the Sun exclusively revealed yesterday, gropes pretty pals, Harry is one royal whose popularity has sky-rocketed.\" The article goes on to explain why the prince is such a \"loveable rascal\" who is \"impossible to dislike\" and that \"the Sun's phone lines were jammed with readers calling to give their approval for the young royal\" after an interview to mark his 21st birthday. It also suggests that \"the future of the royal family may yet lie with the pin-up prince with a glint in his eye. A young, popular, non-stick prince who can keep the public onside is exactly what they need.\" An accompanying piece by the \"royals' favourite photographer\", the Sun's Arthur Edwards, gives a bit of Prince Harry history, about being \"robbed of his mother\" and his charity work playing with \"dirt-poor African orphans\". It ends with a warning that \"Harry must sort out his true and loyal friends from those who are just waiting to cash in and make a fast buck out of him\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
