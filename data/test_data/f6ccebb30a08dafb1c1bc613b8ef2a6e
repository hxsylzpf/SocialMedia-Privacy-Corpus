  "content": "Hello! magazine has been granted leave to appeal against a high court order to pay \u00a31m to rival celebrity glossy OK! for publishing snatched paparazzi pictures of the wedding of Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas. Mr Justice Lindsay said the magazine could challenge the ruling, which stated that it breached commercial confidence when it published six unauthorised pictures of the Hollywood couple's wedding as a \"spoiler\" after they had struck an exclusive \u00a31m deal with OK!. In an appeal likely to be heard in the autumn, Hello! will argue that as soon as issues of OK! containing the authorised pictures of the November 2000 ceremony hit the streets, the couple lost their right to commercial confidence. \"The issue of spoilers could have far wider ramifications as far as the media is concerned,\" said Hello!'s lawyer Chris Hutchings of media practice M Law. \"If someone has got an exclusive in the media, since time immemorial rivals have tried to spoil it,\" he added. The glossy managed to distribute only 15,000 copies featuring the unauthorised pictures before the Douglases gained a temporary injunction preventing further publication. By the time the ban was lifted, OK!'s own wedding issue was on sale. OK! won damages of \u00a31m from Hello! last year after arguing it would have sold double or treble the amount of copies were it not for the lower quality wedding pictures that appeared in the rival magazine. However, Hello! counterclaimed that the effect of spoilers is usually to increase the net sales of both publications. Ms Zeta Jones and her husband have also been given leave to cross-appeal on the grounds of privacy. According to the Lawyer magazine, the couple are cross-appealing because although they were awarded \u00a314,500 for breach of confidence, Mr Justice Lindsay ruled against another of their claims for privacy. The issue of privacy is about to come to the fore again when supermodel Naomi Campbell takes her long-running case against the Daily Mirror - which published pictures of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting - to the House of Lords next month. The judge deferred a decision on legal costs. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
