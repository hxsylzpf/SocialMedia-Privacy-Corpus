  "content": "Christmas is a time of family gatherings, presents, overindulgence and cheesy films. In the modern age, what was once a relatively private affair is now a lot more public. The buildup is filled with festive selfies, and Christmas day itself is spent taking pictures of food and snoozing relatives. But how much of what we share on our social media stream reflects reality? We want to hear from our readers about their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram lives during the festive period, compared with their real lives. How did you really feel when you took that photo of you out Christmas shopping in a Santa hat? Did the perfect-looking pudding you made actually taste as great as it looked? Tell us your stories, anonymously or otherwise, below the line."
