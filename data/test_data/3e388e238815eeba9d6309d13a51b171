  "content": "Downfall has had a lot of remixes, but this one takes the biscuit. Well you try telling Hitler that Twitter is down... again! Meanwhile, in other Twitter news, figures from Compete claim a 752% growth in user numbers during 2008, with a total 4.43 million users in December - up from 500,000 in January. This all has to be taken with a large pinch of salt, because Twitter has never confirmed any user numbers and external figures and are always subject to the vagaries of different web metric systems."
