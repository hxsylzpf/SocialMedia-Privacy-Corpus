  "content": "This week, the Guardian website will be introducing a new collapsible comment function which allows you to hide or expand discussions below the line. I've been encouraging people to try out the new system on the ideas threads and asking people to leave feedback for the developers on a special preview thread which you can see here. The reaction given has meant some changes to the feature, and you can read about them here. We hope that collapsed threading will help improve the experience for people who wish to comment while focusing only on the discussions they're interested in. For those who use it, the collapse function will be remembered when you visit other discussions using the same browser. Other changes being introduced include removing the options for \"20 comments per page\" and \"30 comments per page,\" since nearly all our users said they preferred either a \"50 per page\" or a \"show all\" option. I will announce the new feature on our ideas thread the moment it launches. Please let us know what you think about it \u2013 either in the discussion below, or by emailing the developers at discussion.feedback@theguardian.com. As we always say, we continue to look at ways to improve our commenting platform and we really do value your responses."
