  "content": "If the techno-banter is right, Twitter is about to announce the acquisition of Summize, the third-party Twitter search app. The little known Josh Chandler first blogged this on Monday (he's 17 and British - huzzah!) and it was subsequently picked by Jason Calacanis, and then TechCrunch, as these things go. People are talking, something might be announced next week and nothing's confirmed - that's the general gist. Om Malik has some good observations on this, saying Summize would be the first step towards a business model because Summize contextualises Twitter posts, and could be a great vehicle for targeted ads. I still use site-specific Google searches, but that's a bit bare bones... \u2022 Incidentally, Venturebeat posted some interesting Twitter usage stats showing the service has (according to a Quantcast estimate) rocketed since December, despite falling over multiple times. FriendFeed, Plurk and Identi.ca are only to happy to pick up the slack if Twitter can't handle the heat... but these stats show Twitter rose from 230,000 US users in December to 730,000 by the end of a particularly wobbly June.

Some rights reserved. \u2022 Mike TechCrunch Arrington has been fuelling the Twitter vs FriendFeed episode, by saying FriendFeed has accumulated half the followers in a quarter of the time. Surely FriendFeed was benefitting from ground that Twitter had broken? Whatever - the FriendFeed concept is great, but I can't deal with the volume. And as usual, Malik has some more subtle, conceptual and interesting points on the way FriendFeed is drowning in recommendations by the poster boys it promotes as 'default' friends. It's really not about genuine friends any more. \"In the words of Iminta founder Aaron Newton, these life-streaming services are the watercoolers of the 21st century. In the past you'd discuss 'Seinfeld' episodes around the office; now you can do that online at Iminta or FriendFeed. But try doing that with thousands of followers -- there isn't much of a conversation left. What you have is a call-in radio talk show. \"Not that there's anything wrong with that -- just that you can't call yourself a FriendFeed when you take the focus away from friends. I know a lot of people, and at best they have about 100-150 relationships, tops -- including casual ones at work or with the neighborhood barista. \"FriendFeed isn't the only startup that seems to have moved away from the whole notion of friends and the personal web. Twitter is another example: What started out a simple alert service for a group of friends became a personal soapbox where the noise started to drown out the signal.\" Technorati Tags: FriendFeed, Plurk, Twitter",
