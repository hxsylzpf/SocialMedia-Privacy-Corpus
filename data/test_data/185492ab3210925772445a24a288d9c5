  "content": "\u2022 After a spate of phishing scams and attacks, Twitter is cranking up safety for users by blocking all dubious links. Essentially it routes all links through Twitter's filter and eliminates the bad ones before potential victims reach the destination. Looks like good news for users - but possibly bad news for the URL shortening services that have emerged in Twitter's wake? \u2022 If you're looking for some fun reading, it's worth taking some time to look through the blog of Jonathan Schwartz. Now liberated from his job at Sun Microsystems, Schwartz is delivering a few stories of his time at the company - the sort of things he couldn't say while there. The latest morsel? Tales of patent bluster with Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and others. And there are fighting words in there: while he says he gets the value of patents, he also believes that \"for a technology company, going on offense with software patents seems like an act of desperation\". \u2022 And it's time to tune in again to the latest edition of our Tech Weekly podcast, headed by the effervescent Aleks Krotoski. the latest show features a dissection of the BBC's apparently contradictory digital plans - is it pushing out or pulling back? - and a look inside San Francisco's wonderful mechanical museum. Click here to listen now. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, @gdngames or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed."
