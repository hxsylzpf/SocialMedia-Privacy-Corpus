  "content": "President Obama will address the nation Tuesday with his annual state of the union address. Last year, as an incumbent for re-election, Obama addressed the growing ideological chasm between Democrats and Republicans, and addressed a laundry list of initiatives his administration was prepared to tackle, from comprehensive immigration reforms to supporting a clean energy industry. Since last January's address, gun control, the growing US budget deficit, same-sex marriage and, of course, winning the 2012 election landed in Obama's in-tray. Which issue do you think should be at the top of Obama's list? We're experimenting with Vine, Twitter's new video app, to collect your personalized six-second state of the union addresses for Obama. Here's how to participate: 1. Film a video using Vine. 2. Share your Vine to Twitter using the hashtag #SOTUin6 or by tagging @GuardianUS. 3. (No Vine? No problem. You can always leave your six-word #SOTUin6 for us on Twitter.) 4. We'll find your Vines and tweets and add them to an interactive. For inspiration, we asked a few Guardian US journalists to give their own six-second agendas. You can also view more video responses here on our Rebel Mouse page.
