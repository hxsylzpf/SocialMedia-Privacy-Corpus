  "content": "Vitriolic bile is always easy on Twitter and Facebook and there have been articles aplenty about this sometimes toxic nature of social media. Yet often missing from these discussions is an analysis of how misogyny and racism, always happy bedfellows, limit the participation of black and brown women from these forums. This week's horrendous abuse suffered by ITV London news presenter Charlene White, perfectly demonstrates why so many of us feel unable to stick our heads above the parapet. The decision to not wear a poppy in public is one that White made several years ago. And though she has previously received negative comments, 2013 seems to be, at least where White is concerned, a great vintage for what some are calling \"poppy-fascists\". Many of the commenters on her Facebook page were at pains to point out that the obvious nature of the racism directed at White was, in fact, another example of a black person frantically wielding our favourite card: the one emblazoned with the words race and racism. Apparently oblivious to all the messages calling White \"a black cunt\" and telling her to \"go back home\", one such commenter stated they could \"never understand why people bring racism into a debate which isn't based on race\". But Jon Snow's refusal to wear a poppy on screen isn't met with a torrent of abuse that reduces him to genitalia and tells him to leave the country. The poppy has become synonymous with moral good and national pride \u2013 a tradition that many assume is beyond dissent. I am not surprised at the nature of abuse White has suffered. It is my first year of teaching and I am wearing my white poppy with pride. A senior colleague challenged me on my decision to wear it, telling me it was a sign of disrespect. I did not know how to respond other than to say I believed it was a better tribute to the lives lost in wars we have fought. Black and brown women are subjected to such abuse when we are vocal about an opinion or make a principled stand \u2013 with or without a public platform. At a recent meeting of Black Feminists, the raced and gendered nature of trolling was discussed at length. Many spoke of how their experiences of either facing such abuse or just viewing it from the sidelines had resulted in a desire to disengage from such public platforms. We are effectively silenced because, for some of us, it is a position that protects our mental health and sense of wellbeing. Principles are great but at times the abuse received as a result can take its toll. White is one of a very small number of black presenters we invite into our homes on a daily basis. The images of black women that we more readily consume are sadly those that see us shaking our ever-fetishised behinds and the horrid treatment White has faced has to be seen in this context. This is not solely about respecting the legacy of the soldiers who lost their lives. It is also about the suggestion that black women have no real entitlement to a public position from which they can vocally challenge the status quo. If we do, we are reminded that we don't really belong, that our presence is tolerated, but we shouldn't push it further than that."
