  "content": "Who likes rape? Loads of people! And they tell the world about it on Facebook. Let's start with the page, \"Riding Your Girlfriend Softly Cause You Don't Want to Wake Her Up\". Sleep rape too un-violent? Try \"Throwing Bricks at Sluts\", check out the gallery and vote Bang, or Brick. The page called \"Don't You Hate It When You Punch a Slut in the Mouth and They Suck It,\" has 2,086 likes. If you want stronger stuff, try \"Punching Pregnant Women in the Stomach.\" Too tame? \"Abducting, Raping and Violently Murdering Your Friend, as a Joke\" has more than 16,600 likes so rape fans needn't feel alone. Social media has been such a great cause for good in many parts of the world but this abuse has gone too far and activists change.org are urging Mark Zuckerberg to have the pages removed. So far the petition has 165,000 signatures but Facebook has done nothing. Zuckerberg, condemn this outright, or you are an abuse apologist and we shall all decamp to Twitter. Oops. It seems I spoke too soon. Recently, Twitter trended \"Reasons to beat your girlfriend\", \"Worst names for a vagina\", and \"Birthday present for side chick\" (meaning, mistress). When it comes to trends like this, all women are on the side, looking on, appalled."
