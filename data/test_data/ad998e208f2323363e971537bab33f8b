  "content": "Facebook engineers wrestling with a fiendishly complex networking problem that had put the site offline for more than two hours discovered a surprisingly simple solution: they simply turned the site off and then on again. The solution, beloved of computer support desks dealing with frustrated PC users, turned out to be the only solution for the social networking site, which has 500m users worldwide and whose chief executive and co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, was claimed to be worth $6.9bn (\u00a34.4bn) on Thursday. Robert Johnson, the site's head of software engineering, apologised for the failure, the site's worst in four years. It was caused by a runaway condition at a \"database cluster\" of computer servers among the 500 sites that form Facebook's worldwide network. In the end, said Johnson, \"we had to stop all traffic to this database cluster, which meant turning off the site\". The problems occurred late on Thursday in the UK, the early evening on the US east coast and afternoon on the US west coast. The reaction was swift: \"Facebook is down. In other news, office productivity is up across America,\" tweeted Matt Moore. The problem arose because Facebook has a central server system, and a set of outlying servers that users connect to, which then connect with the central system. The outlying servers have to know certain setup data to run properly. But a mistake by the Facebook engineers gave them the wrong setup data \u2013 which meant that they deluged the central system with requests for the correct data. \"Usually you wouldn't expect them all to want to connect at the same time,\" said Mark Sutton, a systems architect for the hosting company Fubra. \"Facebook hadn't considered that there might be a situation where they'd all query the central server at the same time.\" The central server, overwhelmed, began handing out more wrong information, and the problem snowballed, so that every outlying server could not connect \u2013 and Facebook disappeared from the web. About 350,000 sites that used its \"Like\" button saw those stop operating too. The only solution: turn off the site completely and correct the information, and bring the servers back online gradually. The outage lasted two and a half hours. By then the damage had already been done, as millions of people around the world tried and failed, to connect to the site. Every day 50% of its registered users log in at least once \u2013 and as news spread of its failure, more and more tried to log in, making the problem worse. \"I don't think the damage will be long-term, but it's very frustrating for any user,\" said Paul Armstrong, director of social media at Kindred, an advertising and marketing agency. \"It's a big deal for them, but it's not part of an ongoing problem with reliability like Twitter has had this year.\"",
