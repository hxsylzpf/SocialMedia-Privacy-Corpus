  "content": "Facebook is testing new tools to help charities raise money within the social network, with 37 partners already signed up. Restricted to the US for now, the early testers include the World Wildlife Fund and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, with Facebook planning to open up the test to more non-profit bodies in the coming months. One of the new tools is a feature called \"fundraisers\" where charities will be able to raise money for specific campaigns, setting financial targets with the progress visible on their Facebook campaign pages. Facebook is also launching a \"donate\" button that will appear on charities' pages and posts on the social network, which it hopes will spur more donations. \"Both of these buttons will make it easy for supporters to contribute using a one-page form without leaving Facebook, and share that they donated with their friends,\" wrote Facebook's vice president of product management, Naomi Gleit, in a blog post. Gleit added that Facebook's 1.55 billion-strong community includes \"more than 150 million people around the world connected to a cause\" including volunteers, activists and donors. The company has previously worked with charities to raise money after some natural disasters, raising more than $10m in two days after the Nepal earthquake in April 2015. The new tools are the first time Facebook has tried to roll that idea out as a more regular feature for charities. The move means Facebook will compete with \u2013 although it would doubtless argue it will complement \u2013 existing services such as JustGiving, which has helped charities raise more than $3bn from 24m donors since its launch in 2001. Crowdfunding service Kickstarter is also making moves in this area. Traditionally it has barred projects that are fundraising for charities or causes, but in October it ran a one-week campaign with the White House and the UN Refugee Agency that raised nearly $1.8m to support refugees from Syria. \"I don't plan for that to be a new platform for Kickstarter, but I do think that in moments of crisis in the future it's possible that we'll do something like that again,\" said the chief executive, Yancey Strickler, at the recent Web Summit conference. \"It was a first step for us.\""
