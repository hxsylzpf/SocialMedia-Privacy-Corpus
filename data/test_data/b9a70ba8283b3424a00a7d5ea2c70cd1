  "content": "Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation founder and chairman, used his address to the eG8 Forum in Paris on Tuesday to call for more investment in education and \"unlocking the potential\" of the world's children. Murdoch said it was not a question of putting a computer in every school, but concentrating on opening up opportunities for youngsters to flourish by using targeted and tailored software. News Corp moved into the $500bn (\u00a3310bn) US education sector in late 2010, paying about $360m in cash for 90% of technology company Wireless Generation, which provides mobile and web software to enable teachers to use data to assess student progress and deliver personalised learning. Murdoch said in Paris that \"the greatest challenge is human capital \u2026 how to find it, how to develop it, how to keep it\". He added that the internet had changed the world in every area except education. \"Someone waking up from a 50-year nap would find the world had changed beyond recognition \u2026 not in education where our schools remain the last holdout from the digital revolution,\" he said. \"A teacher waking up from a 50-year nap would find a classroom looks almost exactly the same as it did in the Victorian era. My friends, what we have here is a colossal failure of imagination and an abdication of our responsibilities to our children and grandchildren.\" Murdoch attacked the \"mandarins of mediocrity\" who argued children were too poor, too ignorant to learn or were immigrants who had difficulty understanding. \"This is absolute rubbish. It is arrogant, elitist and unacceptable,\" he said. He gave examples of schools in the US and elsewhere where digital technology was being used to teach children at their own pace to unlock their potential. Businesses, he said, had learned to personalise their websites to target people, companies were letting clients customise their experience. Business leaders had to do the same for schools. \"In putting this creative force into schools we can ensure the poor child in Manila has the same chance as the rich child in Manhatten,\" Murdoch said. \"The key to our future is to unlock this potential.\" Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, told the eG8 Forum that the internet was no longer a tool. \"The internet has become part of our DNA; we have outsourced parts of our own personality and we now have the possibility to really share our DNA with the global community,\" he said. \"This has given rise to some worries: how much do we still own ourselves?\" Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, said the web had evolved from an information-gathering tool to a social interaction. \"When you use the web [for information] you get the same information as everyone else. When you use social networks you are who you are. I am not looking for anything, but my friends are telling me what they want to tell me,\" Sandberg added. Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, said it was interesting to see the impact of the internet on languages in the developing world. \"We now have over 200 languages [used in Wikipedia], some of them quite small but developing. For example there has never existed an encyclopaedia in Swahili, nobody bothered to do it before, but now we have nearly 30,000 entries,\" Wales added. \"That's why it's going to have a huge impact on the world.\" Of the criticism that Wikipedia is a permanent record of some information that people might prefer not to have on a public forum, Wales responded: \"They say an elephant never forgets; Wikipedia is a very big elephant.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
