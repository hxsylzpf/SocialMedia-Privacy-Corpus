  "content": "Lord Justice Eady has made it plain. Parliament has not legislated and the people have not given their consent, but Britain now has a law of privacy. That is the real consequence of Max Mosley's victory against the News of the World. It is only superficially related to one man's right to hire a posse of dominatrices to whip him into frenzy. This ruling is a threat to freedom of expression based solely on a judge's interpretation of the appropriate balance between two articles of the European convention on human rights. It is tempting to be complacent. This was a trivial story based on salacious tittle-tattle and published to sell newspapers, not a serious attempt to serve the public right to know. The News of the World made itself look foolish by pretending otherwise. Lord Justice Eady said that a public interest defence might have worked had there genuinely been a Nazi theme to Mr Mosley's sex party. But there was not. The News of the World got its facts wrong. So, it is possible that judges may take a less restrictive view of section eight of the ECHR, which protects privacy, if the case before them involves serious investigative journalism. The problem is that while it is possible it is now very far from guaranteed. The wealthy, famous and powerful have been handed a weapon with which to deter those who seek to hold them to account. It might not be worth worrying if such people were all celebrities, with whom the public, like the courts, appear to sympathise more readily than they do with journalists. But the celebrity cases that began with supermodel Naomi Campbell's victory against the Mirror are a red herring. They have only set the agenda because, in this era of falling newspaper circulations, populist tabloid newspapers are investing more in celebrity smears than their quality counterparts can in significant investigative work. The health of our democracy will be endangered if that remains the case. What is important is not whether the News of the World published a spurious and intrusive story, but how this ruling will be interpreted by reporters and editors who seek to expose exploitation of the vulnerable and abuse of trust by people in power. Such people can afford to use the courts too. In many cases they will have more to hide than celebrities who exploit privacy law simply to manipulate synthetic reputations. In America an independent, non-profit newsroom, Pro-Publica, was launched this year to produce original investigative journalism in the public interest. It has already achieved notable success. Britain urgently needs a similar sponsor of reporting that can fight illegitimate authority. Lord Justice Eady's ruling makes it less likely that one will emerge, and if it does emerge that it will be effective. Britain now has a privacy law which, had it existed in 1963, might have given John Profumo a chance to conceal his relationship with Christine Keeler. By all means despise newspapers which pretend sexual adventure is a threat to national morals. But spare a thought for important secrets that may remain concealed. That possibility is real when judges encourage powerful people to believe that activities conducted in private may attract protection they do not deserve. We have too little precedent upon which to base any assumption that judges can be relied upon to put the interests of democracy first when distinguishing between less and more serious allegations. We should question whether liberties as fundamental as freedom of speech should be subject to judge-made law."
