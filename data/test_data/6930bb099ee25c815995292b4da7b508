  "content": "Supporters of liberty should not merely accept the Information Commissioner's Office ruling that Google Street View does not contravene the Data Protection Act. They should applaud it. To allow Street View is not merely a \"pragmatic and common sense\"(pdf) position, as the ICO carefully puts it, but a statement in defence of the concept of public space. My only criticism is that the ruling does not go far enough in affirming Google's right to create its product. The ICO's statement says there is no law against taking pictures of people in the street as long as the photographer is not harassing people. Too right \u2014 despite the efforts of celebrities, police officers and over-zealous officialdom to curtail this right. It's a right that's important to press freedom as well as the general principle of allowing citizens to do what they like in a public place so long as it harms nobody else; a frequent objection to the ID card is that it infringes on this very liberty. But what do we mean by public space? Certainly, definitions can differ with the circumstances \u2014 restaurants and beaches have both figured in high-profile privacy cases \u2013 but the public highway, and views therefrom, seems a pretty solid definition. Certainly it's the one I've safely used in 30 years of journalism. It's strange, then, that the ICO makes a necessity out of Google's self-imposed limits on behaviour. In the statement, the ICO's senior data protection practice manager David Evans says: \"Any images of people's faces or number plates should be blurred.\" The ICO may welcome the decision to blur faces and number plates, but I see no reason for the word \"should\". Likewise, \"Google must respond quickly to deletion requests and complaints as it is doing at the moment. We will be watching closely to make sure this continues to be achieved in practice.\" Why \"must\"? I have asked to see the full decision, but that was not available today. None of this means that Google should get a completely free rein. Rightly, the ICO recognises that a structured database of photographs displayed on the web is a different animal to an archive of shots built up in a newspaper library over many years. But in that case, the weight of the ICO should descend on anyone unlawfully processing Street View images in a way that truly infringes privacy, not one that merely reproduces the view from a public space. Privacy is an important component of liberty, but the only setting where privacy is absolute is within our own heads. If in law and personal behaviour we recognise private places \u2013 usually defined in terms of the home \u2013 it follows we must recognise public ones. And the liberty to walk in a public space without revealing our name or profession is the same liberty that allows Google to photograph it and paste the results up on our web. The colours of our front doors are public property. If and when Google starts displaying the colours of our bedroom ceilings on the web \u2013 that's when friends of liberty will be right to blockade Street View cars.",
