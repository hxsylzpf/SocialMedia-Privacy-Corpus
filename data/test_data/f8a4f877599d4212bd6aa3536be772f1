  "content": "Efforts by the Prince of Wales's household to quash rumours of a sexual incident involving the future king suffered a further setback yesterday as the allegations were published in European news outlets and on foreign-language websites. The rash of stories among the continental media followed Clarence House's controversial decision to break its silence on Thursday to denounce the rumours as \"totally untrue\". In a statement, Prince Charles's private secretary, Sir Michael Peat, said that because the allegation was becoming common currency he wanted to make clear that it was \"without a shred of substance\". In Britain, the Popbitch email bulletin also broadcast details of the rumours, while television stations added to the sense that Clarence House was losing control of the story by flashing up images of Corriere della Sera, the Italian newspaper which was one of the first to publish. It is also understood that the Mail on Sunday, which was injuncted at the request of Prince Charles's former aide Michael Fawcett when it sought to publicise the allegation, has had the terms of its injunction relaxed. It will be allowed, like the rest of the nation's media, to publish whatever is in the public domain. However, this is unlikely to open the floodgates as the details in foreign media are not generally regarded by the courts as part of the public domain here. It was unclear whether Sir Michael had foreseen that it would be impossible to deny the allegation without it becoming public in the end what the allegations actually were. The report on page 19 of yesterday's Corriere della Sera, was filed by its London correspondent, Alessio Altichieri. It said that \"the most lurid accusation against the British royal household came dramatically into the open yesterday\". He went on to give details of the allegations. A semi-pornographic Italian website has also set out the central allegations. Other websites carried versions of the claims in Flemish and Portuguese.",
