  "content": "Calling all Beyonc\u00e9 fans! We've got a great clip for you as Todrick Hall sings all five albums by the songstress in just four minutes. There are over 80 songs \u2013 and some bonus tracks \u2013 in the video, which took four single take performances of memorising four different sets of lyrics and choreography. Filming took four hours and the clip is exactly four minutes long because of Beyonc\u00e9's love of the number four. Meanwhile all the single ladies \u2013 and all the married ones too \u2013 are bound to enjoy Hawkeye, aka Jeremy Renner, from the Avengers crooning about his lesser-known powers on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show. In New York, as part of the White House's annual Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day, Michelle Obama fielded questions from children and was overjoyed to be told that she looked too young for a 51 year old. We make no apologies for including the terrifying video shot at Everest base camp during the Nepal earthquake - which is surely one of the most amazing pieces of filming you will see this year. We've also got a couple of videos that will give you a chuckle. Tom Fletcher from McBusted shows his son Buzz a dandelion for the first time and a young boy gets a cuddle from a most unlikely source - a duck. If you have a daughter, you will want to experience the unique connection between mothers and daughters but if you think your daughter is a bit of a handful, take a look at five-year-old Saige, who is absolutely adamant that she wants to leave home and go and live with her mum's friend. 1) 4 Beyonc\u00e9 from Todrick If I were a boy \u2026 2) Hawkeye Sings About His Super Powers (Ed Sheeran \"Thinking Out Loud\" Parody) Avengers crooner 3) Buzz and the Dandelions Tickled by a flower 4) \"You're too young for a 51 year old!\" Obama drama 5) Duck love Quackers for him 6) My feisty five-year-old, Saige, is mad and she's moving on! Five going on 15 7) If Facebook Got Rid of Everything You Hate Nothing to dislike here 8) The unique connection Mum's the word 9) Parking problem Well stacked 10) Hit by Avalanche in Everest Basecamp 25.04.2015 Snow nightmare",
