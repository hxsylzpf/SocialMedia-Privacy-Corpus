  "content": "A 14-year-old girl whose disappearance three weeks ago prompted Twitter and Facebook appeals has been found by police and is said to be well. Serena Beakhurst was discovered in the Wandsworth area of south London, close to where she was last seen after a catching a bus from Herne Hill in Lambeth on 15 December. An online campaign appealing for information attracted thousands of backers, including Stephen Fry, Sarah Brown, wife of the former prime minister, and the footballer Rio Ferdinand. Serena's family thanked supporters of the campaign and said it had underlined the power of social media. Her cousin James Andrew told the Voice newspaper: \"We are so grateful to all who took the time to post information about her on their Facebook and Twitter profiles. \"This campaign has highlighted the strength of the community and how powerful we can be when we unite our efforts. Without the dedicated members of the Facebook group, Please help us find Serena Beakhurst, this would have just been another unreported case of a missing child. \"We also wish to thank the celebrities who publicised our efforts. Their involvement was invaluable. And to the media who picked up on the story, your coverage was instrumental in finding Serena.\" A spokesman for the Metropolitan police said: \"Serena was found in the early hours of Wednesday in Wandsworth. Officers will be speaking to her in due course.\" Serena, who also goes by the surname Dennis, disappeared on 15 December after catching a bus to attend her beauty therapy college course in south London. She had never been reported missing previously. On Monday, the Met said it had \"exhausted normal lines of inquiry\" and urged anyone with information to get in touch. Yesterday officers revealed they were about to reinterview the teenager's friends and had received reported sightings of her over Christmas.",
