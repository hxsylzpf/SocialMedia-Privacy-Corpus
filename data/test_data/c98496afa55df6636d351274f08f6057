  "content": "Police are set to investigate the photographs of Prince Harry and Natalie Pinkham that appeared in the Sun and Daily Mail, according to reports. Ms Pinkham has contacted police about the photographs, which show the prince groping her breast and caused a rift between the Sun and the royal family when they were published on Tuesday. The television presenter will make a formal complaint upon her return from Portugal next week and a police investigation would follow, the Independent reported. Ms Pinkham contacted Fulham police to tell them that several hundred negatives had been stolen when she moved house earlier this summer, the paper said. \"We have got no knowledge of a complaint at present,\" a Metropolitan police spokesman said. Ms Pinkham's lawyer, Nick Goldstone of Magrath &amp; Co, said he had not advised his client to contact the police but would be discussing the matter with her next week. The Sun claimed that the photographs were taken this summer, but later admitted they dated from autumn 2003 and printed a correction. Clarence House has said it would take no further action over the photographs. Ms Pinkham is also threatening to sue the Daily Mail over breach of copyright after the newspaper reprinted the photographs while acknowledging that they were stolen. She is not taken action against the Sun, which bought the pictures from an unknown source. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
