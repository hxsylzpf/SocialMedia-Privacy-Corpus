  "content": "For quite the wrong reasons, today's readers of the The Universal Declaration of Human Rights can get a strong sense of datedness. Article 12 says we have a right to privacy and to protection from attacks on one's honour and reputation. The bright luminous smear that the credit card-using, emailing, mobile-telephoning possessor of a travelcard leaves behind him as he moves about his daily life under the CCTV camera's ubiquitous eye, has made privacy a thing utterly of the past for all but the technophobic drop-out or those beyond a certain age who cannot manage, or be bothered with, the endless fiddlesomeness of getting logged on, registered, connected \u2013 and thereafter relentlessly tracked by anyone interested. In the haste with which we have embraced emailing and mobile phoning we have stripped ourselves naked to any eyes that wish to see. Manufacturers of biometric identity data devices and surveillance equipment have importuned governments into violating the limits of citizen privacy and autonomy by selling them the idea that, by turning every individual into a suspect to be watched and monitored, the tiny percentage of bad folk among them can be caught. There is an irony in this: the bad folk are not always stupid enough to leave a bright luminous smear of their presence on the public record; from the hood to the multiple pay-as-you-go mobiles, the fake ID and the once-only used internet caf\u00e9, they are going to stay out of reach of that intrusive gaze that watches the rest of us. Privacy is indeed a right. It is more: it is an essential. Private life, a margin of inviolability for our thoughts, feelings, intimacies, reflections, anxieties, our hopes and nascent plans, and our recoveries from the abrasions of life, are fundamentals of personal and psychological health. Even lovers must have their privacies from one another. It is a strange and shallow human existence that lives at every moment under the burning eye of the inquisitor \u2013 exactly what the church once wanted us to think was our predicament: existence before the never-closed eye of a jealous divinity, even when we are alone in the dark. It shows that the state, in wanting to attach so many electronic and bureaucratic monitors to its ordinary citizens, has given up on that other idea. So the UDHR's article 12 asserts a right that is indeed fundamental, and has already been lost in all practical senses. That does not mean we could not win it back. It does not mean that the injustices which will accumulate in number, and eventually the sheer flood of useless information that bureaucracies will drown themselves in, will not force a retreat. But the privacy principle asserted by article 12 and other human rights conventions should have stopped it in its tracks in the first place. But then: when principle opposes power, it is too often on the losing side. What about the right to protection against attacks on one's honour and reputation? Here too the brave new electronic world makes this a laughing-stock. Look at the blogosphere \u2013 the biggest lavatory wall in the universe, a palimpsest of graffiti and execration \u2013 to see what a whimsy that idea has become. In jurisdictions like ours, there can be a remedy after the fact when such attacks occur in print or on the airwaves; one can sue. For the armies of the nameless invited to \"post a comment\", the only defence would be to compound the felony \u2013 by invading their privacy through yet further electronic means. It does us credit if we prefer putting up with them to seeing the tentacles of rights-annihilating power reach still further into the bowels (though this, in this case, would be the apt location) of our polity. AC Grayling will continue with a daily blog on the UDHR through to the 60th anniversary itself on December 10. The Guardian is the media partner for The Convention on Modern Liberty, taking place on Saturday February 28 2009, which will debate these and other issues. You can buy tickets here",
