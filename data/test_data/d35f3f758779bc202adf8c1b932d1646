  "content": "A prolific hacker gang that has breached numerous companies by exploiting Adobe software has claimed another major hit in the form of car manufacturer Citro\u00ebn, the Guardian has learned. \u2028 Citro\u00ebn had one of its German websites hacked to include a backdoor, which is a method of bypassing normal authentication systems, and which may have allowed the attackers to make off with whatever data was sitting on site's server. A Citro\u00ebn Germany spokesperson said law enforcement were to be contacted about the breach as it appeared to be a criminal act. Some customer data was stolen, the spokesperson said, but it is unclear how many are affected. Customers have been contacted and will be advised to check their bank accounts for any suspicious transfers. The attackers managed to embed the backdoor on shop.citroen.de, a fan site for buying Citro\u00ebn-based gifts. After disclosure by the Guardian and Alex Holden, chief information security officer at Hold Security, the backdoor was removed, but investigations into the breach continue. The backdoor file was live from at least August 2013. \u2028 According to Holden, it was certain the same actors responsible for breaching several sites - including Adobe, PR Newswire and the National White Collar Crime Center - were behind the Citro\u00ebn site breach. Security blogger Brian Krebs last year uncovered a trove of information taken in those attacks. \u2028 The hackers have been scanning the internet for weaknesses in a web application platform from Adobe known as ColdFusion. \"The exploitation was targeted across the entire internet looking specifically for ColdFusion exploits,\" Holden said. \u2028 If the hackers did decide to pilfer data from the site, they would have had access to all information on the server. \"To explain the backdoor simply, it provides full command line and SQL database access with the rights of the user running the web services, which usually means everything on the web server,\" Holden added. Citro\u00ebn was not responsible for running the site. It contracted web design company anyMotion to run its main German website and the affected fan site. \u2028anyMotion said it had fixed the backdoor but was now investigating whether hackers had installed further files or taken data. \"We are examining the machines for known backdoors and unwanted software that someone may have installed on the machine,\" said anyMotion's Heinz Brasch. It is unclear whether credit card information was directly compromised, although the advice from Citro\u00ebn that customers check their bank balances would indicate some kind of financial information was taken. Shopping bags and shipping addresses of users were also stored on the compromised server. \u2028 Passwords used to access the website and admin passwords for running it have been reset, while shoppers were initially prevented from making purchases as a precaution. The breache has highlighted the risks that face companies through third parties. \"You can have all the security in the world inside the company's four walls, all you need is a third party supplier that's connected to you, if they're compromised that compromise has a bridge right into your organisation,\" said Rocco Grillo, managing director and global leader for incident response and forensics investigations at Protiviti, a consultancy.\u2028 \"If you're outsourcing to a third party or relying on a third party, you don't just shut the door and say that is someone else's problem. You can outsource the function but you ultimately own the risk. If that third party doesn't have the same controls in place or the level of controls you need from a risk management standpoint there's obviously an issue. You're in grave risk if that company loses your data.\" The attacks have also proven the need to update exploitable software. The vulnerabilities in ColdFusion have now been patched.",
