  "content": "Welcome to this week's best iPhone and iPad apps roundup. As ever, prices are correct at the time of writing, and (Free + IAP) means the app is freemium and uses in-app purchases. More interested in Android? That's a separate weekly roundup. APPS Periscope (Free) Twitter's new live-streaming video app has a ton of hype, and it's tempting to write it off as a novelty when you see endless broadcasts of cats, kids and parties you're not invited to. There's something more powerful brewing here though: watch for more interesting people who find themselves in interesting places to start using it. iPhone Layout from Instagram (Free) Another standalone app from a prominent social network: in this case Instagram. Layout is an app for creating collages of multiple photos before you upload them \u2013 not just to Instagram, but to its parent company Facebook too. It's quick, slick and pretty flexible. iPhone Vessel (Free + IAP) Available in beta since early this year, Vessel has now launched properly. What is it? A service focusing on shortform video \u2013 from vlogging and how-tos to music videos \u2013 that promises to have the newest clips available for at least 72 hours before they go on YouTube. It costs \u00a32.29 a month for a subscription. iPhone / iPad The Very Hungry Caterpillar &amp; Friends \u2013 First Words (\u00a32.49) The famous children's-book caterpillar is back in this latest app from developer StoryToys, which is aimed at young children learning their first words. Specifically, 80 words, presented over a digital pop-up book. iPhone / iPad The Edit (Free) More and more people are shopping on their smartphones in 2015, even in categories \u2013 clothing \u2013 that were once thought impossible for e-commerce. Here, clobber, shoes and jewellery are on the menu, complete with a Tinder-style swiping system to like or reject individual items. iPhone / iPad Ditty for Messenger (Free + IAP) This is one of the first apps made for Facebook's Messenger messaging platform, which was announced earlier this week. It's a musical messaging tool: you pick a song from the choice available, add text then send the results to a friend via Messenger. iPhone / iPad Filters for iPhone (\u00a30.79) If you're really into your mobile photography, Filters looks like a keeper: an app promising more than 800 filters and overlays for your snaps to make them look prettier, stranger, older or other effects. You'll have plenty of fun simply exploring what's available, before saving your favourites for fast access. iPhone Beatport (Free) Best known as a downloads store for dance music, Beatport is getting into streaming \u2013 and for now, its service is entirely free. How long that lasts remains to be seen, but if you love your electronic music the app is well worth checking out. iPhone Shaun in the City - Sheep Spotter (\u00a31.49) One for children, this, from Aardman Animation. Based on its Shaun the Sheep character, it gets kids out and exploring London trying to find 50 statues of Shaun decorated by artists. Later in the year, it'll also work for a similar scattering of statues in Bristol. iPhone / iPad 850 Sports Digest (Free) If you're a keen sports fan, this is definitely worth a download: it provides a daily digest of sports news covering football, cricket, rugby union and league, tennis, golf, Formula 1 and others. It's a quick, simple way to dive in to the latest happenings. iPhone GAMES Silly Sausage in Meat Land (Free + IAP) It sounds ridiculous. It IS ridiculous. But it's also brilliant fun: a game that'll put a big smile on your face while keeping you coming back for play after play. It's a carefully-crafted game starring a stretchy dog \u2013 nobody mention Adventure Time at this point \u2013 which works beautifully on a touchscreen. iPhone / iPad The Trace: Murder Mystery Game (\u00a33.99) I've been itching for a proper murder-mystery detective game on mobile, and The Trace looks like it may be it. From rifling through the murder scene to studying forensics and testing deductions, it sucks you in. The case itself is quite short, but hopefully there's potential for updates. iPhone / iPad Fast &amp; Furious: Legacy (Free + IAP) Developer Kabam is becoming something of an expert in freemium movie games, with this new racer its latest accompaniment to the Fast &amp; Furious films, just in time for the seventh flick. Expect various race modes, lots of ride-pimping, and social features to interact with friends. iPhone / iPad Final Fantasy Record Keeper (Free + IAP) A real treat for Final Fantasy fans, this is essentially a greatest hits package: not of the individual Final Fantasy games in full, but rather some of their most memorable moments. It's a brisk adventure through the RPG series' history, with a big roster of characters and weekly events in store. iPhone / iPad Stormblades (Free + IAP) Stormblades is cut from similar cloth to epic fighting game Infinity Blade, even if it's not quite up to its standards. Warriors, weapons and a galoot of enormous enemies to take down provide plenty of fantasy fun. iPhone / iPad .Decluster: Into the Bullet Hell (\u00a32.29) \"A mass of bullets and enemies. All you need is just to dodge and to fire,\" claims the App Store listing to Masayuki Ito's shoot 'em up. Don't worry: there's a beginner's difficulty setting, although it's on the harder settings that you'll get the full bullet-hell experience. Marvellous. iPhone / iPad Star Wars Rebels: Recon Missions (Free + IAP) In theory, animated TV show Star Wars Rebels is for children. In practice, it's appealing to a fair few nostalgic adults too, filling the gap before the next all-new Star Wars film. This is its first official game, throwing in Stormtroopers, TIE fighters and all sorts of other familiar Star Wars faces. iPhone / iPad Dungeon Hero RPG (Free + IAP) If you've grown up with dungeon-crawling adventures, this will ping all the right nostalgic synapses in your brain. Heroes, magic, hand-to-hand or ranged combat, and LOTS of monsters to fend off, with the promise of more story-based action to come. iPhone / iPad Compass Point: West (Free + IAP) Clash of Cowboys? There are definitely elements of Clash of Clans in this Wild West-themed game, but it's got a spark of originality too as you build your posse, explore the wild frontier and protect your town. iPhone / iPad Mr Jump (Free + IAP) The new Flappy Bird? With millions of downloads in its first few days on the App Store, Mr Jump is certainly something of a craze. It's more of an endless platformer than a flappy clone, as Mr Jump\u2026 well, jumps his way through the game. It's brutally hard, but somehow keeps you coming back. iPhone / iPad What have I missed? The comments section is open for your recommendations, and your feedback on the apps above."
