  "content": "Cinema has long been suspicious of new technology, be it supercomputers that will eventually become self-aware and enslave mankind (The Terminator, The Matrix) or slow-moving green-on-black text that has to read aloud for some reason (The Net). So when social media came along, it was only a matter of time before film-makers began to tut disapprovingly at that, too. There was Catfish, which taught the world that everyone on the internet is probably an obsessive housewife with a personality disorder. There was David Schwimmer's Trust, which taught the world that everyone on the internet is probably some sort of paedophile. And now there's @urFRENZ which, as well as having a title that makes my soul die whenever I have to type it, also deals with the perils of social media. Can @urFRENZ dial back some of the rampant scaremongering that the other films have been guilty of? Let's take a look at its trailer \u2026 The premise of @urFRENZ seems to revolve around how easy it is to bully strangers on the internet. This woman, for example, has just discovered that her teenage daughter is the victim of an online smear campaign. Chances are it was this girl who started the campaign. Look at her, with her sneer and her vaguely alternative makeup. She's a menace, and her cruel actions must be stopped. But how? The mother from the first image knows. She's going to get her own back by creating a fake profile on @urFRENZ, which is just like Facebook except it has a name that makes you want to self-harm whenever you write it or say it out loud. Anyway, she invents a dreamy young boy with lovely teeth called Brandon. Brandon enjoys hanging out and the television show Legendcrackers, which is just like Mythbusters except it has a name that makes you want to self-harm whenever you write it or say it out loud. The mother decides to use fake Brandon to give the bully a taste of her own medicine. But will it work? It's hard to tell. Because @urFRENZ is about the murky world of social media, the trailer mostly consists of decontextualised laptop-based reaction shots. So, while this image could represent the mother's growing obsession with @urFRENZ, it could equally just show her wondering why an old schoolmate from 25 years ago suddenly wants to be her best mate on Facebook. And while this might show the girl's growing fascination with the fictional Brandon, it could just as easily show her continued bewilderment at the fact that MySpace still exists. And then there's this guy. His look of utter defeat probably suggests that another stranger with a foreign-sounding name who's probably a front for a black market pharmaceutical phishing scam has just put him in a Google+ circle against his will. Oh no. Now the obsession with social media has spread to mobile, too. There she is, getting angry with a retrogressive Daily Mail article about fat women that someone has just retweeted. She knows deep down that reading it will just encourage them to publish more deliberately offensive stories like this, but she can't help herself. Wait, what's that in the sidebar? A thing that Jan Moir wrote about how gay people don't look like they wash their hands very often? This is outrageous. OUTRAGEOUS. \"OMG, this woman is awful, plz RT,\" she tweets, unaware that this is exactly the reaction that the paper had anticipated. Truly, this is as bad as addiction to social media gets. Or is it? No, wait \u2013 this is as bad as it gets. The poor girl. She's so far gone that she's now performing an ironic re-enactment of the Leave Britney Alone video. For shame, @urFRENZ. Look what trouble you've caused."
