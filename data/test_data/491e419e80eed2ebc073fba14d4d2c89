  "content": "Renren, China's answer to Facebook, raised $743m (\u00a3448m) with its eagerly awaited flotation on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, as shares in the social network rocketed in early trading. Investors scrambled to bet huge sums on the Chinese social media giant, set at $14 a share for its market debut \u2013 about 50% higher than the expected price range posted last week. The company's share price had settled at just under $19 a share by 4pm London time, about 35% up on its opening level. Renren becomes the latest Chinese internet giant to make its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, capitalising on investor clamour for the new generation of internet companies. Recent flotations from China's booming internet market include the online video company Youku and the dating website Jiayuan. The loss-making social network, which has about 5 million monthly users, sold 53.1m US depositary shares for $14 each, raising $743.3m, according to its underwriters. Renren chief executive, Joseph Chen, vowed to report a profit \"definitely very soon\". Chen added: \"I believe this will enhance our brand and further validate our position as the leading real-name social networking internet platform in China. This listing brings us an important step closer to realising our vision to define social networking experience and to revolutionise the way that people in China connect, communicate, entertain and shop.\" Renren posted a net loss of $64.2m last year, down from $70.1m in 2009. The company reported revenues of $76.5m last year. Renren's largest backer is Japan's SoftBank, which owns a 40% stake. Investor demand for the site proved strong despite concerns over its prospectus, its internal financial structure, and government influence over the Chinese internet market. Renren's already-delayed initial public offering was thrown into question on Tuesday as Derek Palaschuk, a board member who heads the company's audit committee, resigned over allegations of fraud against a separate company \u2013 Longtop Financial Technologies \u2013 of which he is chief financial officer. The six-year-old company also revised its prospectus to potential investors after observers pointed out potential inaccuracies with its user figures. Initially, Renren said its user base had grown 29% in the first quarter of this year. It later revised that figure to 19%. Renren is one of the first social networking companies to float on the New York Stock Exchange, just five months after the popular social network for business professionals, LinkedIn, declared its intention to go public. Facebook, the world's most popular social network which has attracted a $70bn valuation, is expected to go public next year, with fellow social media sites Twitter and Zynga expected to follow suit. Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse were lead underwriters on Renren's IPO. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
