  "content": "Global perceptions of Pakistan have been largely shaped by natural disasters, terrorism and official corruption. In newspapers and popular culture, meanwhile, the country has been portrayed as a dusty pit of desolation. The visit of Brandon Stanton, the street photographer behind the celebrated Humans of New York project, was nothing if not timely. After touring 11 countries with the UN last September to raise awareness of the millennium development goals, Stanton announced he would be visiting Pakistan to give the stories of ordinary people the same global platform enjoyed by contributors to his original project. Stanton's Humans of New York Facebook page has more than 14 million likes. While many of the photos and their accompanying tales tell of struggles and strife, they also paint a picture of hope and resilience. Stanton sees his project as a way of delivering a more holistic view of a place. \"If there's one thing about Humans of New York that I take particular pride in, it's that it tends to show a more normal and randomised distribution of stories. It's not that I ignore violence and terrorism. I just don't travel to a country seeking out those stories. Therefore the portrayal of a country is softer, sympathetic and, in my view, far more accurate.\" Stanton's journey in Pakistan began in the dream-like landscape of the Hunza Valley, a mountainous terrain in the north-western Gilgit-Baltistan region. The first few photos alone dispelled the myths surrounding the country's environment, with images of the lush green forests of Karimabad, the translucent lakes, and the tall mountain-tops disappearing into the clouds showcasing a natural beauty to rival that of the Swiss Alps. The Hunza Valley's residents offered mixed stories. Some lamented forlorn dreams or recalled impoverished circumstances from which they had since escaped, while others described the daily struggle to support their families. But many were happy with their lot, and spoke of prosperity and contentment. As Stanton moved through the country, travelling from Lahore to Karachi, a common theme emerged amid the diverse experiences. People wanted the same things: security and freedom, a home for their families, access to healthcare, and education. These basic wishes \u2013 necessities as well as universal human rights \u2013 were frequently not being met by the state. Because of Pakistan's turbulent political history, its populace has never relied on the government for support. There is no welfare state, no proper state education, no NHS. The country's largest ambulance network, as well as its largest cancer hospital, are run by charities, the Edhi Foundation, and the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust respectively. In times of hardship, people turn to extended family, community and charities for help. Anything from a small accident at work to short-term illness can cripple a family's finances, plunging them into a life of poverty. There is no official safety net. It was also clear, however, that Pakistan is a developing country, where developing is a verb and not an adjective. Things are changing. The vacuum left by an ineffective state has been filled by the emergence of dedicated grassroots organisations that have stepped in to plug the gap. Humans of New York highlighted the vital work of the Bonded Labour Liberation Front, for example, an organisation led by Syeda Ghulam Fatima that aims to eradicate bonded labour, a pernicious form of modern-day slavery. Within hours of Fatima's story being posted online, hundreds of comments appeared from people around the world who wanted to know how they could help. Humans of New York set up a fundraising page for people wishing to donate and, in just four days, 73,000 people collectively donated more than $2m (\u00a31.3m) to help free the labourers. Activists such as Fatima are challenging gender inequality and economic injustice in Pakistan, and with growing momentum. These individuals and their organisations are challenging the familiar narrative of Pakistani people as either passive victims or barbaric aggressors, retraining the spotlight on the overwhelming majority in between. Stanton believes the international community has misconceptions about Pakistan and vice versa. \"The tendency to stereotype based on limited information seems to be a universally shared trait of humanity. But Pakistan seems to get an unfair share, because so much of the country's image is branded by its most extreme elements \u2013 terrorism, violence, patriarchalism. These are the stories that the international media is most drawn to. So unfortunately, these are the stories of Pakistan that people hear most often.\" Asked what most surprised him about Pakistan, Stanton said it was the country's similarity to India: \"The richness of culture, the hospitality, the landscape. This striking similarity only deepens the tragedy of the hatred that exists between them. Little separates these two countries except for religion and a violent history of conflict. It's one of the world's greatest tragedies that two of the most beautiful and similar peoples \u2026 can possess such a deep rooted fear and hatred of each other.\" Stanton's photos may be helping to bridge the divide, however. An Indian Facebook commenter wrote: \"I am loving this Pakistan series. We're not all as different as we think.\""
