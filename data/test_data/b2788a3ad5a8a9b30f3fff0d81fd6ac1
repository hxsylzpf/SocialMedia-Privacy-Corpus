  "content": "Ministers have launched a cross-party review of the Freedom of Information Act that is likely to be viewed as an attempt to curb public access to government documents. The move comes just hours after papers released on Friday under FOI disclosed that British pilots have been involved in bombing in Syria. Matthew Hancock, the Cabinet Office minister, laid a statement before parliament outlining details about the five-person commission that will be asked to decide whether the act is too expensive and overly intrusive. Members will include Jack Straw, the former foreign secretary, who is already on the record calling for the act to be rewritten. Straw is still the subject of FOI requests over the rendition of a terror suspect during his time in office. Lord Carlile of Berriew will also sit on the commission. He accused the Guardian of \"a criminal act\" when it published stories using National Security Agency material leaked by Edward Snowden. The committee's other members will be Michael Howard and Dame Patricia Hodgson, and it will be chaired by Lord Burns. Hancock wrote that the review was intended to make sure that the act is working effectively, 15 years after it was introduced by Labour. \"[The commission will] consider whether there is an appropriate public interest balance between transparency, accountability and the need for sensitive information to have robust protection,\" he wrote. \"And whether the operation of the act adequately recognises the need for a 'safe space' for policy development and implementation and frank advice.\" Campaigners fear that the commission could tighten rules stating that if a request from the public or the media takes a long time to process, it can be rejected on grounds of cost. At present, anyone can ask for information so long as finding it does not cost more than \u00a3600 in the case of a government department, and \u00a3450 for another public body. Officials have discussed either lowering that limit or including extra items in the cost, including time spent on \"considering and redacting\" any releases. Senior Tories have previously said they are considering strengthening the ministerial veto after the Guardian's successful 10-year campaign to release Prince Charles's 'black spider memos'. Ministers lost their legal battle to block the publication of those letters earlier this year when the supreme court ruled that Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, had been wrong to apply his ministerial veto. Michael Gove hinted last month that the government could make it more difficult for applicants to request to see the advice that civil servants have given to ministers. This is despite the fact that there is already an exemption for most internal civil service advice. Campaigners fear that, in future, officials' memos will be kept secret for 20 years under a blanket ban. Ministers have long called for reforms to the act after claiming that they are forced to avoid writing down information for fear of exposure under FOI. They also believe that the act stifles creative thinking among officials. Information commissioner Christopher Graham said he would be happy to give evidence to the committee and praised the act for opening up the corridors of power to greater scrutiny. \"The act is not without its critics, but in providing a largely free and universal right of access to information, subject to legitimate exceptions, we believe the freedom of information regime is fit for purpose,\" he said."
