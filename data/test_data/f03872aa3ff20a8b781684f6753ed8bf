  "content": "Reading this having clicked through via Twitter? Then you've not suffered the problem that a lot of people did today when the number of Twitter updates that there have been ever passed 2,147,483,647. Many Twitter programs - though not the web interface, for reasons we'll explain - stopped working, giving the slightly mystical reaction \"operation could not be completed\", even though Twitter itself was working fine. You'll recognise at once why. Or maybe not, if computer science isn't your strongest. The significance: the number above (around the 2 billion mark) is the largest number that can be stored as a \"signed integer\" using a 32-bit integer system. (An unsigned 32-bit integer could go up to 2^32 -1, or 4,294,967,295.) And the problem: if your program can't handle a number large than that, then when it's presented with an update whose number is larger than that, it will simply refuse to believe it. The sky has fallen! Down is up! And so on. It led to the collapse of Twitterrific on the iPhone, and problems with searching for Tweetie on the iPhone, though there's not much news of other problems on third-party services (darn). As Mo points out (on Twitter....) although Craig Hockenberry, of the Twitterrific developers IconFactory, figured out what was wrong (well, people have been expecting it), and though they did come up with a fix almost at once, the problem is that the iPhone app has to go through the iPhone App Store approval process. Which Mo sums up thus: \"Diary of an App Store Reviewer: \"Saw urgent update to Twitteriffic. Moved it to my \"review in a fortnight\" queue.\" (That being a reference to John Gruber's \"Excerpts From the Diary of an App Store Reviewer\", which if you haven't read, you should: it's finely-pointed satire on the whole approval process.) There's even a Twitpocalypse page which has a counter showing that.. the total has long passed. (Interesting to note that we're currently travelling at 161 tweets per second..) Clearly, Twitter itself has been rather wiser in its allocation of the database fields for the service. And as has already been pointed out, it only takes one SQL instruction to get the database to update to be large enough that everyone on the planet can be tweeting (plus various bits of your house) and it still won't run out of ids. CNet has a thorough in-and-out of the back-and-forths - the people at Twitter had been thinking of forcing it past the \"limit\" earlier, but decided not to. You'll recall that there was a similar concern about Facebook a while back, with a group called \"If this group reaches 4,294,967,296 it might cause an integer overflow.\" Happily, it didn't. The Los Angeles Times says it was more of a viral marketing stunt... and that the developer didn't think it would happen. We're probably safe for a day or two. So if your iPhone app isn't working and you're not reading this.. other people are. \u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 17 June 2009. We said the number of Twitter updates had passed 2,147,483,6471, but that number included a stray 1: we meant 2,147,483,647. This has been corrected."
