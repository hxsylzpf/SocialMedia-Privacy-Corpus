  "content": "BuzzFeed UK and Facebook have joined forces to live stream an EU referendum event that will include David Cameron. The two digital media companies have linked up to host a day-long \"town hall\" event on the EU referendum on 10 June. The companies promise that the event will include \"prominent representatives\" from the Remain and Leave campaigns, but only name Cameron as a definite attendee at this stage. \"The referendum on 23 June is the most important vote in our country for a generation and the BuzzFeed News and Facebook event is a great chance to debate what sort of future we want for our country,\" said Cameron. The event will be streamed using Facebook Live on BuzzFeed UK's page on the social network. \"The EU referendum is the biggest political story of the year and we are very much looking forward to bringing this debate to life with our audience in new and compelling ways, using new technologies,\" said Janine Gibson, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed UK. Each of the representatives will be questioned by a live audience of 100 voters in separate sessions across the day, moderated by BuzzFeed News political editor Jim Waterson and senior political correspondent Emily Ashton. Session timings are still to be finalised. \"As we enter the final three weeks of the campaign, referendum discussion on Facebook is really heating up,\" said Theo Lomas, Facebook's government and politics specialist for EMEA. \"Millions of people have joined the debate on Facebook to discuss the issues they care about and the likely repercussions of a Yes or No vote. We hope that the campaign representatives will use the live event next Friday to help answer some of these questions and help undecided voters across the country reach a decision.\" Google declined to comment, and Facebook and Twitter had not provided a comment at the time of publication."
