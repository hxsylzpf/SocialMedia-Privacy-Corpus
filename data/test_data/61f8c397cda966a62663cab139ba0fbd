  "content": "It takes effort to remain relevant in the quicksand that is social media, so special mention to Gigi Hadid, a model who was born around the same time as Myspace, came of age on Instagram and has now landed a gig as the new face of Topshop. It's worth remembering that Cara Delevingne fronted last season so, you know, that's pretty solid work given that Hadid, 20, doesn't really exist outside Instagram. The autumn/winter campaign, shot by Tyrone Lebon and styled by Kate Phelan, is typically Topshop: for the main campaign, they lean towards a mainstream look, which showcases staples (leather jackets, a trans-seasonal signature LBD, something in leopard print) alongside a few key pieces, in this case a grungey plaid hoodie or faux fur coat. A product of reality TV (her mother appeared on the The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills), Hadid signed to IMG in 2011. She landed a campaign with Guess the following autumn and has since appeared in further campaigns for Tom Ford, Seafolly, and Maybelline. On the catwalk, she has walked for Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs and Chanel. She opened and closed the last Max Mara show and has appeared on several international issues of Vogue, Grazia and CR Fashion Book last year. She says things like \"on fleek\", photographs her Big Macs and isn't shy of a selfie. So, to all extents, your archetypal millennial. The fact that you can carve a career via the prism of social-media self-marketing has led to the phenomenon of what Vogue dubbed the 'Instagirls' \u2013 models whose social-media currency, predominantly on Instagram, has propelled them into a new and unique realm of smartphone infamy, juggling high fashion with commercial and tabloid via their strong social-media presence. There's a bunch of them too \u2013 see Kendall Jenner and Karlie Kloss whose success ties loosely into the metaphysical theory that if you don't exist on social media then you don't exist at all. So it doesn't matter that you've not heard of Hadid. The fact is, she's pushing 5 million followers on Instagram. Case closed."
