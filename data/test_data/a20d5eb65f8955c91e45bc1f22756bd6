  "content": "The government has launched a consultation into UK media plurality that calls for the impact of the BBC to be included for the first time, and questions whether newspaper websites and digital outlets, such as the Huffington Post, Google News, Facebook and Twitter should be included. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport unveiled a 24-page consultation on Tuesday, following Lord Justice Leveson's recommendation for a clear measurement framework to evaluate how media plurality should be measured in the digital age. The consultation points out that the BBC is the biggest provider of news on TV, radio and the internet \u2013 spending \u00a3430m on news and current affairs in 2011, more than the rest of the UK's broadcasters combined \u2013 but has never been included in a market plurality review. \"As a major player in the market, the BBC has a significant impact on the overall range and scale of provision,\" the DCMS said in the consultation. \"As such, we consider that a measurement framework should assess the BBC's impact on plurality. [This is] distinct from the question of whether the BBC should be subject to any new plurality regulation.\" News Corporation has previously lobbied vigorously for the corporation to be included in any review of media plurality in the UK. Existing media ownership rules only take into account newspapers, television and radio, and the consultation will look at whether digital-only businesses, such as the Huffington Post, Google News and Facebook, should be included in future reviews of plurality. It will also look at whether to include the impact of the websites of newspaper publishers, which could impact the \"20/20\" rule of media ownership. That rule, sometimes dubbed the \"Murdoch clause\", prevents any person who owns a national newspaper group from holding more than 20% of a regional or national ITV service or Channel 5. Currently, the measure of the 20% threshold of national newspaper market share is based solely on print sales figures. The consultation will also look at what type of content should be considered in any test of media plurality. The rules have traditionally looked at news provision. Respondents will be asked to give a view on genres including sport, light entertainment and drama, as well as whether social media should be included in a measurement framework for plurality. \"Social media enables individuals and special interest groups to publicise their views and opinions more easily, and can be a first source of breaking news,\" the DCMS said. \"For example, some major news stories in recent years, such as the American forces' raid on Osama bin Laden and the announcement of the royal wedding, were broken first on Twitter. It has also been argued that a tweet is more like a broadcast than an email and as a consequence is subject to the law of libel in the same way.\" The DCMS unveiled the media plurality consultation alongside its policy strategy paper for the media, telecoms and technology sectors, \"Connectivity, content and consumers: Britain's digital platform for growth\" \u2013 published in lieu of a white paper, which has been quietly dropped. Among the proposed measures is a broadening of legislation to protect the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5's prime slots on electronic programme guide as part of their public service broadcasting licences. \"There are now multiple new ways of discovering and accessing TV programmes online, for example, through SkyGo, or Virgin Media's TiVo,\" the DCMS said. \"As a result, we need to look again how the prominence of PSBs can be maintained as viewers move away from standard definition formats, viewing at the time of broadcast and traditional numerical channel lists, to a world of high- definition, catch up TV with more dynamic and tailored menus.\" The DCMS has also confirmed that it intends to finally make a \"decision in principle\" later this year on a date for digital radio switchover. \"[This] will provide the radio industry and consumers with greater certainty, would support investment in innovation and content, and enable consumers to make informed purchase decisions,\" said Ford Ennals, chief executive of Digital Radio UK, the body set up to promote and execute switchover. \"A positive government decision will trigger the next stage of DAB coverage buildout, which will enable millions of additional households to receive local BBC and commercial radio stations.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
