  "content": "Prince Edward is to remain defiantly at the helm of his TV production company in blatant opposition to the wishes of Prince Charles and other senior royals. Malcolm Cockren, the chairman of Ardent Productions, told MediaGuardian.co.uk that Prince Edward's involvement in the company \"will not change\". He also blamed media intrusion for Ardent's failure to secure TV commissions in the past. \"I suspect his [Edward's] role will not change. We'll conclude the A-Z of Royalty and then I expect him to inject as much energy as always into our film and drama projects,\" said Mr Cockren. \"His royalty has always been regarded as paramount and whatever the company can do, we are committed to helping him in that.\" The defiant stand is likely to whip up a storm of protest from the senior royals, who believe the Earl and Countess of Wessex should curtail their commercial ventures. The prince's stance mirrors that of his wife, Sophie Wessex, who refused to quit her PR company, R-JH, after the \"Sophiegate\" scandal, in which an undercover reporter revealed the extent to which the firm cashed in on its royal connections. Later this week Prince Edward and Ardent are to make \"meaningful apologies\" for filming in Prince William's university town of St Andrews, said Mr Cockren. But the apologies will fall short of admitting the company was trying to film Prince William. Mr Cockren said: \"We hope today to be able to hand over the material shot on the Sunday in question. \"After that, Edward, I or both of us will issue a further statement confirming categorically there was no footage of Prince William - as everyone has been suggesting - and confirming categorically the footage has been handed over.\" He said he needed more time to piece together the events of last week before any official apology would be issued. \"I've spent the last few days - and will spend today - getting the facts in place,\" said Mr Cockren. \"After that we can make some decisions and meaningful apologies. Give us a bit more time to do our job properly and ferret out the facts.\" He added he had \"no knowledge whatsoever\" of any discussions Prince Edward may have had with his family. The Queen's senior advisers were today in crisis talks with the Earl of Wessex. Prince Charles is thought to believe the palace inquiry into \"Sophiegate\" by the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Luce, did not go far enough in curbing the commercial interests of members of the royal family. Mr Cockren said Ardent would switch its focus from making programmes about royalty to producing drama. \"I never said we wouldn't do royal stories but we've no intention of going out to make royal programmes. \"There's nothing in the pipeline and no reason to suppose anyone would come up with an idea for a royal programme,\" he said. But Mr Cockren refused to confirm any forthcoming productions from Ardent, blaming the media for the fact the company had lost business in the past. He said: \"I'm not prepared to discuss it [potential business] today. We have lost out so many times in the past because confidentiality has been denied us by the media. \"When we are talking to potential financial backers and partners, they don't expect us to talk to the media. Other production companies don't.\" Last year Ardent scraped a \u00a330,000 profit but has lost almost \u00a32m over the past eight years. Mr Cockren confirmed Ardent had not sold all its shares and \u00a3500,000-worth of shares were available for new investors.",
