  "content": "Child killer Mary Bell has won her high court bid for lifelong anonymity to protect her and her daughter from unwarranted press intrusion and the threat of attack. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the president of the family division, today granted an injunction preventing Bell's identity from being disclosed, after hearing that disclosure could lead to harassment. She said she had granted the injunction for different reasons from the case of Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, the killers of Jamie Bulger, whom she has also granted lifelong anonymity in a separate case. \"As far as I am aware, there are at present no other child killers who have been released from prison or detention,\" the judge said. Mary Bell, now 46, was 11 years old when she was convicted of the manslaughter of two young boys, Martin Brown, four, and three-year-old Brian Howe. She was detained at her majesty's pleasure and has lived under a new identity since she was released on licence in 1980. \"The granting of the relief sought by the claimants in this case is not, and is not to be taken to be, a broadening of the principles of the law of confidence nor an increase in the pool of those who might in the future be granted protection against potential breaches of confidence,\" said Dame Elizabeth. Bell's lawyers argued that if her identity was revealed, her safety and that of her daughter, who turns 19 on May 25, would be jeopardised. They feared they would have come under attack or been subject to unwarranted press intrusion, which could have ruined their lives, particularly that of her daughter who is innocent of any crime. The families of her two victims believe Bell should bear the consequences of the crimes she committed. However, Dame Butler Sloss ruled that it was in the public interest that Bell's identity and that of her daughter should remain a secret. The press did not contest the proceedings and the attorney general, representing the public interest, did not oppose the injunction, granted under article eight of the European convention on human rights, which upholds the right to a person's private and family life. The Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror have argued in the past that any decision in the case of Bell could have an impact on that of Moors murderer Myra Hindley, potentially entitling her to keep her identity secret if she was ever released from prison. However, Hindley has since died.",
