  "content": "Death, a Tarot card interpreter might say, isn't an end; it's just a transition. However, the physical fact is that this transition from being into not being is very much a meatspace phenomenon. Yet we the living dress it up in all kinds of ritual garb and mourn our losses as if they - the ones who've departed - are paying attention. A powerful psychological coping mechanism, this has naturally manifested in the digital space as well. The web has transformed the death experience. From live expiration to global dissemination to eternal memorialisation, we can now live on for as long as the technology that houses the bits and the bytes that we leave behind doesn't become obsolete. As we advance inevitably towards the biggest death day in the annual calendar, Untangling the Web pauses to reflect on how much has happened in the web's lifetime, and how our own corporeal moments on this mortal coil are really only just the beginning. If you have a digital death experience or would like to share your thoughts, send an email to aleks.krotoski.freelance@theguardian.com or tweet me @aleksk with #uttw and #death. Follow the progress of this column on the Untangling the Web blog.",
