  "content": "\u2022 Facebook has finally instituted new privacy settings and pulled the plug on local, city-based networks in its attempt. Co-founder Mark Zuckerberg explains it a little in a post on the Facebook blog, suggesting that it is an attempt to \"create a simpler model for privacy control\" - though whether it pans out that way or not has yet to be seen. The change takes place as of now, but the announcement isn't strictly new - we first reported that this was due to happen back in the summer. \u2022 For anyone who rolls their eyes at the idea of stories about Facebook, the next headline isn't going to make you any happier, given that it spins off the only startup that's more over-saturated in the media than Zuckerberg's baby. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey officially unveiled his new project, Square, on Tuesday - it's a little gizmo that turns an iPhone into a credit card scanner, with the idea that it gives anyone with a handset the ability to take physical payments. The company's already got $10m in funding (which TechCrunch says gives it a $40m valuation even before it launches anything). \u2022 Oh, and you'll be pleased to hear that the latest episode of the Guardian's Tech Weekly podcast is now live. In the host's chair, once again, is the inimitable Susi Weaser, who oversees a show in which we hear from Josh Harris - the internet entrepreneur whose obsession with surveillance turned him into the subject of award-winning documentary We Live in Public - and find out more about the (slightly odd) launch of Freeview HD.
