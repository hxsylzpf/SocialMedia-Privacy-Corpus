  "content": "Spoilers of the kind Hello! ran on the wedding of Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas are a fact of life in the world of celebrity magazines, the high court heard today. James Price QC, acting for Hello!, said publishing photographs before official wedding pictures were released was far from unusual. He pointed out that OK!, which had signed an exclusive deal to cover the Douglases' wedding, had earlier spoiled an exclusive deal between Hello! and TV presenter Gloria Hunniford by publishing unofficial pictures of her wedding. \"Hello! was pipped to the post,\" said Mr Price. \"Spoiler features are commonplace... It just happens all the time.\" Douglas and Zeta Jones are suing Hello! for publishing unauthorised photographs of their November 2000 wedding after they had struck an exclusive \u00a31m deal with OK!. Mr Price added that Hello!'s publisher, Sally Cartwright, said in her witness statement: \"Spoilers of this kind are simply a regular feature of this market.\" He added: \"She concludes it didn't occur to her it was unlawful, indeed, it was no different from what had recently been done by OK! in relation to the Hunniford wedding and on many other occasions.\" Mr Price held up the January 8 edition of Hello!'s Spanish sister publication, Hola!, whose front cover was devoted to the wedding of veteran French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo. He then held up a second magazine and explained: \"This is an issue of Paris Match - what do you see on the front cover? 'Le mariage du Belmondo.' Has Hola! complained that its exclusive rights were breached? No it's just one of those things.\" However, Michael Tugendhat QC, the Douglases' council, argued this evidence was not relevant to the case and should be struck out. Hunniford had declined to give a witness statement in relation to the matter, he said. Mr Tugendhat then quoted from the evidence given by Martin Townsend, who was the editor of the Daily Express at the time of Hunniford's wedding. \"The photographs were taken outside the church. None of OK!'s staff went into the reception. OK! had no prior agreement. OK! didn't receive any complaint from Gloria Hunniford. The subsequent relationship was very good. Gloria granted OK! rights to cover her 60th birthday,\" he said. \"The first time Hello! complained about the matter was in these proceedings more than two years after the event. \"It's the 'everyone does it' answer that lawyers are so familiar with hearing from everyone caught in unlawful conduct. An argument in favour of a vicious spiral down to the gutter.\" Mr Price also denied claims that Hello!'s owner, Eduardo Sanchez Junco, had entered into a prior agreement to buy the Douglas wedding photos from paparazzi photographers. \"It's certain that Mr Sanchez Junco declined to be involved in sending a photographer into this wedding in New York but he agreed to buy the photographs after the event,\" Mr Price said. \"The evidence overwhelmingly shows they refused to pay in advance. But they were happy to pay after the event.\" The six unauthorised pictures of the wedding that appeared in Hello! were taken by British paparazzi, including the son of former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe, Rupert Thorpe, who held a camera at hip level."
