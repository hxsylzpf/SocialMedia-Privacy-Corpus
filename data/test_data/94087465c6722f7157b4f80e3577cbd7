  "content": "Newspaper clippings of local success stories line the entrance to Silicon Valley's luckiest building. 165 University Avenue: the unremarkable Palo Alto office where Larry Page and Sergey Brin built Google \u2013 now the world's most important internet company \u2013 in 1999. It took only six months for Page and Brin to move on to bigger and better things; their team of 50 people quickly outgrew the corporate-looking office. But a litany of technology companies followed in their footsteps, including Paypal and Milo.com. Today, it is UK music-recognition company Shazam that occupies the hallowed ground. About a dozen people sit at computers in the plainly decorated second-floor office when David Jones, a marketing executive at Shazam, shows me around. To fit another dozen in would be a struggle, he says. \"When we started looking [for a US office] we were pleased to discover that this suite was available,\" says Jones, who moved Shazam into the space last summer. \"The landlord says it has good karma and he's probably right.\" The landlord, Saeed Amidi, is almost as famous as Google and Paypal in Palo Alto. A former carpet salesman turned opportunist investor, Amidi now insists on taking a small stake in the startups he leases to in the city, just in case they \"do a Google\". Amidi split the two-floor office into six suites after Google left, and now leases to three startups \u2013 Shazam, Eye IO and Yummly \u2013 and two private equity firms, Edward Jones Investments and Lanza Tech Ventures. \"It's the centre of Silicon Valley,\" says Jones. \"It's in the middle of the peninsula so you can recruit engineering talent from as far south as San Jose all the way up to San Francisco. It's also the centre of the venture capital community, and close to Facebook, Apple and Google.\" Facebook is a 15-minute drive from the famous office, up through the leafy hills and on to Page Mill Road. At least, that's the corporate headquarters. Mark Zuckerberg and his herd of engineers run the operation from a graffiti-daubed office two miles away. Famously, Facebook has roughly one engineer for every 1 million users. And with the social network nearing 1bn users, it is time to move home. Zuckerberg will move Facebook on to a giant Menlo Park campus by the end of the year, less than 12 months after it pitched up in Page Mill. In the Valley, if you're not moving office, you're standing still. Twitter, too, is on the move. It has shared an uninspiring corporate block with AT&amp;T in the heart of downtown San Francisco for almost two years, when it had about 60 employees. Twitter now employs 650 people, with 200 added in the past six months. It will do the \"Silicon Valley shuffle\" next year, moving a brisk walk from Zynga. \"I remember when we were buying furniture from Craigslist,\" said Marcus Segal, the chief operating officer of game studio operations at Zynga. The fast-growing games publisher set up in a converted shopping mall only five weeks ago. \"We were so surprised by our own growth that we were just focused on keeping the lights on. Now we have community managers for different languages \u2026 I feel like we're just scratching the surface.\" Back at University Avenue, the good karma is palpable. Jones predicts that Shazam, already bursting at the seams of the famous office, will have outgrown the site within nine months. The hunt for the next Google has begun."
