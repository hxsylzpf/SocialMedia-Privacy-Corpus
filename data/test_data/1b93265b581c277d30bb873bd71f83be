  "content": "Life can be a beach \u2013 especially if you are Channing Tatum. Jimmy Kimmel's new music video, (I Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum, has the actor and his White House Down co-star Jamie Foxx singing on the sands. The song also features Tatum's Magic Mike co-star Olivia Munn and Precious actress Gabourey Sidibe \u2013 plus a cameo role for Miley Cyrus who gets trapped under a vending machine. If that video enters the realms of fantasy, wait until you see our trailer for the latest installment of the The Hobbit. Continuing the story begun in An Unexpected Journey, The Desolation of Smaug stars Ian McKellen, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Benedict Cumberbatch, Lee Pace, Sylvester McCoy, Luke Evans, Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly. Peter Jackson's trilogy is set to conclude with There and Back Again next year and the three films together act as prequels to Jackson's Lord of the Rings film trilogy. The appetite for sequels continues unabated and we've got sneak previews of Anchorman 2 and Kick-Ass 2. It took two years to make trials rider Danny MacAskill's latest cycling video and it's a gem. Meanwhile the world of entertainment is mourning the loss of Sopranos actor James Gandolfini and we have a video tribute. To end on a laugh, make your own mind up about Hull health boss Phil Morley who has divided opinion after dressing as Superman to promote fitness at work. Clark Kent, he ain't, but it's life-affirming stuff! Guardian Viral Video Chart. Compiled by Unruly Media and tweaked by Janette 1.
