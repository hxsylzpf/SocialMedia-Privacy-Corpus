So far it's been pretty popular with women (the site has the feel of Good Housekeeping from the 80s) and the cleverest pinners' boards inspire and aspire to perfection. Also visit pinnerstofollow.com for a complete guide CRAFT Etsy For all your crafty goodness \u2013 boards from this marketplace range from DIY projects to gift ideas, and there's one for stationery addicts to follow.
