  "content": "The press complaints commission is under fire once more, and today's report by the Commons select committee into media intrusion is likely to turn up the heat. Questions about the PCC's effectiveness have been raised by the People's Sara Cox misdemeanour and the News of the World's Victoria Beckham kidnap fiasco. In rejecting criticisms in both instances, the PCC's new chairman, Sir Christopher Meyer, argues that the commission, in its primary role as a conciliation service, is doing a fine job. But the nagging doubts about the practice, rather than the concept, of self-regulation continue to grow. One major factor, which has nothing to do with the PCC itself, is the public's deep-rooted suspicion, even hostility, towards newspapers. The other problems come once people complain formally, and discover that dispute resolution, by its nature, means that the scales of justice weigh heavily in the offending paper's favour. Many are also surprised to realise that the PCC has extremely limited powers of investigation and, finally, that the punishment rarely seems to fit the crime. Although a survey, presented by the commission to MPs, found that 92% of complainants were happy with the way their resolved complaints were handled, a recent case, which has received no publicity, suggests that one needs to probe deeper to discover what people really think of the PCC. The saga began a month before Easter when the Sunday Telegraph ran a lengthy story headlined \"Hot cross banned: councils decree buns could be 'offensive' to non-Christians\". It claimed that Tower Hamlets council in London and five city councils - Liverpool, Birmingham, York, Wolverhampton and Wakefield - had banned the schools in their areas from serving hot cross buns in order not to offend children of non-Christian faiths. Unnamed council spokesmen were quoted in support of a story that seemed, even at first glance, to be suspect. For a start, few schools anywhere in Britain serve hot cross buns. But there was an accompanying photograph of three girls at a west London school tucking into their buns. Indeed, the story was wholly false in every respect (including, as we shall see, the picture). As Liverpool city council's media spokesman, Matt Finnegan, said: \"It was a preposterous, made-up story. We've never provided hot cross buns, just as we've never provided caviar, or lobster.\" His views were reflected by the other five official spokespeople, most of whom did their best to quell what became a bushfire in the following couple of days, as papers and radio stations - often without checking - ran with the story. The Times and Daily Express lifted the quotes word for word from the Sunday Telegraph. Then the columnists got at it. The Sun's Richard Littlejohn wrote a vitriolic attack on \"the lame-brained Guardianistas\" in town halls for banning the buns. A Sunday Times writer referred to the \"silly burghers\". Columnists on the London Evening Standard and on regional papers carried similar comments. The Catholic Herald joined the chorus of disapproval. The false tale appeared on several internet sites, attracting predictable fury from racists. Papers in the US and Germany also ran with it. So the audience for what has since become a sort of barmy council urban myth expanded from the couple of million Sunday Telegraph readers into an audience of tens of millions across Britain and untold millions elsewhere. The council press officers found it impossible to get their message across, struggling with poor resources to try to quash what they knew to be an outrageous lie. Wolverhampton's council leader, Roger Lawrence, wrote a strong letter of protest to the Sun, and appeared on a local radio station to confront the two Sunday Telegraph reporters, who were still defending their article. Don Neame, a Tower Hamlets press spokesman, demanded a retraction from the Sunday Telegraph, which was refused. Other councils sent in letters, which the paper did not publish. After more than two weeks without satisfaction, Liverpool made a formal complaint to the PCC, naming the Sunday Telegraph, the Sun, the Express and the Blackpool Evening Gazette. Some of the other councils evidently viewed Liverpool as a stalking horse and did not join in. Helen Edwards, York's head of communications, said: \"We were supportive of Liverpool, but we were hoping for as quick an apology as possible. We didn't feel we had the time and resources to go through the PCC.\" That was, as Edwards recognised in hindsight, a mistake, because the PCC did indeed secure a correction with some speed. The Sunday Telegraph published a retraction of 106 words - placed at the bottom of a page - which mentioned all six councils and included a somewhat mealy-mouthed apology for \"any confusion\". It took longer to get the Express, which apologised only to Liverpool, and the Sun to say sorry. Even so, Littlejohn was not required to apologise in his own column, a suggestion of the PCC's lack of power to insist on where an apology should be placed, and a sign of Littlejohn's own lack of backbone: he made the error and he should have been man enough to own up to it himself. Liverpool and four of the councils (Wakefield was an exception) remained unhappy about the wording and placing of the apologies. But Liverpool, as the single complainant, is the only one with a genuine right to criticise. Finnegan said: \"I don't feel the Sunday Telegraph apology was adequate. I agreed to it on advice from the PCC, which told me they thought it was the best we could get.\" What he may not have known is that he could still have raised an objection afterwards, although he may have shared the world-weary view about newspapers of Birmingham's Jane Spence. She said: \"Press officers have come to expect that a paper will not offer to apologise in print whatever the circumstances. We have learned to have very low expectations in terms of redress.\" Those kinds of views about newspapers underlie much of the public scepticism about the PCC, which has to do much more if it is going to win confidence and quell the rising tide of criticism. Most importantly, it suggests that the PCC must be more pro-active and less hidebound by legalistic and semantic hair-splitting. It must stop sticking so rigidly to a minimalist interpretation of its current modus operandi. While it is obvious that the PCC cannot act on behalf of people who refuse to complain, in this case the lack of formal complaints from five of the councils was largely irrelevant because the Sunday Telegraph had admitted that its story was fictitious. Once that happened, the PCC should have swung into a much more aggressive mode by contacting the other five councils to see if they wished to join Liverpool. It should then have ensured that the Sunday Telegraph placed its apology in a more suitably prominent position. It is no good the PCC claiming, as it routinely does, that the placing was agreed beforehand with the complainant. The supplicant position of most complainants - as Spence mentioned above - means that they will too often accept that what they are being offered is the best that can be achieved. All the papers should have been required to apologise to all the councils. The PCC should also have noted that other titles which ran the story, and which Liverpool had overlooked, such as the Times and London Evening Standard, needed to run apologies, too. Why should their readers live under the misapprehension that hot cross buns had been banned simply because no one had formally complained? Having sorted out the apologies, the PCC should then have censured the Sunday Telegraph for blatant breaches of the editors' code of practice. The story was inaccurate and councils had not been given the opportunity to reply. Finally, we come to that picture of the girls in Ealing eating their buns. They were enjoying them, stated the caption, but \"in Liverpool, York and many other areas the buns are off the menu\". It transpired that the picture was false too. Hathaway primary school does not serve hot cross buns. The headmaster explained that a Sunday Telegraph photographer turned up with a bag of buns for his pupils and he was entirely unaware of the controversial use to which the picture would be put. I would suggest that the picture also breaks the clause of the code about misrepresentation. If the PCC is really going to play a part in cleaning up bad journalistic practice it has a lot of work to do."
