  "content": "The Government's police inspectorate backed down today after facing a furious online backlash over the choice of name for its new website. Officials at HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said they will find a new name for mypolice.org.uk, which was launched amid some fanfare last month. Entrepreneurs behind the fledgling internet venture mypolice.org, an independent police feedback service, accused the watchdog of trampling over their work. The Guardian highlighted anger over what was seen as a landgrab by HMIC early in March. At the time, Lauren Currie, director of MyPolice (the non-HMIC one), said: \"We are in an extremely narrow market, and it is incredibly likely that confusion would arise if they continue to use our name, Mypolice. It is extremely unprofessional to view all our channels and move forward with the name mypolice. If HMIC launch as Mypolice, they will run the risk of confusing the public to think they are an independent company, which they are not.\" Now HMIC has backtracked, and says that its service \u2013 an innovative statistics database \u2013 will be renamed. \"We have been working with the mypolice.org founders since 8 March 2010 to address their concerns and to provide the best possible solution,\" it said in a statement on its website. \"They asked that we stop marketing 'mypolice.org.uk' as a redirect page, since the public might confuse this with their service. We agreed, and now only refer to www.hmic.gov.uk/mypolice. We also agreed not to renew our ownership of any of the 'mypolice' domains. This will give them the opportunity to buy and use them when they get their service up and running. \"To ensure the public gets the benefits of both services with no chance of confusion, we will change the name of the 'my police' pages on our website. We are currently consulting on the best option, and will announce the results in the next week.\"",
