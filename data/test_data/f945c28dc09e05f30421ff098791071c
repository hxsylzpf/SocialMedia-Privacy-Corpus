  "content": "Guy Black Director of the press complaints commission: a shrewd operator, close to newspaper editors. He is at the forefront of a strategy, supported by most newspapers, to strengthen the credibility of the PCC in order to avoid more stringent statutory regulation of the press. Mark Bolland Deputy private secretary to the Prince of Wales, Mr Black's predecessor as PCC director, and partner. They live together in London's fashionable Clerkenwell district. Architect of Operation PB - the plan to promote the acceptability of Camilla Parker Bowles as consort to the future king. Rebekah Wade Strong-willed editor of the News of the World, made a name for herself with the \"name and shame\" campaign to identify convicted paedophiles living in the community. A friend of Mr Bolland and - by extension - Mr Black. Ross Kemp Said to be a \"childhood friend\" of Mr Black, and now the boyfriend of Ms Wade. A former EastEnders actor - he played bruiser Grant Mitchell in the BBC1 soap - now contracted to ITV.",
