Wearing an dashing suit and standing on a table, West delivered a capella versions of Lost in the World/Chain Gang (above) and Mama's Boyfriend (below) to a room full of cheering Facebook employees. \"Many times in my life I've had to deal with moments of doubt,\" West wrote on his blog, Kanyeuniversity.com, about the performance. \"Your energy was a gift so electric, so genuine, that it really helped me give my best.\" One question: why Facebook?"
