  "content": "In the Oscar-tipped film The Social Network he is depicted as a ruthless young man who founded Facebook to increase his chances with girls and allow him entry into elite Ivy League institutions. Now Mark Zuckerberg has broken his public silence over David Fincher's movie, claiming that the main thing it got right was his clothes. Speaking to an audience at Stanford University in California, Zuckerberg poured scorn on the suggestion that he was motivated mainly by opportunities for social climbing. In real life, he had been with current girlfriend Priscilla Chan since before the advent of Facebook, while in the film he is rejected by an invented character called Erica Albright, he said. \"The whole framing of the movie is I'm with this girl (who doesn't exist in real life) ... who dumps me ... which has happened in real life, a lot,\" he said to laughter from the audience. \"And basically the framing is that the whole reason for making Facebook is because I wanted to get girls, or wanted to get into clubs. \"They [the film's creators] just can't wrap their head around the idea that someone might build something because they like building things,\" he added, though admitting that Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin managed to nail his wardrobe. \"It's interesting the stuff that they focused on getting right \u2013 like every single shirt and fleece they had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own,\" he said. Zuckerberg's comments are surprising because Facebook has previously been careful not to attack The Social Network, a strategy which had appeared to pay dividends. The film has certainly done nothing to harm the company's position as the world's pre-eminent website of its type. Bloggers have called into question Zuckerberg's claims that Albright is not based on a real person. The website Gawker said his claim to have been with Chan throughout Facebook's early period was a \"documented falsehood\", and pointed to a book titled The Facebook Effect which suggests he dated a Berkeley undergraduate during a break in their relationship. In an interview with the New Yorker last month, Zuckerberg did own up to sending a string of instant messages from 2003 which mocked the first wave of users that joined Facebook as \"dumb fucks\" who \"trust me\". Voicing his concerns over the film, he said: \"I think a lot people will look at that stuff, you know, when I was 19, and say, 'Oh, well, he was like that ... He must still be like that, right?'"
