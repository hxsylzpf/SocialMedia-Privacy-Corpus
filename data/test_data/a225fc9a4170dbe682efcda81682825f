  "content": "Quite a number of families will greet Boxing Day with delight because Christmas Day has been completed without acrimony. Others will greet Boxing Day with delight because here is a new morning and a chance to put the acrimony that regretfully erupted on the previous day behind them. Still others, I suppose, will have had a genuinely Merry Christmas, hard as that is for the rest of us to believe. Everyone acknowledges that Christmas is a time for family. Everyone also acknowledges that family can sometimes be tricky. Sometimes, all that stops me from stuffing my teenagers and putting them in the oven is remembering that, as a teenager, I was much more awful than they are. If my parents were around to disagree, they probably would. But my memory is that my own contributions to shattered family unity were greatest when I was a student. Having experienced life away from home, having actually fantasised about how great it would be not to go home for Christmas, I'd developed the idea that my sulky presence was a great favour to my undeserving parental home. What's more, university life had armed me with progressive ideas, ideas I was keen to share. The most painful memory is of the year we ran out of something essential, and my mother announced that this was not at all the disaster it had been in yore, because of \"the Paki shop\". The ensuing conversation went something like this: \"You can't say that, Mum.\" [rolls eyes] \"Say what? Paki shop?\" \"Yes.\" [sighs] \"Don't be silly. Everyone calls it the Paki shop. They call it the Paki shop themselves.\" \"That's because they're trying to fit in.\" [smacks palms against temples] \"Well, that's good. They are fitting in.\" \"I really think you should call it the corner shop. Please. For me. Call it the corner shop. I can't be here, if you say those words.\" [raises chin, looks haughty] \"All right, Deborah. Go to the corner shop and get some Bisto. Happy now?\" \"No.\" [slams front door] I've thought about some of these dilemmas a lot this year, because of all the banging on about \"safe spaces\" at university. The fact of Christmas tension illustrates than even the bosom of the family home is not a guaranteed \"safe space\". Our family Christmases were \"safe\" neither for me nor for my parents, because we had competing ideas about the world. And I'm very glad that university didn't provide me with a \"safe space\", one where I might have felt entitled to learn nothing about how so many of the assumptions my upbringing had fostered were wrong. Do I regret lecturing my parents about sexism, racism and homophobia? No. I only regret that I did it so gracelessly, so badly, so self-righteously. Looking back, I see that what was missing from those 1980s discussions with more enlightened students was any talk of how to broach these subjects to people who hadn't heard these arguments before, or who had proved resistant to them before, in a way that wouldn't make them feel criticised and attacked. So, when I look at students now, demanding their safe spaces and devising protests and punishments against those who wish to pollute them, I find myself marvelling at the wholesale misguidedness of it. But I think I also see what has gone wrong. People often talk about social media being an \"echo chamber\", in which the people most keen to inform themselves end up misinformed, because they absorb everything that supports their worldview and ignore everything that doesn't. Despite all the talk of \"trolls\", social media is a fantastically safe space, where you can filter out anything at all that discomforts you. This generation of students has grown up fully in that space, and sometimes it seems to me that they want to make their universities as unchallenging as they can make their Twitter feeds, muting, blocking and reporting anyone who doesn't accept their gospel in the real world as completely as they are able to in the social media world. No-platforming is blocking, IRL. Quite how all of this will play out is hard to say. Britain has always chugged along using an adversarial model, in the courts and in politics. That's why debating has always been an important aspect of elite education. How a generation of supposedly elite thinkers will get along, having persuaded themselves that their shibboleths are too right and true to benefit from being debated, is anyone's guess. But it's important to remember that \"safe spaces\" can be important too. A recently published report, published in the Chinese Journal of Communication, examined the role of social media in China's \"Umbrella Movement\", this time last year. It found that for \"digital natives\" \u2013 typically people born after 1990 \u2013 the safe environment of social media offered a place where an insurgent movement could be nurtured with relative freedom. Donald Trump may wish to remove the bits of the internet where Isis do this same thing. But, like it or not, safe spaces belong in the digital realm. The information disseminated within them then has to find its way into the actual world and be tested, for good or ill. By refusing to accept the challenges of the real world, no-platforming enthusiasts merely throw away opportunities to develop their own arguments and improve their efficacy. I was unable to mute, block or report my parents (thankfully, or I might have). I was also unable to make my points with much in the way of empathy or elegance. But by Easter, they had become appalled that there had ever been a time when they hadn't said \"corner shop\". You change minds by confronting prejudice, not by banning it. You don't even have to do it very well. It's still far superior to folding your arms and demanding from your adversaries only silence."
