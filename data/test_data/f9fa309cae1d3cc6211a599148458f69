Brooke has been given a \"stern talking to\" after appearing to endorse a range of brands including McDonald's, Domino's Pizza and Sienna fake tan by posting photos of them on her Twitter feed. Apparently the number of products she appeared to endorse to her 76,000 followers got a bit out of hand for ITV bosses who felt she had \"crossed the line\".",
