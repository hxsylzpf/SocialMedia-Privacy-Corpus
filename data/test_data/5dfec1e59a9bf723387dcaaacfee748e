  "content": "The BBC's Persian TV service has been the scourge of the Iranian government since its first broadcast little over two years ago. Without a reporter in the country, and in the face of systematic jamming by state authorities, the World Service channel has become increasingly reliant on video, audio and images published by Iranian citizens. \"Since the presidential protests [in December 2009], the government has realised the power of that footage and decided to work actively to not let the BBC and others broadcast it,\" said Sanam Dolatshahi, a London-based producer and presenter for BBC Persian TV. \"So they would jam our footage and show their own version of events \u2013 using the same UGC, but to tell a different story, a different version of events. They would also try to make us broadcast wrong stuff so that we would lose our credibility.\" Dolatshahi recalls receiving a number of reports \u2013 including from another BBC correspondent \u2013 that a marked police van had repeatedly run over and injured one Iranian protester during the uprising. However, in the absence of citizen footage of the event the news was deemed too unreliable to broadcast. It was three days later, when a series of videos which appeared to support the claims surfaced, that the channel ran with the news. \"Somehow it's as if our coverage is now dependent on pictorial evidence and video footage,\" Dolatshahi said. \"But if you rely on videos so much then you don't have enough to prove stories. It's very challenging for us when we're accused of feeding protests and showing wrong stuff. So we have to sit down and do more verification and cross-checking of our sources.\" The BBC received around eight videos a minute from the streets of Iran during the 2009 uprising. But it was far from a \"Twitter revolution\", Dolatshahi said. \"The reality was that people in Iran weren't using Twitter. It was people outside of Iran. We were just the receivers of this information. \"It was interesting after the election because people were beginning to hear about YouTube and videos. Some would take it from YouTube and share via Bluetooth on their cell phones. I can confidently say that since the election protests, and when TV channels showed YouTube, more people have started using those communication technologies.\" Raymond Li, the head of BBC China, says he circumvents the communist state's censors by publishing news on Twitter-equivalent sites, where regulation is less strict. \"Foreign media like us have been persistently blocked by China for a long time. Instead people are using proxy software or social media sites to come to us,\" Li said. \"By using microblogging sites the censorship of media seems to be less. By publishing news and content on microblog sites you can publish stuff you wouldn't get published in public media spaces, but you have to be careful and skillful.\""
