  "content": "Name: \"White Saviour Barbie\". Age: 20. Appearance: The very model of western millennial egalitarianism. Is that a compliment? No, definitely not. \"Barbie Savior\" is an Instagram account that satirises the messiah complex of affluent westerners who spend time travelling in the developing world. I'm nothing like that. Really? But didn't you once spend an afternoon helping out in a rural Guatemalan orphanage during your gap year? Yes, but \u2026 And didn't you spend the entire afternoon ignoring the staff and taking selfies with the kids? Yes, but \u2026 And don't those selfies now exist exclusively as a method to convince people that you are nicer than you are, mostly so that they will sleep with you? Rats, busted. It's OK. We have all done it. White Saviour Barbie just shines a light on that a little. In fact, the creators started the account after realising that they were guilty of imitating her behaviour. So what does White Saviour Barbie do? She essentially embodies the obnoxiously self-serving \"They have nothing, but they're so happy\" attitude of many western travellers. For example, the caption under a photo of Barbie hugging a black Barbie is: \"Orphans take the BEST pictures! So. Cute. #whatsyournameagain #orphans.\" Is there more? A fortnight ago, she started a charity called Harness the Tears, because: \"Ever since I've been here, I've been crying almost 90% of the time. I realised how wasteful that was as there is such a need for water here! Given the fact that I've always wanted to be a CEO and I'm already 20 years old, I figured it was time to get moving!\" This all sounds a lot like the Sociality Barbie Instagram account from last year. Truth be told, it is. Poor Barbie is quickly becoming the vessel by which white millennials chronicle their own self-loathing. What could possibly be next? Barbie Already Nostalgic for 2011 Student Disco? Barbie Blaming Her Dire Financial Outlook on Baby Boomers by Tweeting a Sad Emoji on Her \u00a3750 Smartphone? What about Barbie Silently Furious at the Condescension of an Apparently Ageing Media? Yes, OK, point taken. Do say: \"Check your privilege, White Saviour Barbie.\" Don't say: \"And don't get me started on you, Masculine Hegemony Mr Potato Head.\"",
