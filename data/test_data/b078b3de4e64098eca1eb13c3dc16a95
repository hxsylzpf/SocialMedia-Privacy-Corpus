  "content": "There was precious little entertainment to be had for Tottenham Hotspur fans during Sunday's 5-0 drubbing at the hands of Liverpool \u2013 which led to manager Andre Villas-Boas being sacked \u2013 but the club has launched a new app to get them playing along with live matches. Spurs Connect, which is currently available for Apple's iPhone and iPad devices, is the result of a partnership between Spurs and mobile developer OneUp Games. Released this month, it's a cross between Bingo and Connect 4, with fans competing with their Facebook friends to correctly predict events during matches, and get four in a row on the in-game board. The game is based on live statistics from Spurs' Premier League matches. \"Spurs Connect takes the best elements of watching the match with your friends and enhances it with direct head-to-head competition,\" claims the App Store listing for the free app, which makes its money from in-app purchases of virtual tokens, which are used to buy power-ups to boost people's chances or impede other players. The game represents Spurs' first step into the \"free-to-play\" games market that has become increasingly dominant on smartphones and tablets. At the time of writing, 46 of the 50 top grossing iPhone games in the UK are free-to-play. US company OneUp Games already has a number of similar partnerships in its homeland, with Connect-branded games available for basketball, American football, baseball and ice hockey via licensing deals with their respective sporting bodies NBA, NFL, MLB and NHL. The company also makes the official (non-gaming) apps for US sports teams the Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers and Tampa Bay Rowdies among others, although Spurs Connect is its first partnership with an English football club. The app is part of Tottenham's wider digital expansion. The club has an official news app, as well as a separate app for its club shop selling merchandise to fans. Earlier in 2013, it launched a web and mobile virtual world for 7-10 year-old children called Tottenham Turfies too. Liverpool's five-in-a-row thrashing on Sunday put paid to Villas-Boas' time at the club, but it remains to be seen if a four-in-a-row mobile game can cheer up fans as Spurs look to fire up their campaign for a top-four finish this season."
