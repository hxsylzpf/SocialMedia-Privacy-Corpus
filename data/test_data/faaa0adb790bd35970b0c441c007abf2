  "content": "Amid the chatter surrounding this week's Digital Britain report, one aspect is going unnoticed \u2013 the involvement of Tanya Byron. Asked by Gordon Brown in September 2007 to look into online safety for children, the psychologist and television presenter published her report, Safer Children in a Digital World, on 27 March last year. Now, as part of communications minister Stephen Carter's review team, Byron is expected to help shape what he describes as a broader \"step change\" in media literacy \u2013 from spreading basic knowledge about going online to the 40% of the population who remain unconnected, to safety issues. The specific challenge, as far as children are concerned, is to give fresh impetus to tackling peer to peer file sharing of child pornography, and the use of social networking sites by paedophiles. But given that Carter's biggest interest is in mapping the way towards a UK with universal broadband coverage, there will also be a pressing need for minimum standards of safety and decency. Byron, the former presenter of Little Angels and House of Tiny Tearaways is credited with raising the tone of the debate, following her report. While she made clear that there is no silver bullet solution, her largely child-centred approach was widely welcomed as pragmatic. She recommended a policy of educating parents, extending the system of age classification for films to video games, and the creation of a UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS), reporting to the prime minister, as a guarantee the online industry would focus and pull together. This was duly followed with a high-profile UKCCIS launch at the Science Museum. But with a hundred members on the Council it seems little of substance has yet percolated through. Nick Lansman, secretary general of Internet Services Providers Association, speaking at the Oxford Media Convention last week said: \"The UK council has taken a long time to get going, though meetings are taking place. That's Government for you. Our members who are on the committee have been frustrated. It's not always the most efficient way of dealing with things.\" Other bodies are, however, faring better. For instance, the Internet Watch Foundation, established 12 years ago, has won the respect of ISPs, which take down sites identified as hosting illegal content on its recommendation. But there is some way still to go: the Child Exploitation &amp; Online Protection Unit (CEOP), part of the police force, believes about 80,000 file-sharing child abuse sites are active. Byron's report also identified the looming danger of abuse and bullying on broadband-enabled mobiles, accessing children direct, out of the home. She also said Ofsted should consider e-safety issues as part of reports on schools. The CEOP is pressing for the extension of a cyber button alert to social networking sites so children, uncomfortable with an approach, can click to register concern. \"For a long time the internet seemed dominated by technology. But it's a public place. We would not tolerate a playground where paedophiles stand on the perimeters,\" said a spokesman. The issue for Digital Britain is how to balance all these competing claims without undermining free expression.",
