  "content": "Bill Gates has shown that even billionaires like to have a bit of fun at Christmas, taking part in Reddit's secret Santa present exchange and making one lucky girl's jaw \"hit the ever loving floor\". Gates apparently took part in the secret Santa event held by social news site Reddit, which matched participants online around the world and broke the world record for the largest secret Santa gift exchange in 2012. The lucky girl, who goes by the name of NY1227 on Reddit, was unknowingly allocated Bill Gates by the system, who diligently shipped a secret Santa package. From 'Bill' Inside was travel book with personal inscription, a stuffed cow and a charitable donation to Heifer International, which \"gives families in need the right tools such as animals, seeds, clean water, safe stoves or a chance for girls to go to school\", all signed \"Bill\". Oblivious as to who \"Bill\" was, it wasn't until NY1227 discovered that Gates had also included a photo of himself holding the stuffed cow and donation card that she realised \"Bill\" was Mr Gates himself. \"Oh.... wait. Holy shit. Time out. And then it finally hit me. All the presents I had just torn open, the charity, everything \u2013 was from Bill GATES ... my jaw hit the EVER LOVING FLOOR,\" said NY1227. Nearly 60,000 users took part in Reddit's secret Santa last year, twice as many as the year before, showing the power of leveraging the social news site's critical mass of users, many of which have been long-time contributors to Reddit across over 120 countries."
