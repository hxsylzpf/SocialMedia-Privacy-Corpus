  "content": "The ruling is the latest in a series of controversial decisions on the balance between an individual's right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression. Judge Eady, the specialist high court judge who presided over last year's notorious case between Max Mosley and the News of the World, said: \"Blogging is essentially a public rather than a private activity.\" He warned that bloggers would have to accept \"a growing trend towards openness and transparency in such matters\". The case is being seen by lawyers as a landmark decision. \"It's a very useful judgment,\" said Alastair Brett, the legal manager at the Times. \"It demonstrates that where you don't have a traditional confidential relationship between two parties, the court won't automatically say that simply because the person wants to remain anonymous they are entitled to legal confidentiality\". Eady's decision is likely to have far-reaching implications for other bloggers. \"The right to speak \u2013 whether it be in Speaker's Corner or cyber corner \u2013 is the right to impart information and ideas, and for another individual to receive them,\" said media lawyer Mark Stephens. \"The right of anonymity is not built in.\" Brett said: \"I don't believe this will have a chilling effect on the free expression rights of bloggers. Bloggers can carry on blogging happily \u2013 this is not going to stop that.\"",
