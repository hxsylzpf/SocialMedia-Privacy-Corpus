  "content": "The story Hugh Hefner dumped He's spent years profiting from the exploitation of women, but at the age of 85 the Playboy king has got something of a comeuppance, having been dumped by his fiancee, 60 years his junior. Citing promiscuity, 25-year-old Crystal Harris called off the 'do' with five days to go, and after the printing press had already rolled out this month's Playboy, which features a cover announcing the new \"Mrs Hefner\". In an attempt to rescue some dignity, Heff has ordered a sticker be placed over the picture describing her instead as the runaway bride. Meanwhile, Crystal's debut single was released this week. It's hard to feel sorry for either of them, really. The stat 15,000 Glasto-goers ... ... will be aged 50 or over. Morality rockers U2 are likely to be among their own demographic as they take to the stage at Glastonbury, as research into the age range of festival goers reveals that one in nine will be Bono's age or older. Questions over how many of them will be taking part in the Art Uncut protest against U2's alleged tax avoidance were evidently left out of the brief. The quote Anthony Weiner \"I'm here to apologise for the personal mistakes I have made and the embarrassment that I have caused.\" Unfortunately-named bright star of the Democrat party is forced to resign after posting a picture of, well, his own wiener, on Twitter. Despite being heralded as a potential future Democratic leader, the disgraced politician left his farewell press conference to cries of \"Bye bye pervert!\" The tweet \"Tango down \u2013 cia.gov \u2013 for the lulz.\" The comedy hackers behind hacks on Sony and Nintendo, claim to have crashed the CIA's public website, announcing it via Twitter. The group have made efforts to democratise their next attack by creating a phoneline that allows fans to suggest potential targets."
