  "content": "Not so long ago, each World Cup or European championship would be accompanied by articles by leading authors \u2013 profiles of players or managers that might involve literary comparisons, cerebral reports on key games, and the occasional magisterial dismissal of all football as Roman circuses in modern, hyper-real guise (Umberto Eco's essay The World Cup and its Pomps). Few such interventions have been seen so far this time; those eager for novelists' takes on players and play in Brazil have had to make do with a New Republic compilation of mini-profiles in which Joseph O'Neill discussed Arjen Robben (\"Everything about him is irritating\"), Aleksandar Hemon wrote about Bosnia and Herzegovina's aptly-named playmaker Miralem Panic, Karl Ove Knausgaard pointed out that Argentina's Angel de Maria is \"Kafka's double\", Jess Walter accurately predicted \"Portuguese pest\" Pepe would be a disaster, and Geoff Dyer semi-opted out characteristically by enthusing about the non-participating Gareth Bale. Significantly, this appeared before the tournament and nothing similar has surfaced during it (similarly Wimbledon, previously covered by the likes of Martin Amis, went by without any instances of posh sportswriting); perhaps because we've all become more impatient, and there's less appetite or scope for the reflective essay that requires thinking-time and the burnishing of prose. Today's demand is for shorter pieces and instant insight during sporting events, and only one award-winning novelist has provided that in writing about Brazil 2014. This is Nigerian-American Teju (Open City) Cole, who also, relevantly, has Belgian and Swiss connections, and whose 157,000-follower Twitter stream has been almost entirely dedicated to football during the tournament. His thoughts on games has been full of jokes (\"Prince Harry [a red-headed striker] having an excellent game for Belgium\"; \"Greece \u2013 taking the longest way home since 1188BC\") and arty angles (a Bosch image as a suggested Belgian lineup, \"Pina Bausch choreographed that [German] free kick\"), but every so often a more substantial comment appears. The angrier Cole most strikingly surfaced during Nigeria v France, when he first complained that the referee was \"seeing no evil\" although the French (who duly won) were committing \"every kind of foul\"; then linked that to his previously tweeted view that the discrimination was due to \"football's persistent 'Africans are aggressive' slander \u2026 African players are called fast, physical, aggressive; rarely organised, strategic, or clinical\". Rather than just consisting of instant gags and reactions, this suggested, live microblogging can also accommodate the kind of reflections that old-school literary sportswriting specialised in.",
