  "content": "When American vlogger Casey Neistat took home the Shorty award for YouTuber of the Year last week, he and his fellow nominees all had something in common: their channels were all based in either Europe or North America and broadcast in the English language. With the world's tech pulse fixated firmly on the English-speaking world (and with Silicon Valley serving as the hub), it's easy to forget that social media is a decidedly global phenomenon. So while the likes of Casey, Pewdiepie and Zoella may seemingly dominate a platform such as YouTube, regional users of various platforms can take on unique cultural dimensions and patterns. Nowhere is that more true than in Japan and on video platforms such as YouTube and its homegrown iteration, Niconico. The world's third largest economy by GDP, Japan is also home to the world's fourth-largest internet population. According to ComScore's 2015 report on the country, Japanese internet users spend more time on multimedia video sites such as YouTube and Niconico than they do on social media platforms, a usage pattern that runs counter to global trends. YouTube's own data places Japan in the top 10 countries globally in terms of watch time, while Niconico \u2013 which was founded in 2006 (just one year after YouTube launched in Japan) \u2013 had more than 4 million paying subscribers in January of this year, according to its parent company, Dwango. There are several reasons why video platforms do extremely well in Japan, said Ken Charles, a consultant at the Tokyo-based firm Apex, which helps western companies enter the Japanese market with a focus on IT, gaming, social media and startups. The first is that unlike other western social media companies, such as LinkedIn and Facebook, YouTube has largely allowed Japanese users to mould the platform to their own cultural norms and riff-off homegrown formats. Charles contrasts that to other, more rigid platforms such as Facebook, where the culture of touting one's own achievements and the requirement to use your real name are uncomfortable to many Japanese people. Similarly LinkedIn, which has repeatedly stumbled to adapt its communication norms to Japan's highly honorific business culture, has failed to attract mass usership. \"Nobody can touch the reach that YouTube has [in Japan] in terms of views and impressions right now,\" Charles said. \"But when Niconico started, it had its own culture, its own terminology, its own mascots \u2013 and a lot of it has spilled over into places like YouTube. So YouTube is a platform that can support all these different [styles and formats] that Japanese users were already comfortable with.\" In addition, major streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music have yet to make headway in Japan. An anomaly globally, the market for physical CDs still thrives in Japan for a variety of reasons, including myriad independent labels with which to negotiate rights, and the marketing lure of CD purchase promotions. Charles said that this, alongside a lack of streaming competitors, has been a boon to YouTube's growth. YouTube reports that its watch time in Japan has grown 50% year-on-year. \"People aren't buying [a CD] in Japan to listen to music necessarily \u2013 they're buying it because they're collectors and want the special edition or to win a giveaway or concert ticket,\" Charles said. \"So YouTube is a really natural platform for getting people excited about new music, so they can run to the store and still buy the CD. But that's certainly going to change as more streaming services gain traction.\" But perhaps the biggest reason why Japanese internet users choose to spend so much of their online time on YouTube is the panoply of extremely niche, special interest and passionate online communities that thrive there. Whether it's anime, manga, idol groups, gaming, product reviews of snack foods, or tutorials on how to make micro-bento boxes out of candy, Japan's fan culture evokes a near-obsessive dedication and YouTube provides the perfect platform to both feed and amplify it. According to the network, some of YouTube Japan's most successful and stand-out talents include Kumamiki, a Harajuku DIY-er who turned her hobby into a full-time business, and Max Murai, who blogs about gaming and has turned his channel, which has 1.4 million subscribers, into his own game-making business. Hikakin, who dominates the top five of YouTube's most-subscribed list, started by beatboxing anime theme songs and since since collaborated with the likes of Aerosmith and Ariana Grande. Alan Swarts is the Japanese-American founder of Breaker, based in Tokyo, and a former MTV VJ (video jockey). His company exists to \"create and nurture the next-generation storytellers\" in Japan, but he points out that he wants his artists to thrive both on YouTube and to \"grow them into brands and businesses that go beyond digital\". \"There's a lot of brand loyalty in Japan, whether it's artists, products, even jobs,\" Swarts said. \"On YouTube, once you can establish your voice as an engaging storyteller, become a social brand, then you have a good chance of creating a long-term relationship with fans.\" One of Breaker's stand-out creators are the expat Canadians Simon and Martina, who recently moved their extremely popular Korea-based channel Eat Your Kimchi (which ran for eight years), to Japan, where they naturally renamed it Eat Your Sushi. After moving to Tokyo three months ago, their channel experienced its highest monthly views ever in February. \"In Japan, we're finding you have more of an audience of people who understand the urge to have an extreme hobby,\" Martina said. \"For example, I went to a Sailor Moon convention at the weekend wearing a Sailor Moon wig and a leather jacket on the bus and nobody blinked at me.\" Swarts points out that statistically, they have the biggest international fan engagement (likes, comments, shares) than any other channel in Japan. But it turns out they are are part of a content category that Dave Powell, director of online partnerships and development for YouTube in Asia Pacific, said does very well in Japan. \"Simon and Martina are sort of translating things that they're experiencing and making it easier to understand,\" Powell said. \"The world is fascinated with Japan, so that style of creator is something that's a little more unique to Japan and other prominent YouTubers such as Rachel and Jun, Sharla in Japan, Abroad in Japan do something similar.\" As these English-language creators drive more intentional interest to Japan, Powell said YouTube encourages Japanese-language creators to capitalise by translating their channels to English, using either paid-for translation services or a new feature which allows fans to create subtitles for videos. At Breaker, Swarts said his team supports a mix of Japanese-born and foreign-born creators based in Japan with hope of incubating \"what we think is the first Japan-to-the-world success story\". In other words, he wants a Japanese creator to be in the lineup for next year's Shorty Awards.
