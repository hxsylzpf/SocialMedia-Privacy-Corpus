  "content": "James Arthur has announced that he is no longer with Simon Cowell's record label, Syco, telling his 2 million Twitter followers that he has to \"move on and do something different\". The singer, who won The X Factor in 2012 with 53.7% of the final vote, said that he wanted to thank those who helped to create his self-titled debut album, which was released in November 2013. \"I now have to move on and do something different - the future is bright! #LOVE,\" he added. Rumours of the singer's split from the label began earlier this year, although Arthur initially denied these claims in a series of tweets. \"As far as I know, I am still with Syco, but I am exclusively signed to Sony. People look too deeply into the media circus. It's about music,\" he wrote at the time. Despite scoring a No 1 singles-chart hit with his cover of Shontelle's Impossible and a No 2 position with his debut album, the singer's career has been the subject of much controversy. Often publicly decrying his career under Simon Cowell's control, he criticised his own promotions team on Twitter and told a Polish TV station that other male winners from The X Factor were \"puppets\", before criticising Syco's approach to artistic integrity. \"When you find fame or you get signed to a record label, it's not what you \u00adimagined \u2013 because you imagined they would have 100% trust or faith in you as an artist,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, that's not really the case \u2013 it's whatever sells. That's the honest truth.\" Most notably, however, James Arthur came under the media glare at the end of 2013, when he uploaded a rap track entitled Hey Mickey, which included lyrics that many listeners, including comedians Matt Lucas and Frankie Boyle \u2013 deemed homophobic. Arthur has since insisted that the lyrics did not refer to homosexuality, but a number of fans who bought Arthur's debut album asked retailers for their money back over the incident. iTunes approved a refund request from one buyer of The X Factor winner's new album. According to reports in the Sun on Sunday, his contract with the label was uncertain in April following the release of a song, Follow the Leader, which featured lyrics: \"I'm gonna blow up your family like I'm a terrorist.\" V festival has added James Arthur to its lineup at the August event."
