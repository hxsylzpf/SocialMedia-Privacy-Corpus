  "content": "Social gaming firm Zynga released its first set of results as a public company on Tuesday and beat Wall Street's expectations, but only just. The game maker behind CityVille, FarmVille and Words With Friends delivered fourth-quarter revenues of $307m, or 5 cents per share. Analysts had expected the company to report earnings excluding items of 3 cents per share on revenues of $302 million, according to Thomson Reuters. The company's shares fell heavily in trading after the closing bell. Zynga's shares slumped after the firm went public last year but have been riding high since it was revealed that the firm accounted for 12% of Facebook's revenues. For the period ended 31 December, Zynga reported a net loss of $435m, or $1.22 a share, compared to net earnings of $43 million, or five cents a share, for the same period the previous year. The company said 54m people were \"daily active users\" of Zynga games in the fourth quarter compared to 48m in the fourth quarter of 2011, a rise of 13%. The number of monthly active users was up 23% at 240m. At the end of the year Zynga accounted for all of the top five games played on Facebook. In a statement, founder and chief executive officer Mark Pincus said: \"Zynga set new records in the year in terms of audience size, revenues and bookings. We saw great momentum in mobile and advertising and ended the year with a strong pipeline of new games. We are excited about the opportunities in front of us to continue delighting our current players and to bring play to millions of new people.\"",
