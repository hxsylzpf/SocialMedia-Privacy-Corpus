  "content": "Enron, WorldCom, Madoff Securities, Lehman Brothers, Ryan Giggs PLC. And so it is that another name is added to the fraudsters' roll of shame, the list of glorified thieves who ... I'm sorry. Which of us has the strength? Of all the nauseating aspects of L'Affaire Giggsy \u2013 and they're legion \u2013 perhaps the most emetic is the manner in which it has been dressed up in pseudo-financial language, the solemn tones of the whistleblower, as though those who wished to publish details of his sex life were exposing massive corporate fraud, as opposed to indulging in a bit of sharp business practice themselves. And never forget it is the intimate details they wish to publish, as opposed to the mere allegations of infidelity. Everybody with a timeshare on half a brain cell knows that the Sun wanted to run its original Giggs story because it would have titillated some of the public. Yet you cannot move for disingenuous cobblers about how Giggs had \"traded\" on a reputation which now \"lies in tatters\". \"The Giggs brand,\" runs some typically woolly posturing in the Daily Mail, \"was underpinned by his 'clean cut, family man' image.\" Doubtless the Trade Descriptions Act will have been adduced by Friday. To the pseudo-financial, we may add the pseudo-political, exemplified by thunderous editorials lamenting that Giggs was an \"ambassador for the game\". Whether this is technically an FA or a Foreign Office appointment I can't say, but presumably Ryan travels with a retinue of attaches and can avoid repercussions for any dodgy tackle committed on foreign soil by claiming diplomatic immunity. To follow these palpably disingenuous arguments to their logical conclusion, the best way to move the story on is to call for the immediate convening of an FA panel, to determine how many points Manchester United should be docked for the competitive advantage of some people not knowing that Giggs had done it a few times with someone off Big Brother. Didn't you hear? We're pretending to carefully weigh the value of everything these days \u2013 including the nebulous percentage of Giggs's image rights dependent on his totally unpublicised family life \u2013 in order that the tabloids or a Twitter mob can apply the precisely calibrated moral counterweight. Hereafter, Manchester United's historic 19th league title must be asterisked, on the basis that we cannot know how the table would have panned out had Giggs's affair been exposed earlier in the season. A few weeks ago, I took part in a panel discussion about the dysfunctional relationship between the press and sport, in which Max Mosley also participated and made some splendidly provocative rejoinders to those convenient old media clich\u00e9s about footballers being role models and so on. If sports stars really are the vitally important role models the tabloid press claims, ran one of these, then surely their misdeeds should never be exposed, to safeguard the ideals of impressionable children. An extreme position (though delivered with a twinkle), and not one I agree with \u2013 but I'm glad someone is willing to float it, because every well-rounded debate needs articulate ultras. Alas, those who have thought things through tend to be crowded out by those apparently incapable of doing so. \"Sick joke,\" began Janet Street Porter's column on the John Terry expos\u00e9, quoted here at the time. \"John Terry was chosen as 'Dad of the Year' by Daddies Sauce. That's a product I won't be buying any more.\" To which the only rational response seemed to be: Really, Janet? REALLY? Do you feel lied to by a condiment manufacturer? Or a Premier League footballer? I am afraid you sound too delicate to be around the news. And so this week, where sections of the press will have you believe that there are myriad people other than Giggs's wife who feel \"lied to\" by his behaviour. Forgive me for adopting an ultra position, but if some people require smelling salts when they discover that young multimillionaires at their physical peak are occasionally shaggers, then perhaps they should be medically ruled too stupid and fragile to watch sport, and should instead only be allowed to spend their leisure time on less confusing activities, such as removing lint from their belly buttons. I'm all for privacy injunctions being granted on a case-by-case basis, though others will not concur. But can we at least agree to dispense with the idea that such stories are run for any nobler reason than money-spinning titillation? To pretend otherwise seems a hypocrisy infinitely greater than that Ryan Giggs is supposed to have indulged in."
