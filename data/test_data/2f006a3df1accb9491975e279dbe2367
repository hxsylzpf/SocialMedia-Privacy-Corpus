  "content": "Picture the scene: suddenly you get a boss who has got it in for you but can't fault you for any of your work. So he starts looking at all the back emails you have made, and all the websites you've visited, copies of which are on the back-up server even though you have deleted them. \"What's this?\" he says. \"Ordering your holiday, replying to emails from friends - and all in MY time.\" And that's just a mild example of what could happen now that the government has caved in to industry to allow companies \"routine access\" to any emails and phone calls made at work to discover whether they are business-related. Remember what Richelieu said - give me ten lines written by the most honest man and I will find something in them to hang him for. Patricia Hewitt, the minister for e-commerce - believed to be the same Patricia Hewitt who used to be an outstanding champion of civil liberties - denies that business is being given a licence to snoop because there are limits companies can't go over, such as \"intercepting personal calls for unjustified scurrilous interest\". But who's to judge? In theory, it wouldn't matter so much if all employees knew exactly what company policy was (do you?) and if it was all laid out in a contract of employment. But this gives undue power to the employer because not many people will refuse a job - after getting through all the competitive interview stages - because of something potentially threatening in the small print. As Caspar Bowden, director of the Foundation for Information Policy Research, said today: \"By allowing employers disproportionate powers of surveillance over employees, these regulations fly in the face of the protection afforded by the human rights act\". The government's decision should be tested in the courts as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, be careful what you do in your lunch breaks; use your mobile to make calls, and the infra red port to your laptop to buy that book from Amazon. Maybe your employers could end up knowing much less about you than they do now."
