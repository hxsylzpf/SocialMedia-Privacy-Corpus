  "content": "News Corp's overly enthusiastic protection of photographs of James Packer and David Gyngell hindered a police investigation into their fight in Bondi because the watermark covered up what was going on. NSW acting assistant police commissioner Mark Walton said at a press conference on Wednesday that police had officially begun inquiries into the incident in which two of Australia's most powerful men fought in the street. Billionaire Packer, and Gyngell, the head of the Nine Network, came to blows on Sunday, reportedly over a misunderstanding about a Nine camera truck which Packer believed was camped out to catch the arrival of his rumoured partner, supermodel Miranda Kerr. News Corp reportedly bought photographs of the fight for more than $200,000 on Monday, publishing them online behind heavy watermarks before plastering various snapshots across the nation's front pages the following day. The watermarked images were quickly ridiculed \u2013 including by some News Corp publications. \"The early material was so difficult to see what was going on because of the branding of it,\" Walton told media on Wednesday. \"I certainly wasn't expecting the police to rush out there.\" A spokesman for NSW police told Guardian Australia Walton was not joking. The watermarks \"genuinely made it very hard to see through what was going on in the background\", he said. The spokesman could not confirm whether police had earlier requested unmarked copies of the photographs from News Corp. The police investigation \u2013 which was launched despite no complaint filed by either Packer or Gyngell \u2013 will determine whether the fight amounted to assault or affray. Walton acknowledged police were slow to begin an investigation, but said they had now made contact with legal representatives of both Packer and Gyngell requesting an interview with the pair. \"We have had contact through a legal adviser indicating if they wish to indicate anything to us, come and see us, they're welcome to do so,\" he said. \"There's no compulsion for anyone to be interviewed in these circumstances.\" A lack of police action in the days immediately following the incident attracted some criticism that Packer and Gyngell appeared to be escaping consequences at a time when government and law enforcement are focusing so heavily on violence in Sydney. Walton said the profiles of the two men had \"no relevance to the determination in this matter\". The photographer responsible for the Packer-Gyngell images, Brendan Beirne, told AAP he had complied with a police request to hand over more than 300 pictures of the brawl during a two-hour witness interview on Wednesday."
