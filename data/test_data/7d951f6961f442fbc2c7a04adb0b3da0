  "content": "It's not possible to be a well-informed person and only read the Guardian or the New York Times. So said Michael Wolff, a media columnist and veteran web guru, at last week's Changing Media Summit 2010. Alongside news aggregation sites such as Google News (and Wolff's own Newser), many millions more people use social networks such as Facebook and the microblogging site Twitter than will ever think to visit theguardian.com. So one of the key challenges facing the Guardian is how best to harvest the many news-related conversations that take place beyond our pages. This lets us reach people who wouldn't necessarily visit theguardian.com directly, providing a counterpart to the opinions of our journalists and the readers who engage directly via conversations on our website and letters to our paper. There is already some crossover: half a million pages a month on our website are viewed by people who find them via links posted on Twitter, and 800,000 more from Facebook. \"People have always had conversations about the issues of the day, but now we've got new ways to listen. Monitoring Twitter or Facebook is the digital equivalent of eavesdropping on conversations in the pub,\" says Meg Pickard, the Guardian's head of social media development. \"The journalist's role lies in understanding, sorting and analysing what we overhear and providing context about why \u2013 or whether \u2013 it matters, and how alternative perspectives can enhance our understanding of public mood or activity.\" Or to quote the Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales: \"Everyone tells jokes, but we still have professional comedians.\" The Iraq war inquiry was a case in point. When Tony Blair and Gordon Brown gave evidence we monitored all tweets that mentioned their names and published them alongside our reporter's live blog. We used plus and minus signs to designate each tweet positive or negative, and tracked the overall sentiment using a dynamically updating swingometer and a graph that showed which statements had gone down best (and worst). So, what did we learn? Once we'd discarded obscene, foreign-language and irrelevant tweets (including those referencing Gossip Girl's Blair Waldorf and any number of Browns who weren't discussing Iraq on 5 March), we had more than 1,100 Blair tweets and 350 for Brown, confirming that there was substantially more interest in hearing from the man who actually took Britain to war in 2003. Some 80% of the Blair tweets were negative, compared with 70% for Brown: Twitter users felt Brown acquitted himself somewhat better than his predecessor. Both pages were among the day's six most-viewed articles on theguardian.com/politics, indicating healthy reader interest. Spikes in negative sentiment about Blair came when he insisted Saddam Hussein would have been a bigger threat if left in power, and said he had no regrets about joining the invasion. They plummeted when he appeared to say that publishing the \"dodgy\" WMD dossier was a mistake. Some said he should face a war crimes tribunal, and many accused him of lies and evasion, with words such as \"slick\" cropping up frequently. There was frustration at the inquiry's failure to pin him down, alongside grudging admiration for his performance. Brown was worst received when he insisted he had granted every MoD funding request, and best when he criticised the \"neoconservative\" proposition that peace in Iraq could be imposed at the barrel of a gun. He also received a fillip when \u2013 unlike Blair \u2013 he offered sympathy and respect to bereaved families. Twitter's 140-character format enforces a brevity of expression that fosters enormous creativity. Some people encapsulated hours of arcane testimony with laconic observations such as this one from @LeeConti: \"We already have double-glazing, but even so, I reckon Tony Blair could probably persuade us to buy some more.\" We'll be repeating the exercise on Wednesday during the budget. Our budgetometer will be monitoring the hashtag #budget (following #darling might yield the wrong results). To take part, tweet your thoughts on the chancellor's speech \u2013 which starts at 12.30pm \u2013 and include #budget in your message."
