  "content": "Almost as soon as Ed Miliband began his speech on the economy, the Labour leader's words on working families sent tweeters running for their touchscreens. But reaction soon cranked itself down a few notches as his words appeared to hit their intended target. It didn't last long. @SymonHill seemed to take issue with the reactionary and sensationalist commentary found on social media, particularly in the context of bipartisan politics. His measured observation was in no way ironic. It was about this time that @guardian readers appeared to disagree with @n_b_jones. The perennial criticism of Miliband's leadership qualities soon reared its head. In a flow of public commentary dominated by increasingly negative male voices, @FreeBesieged and @bevclack, a Labour councillor, were notable for voicing their firm support for both the style and substance of the speech. @Brendan_Surrey has a question for @GuardianTech.  Will Miliband's latest rhetoric come back to haunt him? @poppy2324 seemed to be trying to make it happen. Finally, speech and questions over, @dandiedinmont voiced what is sure to be a common and lasting thought among voters."
