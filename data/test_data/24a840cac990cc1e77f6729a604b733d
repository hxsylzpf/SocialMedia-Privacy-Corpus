  "content": "Vanessa Feltz has complained to the press complaints commission about stories in the Mirror and Sunday Mirror that she claims were inaccurate and invaded her privacy. Feltz objected to a series of articles about her and Fitzroy Charles, a bouncer she was reported to have \"dated\" after the break-up of her relationship with her personal trainer, Dennis Duhaney. She has also objected to a story in the Sunday Mirror she claimed contained inaccuracies about her relationship with Mr Charles. And she is thought to have complained about an article in the Mirror by her rival, TV chat show host Trisha Goddard. Feltz objected to observations by Goddard that she had a predilection for black men on the grounds of privacy and accuracy. The PCC confirmed it had received a complaint from Feltz, saying: \"We will be adjudicating in the next month or so\". It refused to disclose any further details about the complaint. But Trinity Mirror, publisher of the papers, is thought to have issued a robust defence, claiming Feltz had previously published \"highly intimate\" details about her private life. Celebrities who have publicised their private lives tend to be given less protection under the PCC's code of conduct. Feltz and Goddard have a history of animosity. Feltz's TV career on the BBC got off to a bad start in 1999 when she was beaten in the ratings war by Goddard. Earlier this year the BBC decided not to renew her \u00a32.4m-a-year contract."
