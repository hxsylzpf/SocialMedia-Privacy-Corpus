  "content": "David Cameron has been accused of \"ripping the heart and soul\" out of Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry and betraying victims of press abuse by rejecting the judge's recommendation for a statutory body to oversee the new independent press regulator. Media reform campaigners and some of those who had their phones hacked or computers compromised said they were \"profoundly depressed\" by the prime minister's refusal to follow the recommendation. Speaking at a press conference organised by the Hacked Off campaign, the filmmaker Ed Blum \u2013 himself a victim of hacking \u2013 accused Cameron of abandoning those he had pledged to help. \"I think with Cameron's statement today, he's let down the victims of press abuse,\" he said. \"He's also ripped out the heart and soul of the Leveson report and at the same time, some papers tomorrow will call him courageous, although the British public will know that the slippery slope towards self-regulation has also let them down terribly as well.\" Mark Lewis, the solicitor who represents a number of phone-hacking victims, including the family of the murdered teenager Milly Dowler, said some of his clients were struggling to understand the prime minister's behaviour. \"I have spoken to some people who feel that they've been let down because they were looking for an independent inquiry which was looking at the politicians themselves as well as the press,\" he said. \"The politicians were in on this and somebody independent was coming along and made recommendations and cautious optimism lasted for about 45 minutes and then the prime minister spoke and said well he's not actually going to implement a report that he instigated.\" He added: \"[Cameron] called for a judicial inquiry. There wasn't really much point in this judicial inquiry unless it was going to be implemented.\" Lewis also pointed out that in his evidence to the inquiry, the prime minister had spoken of the importance of what he termed the \"victim test\". Cameron had told Leveson that the inquiry should not be about placating the press or politicians but about \"really protecting the people who've been caught up and absolutely thrown to the wolves by this process\". By any measure, said Lewis, Cameron had failed that test. \"He called it the victim test; he called it the Dowler test,\" said the solicitor. \"It looks like he failed his own test. He appointed the lord justice to make recommendations and now he says he's not going to follow them. That's a failure of that test and he needs to resit.\" Other victims of press abuse told Hacked Off of their disappointment with the prime minister. The former policewoman and Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames said she found his remarks in the Commons \"profoundly depressing\", while a group representing families who lost relatives in the Hillsborough football disaster were said to be \"very upset\". Christopher Jefferies, the man vilified in some sections of the press and falsely arrested over the murder of Joanna Yates, told Hacked Off he felt betrayed. Midway through Thursday afternoon, the actor Hugh Grant tweeted: \"With a group of (non celeb) victims including Hillsborough families listening to PM. Buzzword is betrayal.\" Brain Cathcart, a journalism professor and founder of Hacked Off, praised Lord Justice Leveson for producing \"a thorough, balanced and powerful report\" containing measures to protect press freedom and recognise the rights of victims of press abuse. He said the report had offered \"a workable, proportionate, reasonable solution\" to the problems facing the public, the media and the politicians. The prime minister, however, had \"not done his job\" and his failure to accept the report's full recommendations was both regrettable and unfortunate. \"The Leveson proposals were carefully thought out,\" said Cathcart. \"They would have made a difference. They should be implemented as quickly as possible and must not be put aside.\" He added that despite \"their years of abuses and outrageous conduct, it seems that the prime minister still trusts the editors and proprietors to behave themselves.\" Cathcart described the report as a very important moment and urged Cameron to seize it. \"We do not want to let it slip and surely the prime minister does not want to be seen to be the person who has let slip this opportunity which is coming once in a generation,\" he said. \"A long time we've been having these choices and ducking them. Does he really want to be the latest prime minister to duck these choices?\" To that end, Hacked Off announced that they had launched a petition urging Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband to work together to implement all the report's recommendations as soon as possible. Jane Winter, the director of a human rights charity who discovered that emails and documents she had sent had been illegally accessed after the recipient's computer was hacked, was disheartened by the Leveson report in general and the prime minister's refusal to accept its key recommendation in particular. Winter, head of the British Irish Rights Watch, was one of 60 victims who signed a letter to the PM last October asking him to implement Leveson's suggestions. She said: \"His response was, 'As long as it's not bonkers, I'll implement that'. Well I saw the report this morning and it doesn't look bonkers to me and I think he's gone back on his word and I feel betrayed.\" Winter added: \"I'm afraid he knows who his friends are \u2013 his friends in the media \u2013 and he's not really concerned about the victims although he said he was. He made a lot of nice noises about the victims who've been to hell and back, like the Dowlers, but he doesn't mean a word of it. If he did, he would implement these recommendations.\" Despite her deep disappointment, however, she was refusing to relinquish hope entirely: \"I still have a spark of optimism because it looks to me like both Labour and the Liberal Democrats are in favour of Lord Leveson's recommendations and we also know that there are a number of Tory backbenchers who support proper regulation for the media.\""
