  "content": "Here's a tale of two societies. The South Korean communications commission is planning to boost broadband speeds in that country tenfold by the end of 2012. That means Koreans will get one gigabit per second (Gbps) connections by next year, which is 200 times as fast as the 5Mbps ADSL connection which is common in the UK. Meanwhile, back in the middle ages (aka Whitehall next Wednesday), a ministerial summit on \"net neutrality\" convened by the culture secretary Ed Vaizey will hear how Britain's internet service providers (ISPs) plan to throttle still further the measly internet access they provide to the citizens of the UK in order to boost their bottom lines and reduce competition. Now it has to be said that the principle of net neutrality is not exactly a staple of saloon-bar conversation, so most citizens will assume that next Wednesday's discussions have nothing to do with them. In this, they are sadly mistaken \u2013 as they will discover if Ed Vaizey does indeed agree to let the ISPs violate or erode the principle. Their rude awakening will happen when, one future winter's evening, internet users decide that they would like to catch up on an episode of QI on the BBC iPlayer and find that the download is so slow and erratic that it's unwatchable. What will puzzle them even more is that videos from Sky not only come down in a whoosh, but play faultlessly in HD. And then, perhaps, the penny will drop. By which time, of course, it will be too late. The reason the internet has been such an powerful enabler of innovation is that it is, at its core, a meritocratic network which is not owned or controlled by anyone. All it does is take data packets in at one end and deliver them to their destinations at the other. And it was designed to be agnostic about the packets \u2013 to give them all the same treatment. In that sense, it was \"neutral\" towards applications. If you had a good idea that could be implemented in data packets, then the internet would do it for you, no questions asked. It was this neutrality that enabled the explosion of creativity triggered by the network. As Barbara van Schewick explains in a compelling book, Internet Architecture and Innovation, one implication of net neutrality was that the barriers to entry to the online market were incredibly low: all you needed was a good idea, programming skills and enough money to rent space on a server. So it's no accident that some of the most iconic internet businesses \u2013 Amazon, eBay, Google, Blogger and Facebook to name just five \u2013 were launched without any significant capital investment by anyone other than their founders and their friends and families. This is what makes cyberspace so different from the \"real\" world \u2013 where anyone seeking to create an innovative, disruptive business has to find a way of placating or buying off the incumbents. Net neutrality enables something radically different, what one might call \"permissionless innovation\". The Harvard scholar Lawrence Lessig illustrates this with a nice story about two Massachusetts ferrymen, Tom First and Tom Scott, who invented a juice drink that proved popular with their passengers. Slowly, it dawned on them that maybe there was a business here, so they founded Nantucket Nectars and built it into a company that was eventually sold to Cadbury Schweppes. But, writes Lessig, \"At each step after the first, along the way to giving their customers what they wanted, the two Toms had to ask permission from someone. They needed permission from a manufacturer to get into his plant. Permission from a distributor to get into her network. And permission from stores to get before the customer. Each step between the idea and the customer was a slog. They made the slog, and succeeded. But many try to make that slog and fail. Sometimes for good reasons. Sometimes not.\" Critics of net neutrality argue that while it might have been appropriate in the early days of the net to treat all packets the same, it no longer makes sense because different applications have different needs. So it doesn't matter if the packets which make up an email message are delayed, but it's a real pain if that happens to packets in a Skype conversation or an iPlayer stream. And that's true. It would be and daft to insist on a neutrality that stifled new applications and technological progress. So an intelligent position for the government would be to allow ISPs to discriminate between different types of internet application (so long as it's done transparently), but ban them from favouring individual content providers. If Mr Vaizey fumbles this, then will the last entrepreneur emigrating to South Korea please switch off the lights."
