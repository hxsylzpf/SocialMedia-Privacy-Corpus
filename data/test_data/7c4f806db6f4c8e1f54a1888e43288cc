  "content": "Prince William's decision to grant a pooled interview to the Press Association is a PR masterstroke that will encourage the media to leave him alone for the rest of his time at St Andrews - and could even be the salvation of the monarchy - public relations experts said today. The prince is guided by his father's press advisers but has shown an instinctive understanding of the media, which has enabled him to strike exactly the right note in his interview with PA's court correspondent Peter Archer, said veteran publicist Max Clifford. \"As a PR exercise this is premier league stuff,\" Mr Clifford said. \"He comes across very well, very natural, unassuming and modest. He handles himself very well and praises the media - that's a tremendous thing to do.\" Mark Borkowski, the head of Borkowski PR, also considered the interview to be a PR coup but thought Prince William had \"complete and utter disdain\" for the media. \"He doesn't have much respect for it and doesn't play their game. It's a reluctant need to give the baying masses something - to throw a mackerel to the penguins,\" Mr Borkowksi said. In the interview, which appeared in all national newspapers today, Prince William thanked the Scottish media for leaving him alone during his time at St Andrews University, where he is half way through a four-year degree. \"As time goes by, they [the media] are getting closer and closer and more and more edgy and desperate to find out about girlfriends etc,\" said Mr Clifford. Three Sunday newspapers, including the Mail on Sunday and the News of the World, recently published pictures of Prince William having his feet massaged by a female friend at a rugby match, prompting a complaint from Prince Charles' private press secretary, Sir Michael Peat. However, Mr Clifford believes today's interview will prevent newspapers from publishing similar pictures or stories in the near future. \"He's thanking the media for leaving him alone while he's in the middle of his studies, while making it clear that he's still in the middle of his studies. \"The media have been very happy to carry that message. They will weigh up the pluses and minuses. Particularly after today, the minuses would surpass,\" Mr Clifford said. \"At the moment he's in a very good position and today has put him in an even better position. Newspapers have to ask if it is going to attract readers or put them off.\" Mr Clifford also thinks the interview will improve the prince's relationship with the press in the longer term. \"This is all part of putting good foundations in place. He recognises the importance of a good media relationship, probably more instinctively like his mother,\" he said. \"His father always had a difficult relationship with the media, although it's got better in recent years. But his mother became a very good media manipulator. \"It is the first couple of steps in the marathon. The next 20 or 30 years will be crucial to the monarchy and he's their best hope of survival. \"His instincts are sound and good and that must be incredibly encouraging for the royals. \"I've always said he's going to be their salvation - or not - and this is a clear indication he has inherited the best of his mother's media skills.\" Mr Borkowski said the prince was wise to give his first proper interview to PA, which pooled it among national newspapers. \"He's got incredible personal nouse. He's done the even-handed thing. It's fantastic because he's given copy to everybody, yet kept himself at arm's length from the media,\" Mr Borkowski added. \"It keeps him firmly in control. I think he's very wary and has a keen understanding of what happened to his mother. \"He recognises he's the future king and a matin\u00e9e idol, but he's firmly declared he's not going to get into bed with any one media organisation.\" \"Doing a pooled interview was the right thing and many newspapers have cheerfully treated the remarks as if given first hand to their own reporters,\" said Julia Hobsbawm, the chief executive of HMC PR. \"I'm all in favour of people in the public spotlight giving rare but generous interviews and Prince William has done this. \"He has cheerfully and with good grace mastered the art of saying little well. He appears at ease and although no one in the public eye can escape sharp criticism for long, he should not suffer unduly as a result of giving this interview. \"The media can never have 'enough' of certain people but in the eternal baiting game that characterisies medial relations with the royal family, I think sufficient titbits have been thrown to the wolves to keep them happy for a bit.\"",
