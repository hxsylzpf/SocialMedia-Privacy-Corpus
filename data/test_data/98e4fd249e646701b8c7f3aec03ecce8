  "content": "Further to my article about the forthcoming launch of London Live, a couple of extra points of fact, followed by a personal statement to clear up what appears to be a misunderstanding. Standard distribution: Since the beginning of this month, the capital has been deluged with London Evening Standards. On Monday last week, 922,000 copies were distributed and, according to the monitoring by the paper's publisher, the exercise was successful (meaning that there were very few, if any, copies left behind in the bins). Standard executives believe this makes the paper the most read title in Greater London (though I don't have the figures to compare its total with, say, those of the Sun and Daily Mail across the same area). What is certain, however, is that the Standard is now Britain's fifth largest national daily paper in terms of circulation/distribution - following the Sun, Mail, Metro and Daily Mirror (which is only just ahead at 951,000). Clearly, regardless of London Live's fate, the Standard stands to benefit from the huge rise in readership. It has found a way, against the trend elsewhere, to encourage people to read newsprint. Finding London Live: From launch next Monday, it will be available on Freeview channel 8, Sky channel 117 and Virgin channel 159. A personal opinion: why I remain a 'local TV' sceptic With people having jumped to the wrong conclusion about my article - a report reflecting what I found and NOT a comment - let me make it clear that I am a confirmed \"local TV\" sceptic. I am on the record on this matter, on this blog and in various speeches. Go into a street with a clipboard and ask people if they like consuming local news. The majority answer, and probably overwhelmingly so, would be an unhesitating \"yes.\" Then ask them how they like to receive it - newspaper, TV, radio, online. Previous opinion poll results would suggest that most people opt for printed newspapers, despite the fall in sales and despite the likely fact that they don't even read them themselves. That uncomfortable truth would probably emerge if researchers dared to ask a follow-up question: \"OK, when did you last buy a local or regional newspaper?\" It isn't that people are not sincere about their respect for local news and their belief that papers provide the best service. They really believe it as they say it. The problem is the gap between intention and reality, between what they think - or think they should think - and what they actually do about it. It is just one of the reasons that I am unconvinced about local TV. I am aware that people have said they want it. I am also aware that most, when asked, say they particularly favour its news component. But will they really watch it? I want to be proved wrong because I'm a journalist. My trade is news. I want people to get as much of it as they can, regardless of the platform that delivers it. But, in a near 50-year career, I have watched people retreat from news, and most notably local news. The idealists, and there is nothing wrong with idealism, seem to think that, if people are turning their backs on print, then give them the news on TV. History suggests otherwise, as the regional television news programming offered by the BBC and ITV down the years has shown. Gradually, audiences have deserted and, as a consequence, the resources devoted by mainstream broadcasters to such output have been reduced. I concede that London Live is not really \"local TV\" nor even \"regional TV.\" London is a metropolis and the planned output is aimed to reflect that reality. I also accept that the owners and senior executives at the Independent/Standard have set about the task of creating London Live with an enthusiasm bordering on passion. Further, having witnessed the set-up, I do not doubt that it is going to be a slick, professional broadcasting operation. The novelty alone should win it a reasonable initial audience. None of this, however, can conceal the fact that there is a public resistance to local news and localised television. That is compounded by the growing use of social media through mobile devices as the information-provider of choice. In a fragmented TV landscape, with so much competition for people's attention, I repeat what I've said before: local TV delivered through the television screen is not going to have a long life. NB: I write a weekly column for the London Evening Standard",
