  "content": "Facebook users in the UK have finally lost access to Scrabulous, the unofficial version of the Scrabble word game, after a formal complaint by the rights holder Mattel. Scrabulous has built a user base of more than 600,000 people globally on the social networking site, but it was closed to Facebook users in the US and Canada after a similar rights claim by Hasbro, the North American Scrabble rights holder. The game is still available in India, where it was developed by Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla. But the brothers were critical of Facebook for giving in to Mattel's demand to remove the game on Friday from the rest of the world, including the UK. Facebook said it was obliged to remove the game because the Agarwalla brothers had not done so. But Jayant Agarwalla said Facebook should have waited for the outcome of a hearing by an Indian court. \"It surprises us that Mattel chose to direct Facebook to take down Scrabulous without waiting for the decision,\" Agarwalla said in a statement. \"Mattel's action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary.\" Both Hasbro and Mattel are promoting their own official versions of the game on Facebook, through their respective online rights holders Electronic Arts and Real Networks - though neither have as many players as Scrabulous. \"Do they really think that Scrabble would have sold nearly as many sets since the invention of Scrabulous?\" commented one player on the Facebook Scrabulous page. Several others encouraged users to play Wordscraper, another word game launched recently on Facebook by the Agarwalla brothers. Mattel had not responded to a request for comment by the time of publication. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
