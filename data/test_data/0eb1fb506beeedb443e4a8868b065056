  "content": "When I put out on Twitter yesterday that I was back to blogging, a colleague asked if people even did that any more. I replied that what I was doing was more like long-form Tweeting, you know, the modern internet's Esquire in the 60s. I cannot actually promise you bloggy (Tweety?) versions \"Frank Sinatra Has a Cold\" or \"Superman Comes to the Supermarket\" or even color photographs, but I do hope you'll bear with me as I figure out again for the first time the limits and possibilities the form. The tubes have changed since 2006 \u2013 the last time I blogged full-time \u2013 and what works now might not be worked then. I do suspect that some things never change: you can count on the popularity of posts about cats and libertarians, and shorter is better (short long-form journalism being akin to my preference for small big government). So let's start the morning with some sure-fire hits, a shotgun blast of stuff that's caught my eye in the past 24. \u2022 Combining meaningless straw poll results with the political rumor of the day will result in sentences such as this: \"Herman Cain's success shows that people want an outsider.\" You have been warned. \u2022 Esquire mocks the candidates' ties. It looks like Perry is ketchup and Huntsman is mustard; I think that makes Romney mayonnaise. They all might consider a lesson or two in true conservative style. \u2022 At his Linked In town hall, Obama had the good taste to be appalled by the GOP audience booing gay soldiers/death; also in good taste: praise for Austin, the only part of Texas Perry is not the governor of. \u2022 The Star Wars saga is the most popular series ever to be about tax policy. Also, kittens. \u2022 Commenters! I will be around later today, in the threads, commenting.",
