  "content": "A Daily Mirror reporter was accused of a \"flagrant breach\" of his employment contract in the high court today after he spent two months working undercover as a footman at Buckingham Palace. Branding Ryan Parry \"not so much a footman as a foot-in-the-door man,\" David Pannick QC, representing the attorney general, accused the reporter of \"obvious and unjustified intrusions into the private life of the royal household\". The palace is seeking an injunction to restrain the Mirror and Parry from publishing any further information gleaned in his stint as a royal servant, following two days in which the Mirror has printed 27 pages of detailed insights into life at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. Mr Pannick told the judge, Mr Justice Lewison, that the Queen was seeking the injunction because Parry had breached his contractual obligation to maintain confidentiality. Neither the Queen nor the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, had any wish to \"stifle discussion\", Mr Pannick said. \"But it is plain, as I shall show you, that the articles go far beyond any such material,\" he added. When the story of Parry's infiltration broke in the Mirror yesterday, the palace threatened legal action and sought an undertaking from the editor, Piers Morgan, that no more similar material would be published. However, Morgan had refused to give such an undertaking, Mr Pannick said. He added Parry had signed a confidentiality clause in which he undertook not to reveal to any unauthorised person \"any information whatsoever whether of an official of personal nature\" concerning any member of the royal family or royal household, unless authorised to do so\". Mr Pannick said the contract included \"a very clear agreement, the purpose of which is to prevent those in royal service from communicating to third parties what they have learned\". \"Will he be acting unlawfully to say the wallpaper is pink?\" asked the judge. \"We are concerned on any view with a very substantial breach of this agreement,\" replied Mr Pannick. \"In truth, Mr Parry had no intention whatever of complying with this undertaking. He is and was a journalist working for the Daily Mirror - not so much a footman as a foot-in-the-door-man.\" The Mirror published 15 pages of written material yesterday and another 12 pages today including \"personal and intrusive\" information, including details of the Queen's breakfast table and the habits, likes and dislikes and moods of the royals, Mr Pannick said, adding: \"It fosters no conceivable security concerns.\" He described the tabloid's story as the \"plainest possible breach of confidence and the plainest possible intrusion into personal privacy\". He added: \"Her majesty and other members of her family claim no special rights in this court. \"But they do have the same entitlements as everyone else to protection of their interests, in particular relating to an express contractual provision which Mr Parry signed.\" Morgan has described the lack of security at the palace as \"scandalous\" and argued the undercover operation is in the public interest. However, Mr Pannick branded the Mirror's claim \"cynical in the extreme\". \"If that is the concern of the Daily Mirror it could have and should have informed the home secretary, Metropolitan police, attorney general or any of the authorities,\" he said. \"In any event, much of the information published so far consists of photographs and details which intrude into the personal privacy of the royal family and which breach contractual undertakings in a manner wholly unnecessary to identify security breaches.\" If the Mirror were to be taken at its word, it had already published sufficient information to highlight the security problem, Mr Pannick said. He added that if the paper had more information relevant to security concerns it should give it to the inquiry to be headed by the president of the high court family division, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss. The inquiry was announced yesterday by the home secretary and is due to report on its interim findings before Christmas. If no injunction is granted the Mirror would publish further intrusive information tomorrow and for as long as it could, said Mr Pannick. Personal information, once disclosed, could not regain its confidentiality and privacy. It was therefore right and proper that the court should \"hold the ring\" until trial and prevent publication. The lawyer accused Parry of a \"cynical exercise\" and said the reporter never intended to comply with his contractual obligations. Richard Spearman QC, acting for the Mirror, described the palace's bid to gag the paper as \"idle and fanciful\". Some of the material identified by Parry is already in the public domain, for example in former royal butler Paul Burrell's book, Mr Spearman said. He added it was at least arguable - and he would put it much higher than that - that there was a public interest in the investigation. Parry secured his job as a footman after replying to an advert on the official Buckingham Palace website in August. He provided one fake reference and one real reference and submitted a CV that made no mention his journalistic career. The Mirror claimed its reporter was never subjected to a \"serious\" security vetting. Today Morgan told staff that Parry, a graduate trainee at the Mirror, had been given a staff job in recognition of his \"astonishing piece of journalism\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
