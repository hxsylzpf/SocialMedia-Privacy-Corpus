  "content": "Are you pedantic when it comes to arranging your books? Do you sit them on your shelf in order of height, colour or age? By genre? In the order you bought them? Do you place novels side by side only if you think the characters in them would get along in real life? Whatever your scheme and the reasons for it, we want to know. Upload photos of your bookshelf to our Flickr group and explain to us why you chose the books, what they mean to you, and the idiosyncrasies of your cataloguing system. We'll feature some of our favourites on guardian.co.uk/books. Here's how you can get involved: 1. Photograph your bookshelf, ideally so the titles can be read. 2. Add the photo to our Flickr group. 3. Tell us who you are and the story behind your books (though you're of course free to remain anonymous if you'd prefer). By posting your pictures in this group, or sending them to us in response to this request, you're agreeing to let us use them on our site and potentially in the newspaper (though copyright remains with you at all times, and you will be credited). \u2022 This Flickr group was created after a suggestion by frustratedartist. If you have a subject you'd like to see us cover, please visit our Tips, links and suggestions page and tell us about it.",
