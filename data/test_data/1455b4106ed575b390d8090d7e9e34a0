  "content": "For the past couple of months, fragments of my past have been regularly dropping through the letterbox, contained in A4 envelopes. I didn't remember buying the autobiography of the US basketball star Dennis Rodman from Amazon on February 19 2000, but according to the bumf they sent me - and, in actual fact, my bookshelves - that's what happened. When I opened a package from the Identity and Passport Service, I found a murky photocopy of a form I'd filled in 22 years ago. My old postcodes and telephone numbers regularly flashed in front of my eyes; thanks to the DVLA, I was reminded not only of all my past parking fines, but the fact that my secondhand Volkswagen Golf clocked up its first mileage in and around Basingstoke. The AA, bless them, sent me the full transcript of a conversation I had in June 2007 with an operative called Julie (an illustrative excerpt: \"We're at home and our car won't start. I assume it's the battery\"; \"Right, smashing. We'll get some help to you there.\") This is what happens when you make a list of the companies and organisations with whom you regularly deal and put in subject access requests - an opportunity afforded by the 1998 Data Protection Act (DPA), whereby anyone with access to paper and envelopes (and, more often than not, a \u00a310 cheque) can write to an organisation's data protection officer, and demand to see the information held on them. In keeping with the correct way of doing things, the two dozen letters I wrote reminded their recipients that \"the act covers both facts and opinions about myself as an individual, as well as information regarding the intentions of your organisation towards myself.\" The requests, I suggested, \"should therefore cover any internal/external memos, emails, faxes and any other correspondence or readily accessible data held on computer by your organisation which could be classified as 'personal data'.\" All this, needless to say, shines at least some light on some very hot issues. This week saw a flurry of headlines about the government's attempts to retreat from new legislation increasing the penalties for the thriving illegal trade in personal data - a story usually framed in terms of media spying on celebrities, though it also extends into such areas as debt collection and the use of private investigators in divorce cases. Towards the end of last year, public anxiety about data protection was decisively ramped up by the run of high-profile data losses that began with the now infamous disappearance of two CDs containing the personal details of 25 million people, mislaid in the internal mail system of HM Revenue &amp; Customs, and took in further blunders involving the NHS, the Royal Navy, and the Driving Standards Agency. According to the Liberal Democrats, the total number of British people affected last year by data loss totals nearly 37 million. Lest anyone think this is purely a public sector problem, last year also saw high-profile stories involving such companies as Marks &amp; Spencer, Standard Life, HBOS and TK Maxx, who famously lost the credit card details of 200 million customers to online hackers. In December, Norwich Union was fined \u00a31.26m by the Financial Services Authority, after \u00a33.3m was stolen from its policyholders by fraudsters using false names, addresses and dates of birth; by Christmas, it was claimed that more than 4 million Britons had fallen victim to identity theft, and that essential personal details were being traded online for as little as \u00a335. When you're presented with the reams of data your everyday life leaves trailed through hard drives and office filing systems - and your mind also wanders to government plans for a national identity register and universal NHS database - one question therefore rears up time and again: could you be next? As the envelopes arrived at my home, they brought some unpleasant revelations. Up to now, for example, I had never heard of the credit reporting agency CallCredit, much less authorised its ownership of some very detailed personal information, but I now know that there is at least one computer at its Leeds HQ that contains details of me, my partner, our address (gleaned from the electoral roll), a bank loan I took out in late 2005, the balance of our current account over five years, the state of our mortgage repayments, the details of my mobile phone and credit card arrangements, and the fact that I have a clean bill of health as regards insolvency and county court judgments. The same, as far as I know, applies to their fellow CRAs, Experian and Equifax. \"The rise of credit reporting agencies is unprecedented,\" one privacy activist later told me, comparing them to government departments, \"with the power and autonomy that applies.\" They can, he said, \"do more or less what they choose, and exempt themselves from any liability. That is unheard of anywhere else in the world.\" If Callcredit's response was alarmingly exhaustive, plenty of other replies were disappointing. Royal Bank of Scotland blithely ignored my request for detailed information and sent me little more than five years' worth of statements. My attempts to get hold of data from Virgin Media, my internet service provider, resulted in a laborious chain of returned cheques and sudden demands for additional ID, and a request that is still ongoing (even when the inquiry has officially kicked in, you must wait up to 40 days for a reply, which means that the bouncing back and forth of letters can stretch out over months). Hard-bitten anti-corporate activists might see such behaviour as the stuff of mendacity, but it looked to me like a matter of laziness and confusion. On at least one occasion, however, I bumped up against what looked like deliberate obfuscation. Mobile phone companies keep records of their customers' \"cell data\" - the rough locations from which calls are made and text messages sent, established on the basis of where their masts are situated. They're retained for a year and accessible to public officials, in particular the police, according to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. From time to time, the use of cell data makes its way into the news, as happened early this year when it formed part of the evidence that nailed the gang responsible for the robbery of \u00a353m from a Securitas depot in Kent. As personal data goes, this is juicy stuff: if you use your mobile a lot, it amounts to a pretty reliable index of where you've been. When I made a subject access request to T-Mobile, my phone provider, I made a point of asking for my cell data, but the letter I received back ruled this out on the basis that it was \"company information\". When I contacted the T-Mobile press office and queried this response, they said this: \"As we do not know whether the person who pays the phone bill is always the person who makes or receives a call from that phone, we don't assume that cell records always relate to them. \"Accordingly, we don't consider that cell records are 'personal data', as defined by the DPA and as interpreted by the courts, because the information may not actually relate to them.\" David Smith is the deputy information commissioner, one of the most senior public officials charged with overseeing the working of the DPA, and enforcing compliance with it. When I read him T-Mobile's response, he sounds bamboozled. \"I can't see any obvious reason why you shouldn't have that information,\" he says. \"According to the Data Protection Act, the fact that it's so-called company information isn't a reason for not giving it to you. \"If it's your personal data, you're entitled to it. One test would be this: if you were suspected of involvement in a crime, and the police went along and said: 'Could you tell me what information you've got about John Harris?' If they would give it to the police in response to that, then you should get it back in response to a subject access request.\" The information commissioner's office will be happy to look into my formal complaint, he says. \"We would try to persuade the company to give you the information. If they refused, we would issue them with an enforcement notice.\" The next day, my mobile trills with a call from Martin Hoskins, T-Mobile's data protection manager, who sounds ever-so-slightly panicky. In principle, he says, T-Mobile would issue a customer with \"some\" cell data, but the company \"would expect that person to write to us to explain who they were, that it was them who made the phone calls in question, and why they wanted the information.\" Soon enough, we hit circular logic of the Kafka-esque variety: I want the information because it's exactly the kind of \"personal data\" to which I'm entitled under the DPA, but Hoskins says T-Mobile would deal with any request for cell data \"outside the act\". In short, the company are sticking to their very questionable line. \"Mobile phone companies are notorious for creating exemptions on the run,\" says Simon Davies, director of the pressure group Privacy International. \"One day, they'll decide that the justification for the exemption from disclosure is security, the next it's commercial confidentiality, then it'll be a technical reason. Not that long ago, they tended to claim that there were disproportionate costs in giving you the full information, but eventually, that didn't wash any more, so they came up with something else. The phone companies are effectively saying: 'No, that's commercially sensitive and extraordinarily valuable data, and we're not giving it away on principle, so we'll just make up a justification.' What you got back was a pretty thin excuse, but given the history of these things, it doesn't surprise me.\" Davies, who splits his working time between a visiting fellowship at the LSE (where he specialises in \"privacy and the impact of technology on society and the individual\"), and the running of a consultancy called 80/20 Thinking, which assists firms and organisations with \"privacy and security issues\", has been involved in data protection for 20 years. As he sees it, the fact that so many companies and bodies seem to discharge their responsibilities under the DPA in such a half-hearted way is partly down to the lowly place of the relevant people in the average corporate hierarchy. By and large, data protection officers are on their own,\" he says. \"They tend to occupy a broom closet [laughs], they're provided with no resources, and no one particularly likes them, because they're either asking messy legal questions, or they're the conduit for PR problems. They're very often alienated within their own organisations, and given precious few resources. I don't think it's always the case that there's a conspiracy - it's often that underfunded and undertrained people are given the job of responding to customers. \"That's why you get inconsistent answers. But sometimes, organisations make a policy decision that this is a stupid law, and they're not going to dignify it with a response.\" There is, it seems, a hole within the cultures of both the public and private sector where much more advanced thinking about data protection ought to go, of a piece with that great national blindspot about matters of surveillance and privacy. In the US, big organisations very often employ a chief privacy officer who, says Simon Davies, tends to be \"regarded as an important part of the organisation - they can be involved in corporate development, strategy, any number of other areas\". Here, by contrast, data protection officers appear to be time-poor, much-maligned people whose often slapdash responses to information requests don't exactly make you feel confident about the even more essential matter of data security. By way of a case study, the experience of Kamlesh Parmar, a 35-year-old IT contractor from east London, takes some beating. An Orange phone customer, he discovered in 2005 that someone had opened an additional Orange account in his name, and run up about \u00a3600 in charges. Keen to know how this fraud had happened, he wrote to Orange asking for clarification, but claims to have received nothing in response. \"They pretty much ignored me,\" he says. \"I wasn't aware of the Data Protection Act and how it worked, but then I did a bit of research about subject access requests. So I filed one, and everything still stayed completely quiet.\" Parmar made an official complaint to the information commissioner's office. Thanks to its investigations, it transpired that Orange had added insult to injury by sending the personal data Parmar had requested- including, he says, such sensitive items as his account's password - to the wrong address (the company blamed \"human error\"), opening up the possibility of yet more identity fraud. When he belatedly received material from Orange, his complaints that the data he sought was still not in there were met with a claim by Orange that its data protection officer did \"not have time to read every single page of information we send to the customer\" and that to do so would constitute a \"disproportionate effort\". In any case, nothing Orange sent him cast convincing light on how someone had managed to open an account in his name. In the end, he pursued Orange through the small claims court for the cost of the time he had spent writing 36 letters to them and the information commissioner, and was eventually awarded just under \u00a33,000. As privacy becomes more and more of a public worry, the debate around data protection is inevitably becoming more and more charged. The information commissioner's office is lobbying for changes in the law, not only so that illicitly dealing in personal data can result in a prison sentence, but so they have access to companies and public bodies that are currently off-limits. \"We're concerned that we don't have enough powers to investigate and check,\" says Smith. \"We want the ability to make audits and do spot-checks. And if we find things that are seriously wrong, there ought to be effective penalties.\" He goes on: \"You may remember issues about banks leaving confidential waste in bins round the back. In that instance, there's a strong argument that they should face a penalty.\" Over at Privacy International, Davies wants to go much further. The DPA, he reckons, was \"written with the express intention of ensuring that data protection administration was weak, because this government saw data protection as a potential roadblock to profitable commerce\". Ten years on, he says, \"you've got to rip this law up in all but its core principles, and start again. You have to empower your information commissioner with the resources and legal rights to scare the hell out of these organisations. At the moment, those powers don't exist. That's what we've argued for years.\" As things stand, you need only make a handful of data requests to understand the unsettling murk that surrounds too much personal data, and how fragile your individual security could turn out to be. Put it this way: as the postman arrived each morning with new bundles of information, one image kept springing to mind - a laptop left on the back seat of car, a smashed window, and all hell breaking loose.",
