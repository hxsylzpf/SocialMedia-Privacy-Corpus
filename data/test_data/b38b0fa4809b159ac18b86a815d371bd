  "content": "Once again, Anthony Weiner has been caught with his pants down. This time, Huma Abedin decided enough was enough. The trusted Hillary Clinton aide decided to separate from the scandal-plagued former congressman. The news came just a few hours after the New York Post published a piece saying that Anthony Weiner was caught sending explicit Twitter messages to an online acquaintance \u2013 who is also a reported Trump supporter. The exchange, which allegedly happened last summer, included crotch shots (one of which appears to have been taken by Weiner while his son was lying asleep next to him) and steamy messages. It's truly bewildering how \u2013 despite numerous embarrassing sexting scandals \u2013 he made the same mistake over and over again. He continually exposed not only himself and his reputation to such absurd scandal, but his wife, her career and his family too. Why? We could chalk this up to fallacies inherent in male sexuality, which often seem to be more evident in the powerful and famous. We could describe his behavior through the model of addiction \u2013 and the immediacy of cellphone technology and the anonymity of the online universe that makes us all so vulnerable. But I think there is more at work here. Anthony Weiner wanted to be caught, and caught and caught. It isn't enough that he sent out the pictures himself in 2011. The latest rendition is revealing on a whole number of levels if we look closely. First, he was apparently sexting with someone who is in the opposing political camp. His lady-friend supports the opponent of his wife's boss \u2013 she couldn't have more reason to want to turn him in. In the direct messages published by the New York Post, Weiner allegedly sent a photo of himself with bulging underwear while his child lay beside him. \"Someone just climbed into my bed,\" the text reads. She replied: \"You do realize you can see you[r] Weiner in that pic??\" This act seems to bring on a moment of conscience, and Weiner appears to become scared that he accidentally posted the message publicly online. It wouldn't be the first time \u2013 that's why he was forced to give up his seat in Congress in 2011, in his original sexting scandal. He writes: \"Ooooooh \u2026 I was scared. For half a second I thought I posted something.\" This is then followed by him writing \"Stop looking at my crotch\". It should also be noted that since Weiner tends to send pictures of his penis concealed by his underpants, they are appropriate for worldwide distribution and need not be censored or blurred. One might wonder whether, on some level, that is a deliberate choice. \"Whatever you did it on purpose\", his texting partner replies. She quickly corrects herself \u2013 of course he did it on purpose \u2013 with: \"O I see, you thought you posted on your TL [timeline] not DM [direct message]. S--t happens be careful\". In hindsight, these misunderstandings seem oddly prophetic. He is doing this on purpose, making the same mistakes, not being careful, so that he can confirm for himself that everyone wants to see his stuff. Still when he says \"stop looking\", there is something genuine about that request. Anthony Weiner, I think, wants to stop these scandals. He wants to find a way for us to stop looking at him. Why does anyone try to get caught \u2013 if not to be stopped from carrying out a destructive behavior? The strange thing is that even public humiliation and scorn cannot stop him, which is what fascinates us and keeps the cycle going. In Freud's last published paper, The Splitting of the Ego in the Process of Defense, in 1938, he writes about sexual impulse and what happens when we are faced with prohibition that can result in danger. He found that, when presented with the choice between stopping or going ahead despite danger, some people do not decide either way. They keep both positions and split their mind in half, so to speak \u2013 inhabiting an untenable, split reality. Who displays this contradiction better than Weiner? Is this not what we see in the play-by-play of his sexting, to say nothing of his entire life? Fascinatingly, Freud goes on to talk about the fact that this symptom of splitting often appears in someone's relationship to his genitals. This strange thing that Freud calls 'castration anxiety' is the contradiction between 'I have it, this penis of all penises' and 'I have nothing, nothing to show for myself'. This is precisely what we see Weiner play out before our eyes, as he seemingly begs us to put some limit on his compulsive display of his genitals to the public. Very Freudian, of course, but how can we bypass this when it comes to thinking about Anthony Weiner?"
