  "content": "There appears no consensus on what to call the next decade. Is it the 10s, twenty-tens, tenties, teens, or even tweenies? The new year had barely begun before the arguments on Radio 4's Today programme about whether 2010 should be pronounced twenty-ten or two-thousand-and-ten. The website twentynot2000.com is clear: \"Say the year 1810 out loud. Now say 1999. See a pattern? It's been easier, faster, and shorter to say years this way for every decade (except for the one that just ended) instead of saying the number the long way\" So far 2,556 people have joined an \"It's twenty-ten, not two-thousand and ten\" Facebook group, and 23,086 the \"Saying twenty-ten instead of two-thousand-ten because it sounds cooler\" group. The Today team may well have pledged their allegiance to the groups. \"It's twenty-ten,\" said presenter Evan Davis. \"Not only does it have three syllables, the Radio 4 newsreaders have settled on twenty-ten. And I'm with them.\""
