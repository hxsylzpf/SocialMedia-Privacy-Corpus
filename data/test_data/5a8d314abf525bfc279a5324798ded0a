  "content": "The Conservative Party's commitment to free data in the name of more accountable public services is to receive its first large-scale test. Newly elected London mayor Boris Johnson says he will require the Metropolitan Police to create Britain's most detailed map of reported crimes. He also promised to make data available to groups such as local Neighbourhood Watches to create their own crime maps. One entrepreneur in the US has already offered to develop a Google-based system for free. Geographical information and crime researchers at the University of London are also hoping to interest the mayor in a system. Presenting crime reports in map form is not a new idea. The Home Office has been interested for at least six years. Several local authorities and police forces have tried out limited schemes, both as a tool both for identifying \"hot spots\" and for reassuring the public. \"Perceptions of crime levels are often 10 to 100 times greater than actual levels, so maps can have a positive reassuring message,\" says Spencer Chainey of the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science at University College London. Johnson's manifesto cites two examples of police forces making crime maps available - West Yorkshire Police Authority's beatcrime.info and West Midlands' myneighbourhood.info. However these sites map only a limited number of offences, and not at high geographical detail. The London scheme would \"map a large number of offences at street level\". The exact location mapped would depend on the sensitivity of the crime: an assault or theft would have the exact location, a burglary a location within 300 metres, while a sexual assault would be identified only by street. Chainey says the technology is available to present crime data in an intuitive educational way. He hopes the mayor will consider UCL's London Profiler 3D map londonprofiler.org. However one obstacle will be to change the mindset of police forces, which have been cautious about releasing data. \"I don't think they've really sat down and thought through the power of this information.\" Johnson also cites some US cities as the model to follow. However, according to Colin Drane, founder of Spotcrime.com, the picture is patchy. The free commercial site maps crimes in the US's 100 largest cities. While some cities such as Dallas and Washington DC release constantly updated data, in others Drane says he has to rely on media reports. \"Most cities believe they own the data, there is a hesitancy to share it with the public.\" However Drane says that more cities are seeing the benefits. \"When we started mapping crimes in Baltimore, it coincided with a 30% decline in crimes, the first for many years.\" Drane, a British citizen, has written to Johnson offering to set up a crime mapping site for free. So far, there has been no reply. \u00b7 Join the debate at the Free Our Data blog"
