  "content": "Can we just take a minute to appreciate the Isles of Scilly police force's Facebook page? It's garnered quite the following, with more than 14,000 likes to date \u2013 a huge accomplishment when you bear in mind the Scilly Isles have a population of 2,200. They drew a fair bit of internet love on Thursday morning after Sergeant Colin Taylor wrote a job advertisement for a police constable: You may remember them from a viral story earlier this year, when police officers were left puzzled by a fried egg left at the scene of a shed burglary. Describing themselves \"like Heartbeat but less frenetic\", there is nothing not to love about this Facebook page. They comment on current events: They have a crime-fighting cat on the team: In fact, Deputy Chief Constable Mowgli (retired) may be our favourite: Their descriptions of crimes are second to none: And, of course, there's the mystery of the fried egg: Such is their popularity, they were recently given an official Facebook verified tick. Basically, everyone can stop trying now: Isles of Scilly police have won Facebook. We salute you. (and can we have an interview with Mowgli please) UPDATE: BuzzFeed went and found some Scilly Vines and they're just as delightful."
