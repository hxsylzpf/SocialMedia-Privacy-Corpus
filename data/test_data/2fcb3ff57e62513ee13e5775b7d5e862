  "content": "Lawyers for the Queen were due to return to the high court today to seek continuation of a \"gagging order\" against the Daily Mirror. The order was obtained on Thursday last week to prevent the newspaper from publishing further revelations about journalist Ryan Parry's employment as a footman in the royal household. The injunction, effective until 4.30pm today, was a temporary measure to protect the Queen's interests while lawyers for the newspaper and Parry prepared their case for a full hearing of the legal issues involved. The judge at Thursday's emergency hearing, Mr Justice Lewison, said the Queen had a \"real prospect\" of succeeding in her claim for a permanent publicity ban over what her lawyers claimed was a \"flagrant\" breach of the confidentiality terms of Parry's employment contract with the palace. It was not known whether the case would go ahead today or be adjourned - with the same temporary injunction in force - pending a full hearing in the future. Mr Justice Lewison said on Thursday the Mirror was unlikely to succeed in its argument that the material it was publishing was already in the public domain through books written by people such as former royal butler Paul Burrell. He said there was \"well established\" contract law to the effect that contractual rights could be an exception to the principle of freedom of expression under the Human Rights Act. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
