  "content": "Zynga remains the biggest beast in the world of Facebook social games, with 227 million monthly active users (MAUs) according to the latest version of its S-1 IPO filing in the US. The company's mobile business is growing too, but it has yet to reach a similarly dominant position on smartphones and tablets. That S-1 document provides an update on the company's mobile fortunes, revealing that in October, Zynga averaged 11.1 million daily active users (DAUs) on mobile, up from 9.9 million during the third quarter of 2011 \u2013 which was itself a tenfold increase on Zynga's number of mobile players in November 2010. Inside Mobile Apps sets these figures against those of rivals in the mobile social games market, pointing out that Glu Mobile recently announced that it has 2.1 million DAUs across its titles, while Storm8 had four million in June, and likely more now. Zynga is still some way behind Rovio Mobile's Angry Birds franchise, which had 30 million DAUs in October according to the company's general manager for North America Andrew Stalbow. Rovio may not seem like a direct competitor to Zynga \u2013 Angry Birds' social features are minimal \u2013 but the S-1 filing includes it in the list of Zynga's key rivals in mobile. The company continues to work on growing its mobile business. Currently, its oldest mobile title Poker by Zynga is the second Top Grossing iPhone app in the US on both Apple's App Store and Google's Android Market, for example \u2013 in the UK, it tops the rankings for iOS. The US Top Grossing chart shows how much more competition Zynga is facing on mobile, though. Its other iOS games chart thus: Mafia Wars Shakedown (40th), Hanging With Friends (51st), Words With Friends (52nd), CityVille Hometown (61st), and FarmVille (123rd). Freemium games sitting above this clutch of titles include DragonVale, Zombie Farm, Crime City, Smurfs' Village, Tap Fish 2, Blood &amp; Glory, Top Girl, Original Gangstaz and Tap Zoo \u2013 all released by companies who wouldn't have a hope of catching Zynga's games on Facebook. The fact that Zynga has not so far imposed itself on mobile to the same degree that it has on Facebook hints at some important differences between the two platforms, even if those differences may blur following Facebook's extension of its applications platform to mobile devices, with an emphasis on HTML5 games complementing native apps. The stakes are high, as freemium and/or social games are becoming a lucrative business on mobile devices. In July, mobile analytics firm Flurry estimated that 65% of the revenues from the US App Store's 100 Top Grossing games came from freemium titles, compared to 39% in January. Flurry also estimates that the percentage of players who spend money via in-app purchases in freemium mobile games ranges from 0.5% to 6%, and that the average amount spent per transaction in these games is $14. In November, it made waves by suggesting that 58% of all US portable games software revenues in 2011 will come from Android and iOS, overtaking Nintendo DS (36%) and Sony PSP (6%). Watching Zynga try to build its mobile business in 2012, possibly by snapping up some of the developers making those games that are out-grossing most of its titles on the App Store, will be fascinating. Not least because the company will have to delicately tread the fault-line between two big platform owners \u2013 Facebook and Apple \u2013 while rolling out its own Project Z platform to sit alongside them."
