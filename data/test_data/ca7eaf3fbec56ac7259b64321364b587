  "content": "In this spot recently we looked at a laser beam keyboard - and now, a fingerprint reader for your computer. Previously this was only the stuff of films; now we all get to play with them. Roll over James Bond - I'm sure my jet backpack is in the post. But while I wait, here's the \u00a335 Eikon \"Digital Privacy Manager\" (that's the fancy name for a fingerprint reader) from Upek. It works on XP, Vista and Mac OS X, and doesn't limit itself to just controlling whether you can log in to the machine (though that is one of the possibilities). No, you can also use it to access password-protected sites, encrypt folders (possibly forever, as I'll explain), launch applications with different fingers and even swap between user accounts. The worry that I had was this rather simple but pragmatic one. No, not what happens if I rub the prints off my fingers through some bizarre DIY accident (or worse, lose the fingers altogether) - because you can store up to 21 fingerprints in the system. (Are they catering to polydactylists?) But: what if I lose the fingerprint reader? How will I get at the sites and encrypted archives? Don't worry: you can set backup passwords that will unlock anything you encrypt with the reader. (Set and remember these, else you'll never recover the data if the reader fails.) With websites, the fingerprint isn't the password (I was wondering how I'd access them if it was sending the print itself). It's the password to the password. Thus relieved, how good is the Eikon? Pretty good. It's fast, and I could get reliable swipes from my different fingers. (Searching around, I find other people have fared less well; perhaps it's a function of how clean your hands are, or similar. There are cleaning instructions for the reader.) Swiping fingers to launch applications may be slightly faster, and swiping a finger to enter a password is easier on some sites - but many banking sites won't work with it (because they don't allow automatic password entry; too big a security risk). Which makes the fingerprint less useful, doesn't it? On Mac OS X, the software (from Upek's site) is less able than on Windows: it can't work with passwords on disk images, and simply unlocks your keychain (where you store your passwords anyway) on login. Finally, can your fingerprint be stolen? No - it's not a picture that's stored, but a calculation based on the pattern of whorls and ridges that come past the reader. So unless the whole world starts using Eikons, which I'm sure would please Upek, you can feel unworried. In the end, though, I did wonder whether James Bond really has it so good. Plain old typing, and memorable but clever passwords (see How secure are your online passwords, December 6 2007) seems to me like it'll do the job just as well. Pros: Simple, caters for multiple users Cons: Limited usefulness; Mac software limited upek.com/solutions/eikon",
