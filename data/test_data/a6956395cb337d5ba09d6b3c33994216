  "content": "In what promises to be a riveting evening, City University's journalism faculty is staging a panel debate entitled How far should a reporter go? The lessons of the News of the World phone-hacking story. Speakers include Nick Davies, who has made all the running on the hacking revelations for The Guardian, former News of the World reporter Paul McMullan, solicitor Mark Lewis, who is acting for many alleged hacking victims, former director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, and Max Mosley, the former Formula One chief who won a privacy action against the NoW after it revealed that he took part in sado-masochistic orgy. It will be chaired by Andrew Caldecott QC, who was once described in The Times as the most cerebral and the most persuasive of libel barristers. Oh yes, I nearly forgot. I am taking part too, though I will not be advancing my own views. You will note from the line-up above that there is no speaker from the News of the World. So I will be arguing the paper's case, not as a comic routine, but in complete seriousness. I will be the voice of the NoW throughout. I ought to point out that at least one of the NoW's senior executives was prepared to attend, but the discussion clashes with the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, and he - like his colleagues - is required to be there. The event takes place next Tuesday, 5 October, starting at 6.15pm. Though hosted by City for its students, it will be open to the public. But advance bookings must be made here. Admission is free."
