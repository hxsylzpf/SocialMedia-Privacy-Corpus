  "content": "There has been global interest in the fact that The Guardian's editor has been called to account by MPs for the paper's mass surveillance revelations. The questioning of Alan Rusbridger by the commons home affairs select committee has received widespread coverage in the world's leading newspapers. In fact, it was given more of a show outside Britain than within it. Major titles in the United States (Washington Post here and New York Times here) gave it a big show, as did several in Australia (The Australian here and Melbourne Age here) and India (The Hindu here). Rusbridger's appearance was headlined in France (Le Monde here) and Germany (Die Welt here) and Italy (La Repubblica here). Japan's Asahi Shimbun, which sells more than 10m copies a day between its morning and evening editions, devoted considerable space to the story, providing a comprehensive account of the whole saga. The headline says \"UK frustration at GCHQ leaks\" and evidently quotes me as saying: \"If parliament won't hold the secret services to account, then newspapers have to do the job and that's what The Guardian is doing.\" Just so."
