  "content": "Twitter's latest acquisition is its biggest to date, paying around $350m in stock for the mobile advertising startup MoPub. AllThingsD compared the deal to Google's DoubleClick buy, because it will give the service a tool to track advertising inventory, offering third parties a way to manage their ads in advance and bid for their campaigns in real time. The purchase potentially puts Twitter ahead of Facebook in the ad technology game, as Facebook has been attempting to create something very similar with its Facebook Exchange \u2013 an integral part of the social network's profitability outlook. MoPub's technology sits directly on the intersection between mobile platforms and data-driven advertising, making it a perfect match for Twitter and its often mobile-first and rapidly evolving consumer base. Twitter stated in a blog post that the acquisition will not change its existing advertising strategy, and that it will \"maintain the same high quality standards that define our platform today\". \"Our approach is to show an ad when we think it will be useful or interesting to a user, and that isn't changing.\" The acquisition should help Twitter maintain the profitability drive that its sponsored or \"promoted tweets\" started in 2010, before being brought to its mobile apps on the iPhone and Android in 2012.",
