  "content": "Prince Edward's TV company will continue making the documentary that sparked the row over filming Prince William, despite claiming that it will stop making films about royalty. And the chairman of Ardent Productions, Malcolm Cockren, has left the door open for the company to make historical programmes about royalty. He also confirmed that Prince Edward will be staying with the company, flying in the face of repeated calls for the Wessexes to drop their careers to concentrate in royal duties. The programme Ardent was filming at Prince William's university for US television, The A-Z of Royalty, will take until next spring to finish, according to Mr Cockren. \"We have to conclude our current contractual arrangements. It is utterly incorrect to say the project has been shelved. Filming for A-Z will continue until next spring,\" said Mr Cockren. But he said that another programme Ardent was due to make on the royals was \"unlikely\" to happen. \"We have one other programme [involving royalty] that is unlikely to happen. It's been on the books for a long time. Once A-Z is finished, that will be the end of royal programmes,\" he said. But because of the distinction Mr Cockren draws between programmes Ardent have made about royalty and those he considers are historical, he does not appeared to have completely ruled out future royal fare. He said that Ardent has made only two programmes on the royals in its seven-year history - Edward on Edward and Windsor Restored. He believes that Crown and Country, in which Prince Edward looked at the stories behind the kings and queens of England, was an historical programme and not a royal one. \"We will put all out energies into film and drama. If the odd, non-royal, factual programme comes along, so be it.\" And Mr Cockren said that he would like nothing better than for the media to leave to company alone and let it get on with its business. \"It's a very difficult company to run because of the media attention. It would be my one wish in life to get on and be left alone.\"",
