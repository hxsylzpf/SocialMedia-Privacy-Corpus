Owers, who joins as head of news and government partnerships at Twitter UK, replaces Joanna Geary who moved to head the social media site's new daily \"best of\" stories curation service, Moments, as editorial lead for Europe, Middle East and Africa. \"Rob's clarity, energy and his track record working on TV news and digital platforms at Sky News, one of the most cutting-edge news broadcasters globally, really shone through,\" said Lewis Wiltshire, senior director of media partnerships at Twitter. \"I'm thrilled he's joining our UK team to lead partnerships with the news industry and government partners, and as his role will also have a regional focus, I'm also looking forward to him growing our media partnerships across the UK.\" Owers was Sky News output editor, also responsible for live online coverage of the general election results. His earlier roles at Sky included building the team that launched Sky News' iPad app, executive producer of Sky News Digital and editorial lead for News at Ten. \"Throughout my career as a journalist I've seen how Twitter has changed the conversation around news and sparked new ways for people to engage with the stories and events which really matter to them,\" said Owers."
