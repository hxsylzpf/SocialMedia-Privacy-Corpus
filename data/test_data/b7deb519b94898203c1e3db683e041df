  "content": "Most historians have accepted that Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the 19th-century hero of Venezuelan independence, died from tuberculosis on 17 December 1830, aged 47, and that his body was moved to the national pantheon in Caracas in 1876. But President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has his own ideas, suspecting his idol was assassinated, possibly poisoned, and buried elsewhere, prompting a controversial exhumation that has divided the country. State television showed scientists with surgical gloves and gas masks opening the coffin last weekend, displaying the skeleton of the rebel leader who inspired Ch\u00e1vez's \"Bol\u00edvarian\" revolution. DNA tests will be carried out on the remains, which appeared to be well-preserved. They included hair, remnants of a shirt, boots and \"perfect\" teeth. The team of 50 includes forensic experts, anthropologists and the attorney general. Opponents dubbed the event a political stunt to distract people from inflation, recession, crime and other problems. Descendants of Bol\u00edvar's sister, Mar\u00eda Antonio, condemned the exhumation as unnecessary and profane. They also opposed a plan to exhume Mar\u00eda Antonio's remains later this week. The president defended the exhumation as a way to resolve issues central to Venezuela's history and identity. He interrupted a speech to provide live commentary on the tomb opening, which was accompanied by the national anthem. \"Viva Bol\u00edvar,\" Ch\u00e1vez said. \"It's not a skeleton. It's the Great Bol\u00edvar, who has returned.\" He interspersed his commentary with messages on Twitter. \"Our father who is in the earth, the water and the air \u2026 you awake every hundred years when the people awaken. I confess that we have cried \u2013 we have sworn allegiance.\" He continued: \"That glorious skeleton has to be Bol\u00edvar, because his flame can be felt. My God. Bol\u00edvar lives ... We are his flame!\" Officials said the remains of the country's second president would not be returned to their lead sarcophagus but put in a gold casket in a grander pantheon. Earlier this year Paul Auwaerter, a doctor from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, suggested that arsenic prescribed as a medical treatment hastened Bol\u00edvar's end. However, Auwaerter did not endorse the assassination theory."
