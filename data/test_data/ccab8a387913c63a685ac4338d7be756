  "content": "It all seems so unfair. We get told that to protect our precious data online we must remember three dozen passwords with letters, numbers, CAPITALS and symbols. We've got to be wary of all of our emails \u2013 even ones promising we have tens of millions sitting waiting for us. We've got to update our firewalls and run anti-virus software daily. We've got to look for the padlock in our browser when we shop online. We do all of that in the hope of not falling victim to identity theft or credit card fraud, or the numerous potential offences we call cyber-crime when they happen online, as if having money stolen were some new phenomenon for the internet era. And yet, so often, it's all in vain. The latest high-profile attack to be reported has a target that should really be able to look after itself: the US federal government. But it has just had to \u2013 sheepishly, you'd imagine \u2013 admit that the personal details of up to 4 million federal employees have been compromised. These potentially include financial information, medical records and even security clearances. This is the real risk of the networked era. We're (sensibly) told to take precautions to look after our details online, but the real, tempting target for criminals and nation states alike isn't picking off details one by one, but rather to get thousands or millions at once by targeting the databases of big business or government. If that's a prospect you find too troubling, there's not too much you can immediately do. You can't force your favourite online shop or your bank or your government to tighten their security. And while the prospect of identity theft might make you withdraw from shopping online until you're sure it's secure, you really can't withdraw from the networked world entirely without huge compromises. Your employer, for example, has your bank records in a database that is almost certainly accessible on the internet. You might ask them to remove them, keep only paper records on you, and give an envelope of cash each month, but they'd probably be unreceptive. When the time comes to pay your tax, an attempt to stay off the electronic grid gets still harder \u2013 and that's before we get anywhere near education, welfare, or health. If you want to be entirely safe from the risk of your personal information being lifted in a hacking attack, it's time to up sticks and live off-grid in a shack in the mountain, growing your own food. If that idea appeals, good luck to you. For the rest of us, what can we do that's useful, and who's in charge of dealing with this stuff? The most constructive thing we can do with a society is to think sensibly about the risks of what we do. If each US agency had maintained its own separate personnel records, each would be a much less appealing target than the Office of Personnel Management's 4-million-strong database. Building huge databases seems to be everyone's favourite pastime, whether they're the UK government, Facebook or Google. But such databases prove a tempting target for criminal and nation state hackers alike. At the moment, UK citizens' tax, welfare, health, education and identity records are all held in separate, fragmentary, and often archaic databases, some networked and some not. Joining them together would enable all sorts of clever tricks, some to deliver better public services, some to detect tax and welfare fraud, and more. But we need to learn to weigh those benefits against the risks of building a one-stop-shop for ne'er-do-wells. We tend to skip that step. The other significant step to think about is trying to make information security as sexy a profession as hacking. At the moment GCHQ \u2013 the same agency that undermines internet security and hacks our rivals, and occasionally our allies \u2013 bears a lot of responsibility for what is, cringe-makingly, referred to as \"cyber-defense\". If you worked for an intelligence agency, what would you rather be doing: hacking into a terror group's systems to reveal and prevent a plot, or upgrading everyone's browser software to avoid a hacking attack? Hacking Iranian centrifuges to cause them to catastrophically fail (this really happened), or doing an anti-virus sweep? Defending our systems needs to be as sexy as attacking others. There's really only one solution: Bond. Sony, which has a vested interest in this area, needs to make sure 007 spends his next two-hour escapade installing improved firewalls in MI6. I'd tune in."
