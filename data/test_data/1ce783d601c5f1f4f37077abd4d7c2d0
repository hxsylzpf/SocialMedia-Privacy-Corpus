  "content": "Bebo's next online drama will be set in the London headquarters of Universal Music, telling the tale of an employee that secretly starts a music label - a plot that echoes Michael J Fox's 1987 hit The Secret of My Success. The Secret World of Sam King will be made by Universal Music UK subsidiary Globe Productions, and independent production company Monkey Kingdom. The online drama, which has not yet gone into production, will be set \"amongst the real-life workings\" of Universal Music UK's west London headquarters. The series revolves around a junior employee in Universal's facilities department who secretly launches his own start-up label in the post room and is \"hungry for success\" to make his way up the ladder and take over the job of his boss Greg. In the 1987 Hollywood film The Secret of My Success, Michael J Fox, who plays Brantley Foster, takes a job in the mail room of his uncle's conglomerate and uses an office to secretly fast track his career, becoming an executive called Carlton Whitfield. The producers of the Bebo show, which follows in the footsteps of Kate Modern and Sofia's Diary, will \"draw on real life experiences\" and use cameos of real life Universal artists to bring \"additional authenticity\" to the storyline. Universal artists include Amy Winehouse, Razorlight, Girls Aloud and Bloc Party. Bebo users will be able to actively participate in the show as well as the fictional music label. Sam's love interest Katie will feature in spin-off online music TV show called Katie's Love In, while Sam's friend Johnny will run a weekly radio podcast. \"The show is a compelling, quality drama that will mix a brilliant narrative with cameos from some of our major recording artists,\" said David Joseph, the Universal Music UK chairman and chief executive. \"The Secret World of Sam King will appeal to creative users with broad ranging interests, all connected to music.\" Sony Ericsson has struck a sponsorship deal committing to the first three months of the show, which will see the mobile company integrated into storylines, such as Sam winding up his boss with mobile phone pranks or getting a trip to Ibiza Rocks. As well as appearing on a dedicated page on Bebo, the show will also be distributed across several online channels of the social networking website's new parent AOL's network to increase reach. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
