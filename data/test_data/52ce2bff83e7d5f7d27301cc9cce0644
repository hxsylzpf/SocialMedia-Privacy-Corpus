  "content": "Now that his successor has been chosen and his presidency is coming to an end amid an all-time-high approval rating, people are getting sentimental about Barack Obama. On Twitter, many are expressing their gratitude for the president using #ThankYouObama. The hashtag picked up during BET's Love &amp; Happiness: An Obama Celebration special that aired on Tuesday night, which was intended to celebrate Barack and Michelle Obama. The special was filmed last month on the White House South Lawn, according to USA Today. The president and first lady were both in attendance and the event included a concert by Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Common and Usher. Celebrity guests such as Samuel L Jackson and Jesse Williams toasted the president. The television channel asked viewers to join the conversation with #ThankYouObama and it was used to thank the president for his achievements and his demeanor. The responses were generally positive, though some used the hashtag to criticize the president and express their support for Donald Trump."
