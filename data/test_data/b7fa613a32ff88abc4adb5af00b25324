  "content": "#interesting? #greatnews? #aaaaaaaargh? Regardless of your opinion, there is no getting away from the ubiquity of hashtag \u2013 today named children's word of the year. An annual analysis of Radio 2's 500 Words short story competition reveals the huge increase in the creative use of the word among the under-13s, with hashtag moving from being a Twitter search term to a device for adding comment and emphasis in stories. Oxford University Press analysed 120,421 entries to the competition to unearth insights into the lives of British children and the ways they use English. There is much to be cheered by, said Vineeta Gupta, head of children's dictionaries at OUP. \"The research has shown that children are true innovators and that they are using more vocabulary, not less.\" Hashtag, or #, is word of the year because it is entering children's vocabulary in a new way, Gupta said. \"Children are not tweeting and using Twitter, but they are using the word hashtag and the symbol # for dramatic effect, it is heightening tension.\" A child might write: 'This is a wonderful day, #sunny,' for example, or: 'I have the best family, #fantasticfamily.' Social media and mobile technology are the predominant themes of 2015, demonstrated by some of the top 20 words to see a significant rise in use over the past 12 months \u2013 zoella, selfie, blog, YouTube and youtuber. On the way out are MP3, Playstation, iPod, Nintendo, Blackberry and even TV, down 10%. Gupta said she was most surprised by \"by the maturity in which children are embracing current affairs\". So the Ebola crisis, in particular, features prominently \u2013 with children using it both literally and as a simile. The first world war features heavily, with U-boats, the Eastern front, Tommies, shrapnel and mustard gas all featuring in stories. The Suffragette movement is also a popular theme, though only for girls. Another trend is for children to use more hyperbolic words. So instead of big, great and fantastic, there might be colossal, magnificent or delightful. The 500 Words competition, part of the Chris Evans Breakfast Show, was launched in 2011 and has seen a big \u2013 or should that be ginormous \u2013 rise in entries. This year there were 120,421 compared to 74,075 in 2012. It provides a rich vein for lexicographers at OUP to mine and helps inform what appears in its dictionaries. Evans said the research showed \"just how incredibly creative children can be\". He added: \"They are so often at the forefront of both adopting, and adapting to, new language trends and using them in all manner of inventive ways. \"It's clear that storytelling remains a hugely important part of child's life and that we as parents should do whatever we can to help them enjoy the worlds they create on paper.\" While the OUP research identified lots of change, it also showed that some things do not change, particularly when it comes to gender. The analysis shows girls will write enthusiastically about cupcakes, unicorns and marshmallows. Boys are more excited about burgers, space, cars and farting.",
