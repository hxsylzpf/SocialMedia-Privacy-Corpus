  "content": "Ever find yourself texting someone in the same house? I admit texting a dinner-time alert to save walking up three flights of stairs (it's not a big house, just a tall one) and I'm not alone. Photo by katielips on Flickr. Some rights reserved. A survey by Best Buy (the US retailer started opening UK stores in the spring, don't you know?) found 50% of us - and 69% of under 25s - have texted or emailed someone in the same house. (Which could mean young people use their phones more reflexively, are lazier or live in bigger houses.) Women are more likely to do this than men - 53% compared to 46% of men. Apparently calling out for meals is a regular message, so clearly women are still not emancipated from the kitchen. Digital storage space is now 40% more likely to cause family arguments than hogging the landline (do people still have landlines?), with 50% of us admitting to accidentally deleting stuff and 25% losing photos or contacts. (I lost 12 years worth of files, photos, artwork, emails - phone stolen, laptop died, back-up died, online backup expired. What are the chances?) Best Buy says 52% of us would chose to keep our internet access compared to 19% of us who'd prefer our washing machine, and for 38% of the under 35s, the laptop is the first device we go to when we get home. There's a generational split between the under 35s and over 35s. Under 35s store most of their music and photographs digitally, but over 35s still have most content on hard copy. I copied all my CDs to an external hard drive and sold them on Amazon, but still have the vinyl, Lionel.",
