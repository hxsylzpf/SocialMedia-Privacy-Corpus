  "content": "There were three things I wanted to ask Twitter co-founder Biz Stone at the Silicon Valley Comes to Oxford conference yesterday. The first was about those swirling rumours of an attempted Facebook acquisition. How would the Twitter community react to a takeover by a more mainstream site, and one where the most obvious use for Twitter would be an integration with rather restrictive status updates? \"There are some interesting overlaps,\" said Stone, \"and most of those are complementary.\" Complementary, but surely Twitter is far more flexible and diverse as a platform than the more rigidly controlled Facebook site would allow? \"Twitter's goal has always been to create a sustainable new company around the concept of this unique form of communication we have created.\" Creating a 'sustainable' company before selling it would mean it was worth far more, but equally support from Facebook could mean a more commercial focus. \"We've been working together with Facebook - obviously we have the Facebook app, and you can set Twitter updates to update your Facebook status. But both of those are a little different. The analogy there is that the Facebook status update is 'I'm headed to Boston' and then the whole time I'm in Boston, I'm Twittering that 'I'm getting doughnuts', 'I'm eating doughnuts', 'I'm on third street with doughnuts'. And then when you get back online, you'd say 'I'm back from Boston'. It's a different use case.\" \"Ultimately what we do is complementary to the big social networks. Twitter is not a social network but a communication tool that has social elements to it. You don't just follow people - you find sources and choose what is important to you. Sorting out full SMS support in the UK? \"It's not something we can flip a switch on. It needs a lot of deliberation and business development, but we're hiring aggressively for ten new positions including business development as hopefully these new people will really get on the front lines of mobile and negotiate so we can get the full, true spirit of Twitter working again. \"Ideally we'll negotiate this in-house,\" rather than as services offered by third parties, he said. Commercialising Twitter The third thing - making money from Twitter. When I spoke to fellow co-founder Ev Williams just over a year ago, he was already talking about brands paying a premium to use the service rather than slapping ads in Twitter feeds. Stone elaborated. \"The first brand we really saw shining was ComCast. One blogger said he was going to writ a post tomorrow slamming ComCast and it would be the number one post on a Google search for ComCast. They replied immediately and sent a van round to his house within an hour to fix his cable, and the next day his post praised ComCast for their amazing customer service.\" He said JetBlue and Wholefoods were doing a similar thing - a quirky, hybrid mix of customer service and marketing. \"What we're going to try to start focusing on next is the big brands on Twitter who are getting a lot of value out of it and have a lot of followers. They're getting value and the customers are getting value so it makes sense to enter a relationship with the where we offer more value at a price. \"But we have an iterative approach - we don't want to unveil a secret weapon. We'll just put stuff out and see what happens.\" The Mars Phoenix cruiser &amp; jail in Egypt He also spoke about some of the major Twitter events of the past few months. The Mars Phoenix project happened to coincide with publicity for the film Wall E, which perfectly set the tone for the anthropomorphised updates on its exploration of the red planet. In a few short weeks, Mars Pheonix built a following of nearly 40,000 people on Twitter and finally injected some energy into Nasa's mission to get the public engaged with science \"So we learned through Twitter that Phoenix had verified water ice on Mars.\" \"Nasa traditionally gets some science, everything goes through PR and then it comes back weeks later very dry. It's the same process for blogging - but somehow Twitter updates were allowed.\" The second was the case of the photojournalism student James Buck who left UC Berkeley for Egypt because he wanted to photograph some exciting stuff. He found out about Twitter in Egypt when he asked activists how they were co-ordinating so quickly - and when he found himself arrested he quickly Twittered 'arrested' when he realised they hadn't taken his phone away. Back home, friends knew what he had been up to and took the tweet seriously. The dean of the school called the lawyer, who called the consulate, and he was out within two hours. And then he Twittered \"free\".",
