  "content": "News International has quietly severed ties with former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman, who was jailed for his part in the phone-hacking scandal. \"He doesn't have a job, he's an ex-employee,\" a senior News International executive revealed to MediaGuardian.co.uk. A News of the World spokeswoman said: \"Mr Goodman no longer works for the company\". It is understood that the former royal editor, who was sentenced to four months' imprisonment in January after pleading guilty to plotting to intercept messages left on the phones of staff in the royal household, was released from the prison facility on the Isle of Sheppey last Monday and electronically tagged. After Goodman was sentenced for his part in the royal phone-hacking scandal, the News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, resigned and said he took ultimate responsibility for the scandal. Former Sunday Mirror editor Colin Myler immediately replaced Coulson as editor. Goodman remained suspended, as he had been since the day of his arrest last August, and the News of the World promised a statement on his employment status in due course. Now MediaGuardian.co.uk has learned that News International terminated its contract with the reporter - who rang the mobile phone numbers of royal household staff 487 times in order to hack into their voicemail messages - while he was still in prison. A source said that News International told Goodman's wife that his contract had been terminated. Goodman's co-conspirator, private investigator and former Wimbledon footballer Glenn Mulcaire, was jailed for six months. Shortly after his appointment, Mr Myler promptly emailed staff about the phone-hacking incident and reminded them of their responsibilities under the Press Complaints Commission code of practice. He invited the PCC to the paper's office to hold briefings for staff. The PCC has launched a wide-ranging investigation into phone-hacking and has been working with Mr Myler ahead of dealing with other newspapers. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
