  "content": "Executives who sanctioned phone hacking and other illegal activities at the News of the World and other newspapers will be barred from running any media organisation in Britain, David Cameron has announced. In an attempt to regain the initiative on the phone-hacking scandal amid Tory criticisms of his performance over the past week, the prime minister said Lord Justice Leveson would take charge of a two-pronged inquiry into the \"disgraceful\" affair. Cameron, who faced criticism for having dinner in Oxfordshire with Rebekah Brooks and James Murdoch over the Christmas period, also said he would consult the cabinet secretary on amending the ministerial code to ensure greater transparency. The prime minister, whose aides were playing down the prospect of a judge-led inquiry as recently as last week, said that Leveson would lead a \"robust\" inquiry set up under the 2005 Inquiries Act. Cameron, who agreed the broad terms of the inquiry with Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg on Tuesday night, said it would be able to compel proprietors, politicians from across the spectrum and police officers to give evidence under oath. \"The inquiry will \u2026 have the power to summon witnesses including newspaper reporters, management, proprietors, policemen and politicians of all parties to give evidence under oath and in public,\" he said. Cameron, who spoke just under two hours before News Corp announced it would abandon its bid to take full control of BSkyB, said the inquiry would have two strands: first, a full investigation into wrongdoing in the press and police, including the failure of the first police investigation into allegations of hacking. This part of the inquiry will not begin its work until the criminal investigation has been completed. Cameron said this would examine \"the extent of unlawful or improper conduct at the News of the World and other newspapers and the way in which management failures may have allowed this to happen This part of the inquiry will also look into the original police investigation and the issue of corrupt payments to police officers. And it will consider the implications for the relationship between newspapers and the police.\". The second strand would be a review of the regulation of the press. Cameron said self-regulation had failed under the Press Complaints Commission, and that this should be replaced by independent regulation rather than statutory regulation. The prime minister said this strand of the inquiry would examine \"the culture, practices and ethics of the press; their relationship with the police; the failure of the current system of regulation; the contacts made, and discussions had, between national newspapers and politicians; why previous warnings about press misconduct were not heeded; and the issue of cross-media ownership.\" Cameron said: \"He [Leveson] will make recommendations for a new, more effective way of regulating the press. One that supports their freedom, plurality and independence from government but which also demands the highest ethical and professional standards. He will also make recommendations about the future conduct of relations between politicians and the press. This part of the inquiry we hope will report within 12 months.\" The prime minister said he would be consulting Sir Gus O'Donnell, the cabinet secretary, on amending the ministerial code. This would require ministers to \"record all meetings with newspaper and other media proprietors, senior editors and executives \u2013 regardless of the nature of the meeting\". Cameron later told Ed Miliband that he would also consult on whether to extend this to journalists. \"On transparency, I am consulting on the proposal to make much more transparent what ministers do, including not just business meetings, but social meetings. It is worth asking whether we should go further on meetings with journalists, as the police might want to do.\" In his statement to MPs, the prime minister said any executives or journalists guilty of wrongdoing \u2013 or of sanctioning illegal practices \u2013 should be banned from running media organisations. \"Let me also say this: the people involved, whether they were directly responsible for the wrongdoing, sanctioned it, or covered it up, however high or low they go, must not only be brought to justice, they must also have no future role in the running of a media company in our country.\" The prime minister, who held talks on Tuesday night with the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, said new rules of transparency would be applied to the police amid public concern about allegations that the News of the World made payments to corrupt police officers. These allegations have been referred by the Met to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Cameron said Stephenson would invite a senior public figure to advise him on improving police transparency after what the prime minister described as a \"mixed\" performance by present and past police officers before the Commons home affairs select committee on Tuesday. Deputy assistant commissioner Sue Akers, who is running the Operation Weeting investigation into phone hacking, has won widespread praise. Andy Hayman, the former assistant commissioner who ran the initial police investigation and who became a News International columnist after leaving the Met, was widely criticised. Cameron said: \"Allegations have been made that some corrupt police officers may have taken payments from newspapers. And there are wider concerns that the relationship between the police and the press can be too close. When I spoke to Sir Paul Stephenson yesterday, he made clear that he is as determined as I am that all aspects of the police relationship with the media should be beyond reproach.\" The prime minister updated MPs on the state of Operation Weeting. He said: \"[Stephenson] assured me that the investigation is fully resourced, one of the largest currently under way in the country, and being carried out by a completely different team from the original investigation. It is being led by deputy assistant commissioner Sue Akers, who I know impressed the select committee yesterday. \"Her team is looking through 11,000 pages containing 3,870 names, including around 4,000 mobile and 5,000 landline phone numbers. They have contacted 170 people so far \u2013 and they will contact every single person named in those documents. The commissioner's office informed me this morning that the team have so far made eight arrests and undertaken numerous interviews.\" Miliband welcomed the terms of the inquiry. \"The revelations of the past week have shocked the whole country and the public now rightly expect those of us in this house \u2013 those who represent them \u2013 to provide not just an echo for that shock, but the leadership necessary to start putting things right,\" he said. \"People like the Dowler family and other members of the public who are the innocent victims of phone hacking deserve a full and comprehensive inquiry. They need us to get on with the inquiry, to make it fully comprehensive and to get to the truth.\""
