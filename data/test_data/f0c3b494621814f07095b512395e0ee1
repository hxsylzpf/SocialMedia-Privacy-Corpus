  "content": "A tumultuous year is ending on a high note for the UK music industry \u2013 in particular for Simon Cowell and Leonard Cohen, who have ended it with a great big record-breaking Hallelujah. So it turns out people aren't, after all, averse to parting with their money to pay for music, not even for MP3s \u2013 at least if it's pop music or music connected to a talent show. Even the runner-up, Jeff Buckley's version of Hallelujah, wouldn't have reached such heights without The X Factor. After all, only by paying for the download could people attempt to knock Alexandra Burke's version off the number one slot. It was in 2008 that we truly realised what living in a global economy entails, with one nation's financial crisis making the rest of the world's finances collapse like a house of cards. The music industry, though, has experienced the erosion of borders for years, watching helplessly as peer-to-peer and illegal downloading sites flourish in countries outside its jurisdiction. This has been the year that the record labels did something about it by getting into bed with internet service providers, mobile phone companies and ad-supported websites, instead of putting all its efforts into battling piracy with legislation. In the past six months we've seen the launch of Nokia Comes With Music, MySpace Music and Datz, to name just a few, and there are more like this to come early in the new year. What are the music industry predictions for 2009? It seems no one, least of all the labels and the companies behind these launches, has a clue. If consumers end up downloading thousands of \"free\" tracks for their Nokia Comes With Music handset, will Nokia have to pay out of its own pocket to compensate the majors? Will consumers who download excessively have their Comes With Music service cut off? If so, how many downloads would Nokia consider excessive? We'll find out next year. The details of the deals that the labels have struck with companies like Nokia are shrouded in secrecy. One thing we know is that deals like these are usually sealed with a big up-front payment to the major labels as a bottom-line guarantee. The onus will then be on Nokia to provide details of what people download to the labels, whose responsibility it will be to distribute the up-front payment and any payment from Nokia thereafter to the artists according to these downloading figures \u2013 retrospectively. Naturally, many musicians and songwriters are curious to see how much of this money will show up on their royalty statements next year or the year after \u2013 such payments can take over a year to get distributed. Universal recently declared that it is bringing in \"tens of millions of dollars\" from YouTube, while an industry source close to the label said Universal will probably book nearly $100m in revenue from video streaming this year. Meanwhile, Warner Music is withdrawing its content from YouTube, stating that YouTube isn't compensating recording artists, songwriters, labels and publishers fairly. Does this mean that Warner's deal has different terms than Universal's? So far, the income for artists and songwriters from YouTube has been negligible. Next year, Behind the music will look into how much of these revenues filter down to the music's creators, and how the labels that have acquired equity in MySpace Music will compensate the creators who provide the content on the site. In another notable event of 2008, the EU made a U-turn (sorry) on copyright extension for performers and decided it might not be such a bad idea after all. Next year, we'll see if it puts its money where its mouth is. We also saw the launch of UK Music, whose primary goal is to get the labels, publishers and music creators to speak with one voice. We'll see if they can. Yes, the coming months will bring answers to a slew of questions, but the most important and interesting ones will be the answers to these two: How do you, the music consumer, want your music? And how can the music industry \u2013 and the artists \u2013 convince you to get it legally? Now, more than ever, the power lies with you."
