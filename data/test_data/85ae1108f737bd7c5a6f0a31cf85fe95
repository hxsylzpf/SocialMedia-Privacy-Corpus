  "content": "Another Premier League footballer has become the latest high profile individual to take out a privacy injunction to prevent details of an alleged extra-marital affair being made public. The footballer, who cannot be named, is married and allegedly had an affair with Kimberley West, an 18-year-old who claims she had a three-month relationship with the highly paid sports star after meeting in a nightclub. The footballer becomes the latest high profile figure to obtain a gagging order to prevent potentially embarrassing details about their private life being published. The high court granted the order on Thursday. Separately, it emerged yesterday that an MP was rumoured to have taken out a superinjunction, allegedly to prevent embarrassing details about his life being exposed. The MP, whose identity nor party membership can be named, joins others including a TV star, a leading actor, and other Premier League football players to have obtained a gagging order against the media. The respected BBC journalist Andrew Marr last month revealed that he too had obtained a wide-ranging superinjunction to protect details of his private life being made public. The Conservative MP Matthew Offord on Thursday raised the apparent increased use of injunctions in the House of Commons. He said: \"There has been much public discussion on the increasing use of superinjunctions and the ability of judges to decide policy instead of elected parliamentarians. Is the leader of the house aware of the anomaly this creates, if, as has been rumoured, a member of this place seeks a superinjunction to prevent discussion of their activities?\" Sir George Young, the leader of the house, acknowledged that it is a \"very important issue about how we balance, on the one hand, an individual's right to privacy and, on the other hand, the freedom of expression and transparency\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
