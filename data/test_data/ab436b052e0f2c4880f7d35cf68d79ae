  "content": "Lo-fi @storiesofiran A US-born lawyer heads to Iran to uncover her roots, sharing experiences and observations in English captions. Some lovely shots, like this one, but don't expect professional photography. The pictures are more like polaroids adorning a sketchbook. Village Life @salarpolad Mohammad, a shepherd in a remote village in northeast Iran, is already an Instagram star in his native country. He has nearly 38,000 followers, most of them urbanites. The account was reportedly set up by a brother who went to Tehran to study with the support of Mohammad's earnings from the farm. Upon completing his PhD and earning his first paycheck, he bought Mohammad a cellphone. Salarpolad is a combination of the names of two of his dogs, Salar and Polad, who have passed away. The photos offers scenes of rural life without the cultural filters, perhaps not for the squeamish. For them I have picked a few pretty ones. A Step @nafasngo This account depicts hands-on ways Iranians can lessen air pollution. Once upon a time in Tabriz @sharifaee A young photographer captures life in the northwest corner of the country. A Reverie @mehran.farid In this intersection of photography and art, I keep thinking back to this essay: Tehran and the Dream. Lots of favorites here. Doors of Perception @bahamorshedi Lots of beautiful old doors, some windows, and other fading architectural detail. A novelist with a good eye. Le Quotidien @everydayiran A popular, steady feed of photos curated from all over the country. The Writing on the Wall @deev_r A sampling of Iran's graffiti and street art. Northern Soul @aminrahmanii Another visual account of northern life, this time from Qazvin in the northeast."
