  "content": "Digital media: founder, Facebook The biographies of Zuckerberg aren't exactly spilling over with excited \u00adstories about the music he loved while a \u00adstudent at Harvard. But it's worth remembering that in, say, \u00adFebruary 2004 there were just 650 people \u00adregistered on Facebook. Today, there are well in excess of 500 million active users, who share everything \u2013 including the music they've loved for years, the music they've only just heard and the music they really want to hear next \u2013 with their friends. In reality, then, it is \u00adZuckerberg's creation that is driving people towards new music. Of all the time spent on the internet in the US last year, 4.1% was on Google while 11.6% was on Facebook. This has only just begun."
