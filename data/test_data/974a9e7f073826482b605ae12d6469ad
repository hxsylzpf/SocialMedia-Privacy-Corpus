  "content": "After Benji's triumphant Twitter trip a couple of weeks ago, we've decided to do the same thing again, but a little further away. Last stop, Paris: this time: San Francisco. This isn't quite the same kind of day trip; having moved here six months ago for my partner's work, I've spent lots of time doing the kind of things you do when you've just moved to a new town - finding the supermarket, good local take-outs for tired evenings, and new favourite brunch places for weekends. But what I haven't really done - at all - yet, is feel like I've 'done' San Francisco. I've walked various neighbourhoods and explored various landmarks - but couldn't say I've captured the heart of the city - not yet, I don't think. So I was looking for your help for the perfect San Francisco day: breakfast places, lunches, dinner: where to go, what to see, and how to get there. I'll be twittering the whole thing live today (Tuesday 24 February) - though because we are in Pacific Time (GMT -8), we've garnered a few more suggestions beforehand, and hope that some people - the international readers and the insomniacs - will be able to throw me a bone if I get stuck. As just when I'm finishing my lunch, everyone in the UK will be going to bed. Drop suggestions for any of those things by following me (twitter.com/annapickard) for the duration of the trip (and, please, excuse the rest of my ramblings, I've been doing this for a few years and occasionally forget my manners now eleventy-billion people are there, too), and sending a message to me by starting the tweet with @annapickard and, if possible adding #Twitrip to it. Places, dishes, entertainments or views - anything that could make up the perfect San Franciscan day out, please. And so (because apparently you can stick 'twit' in the middle of anything and call it a word, now) with little more ado - let the communal exploratwitoriation continue. \u2022 Follow Anna's tweets at twitter.com/annapickard and see her @replies here. You can also see Anna's San Francisco TwiTrip and past TwiTrips here.
