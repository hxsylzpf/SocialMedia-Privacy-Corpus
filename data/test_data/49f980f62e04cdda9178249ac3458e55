  "content": "Thousands of patients are feared to have been harmed after the NHS lost more than half a million pieces of confidential medical correspondence, including test results and treatment plans. In one of the biggest losses of sensitive clinical information in the NHS's 69-year history, more than 500,000 pieces of patient data sent between GPs and hospitals went undelivered over the five years from 2011 to 2016. The mislaid documents, which range from screening results to blood tests to diagnoses, failed to reach their intended recipients because the company meant to ensure their delivery mistakenly stored them in a warehouse. NHS England has quietly launched an inquiry to discover how many patients have been affected. So far 2,500 cases that require further investigation to discover potential for harm have been identified. The NHS is spending millions of pounds paying doctors to assess the scale of the medical impact. It is also undertaking a clinical review of patients who have died since the loss of documents was discovered in March 2016 to examine whether delays in material reaching GPs played any part in any patient's death. The correspondence included the results of blood and urine tests, and of biopsies and screening tests for diseases including cancer. It also included letters containing details of patients' visits to hospital, including to oncology clinics and information about what they had been diagnosed with after visiting A&amp;E. Other paperwork that went astray included summaries of the care patients had received while in hospital. Some involved material related to cases of child protection. In total, 708,000 pieces of correspondence were undelivered. However, 200,000 of these were not clinically relevant as they were temporary change of address forms. Of the remaining documents, only 41 were from Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. NHS England secretly assembled a 50-strong team of administrators, based in Leeds, to clear up the mess created by NHS Shared Business Services (NHS SBS), who mislaid the documents. The private company, co-owned by the Department of Health and the French firm Sopra Steria, was working as a kind of internal postal service within the NHS in England until March last year. The clear-up team is being led by Jill Matthews, the managing director of the primary-care support services arm of NHS England. Documents detailing the team's work, seen by the Guardian, reveal it has finally returned the lost material to 7,700 GP surgeries, and assessed how many potential incidents of harm may have occurred at each practice. They show that GP surgeries up and down England have been affected, with some facing a few dozen cases of potential harm arose from missing correspondence. GPs have so far been paid \u00a32.2m to examine returned correspondence and cross-check it with other material in patients' medical records, although the internal documents show that some have said that they are too busy to do so and others have asked surgery administrators to do it. The British Medical Association warned that some patients might have taken extra drugs unnecessarily or had the diagnosis of their illness delayed because of the blunder. \"This is a very serious incident, it should never have happened and it's an example of what happens when the NHS tries to cut costs by inviting private companies to do work which they don't do properly, the private company in this case being NHS Shared Business Services,\" said Richard Vautrey, chair of the BMA's GPs committee and a family doctor in Yorkshire. He added: \"Undoubtedly, there will be cases where patients have been seen by their home GP without [the GP having] the information from previous consultations or tests being their file \u2013 so they may not know whether antibiotics have been prescribed to a patient or whether tests and investigations have been done. \"That might mean repeat prescriptions, which would be unnecessary, as they have been taken before. And it might mean delay in diagnosis. If that happened it's at best an inconvenience to the patient, and at worst there's a risk of patient harm.\" Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \"This is an absolute scandal. For a company partly owned by the Department of Health and a private company to fail to deliver half a million NHS letters, many of which contain information critical to patient care, is astonishing. \"Patient safety will have been put seriously at risk as a result of this staggering incompetence. The news is heartbreaking for the families involved and it will be scarcely believable for these hospitals and GPs who are doing their best to deliver services despite the neglect of the government.\" He said that Hunt's statement to MPs last July was \"perfunctory, complacent and evasive, failing to reveal any of the catastrophic detail of how 500,000 pieces of correspondence including test and screening results and pathways following hospital treatment, had failed to be delivered and were in fact languishing unopened in a warehouse\". Ashworth added: \"Instead, Mr Hunt glibly told parliament that 'some correspondence in the mail redirection service has not reached the intended recipients'. For a secretary of state who supposedly has transparency as his watchword this looks like he has tried to hide the scandal from patients and the public. It's totally unacceptable.\" Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: \"This looks, to me, like a cover-up. Jeremy Hunt has serious questions to answer, especially his deliberately evasive statement to parliament. Jeremy Hunt often talks about an NHS more open about patient safety failings since the Mid Staffs scandal. His deeds don't match his words. \"This is a staggering loss of personal and private data, this colossal loss of vital material that may have been absolutely crucial to a patient's treatment. I worry that while all this correspondence, including test results, has gathered dust, patients had been put at risk. People could have died as a result of this.\" An NHS England spokeswoman said: \"Some correspondence forwarded to SBS between 2011-2016 was not redirected or forwarded by them to GP surgeries or linked to the medical record when the sender sent correspondence to the wrong GP or the patient changed practice. \"A team including clinical experts has reviewed that old correspondence and it has now all been delivered wherever possible to the correct practice. SBS have expressed regret for this situation.\" A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"The department and NHS England have been completely transparent while work has been ongoing to resolve this issue, with patient safety as ever our first priority. In July, the health secretary informed parliament and in September, senior civil servants updated the public accounts committee.\" This article was amended on 27 February 2017 to add information about the number of documents pertaining to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland."
