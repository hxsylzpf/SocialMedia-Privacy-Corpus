  "content": "I received the most precious gift I could have ever hoped for when Theresa May announced that my son Gary McKinnon would not be extradited to the US for alleged computer hacking. Our absolute joy and sense of relief felt by this decision cannot be overestimated. When our then home secretary had the courage to use the Human Rights Act to protect Gary and to simultaneously announce the introduction of new rules, so that anyone physically in the UK when their alleged crime occurred could now ostensibly be tried here. However, much of the decision-making in this regard has unfortunately been left in the hands of the CPS and judges, who tend to approve extradition to the US regardless of a proposed inhumane sentence or lack of evidence. The extradition decision today on Lauri Love, a 31-year-old with Asperger's syndrome accused by the US of hacking, was the first real test case of May's new system, established with the intention of providing protection from unnecessary extradition. It fell at the first hurdle. Judge Nina Tempia ruled that Lauri will be extradited. This protection is much needed, as the Human Rights Act, which does often come into play to prevent deportation to home countries, is rarely ever used by our courts to prevent extradition to the US, even in cases of highly vulnerable British citizens. The decision on Gary, who also has Asperger's, was a momentous one, and the introduction of the safeguards gave us all hope that other vulnerable computer geeks living in the UK would in the future be much more likely to stand trial in Britain. No American has been extradited for a crime that took place when they were physically on American soil. In those cases they are automatically tried in their own country, as we hoped British citizens would now be. So what's gone wrong? Once again we are seeing the sight of a vulnerable man facing the threat of extradition and an obscene 99-year prison sentence, as his life hangs in the balance. There is no doubt that for Lauri Love's parents, even the threat of losing their son is a living hell. Gary's dad died after May's decision and there is no doubt of the strain our 10-year fight put on him. Fortunately he lived to see his son walk free and for that we are hugely grateful. Lauri's dad is a prison chaplain. He has a heart condition and a huge toll is being taken on his health, as it is on Lauri's. Lauri's mum is a teacher who works with prisoners \u2013 it is ironic that people who have devoted their lives to helping others are now in this terrifying position. When I was at my lowest ebb good people out there instinctively knew I needed help, and help me they did. We came together to create a force of good to save Gary, and against all the odds we did just that. I've always believed that good exists in even the darkest of corners and just knowing that it can win against the most powerful odds is a heartening thing. Although Gary is now safe, Lauri is not and he and his family desperately need help. It may be a naive dream but it would be the most wonderful thing if the American prosecutors and our government could find it in their hearts to give Lauri and his family closure by dropping or blocking the extradition request and ruling that the CPS should try Lauri in the UK if he has a case to answer. Simple acts of compassion and kindness are what bring people and nations together, of that there is no doubt. For British people to see that we are given the same rights as our American cousins would be something to behold and would show the vulnerable that they matter. Asking to be tried by your own peers is surely a reasonable request. A young American computer genius, Aaron Swartz, was driven to a state of mental torment and sadly took his own life when facing a lengthy prison sentence. Prosecutors in the US, Aaron's own country, would not allow him to plea bargain, and the increasing mental torment became too much for Aaron to bear. Our world badly needs some fairytale endings, rather than the unnecessary risk of the suicide of our geeks, our vulnerable, our geniuses who are after all, our future When Gary was under threat he was permanently nervous and said that he'd forgotten what happiness felt like, but fortunately humanity shone on him and saved his life. Seeing him smile for the first time in years was truly something to behold. The support through difficult times means so much to someone whose life is in limbo. The good that exists in our world and the power of the people in it can and does achieve miracles. Please help Lauri to achieve that miracle and to remain in the UK, close to his family. Every letter sent, comment made and article written, every tweet tweeted, phone call made, and demo attended helps to keep the spirit alive and contributes to hope that his freedom is on the horizon. Lauri has not been convicted of any crime and extradition is a cruel punishment of man with Asperger's who is after all, innocent until proven guilty, hopefully by a jury of his peers. We burned our witches. Don't crucify our geeks. \u2022 This article was updated on Friday 16 September at 7.30pm, following the verdict"
