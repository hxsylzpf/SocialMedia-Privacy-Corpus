  "content": "Well before it all began at noon, as the stage filled up with dignitaries and the Mall filled up with cheering people, the rolling news channels were already vying for the love of the viewing audience waiting to see the 44th US president sworn into office. Fox News quickly established heavyweight political commentary on the whole proceeding, as well as fashion-forward commentary on the outfits of Malia and Sasha Obama: \"They look like little ladies, don't they? In their long \u2026 um \u2026 coats?\" wondered one weighty commenter, grasping for the correct drapery term for the garments. \"Yep, coats\" confirmed his sidekick. And admiring the academic qualifications of the new first lady: \"I am going to officially proclaim \u2026 Um \u2026 and this is just one man's view \u2026 that Michelle Obama looks stunning. Yep. She really looks after herself.\" CNN were meanwhile promising something almost as new-media ground-shaking as their election night hologram - itself hailed the world over as the world's most pointless rolling news gimmick. \"We can exclusively reveal,\" said Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper, breathlessly and repeatedly, \"We have commissioned a satellite picture of the oathswearing - so we can see how the inauguration would be viewed from SPACE!\". And then promised to bring it to us as soon as they could. We moved to the edge of our seats. And in the meantime, while waiting for the extra-terrestrial view, we flicked around and watched the serious news anchors celebrity-spotting on stage. \"There's Aretha Franklin - the 'first lady of soul' - there are three first ladies on this stage: Aretha Franklin's the first Lady of Soul\" - proving that there's nothing that can kill a witty comment as fast as repeating it on CNN just in case anyone didn't catch how witty it was the first time around. And very occasionally, a small, human touch: shots of a moving van outside the East door of the White House. CNN managed to catch it when there were people beetling around the back of it. Fox, by the time they cut back, only got a van. \"And the Bushes are moving their clothes and their tchotchkes (an American term for knick-knacks, basically). Those sitting at home with the captions on had the added bonus of seeing a confused subtitler describe the Bushes as having to move out their 'Trotskys', which might have changed the place of Bush in history, if it were true. It wasn't. On Twitter, messages marked with a \"#current\" were received and sorted by Al Gore's TV channel before being put up in a common people's commentary on the ceremony. \"Cheney's transition into Dr Strangelove is complete,\" Someone tweeted, as the outgoing VP was wheeled onto the stage, due to back problems (from either moving boxes or bending over the shredder, opinion was divided on the cause depending on who you were) Other messages were bounding with purest excitement. \"Yes. We. DID!\" came several, as the president-elect walked onto the stage. \"I've got 4 vid streams running, and it's still not enough\" said another. Topping them all was a Twitterer called TymJones: \"I've gotten older, and the joy of Christmas morning has started to fade. THIS MOMENT HAS BROUGHT IT BACK! I'm so happy!!!!!!!!\" - although we can only assume in a \"childlike joy\" way rather than a celebration of the coming-of-the-messiah way. Twitter, liveblogs and television commentary alike questioned the naming convention as \"George Walker Bush\" was welcomed on stage, followed sometime after by: \"Ladies and gentlemen: Barack H Obama!\" H? So much for claiming back the name Hussain for universal use, they all said: Hussains all over the world must have felt their shoulders sag a little at the copping out (though they might have cheered up 20 minutes later when his full name was used in the oath) And then cross-cultural misunderstandings abounded on worldwide multimedia when Aretha Franklin stood up to sing God Save The Queen, but got the words wrong. (Sorry - it's the conventional British joke that must always be made upon hearing My Country 'Tis Of Thee.) She did it, though, in inimitable Aretha fashion, 66-years-old, with a full gospel choir singing 'Ringringringringring!\" at appropriate moments behind her. \"I hope the hat at least gets to sing a verse\" someone tweeted. And it could have, at that - in fact the bow atop it should have had a hat all its own. As the crowd hushed to listen to four world-class musicians play a new piece by John \"That guy who wrote the theme from Star Wars\" Williams, the news anchors, scared of silence - or, worse still, allowing people to listen to the music and somehow involve themselves in the ceremony - talked in short punchy clich\u00e9s over the music. Part way through, at 12 noon precisely, a big sign flashed up on CNN: \"FACT: Barack Obama became president: the constitution states his term begins at noon even without oath\" Man, someone always has to try and call it first, don't they? As the oath was taken, people rejoiced in their own individual ways in various streams on twitter: \"I couldn't feel more inspired to put both feet squarely into adulthood.\" was one \"Ah the end of an error [sic]. I feel a dark shadow has lifted off the capitol. Oh wait, that's because Cheney is sitting down.\" The speech started. Certain tweeting celebrities (and many others) cheered the references to the importance of science and the existence of atheists. Others cheered in general, or merely followed their own agenda: \"Best President since Martin Sheen?\" - said another. \"I hope this is over in time for me to catch All My Children,\" said one more person joining wholeheartedly in the passage of history. And this is where the internet comes into its own - in the ability to pay listen out for your own area of interest, large or small, and feel free to give your opinion on exactly how correct (or not) that was. \"I am offended as a libertarian \u2026 I am sorry, but the question IS whether government is too big!\" said one CurrentTV twitterer, determined not to let the excitement of the day stand in the way of maintaining a healthy debate on personal crusades. During the speech, the swichover of the White House website to a new shiny web 2.0 special, blogs, galleries and all, caused a ripple of excitement among online communities, though most put off having a proper look until after the speech itself was over. And, when it was - during the poem reading that proved once more through polite applause and puzzled internet commentary that people don't really like Official National Poetry that much (apart from a few pleased and dissenting voices: \"Inaugural poem - 'We encounter each other in words.' So true for us here on twitter,\" said one) - the net came to life with reaction, debate, and people seeking to capture their moment. Flickr was busy creating an open pool of people at, watching, and giving their reaction to the Inauguration. A tag cloud created by one flickr user of Obama's speech, highlighting the words that were used most often - New; Nation; World; Common. It said. An hour after the oaths and the speechifying had finished, we sat and patiently waited for that promised satellite image. If they were saving it up this long, we reckoned, it must be something special. \"It's going to be\" said Wolf, once more \"REALLY cool.\" The new president sat down to an inaugural lunch with congress. \"The recipe page for today's lunch has been the most visited of the whole inauguration site!\" said Senator Diane Feinstein, intriguingly, in her introduction. And all the while, as the cameras left congress to a private lunch, the livebloggers on their webpages, the twitterers in their own little worlds, the anchors chuntered away in the studios: There goes President Bush's plane, they said. Here are the crowds lining the route of the parade yet to come. And \u2026 \"We're told there was some cloud cover, but you just wait - it's going to be VERY COOL\" said Wolf Blitzen, yet again, sounding like he was trying hard to reassure someone - though whether it was us or himself was hard to decide. Lunch ended, chilly crowds said happy things, bundled up in warm \u2026 coats? (Yep, coats!) behind barriers lining the roads, preparing for the motorcade. At home and in offices, people turned over their televisions in time for those soaps, and let the live streaming coverage from Washington fall back among the work-filled windows on their computer screen. But those who trust in Wolf sat, and waited, bottoms sore from perching so close to the edge of their chairs: because we weren't moving anywhere until we'd seen this thing From Outer Space. Because even though it was over two hours ago - and even though we'd seen it from every considerable angle already, and even though there was all that cloud cover he'd been told about: it was, we still believed, going to be COOL. [Update, three hours after the ceremony: Still waiting.] [Five hours later: satellite image spotted! It is like google maps but with extra added ants. Brilliant. Glad we waited. Can I go to the toilet now?]"
