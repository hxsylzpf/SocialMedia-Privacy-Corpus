  "content": "My virtual desktop is incredibly messy and my actual desktop is much the same \u2013 the surface almost hidden in a pile of receipts and admin stuck together with baby food and spilled tea. As a writer, I don't often plan, and my drafts are a right dog's dinner until very late on in the process, when a story and a structure emerge. Or that is how it was with my first two novels. A Kind of Intimacy was really difficult because it was the first. And Cold Light was really difficult because it was the difficult second one. With the one I'm working on now (The Friday Gospels) everything is appearing in a very orderly fashion. I had the structure in mind from the very start (although this new and tidy writing process didn't, as you can see, improve the chaos here). Maybe I'm just about getting the hang of it now; it's too early to tell. I have a rough idea of what number four is going to be, and I'm terrified. I'm terrified because it isn't going to be first person. And I'm not sure I know how to do what I want to do yet. I can't think about it too much right now \u2013 The Friday Gospels is taking up all of my attention. The ideas and words don't necessarily come easily to me, but I don't do much of anything apart from writing so I expect myself to get on with it and put the hours in. I don't have a family photo as my desktop image, I have one from a site called Mormongags. There are lots of family photographs stashed away in folders on the desktop and even a picture of me reading at the Manchester literature festival with my baby son under one arm. But I do look at my kids quite a lot of the time. I don't forget their faces when I'm not with them, but when I'm working, I'm working. The image alludes to the way that Mormons used to teach their young girls about sex before marriage. The girls would get a cupcake and the boys would get to take the cupcake and suck off the frosting. The girls got their soggy cakes back, and quickly found they were unable to give them to anyone else. No one wants a cake that's been sucked, do they? Moral: don't let the boys eat your icing. I grew up in the church of the Latter-Day Saints and attended lessons like these until I was about 15. The cupcake scene helped me get going with The Friday Gospels. I put the picture up there because it makes me laugh \u2013 and it would make a lot of practising Mormons laugh, too \u2013 they're not blind to the daftnesses in their own culture. And while I've rejected the religion, for a long time I felt disconnected from who I was. In-jokes like these have helped me feel more comfortable about my culture, my family heritage. And of course, if you laugh at something it can't hurt you any more. My upbringing has influenced my fiction massively. If I hadn't been brought up LDS, I wouldn't have ended up a writer. I am certain about that. The connection is something that's hovered over me my whole life, and I am only just now getting to grips with it. My preoccupation with truth and reliability, unstable identities caused by slippery language, isolation, reading between the lines, mistranslation and misunderstandings are a very clear hangover from being told I was a member of the only true church in the entire world, restored on to the earth by some magical acts of translation and revelation, and led by a person who could not and would not lie. And then I found out that this was not so. The Friday Gospels isn't about me or my family, but it does show, I think, some of what can happen when you're told the world is orderly and certain and then you discover that it isn't. My motives aren't to hurt or embarrass anyone, or to criticise anyone else's way of being in the world. They are to explore what's important to me, and to tell a good story. People who don't know me won't care, and people who do know me know I write out of curiosity rather than malice. It's going to be a good novel, not propaganda. As for why I was doing a public reading with my baby under my arm, it was for the Bugged launch, a brilliant project devised and edited by Jo Bell. The book featured pieces of writing that had been inspired by overheard snatches of conversation \u2013 and all the Bugged writers did their overhearings on the same day. Which, by a miracle of poor timing on my part, happened to be the day my son arrived in the world. Like I say, when I'm working, I'm working. But it seemed only fair to bring him and let him share some of the glory of the launch. I didn't think I'd own a Kindle \u2013 I went all \"threatened librarian\" about it when they first came out. But a friend of mine bought me one for my birthday last year and now I am never without it. My house is stuffed full of books and we just can't take in any more. So now, if I want to buy a new one, I choose the ebook over the paper version. It's a brilliant thing. I hardly ever read them on my laptop, though \u2013 the glare is a bit nasty after a day of writing, and you don't get that with the Kindle itself. I also have the app on my iPhone, and read short stories on it while I'm feeding my baby or waiting for trains. The \"Bank Job\" document on my desktop is a manuscript appraisal report I wrote. The novel was a really funny, original story about a bank robbery. It needed a bit of editing and the writer came to me for an opinion on how to approach the next draft. Writing appraisals and teaching is the other bit of what I do \u2013 hence the handouts and some module mark spreadsheets on my desktop, too. I've been the Writing Fellow at the University of Manchester, where I studied for my own MA in creative writing in 2005, and I also teach undergraduates at the University of Central Lancashire and do standalone workshops and project work in all sorts of places, including prisons. I find teaching really helpful for my own practice in a way I haven't fully understood yet. I think I'm a very messy, instinctive writer \u2013 teaching forces me to theorise about what I do, and extract some observations (not rules) that I can pass on to others. Mainly though, I always say I teach close reading and editing; the writing they have to do on their own. I'm constantly impressed and humbled by the hard work, originality and sheer bloody-mindedness of my students. It's heartening to be around people who are struggling to make their writing better, the same as I am. Gary is one of the characters in The Friday Gospels and \"Gary's Tea\" was the working title of the novel. He's been away for a long time, and on the day the novel describes, he goes home to his mother, who's cooking him something special. And apart from that, my lips are sealed. He's not just languishing on my desktop, though. I email him to myself and keep him in my Dropbox, too. I may be messy, but I am not daft. I'm not very attached to my machines, just what's inside them. I work on my laptop, my husband's laptop, a breaking-down desktop, my phone, on paper, my computer at Manchester. I used to be really precious about having my own space and a big stretch of time. Now that I have children, it's impossible for me to sustain that way of thinking. I just get on with it. Things like Dropbox and iPhones are really handy. I am on Twitter too much, though. I blog, too, and forum and Facebook. I think I'm a fairly shy person and I need lots of time on my own, but blogging and Twitter and emailing feed my need for chat and inanity during the day. I get the gossip, the quizzes, the office politics and the screaming fits without having to leave the house. I also tweet with my Writing Smithy head on, so a gadget like TweetDeck is essential to keep everything straight. Writing Smithy is the consultancy I run with Sarah Hymas. We mentor writers who are looking for one-on-one guidance as they develop their work, their process and their careers. She works with poets, I work with novelists, and we supervise and support each other. The filming of the Culture Show special on the 12 best new novelists was interesting. There are lots of scenes to do with television and the making of it in Cold Light \u2013 but I'd never actually been filmed or been in any kind of studio before. For A Kind of Intimacy, it was an amazing boost, although being on telly was terrifying and the writing came really slowly around World Book Night. Dealing with that was exhausting and I'm glad it isn't the sort of thing that happens to me too often. The \"ego\" pictures on the desktop are (embarrassingly) screengrabs of the Amazon ranking of A Kind of Intimacy when it went into the bestseller charts after The Culture Show, to show my husband, who wouldn't know (or care) what an Amazon ranking was if it came up and bit him. I'm blushing. I did have the good grace to call it \"ego\" though. The photo of the basket of apricots was for a blog post I did a while ago about Madame Bovary, one of my favourite books. She gets dumped in a letter hidden at the bottom of a basket of apricots. That's a photo of Keith Moon for my blog, too. He's brilliant. I like Keith and I like the Who \u2013 they remind me of a good friend I had once who was near-obsessed with them, and whenever I listen to the music I think of her. I like a song with a story in it, and the Who are really good at that, too. I need to have quiet when I write, though \u2013 if not silence, then at least no other voices around me. I don't listen to music all that much. Sometimes I wonder if that bit of my brain is missing. But really it is because I can't read and listen to music at the same time \u2013 and I am always reading."
