  "content": "Twitter has been forced to pull two adverts using its Vine looping video platform after objections were raised by epilepsy campaigners. The ads consisted of six seconds of flashing video, were \"massively dangerous\" to those with photosensitive epilepsy, according to charity Epilepsy Action. The videos were designed to advertise Twitter's #DiscoverMusic campaign, aimed at attracting musicians to the social network, pitching it as a good way for artists to publicise their latest tracks. The adverts were online for 18 hours before being pulled Friday morning. According to Advertising Standards Agency regulations, marketing messages, even those advertising features of the operator's website, must not include visual effects that could affect those with photosensitive epilepsy. Twitter declined to comment. Epilepsy Action's deputy chief executive, Simon Wigglesworth, told the BBC that: \"Twitter's ads were dangerous to people living with photosensitive epilepsy.\" \"87 people are diagnosed with epilepsy every day and that first seizure can often come out of nowhere. For a huge corporation like Twitter to take that risk was irresponsible.\" Users affected by flashing videos can turn off Twitter's autoplay feature within the app, to avoid them playing without being tapped on.",
