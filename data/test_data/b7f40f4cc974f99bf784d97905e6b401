  "content": "Activision has described Call of Duty: Elite as \"one of our most ambitious and exciting undertakings\". The vast social networking system has been designed to revolutionise the way Call of Duty players meet, engage and compete online \u2013 and they'll have to pay a monthly subscription fee for the privilege. It's a huge and controversial undertaking for the publisher, and a fascinating attempt to monetise the world of online shooter games. But how did the idea come about, and where is it going? To find out, we spoke to Activision Publishing's chief executive, Eric Hirshberg. What are the origins of Call of Duty: Elite? It started with us observing the number of hours people were spending playing multiplayer. This game has a certain long tail in that regard, and it's a year-round thing, it's not just focused on launch. We want to supercharge that multiplayer experience \u2013 it's as simple as that. Our culture has become more connected and there are a growing number of technologies to bring people together around the things they love. We're taking a lot of those patterns and applying them in a very focused way around Call of Duty. What have been been the key influences on the design and structure of Elite? Have you looked mostly to social networking sites, or to digital content services such as Netflix? The influences have been very wide. On one hand, we've looked at social media. We've taken a lot of pages from those playbooks in terms of giving people the ability to easily upload and create user-generated content, giving people lots of forums to post messages, giving people the ability to curate their friends and the people they connect with \u2026 All of that stuff is clearly influenced by trends in social media. But we also looked at complex financial sites \u2013 we asked: what's the best in class for presenting very deep statistical information to people in a very user-friendly way? A lot of sports sites, especially fantasy football sites, do that very well. We've also looked at other entertainment services outside gaming to get ideas \u2013 Netflix, iTunes, that sort of thing. Elements of the Elite service will be free to all Call of Duty players \u2013 can you elaborate on what those are? That hasn't been finalised. We're not revealing the specifics of the business model until the summer. But I will tell you there's a dual strategy in play. One element is to simply give back to our fans, and to help solidify their relationship with Call of Duty, and we think the deeper connection people feel with the community of players, the deeper connection they'll have with the game itself. The other part is, obviously, if we're able to create new services that have real value to people, then of course they'll be willing to pay for them. So there will be elements where, if you really want to supercharge the experience, you'll be able to do that. You've introduced this Facebook Groups-like element, allowing players to find and play against competitors with similar interests outside the game. Is this all about creating a more welcoming environment for more casual gamers who have been reticent about trying online gaming? Absolutely. If you look at the statistics, people spend an average of 58 minutes per day playing Black Ops in multiplayer. The average Facebook user spends 55 minutes per day on Facebook \u2013 so people are really engaged with this on an amazing level. And right now, you don't have a tremendous amount of control over that multiplayer experience, you don't have a lot of control over who you play against or connecting with or finding particular friends, or the ability to play against people of a similar skill level, or interests, or geography - and Elite gives you all of those tools. It gives you control \u2013 and that's what social networks are all about. But a big part of what stops people playing online is that they don't want to play against strangers \u2013 and yet their friends are never online at the same time. This is what EA's Autolog system for Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit cleverly addressed: it allows people to compete against their friends' times and scores asynchronously. How much of that will be in Elite? What Elite will do is give you the ability to curate a list of friends, and people you are interested in playing with and following \u2013 and you'll be constantly alerted to their progress, when they're playing. There's the online game, then there's online fame and we want to give people the ability to enjoy both. You'll be able to mine masses of data from user activity on Elite \u2013 will this be used to shape future Call of Duty game content and design decisions? Absolutely. From a pure product development standpoint, if Elite gains traction and is successful, we'll have the best feedback loop imaginable in terms of what's working and what isn't, what's frustrating people, and what could be better \u2013 we'll be using that dialogue with our fans constantly. I think all great software companies have that feedback \u2013 I can't count the number of times I've been using the iTunes Store or similar and there's an update, and the one thing that was bugging me, they somehow heard that and got it fixed. That's something I'm looking forward to with Call of Duty. Is development of Elite an ongoing service? Will it evolve? Yes, as with Facebook and iTunes, a product like this is never really done \u2013 you're constantly evolving and you're constantly responding to feedback, patterns and trends and making it better. There will be a tremendous ongoing investment in continual improvements.",
