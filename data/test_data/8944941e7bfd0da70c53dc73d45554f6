  "content": "Twitter has relaunched its website and mobile apps to give users the opportunity to showcase their own photos. In what appears to be a bid to take on Facebook, users' new-look Twitter profiles will have more visual interest, with their photo stream now shown on their page. The stream will also appear below their most recent tweets. Users' profile pictures will move from being a small icon at top left to a large header photo at the top of the Twitter stream. The move is in line with the company's plan to make the website more of a destination page. Facebook enlarged the display size of its images last year as part of a major overhaul that included the introduction of a timeline, streaming users' posts from the day they joined. Twitter said its move was designed to \"make your presence on Twitter more meaningful\". The new look will apply to Twitter's website, its iPhone and Android apps and its new iPad app.",
