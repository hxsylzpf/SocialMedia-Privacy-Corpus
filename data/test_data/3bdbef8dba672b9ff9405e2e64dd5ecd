  "content": "Virgin Atlantic's senior lawyer will give evidence to the Leveson inquiry next week after it emerged that an employee leaked the flight details of Sienna Miller, Ashley Cole and other celebrities to a global picture agency. Jillian Brady, general counsel for Richard Branson's airline, will be quizzed on the leaks to Big Pictures at the inquiry into press ethics on Tuesday. The UK chief executive of Big Pictures will also submit written evidence on the leaks, which were first reported by the Guardian in April. Giles Crown, the solicitor who represented the Bowles family, whose 11-year-old son was killed in a coach crash in Switzerland in March, is also giving evidence on Tuesday about media intrusion following the tragedy. The inquiry will also on Tuesday hear evidence from Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat MP, and David Mellor, the former cabinet minister responsible for the press, whose private life became the subject of lurid tabloid headlines in the early 1990s. Lamb reportedly told the business secretary, Vince Cable, that someone linked to News Corporation made \"veiled threats\" that his party would be \"done over\" if it did not back Rupert Murdoch's bid for BSkyB. Tim Colbourne, Lid Dem special advisor to deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, will also appear on Tuesday. Clegg told the inquiry earlier this month that Lamb, his former political adviser, told him that an unnamed executive connected to News Corp said the party would get favourable coverage in the company's newspapers in exchange for its support on the Sky bid. He will join Simon Walters, the Mail on Sunday political editor, who last weekend reported that Lord Justice Leveson threatened to quit over comments made by the education secretary Michael Gove on the \"chilling effect\" of the inquiry on press freedom. Walters is appearing on Monday alongside Phil Webster, a former political editor of the Times, who is now editor for the paper's online service. Also on Monday is Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow, Andy Grice, the political editor of the Independent, and the Times' former political commentator Peter Riddell. Mellor will give evidence on Tuesday afternoon. He was secretary of state responsible for the Department for National Heritage \u2013 later rebranded the Department for Culture, Media and Sport by Labour \u2013 in John Major's Conservative government in 1992 and famously warned that \"the press \u2013 the popular press \u2013 is drinking in the last chance saloon\" and called for the \"sacred cow\" of press freedom to be curbed. Months later he was the victim of a kiss-and-tell scandal after actress Antonia de Sancha sold her story of an affair through the PR Max Clifford to the Sun, then edited by Kelvin MacKenzie. Mellor later resigned, attracting further opprobrium from the Sun again, which splashed with the headline \"From Toe Job to No Job\". He later claimed he was hounded out of office by the tabloids. A former member of the Tory government's football task force, Mellor is now best known as a football pundit. On Wednesday the inquiry is expected to sit for just half a day with the morning given over to a directions hearing for the final module, which will be dedicated to future reforms of the press. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
