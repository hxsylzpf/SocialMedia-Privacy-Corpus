  "content": "A man in St Louis has been charged with threatening to kill police and cause an explosion at the city jail in Twitter posts that referenced Ferguson, the nearby town where an officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old led to protests and rioting. Jason Valentine is accused of 10 counts of making a terrorist threat, a felony punishable by up to seven years in prison in Missouri. The charges relate to 10 tweets that Valentine, 35, is alleged to have posted in December with the intention of \"frightening 10 or more people\". Several referred to New Year's Eve as \"kill a pig night\", according to a probable cause statement released on Thursday by the St Louis circuit attorney, which claimed Valentine \"used the slang 'pig' \u2026 to describe police officers\" and was threatening to kill them. One tweet allegedly said: \"St Louis City Justice Center Mysteriously Exploded 12/31/2014\". Prosecutors charge that was a threat to cause an explosion at the building. Their statement said police \"considered these threats to be serious in nature\" and claimed that \"kill a pig night\" had \"gained momentum nationally\". Another tweet allegedly used the hashtag \"#KillJeffRoorda\". Roorda, the business manager of the St Louis Police Officers Association, is a prominent supporter of Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who shot dead Michael Brown after an altercation on 9 August. Brown's death was followed by several nights of protests that met a heavy response from police and reopened a national debate about policing and race relations. The town was hit by looting and arson after a grand jury declined in November to charge Wilson with a crime. Nine of the 10 tweets allegedly posted by Valentine featured a \"Ferguson\" hashtag; all referenced Vonderrit Myers, a black 18-year-old who was shot dead after allegedly shooting at an off-duty St Louis police officer in the Shaw neighbourhood in October, prompting further protests. According to the probable cause statement, Valentine \"admits to using the Twitter user handle @jdstl314 and being the sole poster under that user handle\". The account has since been suspended and cannot be viewed. Police said Twitter suspended it on 29 December. Valentine was listed as living at an address in the Shaw neighbourhood. According to the probable cause statement he has a previous conviction for aggravated stalking and violation of a protection order. The charges are due to be presented to a grand jury for consideration."
