  "content": "The News of the World chief reporter, Neville Thurlbeck, told the high court today that he needed to film the orgy involving motor racing boss Max Mosley because of the \"very, very high\" standard of proof required by his newspaper. Thurlbeck said that he \"took it for granted\" before filming the orgy that there was a public interest justification for the story because of the claims made beforehand by his paper's informant, known as Woman E in the high court hearing. Under cross-examination from Mosley's QC, James Price, Thurlbeck told the court today: \"I would not know that a sadomasochistic orgy was going on simply because [Mosley] had entered the flat separately with five dominatrices. We actually needed to gather some proof of the event taking place. We would never have run a story without that level of proof.\" He added: \"He could have been doing a hundred other things other than taking part in a sadomasochistic orgy. A full statement from [Woman] E would not provide sufficient evidence. It could be said that she wanted to sell the story to the newspaper for money so fabricated it. We needed absolute categoric evidence that an orgy had taken place. The standard of proof, in my experience at the News of the World, for getting a story into the paper is very, very high indeed.\" Thurlbeck told the court that he was \"surprised\" by the footage of the orgy, insisting that he was expecting a \"watered down comedy version of [BBC comedy] 'Allo 'Allo\". \"I was completely surprised by the level of the Nazism as we saw it. I didn't quite expect the degree of Nazi-style humiliation that we saw,\" he said. \"I kind of suspected it might be just some sort of watered down comedy version of 'Allo 'Allo. But, when we looked at the video it became clear very quickly that there was a very cynical Nazi theme running throughout. It was just clear to us all,\" Thurlbeck added. Responding to Price's suggestion that what was filmed was an English prison scenario and did not in fact depict any Nazi activity, Thurlbeck replied: \"I know of no English prison that beats its inmates with a stick until their buttocks bleed. I know of no English prison where the warder will deliver those blows and count them out in German. I know of no English prison where the inmates then have sexual intercourse with the warder who has just given those blows.\" He added: \"I think they find the whole German/Nazi thing a big turn-on. That's why it was all characterised and staged that way.\" Mosley's claim for invasion of privacy will continue tomorrow when Thurlbeck will continue giving evidence. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
