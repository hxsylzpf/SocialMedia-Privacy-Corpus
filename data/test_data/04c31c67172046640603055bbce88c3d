  "content": "This may sound pathetic, but it was only after I saw an Instagrammed picture of 17 circular oat cereals stacked precariously on a sleeping baby's forehead that I realised that I might, possibly, be ready for this fatherhood lark after all. I'm talking about the #CheeriosChallenge, the viral meme in which doting dads compete to show the world just how much love they can pour upon their tiny sons and daughters. Sorry, did I say \"love\"? I meant \"sugary breakfast snacks\", which is basically the same thing. Have a look at the pictures on social media and you may find it an oddly calming experience \u2013 I'm not normally one for cooing over weird, wrinkly baby pics, but seeing them snoozing away with various combinations of Cheerios balanced on their noses, cheeks and foreheads is both meditative and heartwarming. But whatever, though, because sorry babies, this is not about you. It's about the dads and what it says about dad culture in 2016. Up until stumbling upon the #CheerioChallenge hashtag, I was excited about becoming a dad, don't get me wrong (who couldn't get excited about the prospect of spending vast reserves of time and money on something that will repeatedly crap and puke on you before finally blossoming into a proper person who finds you, at best, faintly embarrassing?). But I had several reservations: was I mature enough to guide a child through the obstacle course that is life? Was I ready to cut ties with all the stupid dumbass things I like to do on a day-to-day basis? Clearly, I was overthinking things. Having kids is just going to be a big old laugh full of pranks and novelty pictures that will not only help form an unbreakable bond between me and my new child but also, more importantly, have the potential to really boost my Insta game. I've even bought my first ever box of Cheerios in preparation \u2013 a full month before my child's due date. Looking at it on the kitchen shelf makes me wonder how soon I can feasibly start stacking. During delivery? In the maternity ward? On the journey home, perhaps while driving no-handed to give the task an added frisson of excitement? (relax guys, I'm joking \u2013 I promise to always have one hand on the wheel). Whatever, I feel prepped and ready to join the dad world now and even if the #CheerioChallenge peaks and burns out before I get the chance to take part (there are already pics of people using whole cereal boxes or full dishes of Cheerios \u2026 an awful dad mishap is surely just around the corner), I feel confident that something equally dumb will be along to replace it. Because the #CheerioChallenge is more than just a pointless game played out for social media likes. It's a message to all dads that they don't need to panic \u2013 life may change, irreversibly and forever, but you can still be just as much of an idiot in your life as you were before. What could be more reassuring than that?"
