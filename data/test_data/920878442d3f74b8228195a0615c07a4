  "content": "\"Selfie\" has been named word of the year by the Oxford Dictionaries, highlighting the increasing influence of contemporary slang (last year's word was omnishambles). In Germany, a dubious abbreviation accompanied by a hashtag was made word of the year: according to the Official Society for the German Language, #GroKo is short for Grosse Koalition, the political partnership formed in 2013 by Germany's two biggest parties. But did \"selfie\" work for you? Was there another that sums up the last year more effectively \u2013 or a new one you'd like to create?"
