  "content": "The singer Cee Lo Green has discussed a court case in which he pleaded no contest to supplying ecstasy to a woman in a series of tweets, including one that read: \"People who have really been raped REMEMBER!!!\" The woman had claimed that she had no memory of the period between dining with Green at a sushi restaurant in 2012 and waking up naked in the singer's bed. Green's lawyer argued that Green, 40, and the woman had \"consensual relations\". No rape charges were filed due to lack of evidence. In the tweets, which were subsequently deleted, though preserved by a user of the site in screengrabs, Green added: \"If someone is passed out they're not even WITH you consciously! so WITH Implies consent\". On Friday, Green pleaded no contest to a felony count of supplying ecstasy. He was sentenced to three years probation and 45 days community service. On Sunday, Green aired his views on sexual assault while discussing the case on Twitter. Other tweets included: \"When someone brakes on a home there is broken glass where is your plausible proof that anyone was raped.\" Green, a former judge on the American version of talent show The Voice, and whose international hit singles include Crazy and Fuck You, later apologised. On Monday, he posted a series of tweets including \"I sincerely apologize for my comments being taken so far out of context ... I'd never condone the harm of any women.\" He later deleted his Twitter account."
