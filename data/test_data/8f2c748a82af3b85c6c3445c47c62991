  "content": "The \"Tracking the Trackers\" project has since last Friday asked users of the site to submit anonymised information on the webpages they visit and the tracking files (usually known as \"cookies\") that those sites place. Since then, more than 300 users have uploaded information on the relationships between more than 16,000 websites and cookies, building one of the most detailed databases ever available on the prevelance of web cookies. The project is still accepting new data, but has published the current top 10 tracking files on the internet, in order to begin investigating what information each tracks, and which companies are behind them. It's given below, with the number of websites that attempted to place the cookie on users' computers: 1. doubleclick.net (863 sites) 2. quantserve.com (531 sites) 3. scorecardresearch.com (507 sites) 4. facebook.com (488 sites) 5. twitter.com (378 sites) 6. google.com (306 sites) 7. addthis.com (275 sites) 8. adnxs.com (233 sites) 9. yieldmanager.com (198 sites) 10. imrworldwide.com (188 sites) Some of the most prolific cookies clearly come from well-known internet companies such as Google or Facebook, while others come from their subsidiaries: Doubleclick.net, the most prolific cookie discovered to date, is one of the biggest advertising providers on the internet, and is owned by Google. Others in the top 10 list come from providers who most internet users will never have heard of. The Guardian is investigating who is behind each, what information they track, and for what purposes. The Guardian has encouraged its users to help the investigation by downloading a free application called Collusion, built by Mozilla (the company behind the open-source browser Firefox). It works by showing you the sites you've visited and what tracking devices they set on your computer. Just a few minutes surfing the web can result in a string of company names, products and services unknown outside the worlds of online advertising and analytics, which users were then asked to submit anonymously to the Guardian for research. This anonymous data will eventually be published by the Guardian, to allow any developers and users \u2013 rather than just those within the big advertisers \u2013 to build a true picture of tracking on the net. The initial findings of the study come as new research from privacy consultancy TRUSTe suggested that UK websites are not doing enough to safeguard their users' privacy. TRUSTe's figures suggested that the average large UK website placed 14 tracking files on each user's computer, most of which were from third parties, usually advertisers. One third of privacy policies revealed user data automatically shared with third parties for commercial purposes, while almost half tracked location data of their users. The typical privacy policy was 2,299 words long \u2013 twice a typical's Queen's speech and half the length of the Magna Carta, making them inaccessible for users, TRUSTe warned. \"Clearly, more work needs to be done to deliver shorter, more accessible privacy notices that can be easily understood by consumers so that they can make informed choices around their personal information,\" said CEO Chris Babel."
