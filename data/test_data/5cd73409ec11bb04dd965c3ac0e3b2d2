  "content": "Encryption and privacy firm Silent Circle has unveiled a successor to its Blackphone security-focused smartphone, as well as the first Blackphone-branded tablet. The Blackphone 2 handset and Blackphone+ tablet will both go on sale later in 2015, running the company's new PrivatOS Android-based operating system and its suite of communications apps and services. The announcements at the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona followed Silent Circle raising $50m in funding and buying out partner Geeksphone to take full control of the Blackphone business, which was previously a joint venture. The Blackphone 2 will have a faster processor, more memory, a larger display and longer battery life than its predecessor, which launched in 2014. For now, Silent Circle is keeping the features of the Blackphone+ tablet under wraps. The devices will run an updated version of PrivatOS \u2013 tagline: \"no software, no hooks to carriers, and no leaky data\" \u2013 including a new feature called Spaces that keeps personal and work apps separate, and enables employers to lock and wipe the latter \"spaces\" if necessary. They will also run Silent Circle's encrypted voice calls, messaging and contacts apps, as well as a new conference-calling app called Silent Meeting, and the Silent Store privacy-focused app store that launched in December 2014. Silent Circle says it is working with mobile device management (MDM) companies Citrix, Soti and Good Technology as it aims to build up its business supplying devices and software to businesses of all sizes. The company's co-founder, Phil Zimmermann, recently told the Guardian about its ambition to persuade businesses to focus more on protecting their employees' privacy, in order to improve overall security. \"People don't think of privacy much when they think about enterprises, but enterprise privacy is a real thing: it's the collective privacy of everybody in the company, and the privacy of the company assets as well,\" he said. Blackphone has faced its own challenges, with security researcher Mark Dowd discovering a vulnerability in its SilentText app that could have helped attackers decrypt messages and steal personal data from the device. Silent Circle fixed the bug and publicly thanked Dowd for reporting it. The company is hoping high-profile hacks, such as the attack on Sony Pictures in late 2014, will persuade other businesses to adopt its technology and devices. \"Sony had all kinds of things: intrusion detection, firewalls, antivirus \u2026 But they got hacked anyway,\" Zimmermann told the Guardian. \"A lot of this stuff could have been encrypted. If those emails had been encrypted with PGP or GnuPG, the hackers wouldn't have gotten very far. Those movie scripts that they stole? They could have been encrypted too.\""
