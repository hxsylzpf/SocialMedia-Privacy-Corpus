  "content": "Name: Snap Inc. Age: Two days old. Appearance: Bright, fun, rich. Is this some kind of \"startup\"? In a way. It's Snapchat's new name. I think I've heard of Snapchat. Is it that thing where you show people your genitals for five seconds? Pictures of your genitals, yes. That's one of its uses. It's the app that lets you share photos and videos that delete themselves shortly afterwards. Plus you can add silly graphics and effects. Young people like it. Young people have too much time. Perhaps. But as a result, Snapchat is now worth about $22bn (\u00a317bn), just five years after some college friends started it at home. Today, CEO Evan Spiegel is a 26-year-old multibillionaire engaged to the supermodel Miranda Kerr. I want him to fail. That's a common reaction. And you might get your wish. How come? Because Snapchat has just announced plans to launch its own hardware \u2013 some brightly coloured video-recording sunglasses called Spectacles. That's why they have changed the name of the parent company to Snap Inc, because they're \"a camera company\" now. Glasses that record video \u2026 That reminds me of something. Google Glass? That's right! Whatever happened to them? Failure. It turned out that people didn't want to install a computer on their face in order to make everybody hate them. It seems so obvious, in retrospect. So why does Spiegel think Spectacles will be different? Well, they're cheaper and brightly coloured. Or, at least, they will be when they go on limited release in the US for $130 (\u00a3101) this autumn. Plus, hey, they're from Snapchat! Snap Inc. Whatever. The point is that Google Glass were these high-tech nerd goggles, but Spectacles will be simple, bold, fun \u2013 and cool! Are you sure? Absolutely. Snap Inc has used some Spectacles to make a video of young people skateboarding. Why does this keep happening? What? Technology companies getting so rich that they literally don't know what to spend their money on except daft new wearable products such as the Apple Watch or Google Glass or Facebook's virtual-reality thing. Oculus Rift? Yeah. That. Has it failed yet? It's only been out since March. Give it time. Do say: \"Chk this vid of what I just saw! LOL.\" Don't say: \"I'm standing right next to you, idiot.\""
