  "content": "The world's top advertising executives and marketers grappled with the commercial and creative potential of the ever-growing mountain of digital consumer data at the industry's annual bash in Cannes last week, with recent revelations about the National Security Agency's internet surveillance activities throwing the privacy implications of handling this information into sharp relief. Last week also saw the publication of the UK information commissioner's office's annual report, with a prediction that 2013 will be \"the year that the commercial imperative of good data handling will be realised\". The ICO warned that 97% of people it surveyed were concerned that organisations would pass or sell on their personal details. It is a concern shared by senior advertising executives, who, while keen not to miss out on the benefits of digital data, fear that technology companies may not have protecting individuals' privacy at the centre of their corporate agenda. Some industry veterans are concerned that the heady, IPO- or sale-obsessed mentality of Silicon Valley companies puts wealth creation for individuals, shareholders or investors ahead of fundamentals such as a care of duty to internet users. However, other ad agencies and advertisers argue the real issue is not privacy, but that there is too much data already. What is needed is \"clean\" data, better analytics of what is available, not prying ever deeper into web users' habits. In a digital world where the consumer increasingly expects to find information almost instantaneously, where attention-spans have dropped to almost zero, targeted advertising has huge benefits. At a wider cultural level, consumer goods companies have historically suffered from over-production of goods being shipped to shops due to a lack of exact data about consumer demand. Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of the world's biggest marketing services group WPP, criticised internet giants including Google, Facebook and Yahoo in Cannes for what he sees as their lax attitude towards the data they mine from users. He believes calling themselves technology firms allows them to abrogate responsibility for the editorial content on their sites. They are media companies, he contends, and should shoulder responsibility for the information they gather and exploit in the same way as a newspaper publisher or broadcaster. Sorrell had quizzed a number of senior executives from Silicon Valley companies at a private event held by WPP at the start of the week, and had been left distinctly unimpressed by the reluctance the web giants showed to engage over the issues that Prism raises. Speakers including Velvet Underground frontman Lou Reed, fashion veteran Vivienne Westwood and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales also raised concerns about the misuse of data in their events, attended by hundreds of advertising and marketing executives. Sorrell's broadside sounded a discordant note at a festival with a programme full of speakers from companies such as Facebook, YouTube, Tumblr and Microsoft. Their presentations often enthused about their giant scale and the increasingly granular information on user behaviour they can offer advertisers. Despite his reservations, Sorrell is enthusiastic about its potential too, revealing that about 25% of WPP's \u00a310bn-plus revenues comes from what he refers to as data investment management, which is effectively monetising information that helps advertisers. to better sell stuff to consumers And this figure is growing fast. Meanwhile, both WPP and its French rival Publicis Groupe recently announced global deals with Twitter to try to get to grips with the huge commercial opportunities it opens up. The issue of privacy and data usage was highlighted by Facebook's chief engineer Andrew Bosworth, responsible for innovations such as news feed and head of its privacy engineering team, who said protecting user information was the company's \"Number one priority\". He said that Facebook was \"unparalleled\" in its knowledge of users \u2013 where they were, what device they were using \u2013 and ability to deliver advertising to them. Attempting to allay privacy fears, he insisted that user data \"is in a place where we trust, which is with us\". Sorrell has form in taking a pop at technology companies. With power over $70bn in global ad spend from clients he likes to remind the digital generation of businesses that they can't take their place at the top table of client marketing spend for granted \u2013 even as he admits that by the end of next year Google is set to supplant Rupert Murdoch's media empire at the top of the list where WPP spends client money. The internet era theoretically allows companies to better understand their customers, and so better tailor their ads to target the right customers, which in turn allows Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever or Nike to invest fewer resources and, in effect, make their businesses (with over-production reduced) better for the planet. But if the age of big data tempts firms to misuse consumer information, if the goal is purely to make money, then the risk of terminal damage to a brand is very real. Consumers always have a choice.",
