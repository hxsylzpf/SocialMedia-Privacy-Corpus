  "content": "The online reaction to Margaret Thatcher's death came in a series of perfect waves. First came the wave where people celebrated her passing. Then came the wave where people asked the first group of people to be nice. Then the wave where the first group of people took issue with the superior tone of the second group of people. Then the second group reacted angrily. Then the first group counter-reacted even more angrily. Finally came the wave where all of the internet became genuinely unbearable and you just wanted to go outside and regain some perspective. But between all of this, plenty of people used the news of Thatcher's death to rush on to Twitter and demonstrate a refreshing lack of knowledge. Much of this seems to be down to Harry Styles from One Direction. At 1:42pm, Harry wrote \"RIP Baroness Thatcher .x\", which, if not up there with previous missives like \"Happy purim everybody! Enjoy your seudah today and boo loudly at hamann during the megillah!! .x\", was still a nice way to show that he was keeping up with current affairs. However, many of Harry's followers, having been born a full decade and a half after Thatcher stopped being prime minister, couldn't quite grasp the relevance of the tweet. One reply read \"wish iknew what all this meant\". Another quite simply read, \"Aw you're cute.\" Best of all, one officious tweeter took it upon herself to correct him, saying, \"It's market thatcher. Something to do with our queen.\" Elsewhere, confusion from some quarters over who Margaret Thatcher actually was got so out of hand that a Tumblr called Wait, Who Is Margaret Thatcher Anyway? sprang into life, compiling tweets including \"I'm not even gon act like I know who Margaret Thatcher is\", \"I don't know who margaret thatcher is :-( I probs do but cant remember, help\" and \"I feel like a piece of shit cause I'm not sure I know who Margaret Thatcher is\". The lesson to take from all of this seems to be that some young people don't know much about figures who retired from public life long before they were even born, which is either shocking or perfectly normal depending on how angry you happen to be with the world. And at least it's better than the #Nowthatchersdead debacle, where someone deliberately misread a hashtag, composed a sarcastic tweet suggesting that it was Cher who had died and watched as people repeated it again and again until a handful of journalists and Ricky Gervais decided that it was a genuine trend, even though it wasn't. Still, we should have known this was coming. Last year @MartinBelam published a pie chart entitled \"What Twitter will look like on the day that Thatcher dies.\" It was all there. People mourning. People gloating. Mourners and gloaters searching Twitter for things to be outraged about. Young people asking \"Who is Thatcher?\" Journalists searching for \"Who is Thatcher?\" so that they can write stories about \"the ignorant youth of today\". We should all look at this chart and feel ashamed. RIP Market Thatcher."
