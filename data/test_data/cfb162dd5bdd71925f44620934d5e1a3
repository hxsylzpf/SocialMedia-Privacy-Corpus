  "content": "In 2015, Congress passed more than 100 laws that were then signed by President Barack Obama. Some, like the omnibus budget deal agreed in December, accomplished the most basic task of funding the federal government. There were also 14 different bills to rename individual post offices, including one sponsored by Representative Steve Chabot to name the post office in Springboro, Ohio after longtime local mail man Richard \"Dick\" Chenault. But besides keeping the lights on and renaming post offices, the federal government actually did a few consequential things in 2015. These are seven of the more interesting new laws of the year. USA Freedom Act In June, Congress passed the first significant rollback of government surveillance in decades. The USA Freedom Act, which was passed with bipartisan support, ended bulk collection of phone records by the United States government after Edward Snowden revealed the National Security Agency program. Instead, phone companies would hold those records. The bill also ended a brief lapse in many government surveillance powers after key provisions of the Patriot Act had expired just two days before it was signed into law. But it's considered a modest reform by many privacy advocates. While the NSA will have to go through court to get phone records, it won't face the same obstacle to obtain bulk communications on the internet and social media records. Every Student Succeeds Act In December, Congress passed the first major update to No Child Left Behind, the landmark Bush-era education reform bill. The Every Student Succeeds Act loosened many of the testing requirements around No Child Left Behind while giving states more autonomy in setting goals for academic achievement. The resulting bipartisan compromise appealed to many in both parties, reducing the federal role in education while also loosening standards that were objected to by teachers' unions. However, it still left many questions about whether it would be successful in its goal to close the achievement gap that disproportionately left minority students in poor areas at an educational disadvantage. Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 A bipartisan bill co-sponsored by swing-state senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, this legislation took some modest steps toward improving energy efficiency in buildings. In particular, the legislation created a voluntary program called Tenant Star, which provides incentives for landlords to make spaces they lease in commercial buildings energy efficient. The proposal is modeled after the Energy Star program, which does the same in newly built buildings. The bill, which passed both the House and Senate by voice vote, also contains a provision that exempted some water heaters from federal energy efficiency standards. Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act The stage was set for the controversial nuclear deal with Iran this year by a bipartisan proposal from senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Ben Cardin of Maryland to ensure that Congress had the opportunity to vote on any agreement. The Iran deal was originally designed to be an executive agreement in order to thwart the need for Congress to approve the deal as a treaty. This compromise bill, which easily passed both the Senate and the House, gave Congress the opportunity to block a deal. However, it made it difficult for this to happen and required a congressional resolution disapproving of the agreement to receive consent of two-thirds of each chamber. Eventually, although majorities in both the House and the Senate opposed the deal, it was not enough to block implementation. Steve Gleason Act Louisiana senator David Vitter suffered a shocking and humiliating loss in his attempt to be his state's governor this year. However, he did notch one success in 2015: the Steve Gleason Act, named after a former New Orleans Saints player who suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The legislation allows Medicare and Medicaid to cover speech-generating devices for those suffering from ALS. Gleason currently uses such a device that allows him to use eye movements to communicate. Drinking Water Protection Act Congress actually passed one piece of environmental legislation in 2015, the Drinking Water Protection Act. However, the bill is not terribly ambitious; it guards against the rise of algal toxins in the Great Lakes and requires the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor the threat posed by algae blooms to drinking water. The legislation came in the aftermath of a 2014 water crisis in Toledo, Ohio, when an algal bloom in Lake Erie left more than 500,000 people without drinking water. The bloom is the result of intensive farm runoff from fertilized fields high in phosphorus. Toxic algae then feasts on the phosphorus, creating massive floating dead zones. Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015 Starting in 2017, Americans will no longer be allowed to buy beauty products with microbeads, tiny plastic spheres used to aid in exfoliation. The microbeads are so small that they pass through water filtration systems and end up in the ocean. Along the way, they absorb chemicals and toxins. Fish and sea life end up eating the toxic microbeads and then, of course, humans end up eating the fish. Several states had already banned microbeads and many companies were starting to phase them out of their products because of health and environmental concerns. This bill makes the process uniform across the country."
