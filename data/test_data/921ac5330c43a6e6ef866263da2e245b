  "content": "\u2022 As Yahoo rolls out a $100m marketing campaign for its tweaked homepage, Cursin' Carol Bartz told reporters that the company was done with laying off staff. Phew! PaidContent reports that she also revealed that the 700 layoffs conducted under her watch cost the company $27m. Meanwhile, points out critic Eric Jackson, Bartz herself stands to make between $20m and $30m in her first year on the job. \u2022 The heat is still from many quarters for Twitter to start making money - but co-founder Biz Stone said on Tuesday that \"any kind of approach to advertising is going to be a while\". That's despite the company recently tweaking its terms of service in a way that \"leaves the door open\" for ad placements. \u2022 If you haven't seen the images of a dust storm that hit Sydney, then prepare yourself for some incredible stuff: this Flickr gallery compiling pictures from across Sydney, as well as this frankly insane video of the sky turning black as the dust moves in. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
