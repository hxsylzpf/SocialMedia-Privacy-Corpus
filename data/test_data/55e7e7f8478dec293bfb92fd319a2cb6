  "content": "The government has said it had no intention of introducing a privacy law, despite today's recommendations by a parliamentary inquiry into media intrusion. In response to a select committee's call for privacy legislation, the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, reiterated her support for the current system of press self-regulation but conceded there was \"room for improvement\". \"We don't consider a privacy law to be on the cards - Tessa Jowell made that clear when she appeared before the select committee,\" said a spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. Ms Jowell, who set out an eight-point plan for improving the press complaints commission when she appeared before the committee, said: \"The government continues to believe a free press is vital in a democracy and that self-regulation is the best regulatory system. \"That does not mean there is no room for improvement. This is something I have already discussed with the press complaints commission chairman, Sir Christopher Meyer. \"Sir Christopher has made it clear he has his own ideas on how the PCC might improve its service and that he would be canvassing views on these and other ideas. \"I am sure he will be considering in detail the points the select committee has made. I will be doing the same and responding in full as soon as possible.\" Introducing the report, the chairman of the culture select committee, Gerald Kaufman, said: \"It was clear to me that if there were not a properly enacted privacy law then the Human Rights Act would create a de facto privacy law decided by judges ad hoc on the basis of individual cases brought to court inevitably by interested parties.\" Chris Bryant MP suggested if the PCC had been more robust in dealing with recent cases - such as the collapse of the Victoria Beckham kidnap trial, in which the key informant had been paid by the News of the World - the committee might not have found the need for a privacy law so pressing. \"If the PCC had shown us it was serious about improving standards I would have said 'yes, the PCC is the way to go',\" Mr Bryant said. \"But I think the PCC response to the Beckham case was mealy mouthed and ambivalent at best.\" Mr Bryant also highlighted the lack of power the PCC has to act in cases such as the one brought by Radio 1 DJ Sara Cox against the Sunday People, which published pictures of her and her husband naked on their honeymoon. \"The PCC said 'Sara Cox should have just come to us' but she wouldn't have got the photos back,\" Mr Bryant said. \"It's clear we're going to have a privacy law written for us but it's not going to be done in an open way. It will be done in the courts.\" However, Mr Kaufman insisted the committee supported the principle of self-regulation and ruled out any possibility of the new media watchdog, Ofcom, being given any powers over the editorial content of newspapers. He added the PCC could be \"beefed up\" by implementing the detailed suggestions made in today's report. \"While some people believe Ofcom should be a backstop, we reject that entirely because Ofcom is a statutory organisation - we don't regard it as appropriate that a non-statutory organisation should be made accountable to a statutory one,\" Mr Kaufman said. \"Our proposal for a privacy law doesn't in any way indicate the PCC should be in some way accountable or answerable to the law. \"We pay a number of tributes to the PCC - the impressive detail the PCC has set out [in its evidence to the inquiry], its good results over the last 10 years, the robust attitude of the new PCC chairman.\" However, Mr Kaufman added: \"We believe there are certain areas where the PCC could beef itself up and we've given a series of recommendations as to how [this could be done].\" These include introducing a system in which newspapers that break the PCC code pay compensation, putting apologies on the front pages of papers, making the process of appointments to the PCC more transparent, recruiting more lay members and outlawing payments to police officers in return for information. In their report on privacy, the MPs stated: \"We firmly recommend the government reconsider its position and bring forward legislative proposals to clarify the protection that individuals can expect from unwarranted intrusion by anyone - not the press alone - into their private lives.\" The right to a private life is enshrined in article eight of the Human Rights Act. However, separate privacy legislation does not currently exist in English law. \u00b7 To give MediaGuardian a story email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"
