  "content": "Fleet Street's refusal to publish pictures of a naked Prince Harry represents a remarkable moment of collective restraint with a royal who has already benefited from a different sort of press blackout. Four years ago, the media agreed not to report on his tour of duty to Afghanistan until Australian magazine New Idea broke the embargo, although it did not get much attention until it was picked up by the US-based Drudge report weeks later. This time, though, Harry has been the beneficiary of a heavy handed and controversial intervention from the Press Complaints Commission \u2013 at the behest of Clarence House \u2013 after another US publication, TMZ.com, published two pictures of him naked on its website on Wednesday. Veteran tabloid journalists say that the existence of the Leveson inquiry has forced redtops to be even more cautious. PCC advisory notices are not meant to be made public, but it is an open secret that on Wednesday afternoon, as it emerged that the picture agency Splash Pictures was making the Harry photos available for sale, the body was telling editors what to do. Because the pictures of Harry were taken in his hotel room it was suggested that the prince had a reasonable expectation of privacy, and that anybody choosing to publish would therefore be in breach of the code. Yet, it was a surprising decision for a body that has, in other cases, taken a different view. Two years ago, the PCC ruled that Alix Bromley had lost control over her own image because photographs of the young woman, posing fully clothed on a social networking site, had circulated widely online. At that time, the PCC held that Loaded magazine was within its rights to offer readers \u00a3500 if they could get her along to a photoshoot because she had the \"best breasts on the block\". However, the protection denied the young woman was extended rapidly to Prince Harry, even though, as in Bromley's case, the cork was out of the bottle. The result is that the PCC \u2013 itself under pressure to show that it can be a tough regulator in the aftermath of the phone hacking crisis \u2013 has asked Fleet Street not to re-publish pictures that are likely to have been viewed already millions of times online. In so doing, the regulator has created a situation where, mirroring the privacy injunction crisis, information circulating online doesn't appear in the nation's popular press. Then there was the case of footballers allegedly involved in affairs whose names were freely circulating on Twitter because they had taken out injunctions to stop themselves being named. Neil Wallis, a former deputy editor of the News of the World, who has been arrested by police on suspicion of involvement in phone hacking, wrote on the Huffington Post blog that tabloid editors and executives were \"terrified of risking the opprobrium of Leveson's law, of losing their jobs, or their newspapers losing advertising revenue\". With the judge writing up the conclusions into his press inquiry it is  easy to understand why it is tempting to err on the side of caution \u2013 although there are other factors worth taking into consideration, not least whether British readers would believe it tasteful to see  in print pictures of a still popular royal unclothed. Irish newspapers took a completely different view, with the Irish Daily Star \u2013 half owned by Richard Desmond's Northern &amp; Shell \u2013 and Dublin's Evening Herald publishing images of the royal prince on their front pages. \"Flash Harry,\" said the Star. The upmarket Irish Independent published the images on page three; this is a title that also circulates in the UK, and therefore sidesteps the PCC ban. Ironically, Ireland has what could be described as stronger press regulation than the UK, because the Press Council of Ireland is recognised in law \u2013 a model being actively considered by Lord Justice Leveson as a way of toughening up the system. But, of course, the reason Dublin-titles have chosen to publish is simple: Buckingham palace exerts no influence over the Irish sea. Nevertheless, in Britain, a curious cocktail of circumstance has emerged, in which a combination of traditional deference to the palace, a PCC desperate to show it can be tough to the point where it forgets its own case law, and fears about provoking a judge who is writing a once-in-a-generation report, have kept pictures of a royal prince's high jinks off the front pages. The outcome, though, is to create a gulf between what British papers can publish and what can be read online \u2013 a disparity that so worries tabloid editors. Except, there is little readers missed. All could read that the prince, third in line to the throne, could invite a lot of strangers to his room in the early hours, take his clothes off and let himself be photographed naked. To complete one's knowledge all anybody had to do was go to Google. Is that media in competition or media acting in harmony?",
