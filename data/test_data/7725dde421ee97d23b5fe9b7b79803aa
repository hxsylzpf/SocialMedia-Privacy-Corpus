  "content": "There are few greater honours in Silicon Valley than a personal gift from Steve Jobs of a yet-to-be-released iPhone 4. Or a crash course in micro-blogging from the founders of Twitter. Technology chiefs in California prepared to lay out the red carpet today for a VIP guest in the shape of Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev. Kicking off a US visit, Medvedev embarked on a tour of Silicon Valley in a search for tips on establishing a similar technological hub, dubbed an \"innograd\", outside Moscow. \"My purpose is not just to see what is going on there,\" said Medvedev at a reception in San Francisco hosted by California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger. \"I would like to have my visit be translated into full-fledged relations and into co-operation with those companies.\" In addition to visiting Apple and Twitter, Medvedev's itinerary includes meetings with top executives from Cisco and Google. A Russian warship, the Varyag, docked in San Francisco in co-ordination with the trip. Known to be a technology buff, Medvedev has made it a pet project to create a Russian version of Silicon Valley. His administration has earmarked Skolkovo, a city southwest of the Russian capital, as the site of the proposed centre of innovation, earmarking $500m (\u00a3335m) of public investment for the next year alone. Schwarzenegger, who described the Russian president's visit as \"very, very beneficial\" for California, joked with Medvedev that he had fond memories of Moscow from filming a 1988 police movie, Red Heat, in the Russian capital. The California governor pledged to put together a trade mission of technology experts to Moscow to help with the Skolkovo venture. Medvedev's delegation was due to meet Google's chief executive, Eric Schmidt, today after the search engine boss agreed to join the board of Skolkovo. But industry observers noted that the Russian president had no plans to meet one of his country's most successful emigres, the billionaire co-founder of Google, Sergey Brin. The Wall Street Journal noted that in a 2002 interview Brin had been scathing about the land of his ancestry, describing Russia as \"Nigeria with snow\". After his trip to Silicon Valley, Medvedev will move on to Washington to meet the US president, Barack Obama, before attending this weekend's G20 international summit in Toronto. Part of Medvedev's economic strategy is build innovative industries to try to ease Russia off its financial dependence on oil."
