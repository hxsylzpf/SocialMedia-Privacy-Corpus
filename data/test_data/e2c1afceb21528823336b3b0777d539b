  "content": "With 91% of adults online regularly engaging in some form of social media activity and over 36m Facebook and 15m Twitter users in the UK alone, it's easy to see why social media has become central to how the world does business. Because social media has the unique ability to reach and effectively engage niche audiences and communities, it is becoming an increasingly important way for organisations and social enterprises to amplify and enhance their social impact. In this article we explore five powerful ways to use social media to increase your social impact: 1. Make Your Content Sticky User Generated Content (UGC) is king in Social Media, providing the social lubricant that enriches both the online experience and relationships you develop with people through your social networks. Sticky content is content that people are interested in, want to share, want to interact with and is critical to maximising your impact. Content can be made sticky by ensuring that it's keyword rich, interesting and helpful to the reader and comes from a personal and honest place. 2. Create a Twitition Petitions are extremely powerful, because they can strike a chord, spread virally, and serve as a visual demonstration of the support that an issue has gathered. Twitition is an application that allows people to create, spread, and sign petitions via Twitter. It's quick, easy and free. 3. Create A Facebook Community Page You can generate focused support for a cause or topic by creating a Community Page on Facebook. This can act as a focal point or hub for your campaign by directing your target audience back to your page from other social networks. It's easy to do and best of all is free. 4. Expand Your Network \u2013 Amplify Your Impact There is a direct correlation between the magnitude of the impact you have and the number of followers and friends you have. Therefore it's important to expand your network to include more likeminded people on Facebook and Twitter. 5. Use Online Influencers as Your Amplifiers Generally the more followers/friends a person or company has, the more influential they are but it isn't all about quantity. Quality is hugely important as well and if you have a niche community of followers who are all very active on Twitter and are posting and re-tweeting regularly, you can create a significant groundswell. Influencers should have a combination of a large number of followers, good quality relevant followers to your cause and be regularly active on Twitter and Facebook. These are the people who will engage with your message and amplify your cause. You can find these people through the Twitter search functionality by using keywords and phrases relating to your cause. MPs and other government stakeholders have very publically started to engage in Social Media with a particular focus on Twitter. In addition to using the usual Twitter search functionality and following your local MP via your own feed, @Tweetminister provides an invaluable resource for getting to grips with MPs and Government on Twitter. Online Grassroots Campaigns That Have Worked We Love NHS The We Love NHS campaign on Twitter was a seemingly spontaneous riposte to apparent slurs by US Republicans against the UK health service. It became the social network's number one trending topic worldwide. Twitter crashed at one point because so many people were Tweeting their support for the NHS. A-level exam questions School students protested on Facebook this year over two A-Level biology exams which they claimed contained questions that did not match the syllabus. The Ofqual qualifications watchdog is investigating their concerns. Against Road Pricing The campaign against road pricing scored a significant victory when 1.7m people signed an online petition on the Downing Street website opposing the policy. Many believe this spelled the end for the plans. Then the Prime Minister emailed the signatories to tell them that no decisions had been taken about road pricing and this was the \"beginning, not the end\" of the debate.
