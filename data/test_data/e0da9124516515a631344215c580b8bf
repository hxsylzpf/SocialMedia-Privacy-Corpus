  "content": "Dear Ant and Dec, As the contestants on I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here finish off their latest meal of sauteed kangaroo's anus with a witchetty grub foam parfait, now seems as good a time as any to extend to you a belated welcome to Twitter (@antanddec). When you bounded on to Twitter a fortnight ago with a cheery \"Hi Everyone, as of today we're twittering! All through I'm A Celeb, we'll be tweeting from the jungle, quite excited!\", the collective forefinger of Twitter clicked on the follow button enthusiastically. Here is our Twitter wish list for your time spent in the jungle: 1. Get your own separate Twitter accounts. I know you said in the seminal pop classic \"Let's get ready to rumble\" that you're a \"duo, a twosome\" but some things, such as Twitter, are a solo pursuit. 2. Broker peace between the warring Houses of Essex and Barton. In the past week a strange Twitter conflict has broken out between former The Only Way is Essex star Mark Wright (@MarkWright_), who is in I'm A Celeb this year, and ex-Newcastle United player Joey Barton (@joey7barton). Recently, Barton has taken some time off from tweeting Nietzsche quotes to launch a full-on attack on the Essex reality show (\"Where are all these TOWIE maggots, am ready to obliterate them now \u2026 come on, lets have it. #helmets\"). With Mark in the jungle, and Barton a fellow Newcastle fan, maybe you can pour oil on these troubled waters. 3. Get Twitter to suggest jungle tasks. Whatever the production team come up with, Twitter will deliver something 10 times as evil. 4. Embrace Twitter dating. Not you Ant (you're married), but Dec, as you have already noticed, Twitter is a great place for the single to mingle (\"Fave bit of our first 24hrs on here is definitely seeing all your profile pictures out there \u2013 some stunning women on twitter eh!? D\"). Everyone loves to see a Twitter romance unfold. 5. Keep talking to the fans. Whereas some famous tweeters are all \"me me me\", you guys are interacting with other Tweeters continually. This makes you a jewel in the celebrity crown. @scouserachel"
