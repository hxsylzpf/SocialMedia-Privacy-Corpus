  "content": "Google's Code Blog has a very good explanation of what Google's Friend Connect does. Basically, it says: 1. Google Friend Connect puts users in control over whether they're connected to their data on Facebook. 2. Google Friend Connect only reads a small amount of user data from Facebook, and does so using Facebook's public APIs. We read the Facebook numeric id, friendly name, and public photo URLs of the user and their friends. We read no other information. 3. The only user information that we pass from Facebook to third-party applications is the URL of the user's public photo. 4. Google Friend Connect does not permanently store any user data retrieved from Facebook. Google's video shows how the whole thing actually works: Finally, Dare Obasanjo aka Carnage4Life has a brief look at the three similar approaches adopted by Google, Facebook and MySpace.",
