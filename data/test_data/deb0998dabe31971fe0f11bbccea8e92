  "content": "Footballer Rio Ferdinand on Thursday lost his privacy action over a \"kiss and tell\" story published by the Sunday Mirror. The England and Manchester United star was not at the high court in London to hear Mr Justice Nicol dismiss his claim against Sunday Mirror publisher Mirror Group Newspapers. Ferdinand will pay MGN's legal costs. Ferdinand brought his case for misuse of private information over an April 2010 Sunday Mirror article in which interior designer Carly Storey gave her account of their 13-year relationship in return for \u00a316,000. The judge said: \"Overall, in my judgment, the balancing exercise favours the defendant's right of freedom of expression over the claimant's right of privacy.\" After the judge's ruling, Sunday Mirror editor Tina Weaver said in a statement: \"The Sunday Mirror is very pleased that the court has rejected Rio Ferdinand's privacy claim. \"The judge found that there was a justified public interest in reporting the off-pitch behaviour of the then England captain and discussion of his suitability for such an important and ambassadorial role representing the country. \"We are pleased the judge ruled that Mr Ferdinand had perpetuated a misleading public image and the Sunday Mirror was entitled to correct this impression. \"There has never been greater scrutiny of the media than now, and we applaud this ruling in recognising the important role a free press has to play in a democratic society.\" Ferdinand, who has three children with wife Rebecca, had told the judge at an earlier high court hearing that he was \"extremely upset to read the story, particularly because it came out of the blue\". \"It has been stressful and embarrassing for me to have to explain it to fellow professionals as well as family members and friends, and it has inevitably put a strain on my relationship with my wife,\" he said. \"People also started shouting things out at me in the street after the article was published \u2013 things like, 'Where's your new bird?'\" Ferdinand added that he had not met the woman named in the Sunday Mirror story for six years by the time it was published. \"Although I am a well-known person I make a clear distinction between my public and private life and do not seek publicity for my personal life,\" he said. \"I do not see why I should not be entitled to a private life just because I am a famous footballer.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
