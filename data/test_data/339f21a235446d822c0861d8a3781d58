  "content": "Live streaming of the royal wedding will be broadcast on YouTube as part of an arsenal of social networking outlets harnessed by palace officials to bolster the pair's 21st century credentials. With more than 34,000 followers on Twitter, the event will also be chronicled on an official website, as well as on Facebook and the photo-sharing site Flickr, while William's press office is preparing a live blog with commentary. Besides the four-hour live web coverage, including the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, route to Buckingham Palace, and the newlyweds' balcony appearance, there will be a video wedding book \"for the public to sign\". But while massive security is ramping up to prevent disruption at the 29 April event, it appears nigh impossible to prevent a hijacking of the celebrations in the virtual world. \"May their long and happy marriage be the last one of the monarchy of the UK,\" read one of the many, and slightly tamer, comments left on The British Monarchy Facebook page by users not of the royalist camp."
