  "content": "I hear stifled laughter and feet plodding down the stairs. A friend of the oldest one, who spent the night, shouts goodbye and slams the front door. Moments later, the oldest comes into my office with his laptop open, looking glum. \"Look,\" he says. \"He hacked my Facebook account while I was asleep.\" \"What's he done?\" I say. \"He's basically changed my whole profile,\" he says, \"so that I'm Ainsley Harriott.\" He turns the screen around to show me. \"Wow,\" I say. \"He's changed everything \u2013 pictures, biography, information,\" he says. \"He's put my religion as 'Church of Ainsley Harriott'. What do I do?\" \"Get used to it,\" I say. \"This is who you are now.\" That afternoon, my wife and I leave the children behind to attend a 50th birthday. Teatime finds us checking into a boutique hotel in Henley-on-Thames. There is a couple ahead of us in the queue. \"We've upgraded your room to a suite,\" the receptionist says to the couple. \"Why am I always standing behind people who get upgraded?\" my wife asks. Everyone turns to look at her. We are shown to the room we've paid for. \"I feel shifty,\" my wife says. \"Why do I feel shifty? Do you feel shifty?\" I think about this for a moment. \"Yes, I do,\" I say. \"I think it's because, in the past, whenever we've had cause to check into a boutique hotel with evening wear in garment bags, we did it with the arch detachment of two people playing at being grown-ups. But now we're old enough to do it in earnest. This is who we are.\" \"Christ,\" my wife says. We go for a walk through Henley, poking around in charity shops and picking up necessities in Boots. My wife stops at a jewellers to have the missing pin in her watch strap replaced. It takes 15 minutes. The man charges her \u00a33. \"I suppose this is the sort of thing we'll end up doing,\" she says. \"Marching about in the high street together, forcing tradesmen to perform time-consuming services for no money.\" \"We're already doing it,\" I say. \"Nobody's looking at us as if we're too young to behave this way. This is who we are now.\" \"Stop saying that,\" my wife says. In my limited experience, 50th birthday parties seem to engender a last-ditch sense of abandon in attendees. This is certainly my approach and, though my wife and I are seated apart, it's clear she has adopted a similar strategy. When we get back to the hotel, she expresses a strong desire to sleep in her evening wear, shoes and all. I know she has to attend a lunch the next day and has packed just the one dress. I make it my mission to get it off her and on to a hanger. It's a delicate operation, which I think accounts for the small bruise I find on my forehead in the morning. \"Oh God,\" my wife says. \"I'm sure someone put something in my glass last night.\" \"Yeah,\" I say. \"More wine.\" We check out and part company; my wife goes off in the car, and I return to the hotel for breakfast. I sit alone, wearing a jumper with elbow patches and eating eggs benedict while reading the paper with my glasses on the tip of my nose. I find I'm enjoying myself, although I'm glad I'm not sitting opposite a mirror. This, I think, is who you are now. On my walk to the train station, I pull out my phone to check my email. I learn that my friend Ainsley Harriott has posted several new recipes on his Facebook page.",
