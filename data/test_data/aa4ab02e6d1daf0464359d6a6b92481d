  "content": "The Chicago Sun-Times is temporarily closing the comment function below its articles. In a piece titled \"Sick of internet comments? Us, too \u2013 here's what we're doing about it\", managing editor Craig Newman explains that the website had taken the decision while it works on making a better platform for users. He also describes how his staff have grown increasingly disillusioned with negative and critical comments below the line. Although he acknowledes that online debate can often produce interesting and positive results, Newman insists the staff want to create a new kind of discussion on the Sun-Times website. We want to know if you would defend below-the-line (BTL) discussion. What positive things have you seen as a result of internet commentary? Would you agree with the Sun-Times that comments are all too often negative and trollish, or do you belong to strong and productive online communities? Has anyone online ever made your offline life better? Tell us about the merits or otherwise of BTL commenting and share your stories of how online debate has changed your life.",
