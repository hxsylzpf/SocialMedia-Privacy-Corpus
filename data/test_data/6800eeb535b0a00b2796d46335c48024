  "content": "It has drawn unkind comparisons to a desert island castaway and a \"rubbish Doctor Who\", but Jeremy Paxman said yesterday he was still to decide whether he would keep the beard that sparked a Twitter frenzy on Monday night. Paxman heightened interest in the future of his facial hair, which made its TV debut on Monday's Newsnight, by issuing a statement. \"I may keep it or I may shave it off, but I think I'll make my own decision \u2026 I have grown a beard for the last few summers, and suddenly wondered whether I really needed to shave it off to present Newsnight. \"Unless you're lucky enough to be Uncle Albert on Only Fools and Horses, Demis Roussos or Abu Hamza, the BBC is generally as pogonophobic as the late-lamented Albanian dictator, Enver Hoxha.\" The Newsnight host was one of the most talked-about topics on Twitter in the UK when he ditched his clean-shaven look, and by Tuesday his new look had attracted critiques from hundreds of viewers. The comedian Jenny Eclair said the presenter \"looks like he might ride a Harley come the weekend\" and Ian Rankin, the writer, quipped: \"It is 1973 and I'm really digging the new album by Paxman's Beard.\" His fellow Newsnight presenter, Emily Maitlis, added: \"Right that's it. I'm working on a moustache for Thursday's Newsnight.\" Punters could even place a bet on the longevity of Paxman's chin hair, with Ladbrokes making him odds-on at 4-5 to see out the week with the facial accompaniment. Those who think he will downgrade to a goatee can take a punt at 20-1. The BBC, meanwhile, said nothing. The beard had not prompted any complaints from viewers by Tuesday morning",
