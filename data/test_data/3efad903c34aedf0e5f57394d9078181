  "content": "\u2022 Turns out the recent changes at Craigslist to avoid accusations that it was encouraging prostitution weren't enough to take the heat off the site. South Carolina's attorney general is looking at a possible criminal investigation into its affairs, which Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster responded to in uncharacteristically angry fashion: by saying \"Seriously?\" \u2022 MG Siegler at Techcrunch is outraged - outraged - that the \"UK press\" has encouraged a centenarian to join Twitter just so they can write a story about it. By \"UK press\", of course, he actually means The Sun, which delivered a juicy tabloid story that was dutifully followed up with nary a question by Digg-baiting Fleet Street hacks. Fortunately, the only mention we gave to Ivy Bean was in our Media Monkey diary. \u2022 I've been switched off the online world for the past few days in an attempt to explore the weird and wonderful sights of Arizona - but sifting through the links from the weekend, I couldn't help but notice Jack's pointer to The worst album covers ever. Part 1: heavy metal. Yes, it's linkbait. But it's good link bait. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
