  "content": "Rupert Murdoch's daughter has defended the Sun's right to publish pictures of Prince Harry naked, saying it would be \"sad\" if newspapers could not print something that was so freely available on the internet. Elisabeth Murdoch said the Sun's decision to publish, 24 hours after it acquiesced to the demands of St James's Palace not to proceed, was not the \"death of integrity\". \"It would be very sad if you lived in a world where you can't publish that picture,\" she said on Friday, adding that she herself had gone online to \"check out\" the photos when they first emerged on the US showbiz website TMZ. \"We have all seen the pictures online. If newspapers can't participate in that, it asks questions of where print and online go.\" Murdoch, who is chair of the TV production company Shine, which is owned by News Corp, was talking in a formal question and answer session on Friday morning at the Edinburgh International TV Festival after giving the festival keynote speech on Thursday night. She said she felt the prince had been stitched up by the young woman who snapped the shots of him cavorting naked in Las Vegas. \"I feel sad for him \u2013 take the mobile phones away; he's a young guy having fun.\" Around 60 complaints have been made to the press watchdog about the Sun pictures. The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) said all the complaints came from members of the public and none had come from St James's Palace or any other representatives of the prince. The palace said it had no further comment on the matter. The Sun's decision to publish had come after Prince Charles's aides threatened legal action against newspapers if they published the images, even though they had already been circulated online. One of the two pictures of Harry naked is splashed across the paper's front page with the headline: \"Heir it is!\", a day after a male reporter and a female intern posed in a mock-up. In an editorial, the Sun claimed there was a \"clear public interest\" in publishing the photographs \"in order for the debate around them to be fully informed\". It added: \"The photos have potential implications for the prince's image representing Britain around the world. \"There are questions over his security during the Las Vegas holiday. Questions as to whether his position in the army might be affected. Further, we believe Harry has compromised his own privacy.\" The grainy mobile phone pictures of the prince's antics were first published online by TMZ early on Wednesday. Clarence House confirmed their authenticity but royal aides moved quickly to warn British media organisations not to republish the embarrassing photographs, with newspapers complying until the Sun broke ranks on Thursday night. A Press Complaints Commission spokesman said on Thursday: \"This was an editorial decision taken by the Sun. Should the PCC receive a complaint, it will investigate it following normal procedures.\" The Sun's managing editor, David Dinsmore, said the paper had \"thought long and hard\" about whether to use the pictures and said it was an issue of freedom of the press rather than because it was moralising about Harry's actions. He said: \"This is about the ludicrous situation where a picture can be seen by hundreds of millions of people around the world on the internet, but can't be seen in the nation's favourite paper read by 8 million people every day. \"This is about our readers getting involved in discussion with the man who's third in line to the throne, it's as simple as that.\" There was a mixed reaction to the publication of the photos. Media lawyer Mark Stephens said: \"There is no public interest in publishing these pictures, even the Sun can't come up with a public interest in publishing these pictures, and the fact that they are available in foreign media doesn't make English law any less applicable. They have broken the law cynically, and obviously with a view to obtaining publicity.\" Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott said: \"The Sun's actions proves that as of this morning, self-regulation is now dead. This [story] is not in public interest, it is in the self-interest of Murdoch to earn money by breaching the privacy of anyone he wants, to sell his newspapers. \"The argument that just because it is all over the internet is spurious at least. There are lots of offensive images and extreme material on the web which international papers don't print.\" But Louise Mensch, a Conservative member of the culture committee, said: \"There is a clear, demonstrable public interest: the royal family receives money from the civil list; Prince Harry in inviting people to his room [had] the expectation of privacy so there's questions of judgment and questions of security.\""
