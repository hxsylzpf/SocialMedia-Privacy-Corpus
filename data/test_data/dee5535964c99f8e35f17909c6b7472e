  "content": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Thursday June 12 2003 In our report of the Sara Cox case we referred to article 8 of the Human Rights Act. There is no such article. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights was made part of English law by the Human Rights Act. English statutes don't have articles, they have sections. Conventions have articles. ----------------------------- Sara Cox, the Radio 1 disc jockey, has won a landmark human rights case against the tabloid press for invading her privacy by publishing naked pictures of her and her husband on their honeymoon. The legal victory is bound to embarrass the press complaints commission (PCC) because it illustrates that the law can now prove more effective than self-regulation in punishing newspapers. It may inspire other celebrities who are upset by an intrusive press to launch similar actions. Cox's lawyers sued the People newspaper under article 8 of the Human Rights Act, which protects an individual's right to a private life. The settlement agreed in the high court yesterday between the DJ, the People and the photographic agent concerned, Jason Fraser, means she will receive \u00a350,000 in damages. In addition, the People, Fraser and two photographic agencies with which he is associated must pay legal costs that are expected to total more than \u00a3200,000. Cox was delighted with the result, but bitter about the People having shown her nude on its front page and a two further pages. \"They have ruined all memories of my honeymoon for the rest of my life.\" The case has a special significance because she is the first person to have won an apology through the PCC and then gone on to sue. In setting such a precedent she opens the way for other complainants to win apologies or adjudications and then seek legal redress. It also calls into question the PCC's ability to prevent the tabloids from misbehaving, with echoes of the period of Diana, Princess of Wales, when the papers ignored all attempts to restrain them. Cox was outraged when the People published the pictures of her and her husband, Jon Carter, in October 2001. The couple were honeymooning in a secluded villa on a private island in the Seychelles which only admits paying guests. They were swimming and sunbathing when they were snapped by a paparazzo who had been sent by Fraser, a photographer who also acts as an agent. Fraser offered the pictures to other tabloids, which rejected them, before he sold them to the then editor of the People, Neil Wallis, who was also a member of the PCC. Cox was still abroad when the pictures were published and her agent complained to the PCC. It was considered a blatant breach of the editors' code of practice, which forbids the use of pictures taken when a person is in a private place. The PCC's director, Guy Black, helped to negotiate a 63-word apology, which was placed at the top of page three in the following week's issue of the People. Cox's advisers agreed the wording and the placement, but remained unhappy, believing that it did not recompense her for the hurt she suffered. She then sued. Several commentators were surprised that, despite the apology, the People escaped censure because the breach was regarded as so blatant. Wallis was widely criticised by other editors who rejected his argument that Cox, by often speaking about her private life in the media had compromised her right to privacy. Wallis blamed the photographer for failing to tell him that the couple were on a private beach. An angry Fraser replied that he had told Wallis how the pictures were taken. As part of the settlement, the People, Fraser and the agencies must destroy or delete all copies of the pictures, including electronic images. Wallis has since quit the People to become deputy editor of the News of the World. He remains on the PCC. The commission's director, Guy Black, was adamant that the PCC had acted properly. \"We sorted out this matter speedily and with the full consent of Cox's agent,\" he said. \"We never ducked or dodged.\""
