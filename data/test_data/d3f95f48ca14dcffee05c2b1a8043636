  "content": "Prince Harry has criticised \"incessant\" intrusions into his private life, saying the line between his public and private life had become almost non-existent. \"We will continue to do our best to ensure that there is the line,\" he told Andrew Marr in a BBC interview to mark the opening in Florida of the Invictus Games, of which he is patron, for injured military personnel and veterans. \"Everyone has a right to privacy.\" Even, he made clear, the peculiarly privileged private life of a 31-year-old prince. He and the other members of the royal family, he said, were \"completely aware\" of it. \"I will spend the rest of my life earning that privilege and trying to bring a spotlight on to things and causes that really matter to me, and hopefully matter to other people as well. \"Everyone has a right to their privacy, and a lot of the members of the public get it, but sadly in some areas there is this incessant need to find out every little bit of detail about what goes on behind the scenes. It's unnecessary.\" He added: \"The private life has to be private and I hope people respect that.\" The prince had already complained, in a Sunday Times interview, that he had \"massive paranoia\" about women, because of the media intrusion. \"Even if I talk to a girl, that person is then suddenly my wife, and people go knocking on her door.\" The opening ceremony of the Invictus Games in Orlando, Florida, will be attended by the US first lady , Michelle Obama, and celebrities including the film star Morgan Freeman and the singer James Blunt. The five-day games will be contested by more than 500 athletes from 15 countries. Addressing accusations of being workshy that have dogged him and his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, this year, Harry said that he did not get satisfaction from doing nothing. \"I don't get any satisfaction from sitting at home on my arse,\" he said. The royal said he wanted a job after leaving the army but could not find one with which he could combine his royal duties. After leaving the military, he found most jobs he looked at \"were not going to work\" combined with royal duties and some jobs were \"not even on the table\". Harry has been outspoken in his support of veterans, saying he thought the government could do more to help them, and wants to continue to champion sport despite his body being \"ruined\" after 10 years of service."
