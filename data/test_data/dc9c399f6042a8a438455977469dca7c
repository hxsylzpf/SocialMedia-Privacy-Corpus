  "content": "Several years ago I had to explain to a leading professional cyclist precisely why it was that the media and hardcore cycling fans were so determined to remain sceptical, in some cases in a very vocal way, about performances that stood out and about explanations that did not quite fit. The analogy I used was that of someone who had suspected for years that their partner was being unfaithful but had continually given him or her the benefit of the doubt, before eventually being presented with conclusive proof. With that experience in recent memory, you would be pretty damn careful about putting your faith in anyone else; when you spotted anything bordering on the suspicious your antennae would be sensitive, your emotions raw, your fear of being caught out again intense. My interlocutor got the point, although the fact that the explanation needed to be made says much about the distance in thought process between top sportspeople and those who follow them. Since the Fancy Bears hacking team released details of Sir Bradley Wiggins's therapeutic use exemption certificates for triamcinolone, I have had to look for a different analogy. The vexed question of just where the moral boundaries are drawn between being prudent, evading tax and avoiding tax seems uncannily similar to the question of what TUEs are acceptable and what aren't, and in what circumstances. The facts of the case presented by Wiggins to the Guardian this week \u2013 details of his allergies and asthma, the timelines of specialists visits, TUE applications and so on \u2013 backed up by speaking to some of those close to him, make it clear that the strict letter of the anti-doping rules was followed, hence his use of the corticosteroid triamcinolone was within the rules at the time. The objective in visiting Wiggins this week was not to be judge, jury and executioner. I wanted to get what facts I could and build a complete idea of what had taken place and when, to get much clarity as possible. Hence the decision \u2013 with the cyclist's agreement \u2013 to run the interview in full on this newspaper's website. The picture painted tallies with what has become clear over the years: while even the best cycling teams look perfectly run on the surface, and like that impression to persist, in reality they are often scrabbling around holding it all together; in that context it makes sense that Wiggins didn't see his doctor for weeks at a key time in the season, visited a specialist at the last moment, and the first TUE was put together overnight. The use of Kenalog by injection to treat hay fever is a vexed one but the two GPs I spoke to \u2013 one from within the world of cycling, one from without \u2013 had few qualms about it. Until the NHS changed their guidelines a few years ago, you might give it to a student suffering from allergies before exams, and if you did, you might well do so shortly before the first paper. On the other hand, I cannot recall that any overt trace of Wiggins's allergy/asthma problem broke the surface in the eight years when I spoke quite frequently to him, often at some length. Had it done so, I would have ensured we discussed it when collaborating on his account of the years 2010-12 in the book My Time. I would have expected at least a passing mention followed perhaps by an immediate caveat that this should not be discussed right now, but the best I can manage is a vague recollection of something that may or may not have been said in 2009 about one rainy Tour stage through the Vosges mountains. This is by no means because one expects to be privy to every secret but because Wiggins was not always a guarded character when it came to things cycling-related. However, there were areas of his life we never discussed, primarily those away from bike races, so an absence of evidence may be noticeable but it is not incriminating in itself. Given that his doctors are bound by confidentiality, only a comprehensive trawl of those who had close contact with him over the last 12 years would show how visible his problems were to outsiders. The time line is consistent, although there are mistakes that imply a looseness with detail among those dealing with the paperwork: the rider himself cannot be blamed for those. Here Lady Bracknell's law applies: one mistake you might expect, more than that is a concern, not in this specific case, but more generally given how important and sensitive the process is. The question of Dr Geert Leinders intrigues, as it has done since the end of 2012, hence my decision to press Wiggins over the nature of the contact he had had with the controversial doctor and what Leinders might have known. This was not the first time I had questioned him about the Belgian and the line remains consistent to the point of being unbreakable. The key question about Leinders' involvement is whether his hiring represented a major switch in Sky's marginal gains philosophy, well beyond the team's decision to ditch its founding philosophy on zero tolerance. While acknowledging that there have never been any allegations of improper practice relating to Leinders's spell at Sky, the Wiggins imbroglio prompts the obvious question: was this event an outlier or was it part of a pattern? For most individuals, gut feeling is the ultimate decider on your personal position on moral spectra such as these; to return to the tax analogy, you either believe it is acceptable to have a flat in Monaco to use as a tax address, or it's fine for an MP to \"flip\" a residence, or you don't. In cycling terms, the question I ask myself is this: if one of the young cyclists I advise was in the position Wiggins describes, and was to ask my view on whether he should do the same thing, which side of the line would I fall? I would advise against, for all it might be within the rules and a GP might justify it, simply because of the broader issues involved. The substance has too much resonance for me as a cyclist. Beyond my personal view, higher up the sporting food chain, reputational issues come into play as well; remaining within the letter of the law is one thing but with a certain stature comes a responsibility to remain within its spirit, too. You cannot travel into the grey area where Wiggins and Sky ventured in 2011-13 and expect your moral credibility to remain unscarred."
