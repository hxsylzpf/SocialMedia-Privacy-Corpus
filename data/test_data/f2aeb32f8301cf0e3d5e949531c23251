  "content": "A caterpillar birthday cake \u2013 how plebby is that? You may think that Conservatives have gold-plated g\u00e2teaux delivered from Harrods. You may think that David Cameron's well-heeled colleagues would give him a marble caryatid bought from the Frieze Masters art fair for his birthday. But no, foreign secretary William Hague and chief of staff Ed Llewellyn present their leader with a kid's chocolate cake and a facetious card in this picture that Cameron posted from the Conservative conference on his recently opened Twitter account. Laughing with genuine friendship and high spirits (this is a sop to those who bemoan the reading of every image of Torydom as yet another revelation of the dark heart of the blue beast) in a spontaneous moment at a conference hotel, the lads are none too laddish. The softness of these well-educated chaps comes through, their essential gentility. Smart in identical white shirts, immaculately groomed, at a white tablecloth, their laughter is exuberant, hearty, and yet \u2026 posh. Even in a picture that was posted presumably to reveal the intimate matey side of David Cameron, he and his team come across as well-brought-up public schoolboys sharing a funny birthday cake in the dorm. This week David Cameron tackled the class issue that has come to bedevil his government, addressing the issue of his Eton education head-on in his speech at the Conservative party conference. He is privileged, but he longs to spread that privilege \u2013 that's his new line. Now speculation is rife that he will soon sack Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell whose alleged use of the word \"plebs\" in a tirade at the gates of Downing Street has suggested such a nasty side to the wealthy, public school character of the Conservative leadership. Yet as this photograph shows, the class character of Cameron and co is an ambiguous and doubleheaded reality. They look posh here. But they also look nice, don't they? Their good upper-crust manners make them less egregiously masculine than they might otherwise be \u2013 would they be more likeable if the table was lined with beer cans and the cake portrayed a woman in lingerie? Not that I am saying that's how the plebs celebrate. Class \u2013 it really is a toxic subject. The point is, class made Cameron popular in his early days. Being posh cast him as a Jane Austen beau in contrast to Gordon Brown's Emily Bront\u00eb antihero. This picture of three posh boys who can josh with one another without swearing or getting their shirts dirty is a warning to Labour and its allies not to be too confident about playing the class card. It might backfire. The nation's favourite TV drama is Downton Abbey. The Queen, by definition the poshest person in Britain, is its best-loved human being. That love also encompasses the younger royals, whose lives are adored by newspaper and magazine readers in all their aristocratic loveliness. Public schools? The reason they thrive is that a lot of British people dream of sending their kids there. Cameron's government deserves to fail because of its dim-witted Bertie Wooster grasp of economics. It will not be defeated by class hate, because by and large the British do not hate the upper class. Visit any stately home on a weekend. Lots of people are seduced by these nice chaps in proper shirts and would love to share a chocolate cake with them."
