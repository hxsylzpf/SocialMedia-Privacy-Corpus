Some rights reserved A burst of 6 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Can Martha teach the government not to think it's Google? &gt;&gt; Labour Uncut Fascinating insight from Tom Watson about life inside the Cabinet Office under the previous Labour administration. Such as: \"During my time at the cabinet office, not a day went by where there wasn't a Jim Hacker moment. \"The problem with Google, minister\" said the very high up IT man \"is that it doesn't find the pages we want people to read.\" His solution was for the government to develop it's own search algorithm in order to give citizens the information the government wanted them to find. \"I tried to put a stop to it of course, though I was never confident they actually did.\" And lots more, and thoughtful. Must-read. One million users and counting &gt;&gt; instagr.am Having started on 8 October, the mobile photo sharing site already has 1m users, and shows no sign of slowing down. The question now: what next? RIM thought iPhone was impossible in 2007 &gt;&gt; Electronista \"RIM in particular assumed from the start that smartphones would be outgrowths of its pagers and that there would never be enough battery life or wireless technology for more functions. It started growing beyond this view before the iPhone shipped, but the OS foundation until recently was based on the early assumption.\" Read more: http://www.electronista.com/articles/10/12/27/rim.thought.apple.was.lying.on.iphone.in.2007/#ixzz19RADHvJF Mozilla accidentally publishes user IDs and passwords hashes &gt;&gt; Naked Security About 44,000 users' IDs and passwords leaked, but Mozilla's logs say only one person - the one who reported the fault - accessed the data. \"If you are a web site administrator/developer, are you still storing passwords using methods like Gawker (DES) or Mozilla (MD5)? We know they are broken and it is important to migrate away from these algorithms in case you have a database accidentally make its way outside of your organization. \"Mozilla made the right decision in 2009 to begin using a much more secure system (SHA-512 with per-user salts) moving forward, but in hindsight might have prompted all of their users to migrate to the more secure hash before this incident.\" A call for quality HTML5 demo markup &gt;&gt; Mozilla Hacks \"Right now there are two things to get really excited about in HTML5: the richer, more meaningful semantics of new elements and the APIs that give us deep access into the workings of the browser and the operating system. The former allows us to build much richer interfaces and the latter allows us to build much more complex applications. \"All of this comes with the awesome of view source (or check in development tools) for debugging. You can advocate HTML5 by writing clean and useful markup. You can kill it by treating the markup as a second class citizen which is only there to serve the script.\" With examples. Read. US govt a big user of Amazon web services &gt;&gt; Scripting News Interesting point by Dave Winer: Amazon Web Services in its annual newsletter touts how the US government is putting more of its services onto Amazon. Was the dropping of Wikileaks so coincidental? You can follow Guardian Technology's linkbucket on delicious To suggest links, tag articles on delicious.com with \"guardiantech\"",
