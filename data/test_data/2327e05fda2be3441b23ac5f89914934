  "content": "Hugh Grant, Elizabeth Hurley and her husband Arun Nayar have accepted \u00a358,000 in damages in a legal case over photos taken while they were on holiday. The trio accepted the damages payment for an invasion of privacy over the pictures, which were taken when they were staying at a private resort in the Maldives. Pictures agencies Big Pictures and Eliot SARL will pay the compensation, with \"contributions\" from Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, and News Group Newspapers, which publishes the Sun and News of the World. Grant, Hurley and Nayar were represented by their solicitor, Laura Tyler, at London's high court today for the settlement of the legal action. \"It has been most upsetting for the claimants to have their privacy invaded by these defendants,\" Tyler said. Tyler told Mr Justice Eady that the photos were taken covertly without the trio's knowledge while they were on holiday in a resort, which they had chosen for the complete privacy and seclusion it offered. She added that the picture agencies had also apologised unequivocally and had agreed to pay some of the claimants' legal costs. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
