  "content": "Facebook's policy to force users to install a separate Messenger app on their smartphones hasn't been popular. However, there is a quick trick on an iPhone to stop Facebook installing Messenger and continue chatting using the normal Facebook app. Not all Facebook users are being forced to use the Messenger app, as the change is rolling out gradually. Eventually every mobile Facebook user will face the decision of whether or not to install the separate app. All iPhone users have to do avoid this unpopular decision is to hit the install Messenger button when prompted by the standard Facebook app, but switch to the App Store while the Messenger app is being installed and stop the installation or delete the app. Re-opening the standard Facebook app should have chat available in Messages, as before Facebook's attempts to try to force Messenger on users. The trick should work for now, but Facebook could easily update its apps for better detection of Messenger and remove the little work around. Jailbreak or resort to Facebook in the browser Those on an iPhone that decide to jailbreak have other options with at least one free hack available that forces the Facebook app to ignore the separate Messenger app to allow chatting on the social network through the main Facebook app. Jailbreaking is a process that allows users to override certain security protocols on an iPhone to allow installation of applications from stores outside of Apple's App Store, like the Cydia store, but is not an option for most users. Another alternative for those trying to escape the clutches of Facebook Messenger is to use the Facebook mobile website, which allows users to chat as well as access most of the other features of the Facebook app but from within a mobile browser on an iPhone or Android. Placing a bookmark for the Facebook mobile site on the smartphone's home screen makes it behave similarly to an app \u2013 lacking some features and push notifications of messages \u2013 but also helps avoid battery drain issues some users experience with the dedicated Facebook app. If you have another trick or tip to avoid being forced to use Facebook Messenger, short of just ceasing use of Facebook, share it below. Have you installed Facebook Messenger on your smartphone?",
