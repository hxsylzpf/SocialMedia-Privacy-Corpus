  "content": "When Robert Scoble Tweeted the birth of his son Milan in September 2007, it was still early days for Twitter and nobody quite knew what to make of the real-time text updates, photos and even audio of his first cry. (The baby's, not his father's...) Eighteen months down the road to mainstream Twitterdom, it's far less alarming when photographer Christian Payne, or Documentally, is describing the birth of his son. It's not a one-way exchange but a conversation (and one I'm now personally interested in...) in his group of friends and followers about his experiences. By the time his wife gave birth in the early hours of this morning, it's not the outrageously invasive scenario you might assume because all the people in his network are friends or contacts. He's also considerate of his wife's privacy, mostly using audio, and has been flooded with messages from friends and colleagues congratulating him. But the interesting thing for me is the legacy he has created. At a tech breakfast meeting this morning, American 'social media-ist' Jeff Pulver spoke briefly about the humanity of social media, describing how real personalities, people and exchanges make for a more trustworthy environment - not just for advertisers, as we often hear, but for all of us. It's a world of understanding away from that lazy assumption that social media replaces real-world communication, and he is absolutely right when he says that social media encourages positive connections between people who might not have met otherwise. I challenge you not to well up a little when you listen: My Mum recently showed me her doctor's notes and a thick folder of cards from her friends when I was born. It was a delight, but a world away from what Documentally has just created for his son. How fascinated his child will be to read all this when he has his own children - and how very different the world will be again."
