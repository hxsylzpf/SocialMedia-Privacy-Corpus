  "content": "The mother of a young woman left for dead after a stabbing attack almost seven years ago has told the Leveson inquiry the Press Complaints Commission failed to stop \"incredibly intrusive\" reporting of the tragedy despite being asked to intervene. Baroness Hollins, whose daughter Abigail Witchalls was left paralysed by the knife attack, said on Thursday that journalists stalked the family in the waiting room of the hospital, camped outside her daughter's house, followed her going about her daily life and \"fabricated\" stories laced with \"inaccuracies\". Hollins said the News of the World revealed to the world her daughter was five weeks pregnant when attacked in a story headlined \"New shock in Abi attack: knife mum was pregnant\". At the time Witchalls was in intensive care unaware she was pregnant. \"There are two issues. One was how on earth did they know, but the other one was what was, what were they doing publicising something so personal and intimate? No woman tells the world that she's pregnant when she's five weeks pregnant, you know? That just felt very hard,\" said Hollins. Hollins went through a litany of stories she felt were \"fabricated\" or inaccurate and other instances of invasion of privacy, saying it compounded the \"task\" her family were facing looking after their critically ill daughter. In one report in 2009 the Sun had reported \"Stab victim Abigail Witchalls regains her speech four years after knife attack left her paralysed\", when in fact Witchalls had regained her speech once taken off a ventilator in 2005. \"I thought we had more right to privacy,\" Hollins told the inquiry. In her written evidence to the inquiry, she said the \"Mail was the worst culprit\". Hollins recounted how her daughter was followed by the press after her baby was born and how a journalist was ejected from her son's school sports day. \"I mean, a school sports day: small children, a journalist, uninvited, incognito and trying to take photographs, was asked to leave and in fact did leave, but had apparently followed them there when they'd gone out,\" said Hollins. Twice she went to the PCC \u2013 once to complain about reporters, who she believed to be from the Daily Mail, camped outside her daughter's house \"in a car parked 50 yards away for six hours a day for three or four weeks\". Hollins said the PCC told her in order to take action it would need to know the name of the journalists and have evidence of anything that had been published. She said she formed the view complaining was \"too difficult\" because the PCC was interested in specifics, when \"our distress about press intrusion was not about one particular incident, it was about hundreds of incidents\". The life peer is the first victim of alleged press intrusion to appear at the Leveson inquiry since November, when celebrities such as Sienna Miller and Charlotte Church detailed harassment by the paparazzi and the tabloid press. Hollins told Leveson that her daughter \"is and always has been a very private person with no wish for celebrity status\", but she wrote to the inquiry to have her case heard because her family wanted her experience put on record. The inquiry heard that press interest was so intense they needed police guards on each door of the hospital ward to protect her privacy in the days after the attack, as there were journalists masquerading as visitors in the waiting room listening for any signs of an update. \"We began to joke there must be bugs in the flowers because things that we talked about the waiting room would appear in the papers the next day,\" Hollins said. At one point the family were offered \u00a3300,000 by a newspaper but she told Leveson she turned it down because she thought it was \"wrong\" to sell a story about her daughter. \"We were looking to minimise the press coverage,\" she said. Hollins, who is a professor of psychiatry, said at one point she considered resigning her post as president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists because all the media were interested in was her as her \"daughter's mother\". Leveson said her testimony was evidence that the family had been \"targets of press intrusion\" and felt there \"was no remedy apart from bartering away your privacy\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
