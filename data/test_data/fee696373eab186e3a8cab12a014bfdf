  "content": "Gone Girl Gillian Flynn I always take walks in the middle of my writing day. I remember one day I came home and looked at my front door and thought how nice and safe it was. Then I thought: what if I came home and the door was open in the middle of the day? That was the moment. At the time, I had a slightly awful addiction to true crime shows. The bad guy was often the husband. And so I thought, what if a husband came home from work and saw his front door wide open, and realised his wife wasn't just taking out the garbage: that there was something ominous about it. And what if the husband wasn't the bad guy \u2013 at least not all bad. No story comes to you in full form. Gone Girl changed hugely when I was writing it. I actually had to reverse engineer Amy. I wrote the whole first part of the book from Nick's point of view and Amy's voice wasn't there. The \"cool girl\" section at the beginning started out as a writing exercise when I was trying to figure out who Amy was. I went through several different endings in my head \u2013 should the drifters from the Ozarks recognise Amy and come back to get her? Should someone kill her? In the end, I felt that Nick and Amy deserved each other and were sort of addicted to each other. All first drafts are jagged and wrong, but working as a journalist for 10 years demystified the writing process for me. I never expected some muse to come down and fix everything. I knew I had to figure it out myself. There are plenty of people who are great writers who are not published only because they get discouraged by that first draft \u2013 and I promise you, they are all bad. I had tonnes of doubts with Gone Girl. I had written a book with no one to root for, about two very twisted people in a twisted love affair. It's unconventional \u2013 you find out who did it in the middle instead of at the end. I liked the story and luckily my editors did too, but none of us were entirely sure people would flock to it. We definitely didn't feel: we've got this made, we can just sit back and watch it go. Booksellers are a great indicator because they read everything, and from very early on we knew they were liking it. In the end, it entered at number two on the New York Times bestseller list, and within a week hit number one. I'm wary of trying to repeat my success. I'm going to write other great books, but there's never going to be another Gone Girl. That was just pure lightning in a bottle and I was lucky to be there for it. As told to Becky Barnicoat The Grownup by Gillian Flynn is out now Gogglebox Tania Alexander The idea for Gogglebox came out of something our head of development said about watching his family's reaction to the London riots in 2011. We talked about how interesting it would be to get households around Britain to react to the week's telly and news. I remember thinking \"God, it's really simple\". I could immediately picture how the whole thing would look, like a screengrab of the Royle Family. Harry Hill's TV Burp was coming off air and I thought, imagine blending those two shows and using real people, who are often a lot funnier than anything scripted. Usually it takes me a while to work something out. I go through about a thousand questions in my head and there's a lot of \"yes, but\" conversations. But with Gogglebox, I could see exactly how it would work right from the start. We pitched it to Channel 4. We hadn't worked loads on it but we had this sense that it was a neat idea. Afterwards, the head of factual programming stuck his head back round the door and said: \"If no one else is interested in that people-watching-telly idea\u2026\" They gave us the money to shoot a pilot and away we went. That's when we started to realise what we had. One of the producers asked a daughter in the pilot: \"What does the BBC stand for?\" meaning, what do you think its values are? But she replied: \"I dunno. Is it, like, British Broadcasting Incorporated?\" You couldn't have scripted it. It could still have been an absolute disaster. Before the first show aired, the papers were saying things like \"Channel 4 has run out of ideas\" and \"Is this the end of civilisation as we know it?\" It was being pulled apart on Twitter. The secret is the casting. The people we've got are extraordinary. A lot of the time you cast people for their back story but with this I knew the only thing that mattered was how they reacted to TV. So we'd walk into hairdressers' or bridge clubs (which is where we found Leon and June) and hold up pictures of David Cameron or a Daily Mail headline and see how they'd react. It instantly revealed the dynamics: who was the loudmouth, who rolled their eyes. We try to keep the cast as normal as possible. Once they become celebrities in their own right and start showing up at film premieres, you lose the integrity. When we started, we had around 700,000 viewers. The first episode of the current series pulled in around 7.5 million. People love it because at its heart, it's a warm show. We're not nasty. The rule is: don't have a go at each other, celebrities are fair game and say what you want about politicians. And it works. As told to Rosie Ifould The Knork Mike Miller Teenage embarrassment gave me the idea. I was 14 and had just finished a basketball game, and a big group of us had gone out for pizza. I realised that if I picked up my pizza, I risked spilling sauce down myself in front of the girls. The only alternative was to use the cheap plastic fork I'd been given. I tried turning it on its side and pressing down on the crust but all I ended up with was smushed-up pizza. I could see the chef in the kitchen had one of those big pizza cutters, and that's when the idea of the Knork was born. I went home and lay in bed with a notebook, writing down my ideas and sketching a fork with a thin, rounded, \"rocking\" edge and a \"finger platform\" allowing the user to apply pressure without discomfort. The name came to me that same night \u2013 I'd invented something that combined a knife and a fork. In those days, it was difficult to check if someone had come up with an idea before. So I wrote it down and posted it to myself in case I ever needed to provide dated proof I'd come up with it \u2013 a \"poor man's patent\". I still have the unopened envelope. It wasn't until years later that I returned to the idea. I was at university studying medicine but I often spoke about my invention, to the extent that classmates referred to me as \"the Knork dork\". Eventually, I thought: \"I don't want to be that guy who has an amazing idea and never does anything about it,\" so I quit university and started to work on it, using the remaining money in my college fund to help pay for it. I made a series of prototypes, adjusting the design of my mother's regular forks using car body filler and sandpaper. I spent a lot of time studying people eating. I'd order food in a restaurant and then sit and take notes, trying not to get noticed. I was amazed at how many different ways there were to hold a fork. I took my first order in 2003 and everyone who used the Knork became an instant convert. 12 years on, it's a multimillion dollar company and we sell all over the world. I see no reason why the Knork won't become the standard fork design, in time \u2013 it really does feel like the next stage of evolution. As told to Chris Broughton Tangle Teezer Shaun Palfrey I'd been working as a hair stylist and over the years I had mastered detangling hair, but when I tried to teach other people my technique they found it difficult. I sat down and tried to work out how I was using the brush and the comb differently, and when I did that I realised I needed a product that was the complete opposite of what was already out there. It needed to be like a brush and comb in one. At the time, I wasn't thinking \"I've got a multimillion-pound vision for a business\". All I was thinking was \"I've got an idea for a brush\". I went down to four days a week at the salon and spent the rest of my time in coffee shops or at the British Library researching things like polymers and manufacturers. I was extremely single-minded about it. It still took me two years and around \u00a398,000 of my own money to get it to market. I remortgaged my flat. It was a lot of hard work but I don't think I faltered once, I just knew I had to keep going. My mum was very ill at the same time, so in a way I think her battling that illness put all my worries into perspective. The first prototype worked better than anything I could have imagined. From there it just grew and grew. Being rejected on Dragons' Den gave it a bloody good kickstart in terms of the recognition \u2013 as soon as the show aired the website crashed from the number of orders. But it was at the first trade fairs that I really knew it was going to be a success. People were stealing the demo brushes. We now sell 750,000 a month \u2013 that's about 19 a minute. It's all very well having a good idea but if you want success, you've got to have the confidence to make it a reality. I left school with no qualifications but I've always had that drive to push myself. CB The selfie stick Wayne Fromm I've been fascinated with photography since I was a kid. I used to develop my own prints and experimented with Polaroids and early video cameras. In 2002 I took my daughter on holiday to Italy. I wanted photos of us together but if you take it yourself you always end up with a head off centre. In the end, we'd wait for a passerby who looked savvy enough to use my digital camera, then explain what we wanted usually without a common language. Then we had to deal with people walking in front of us while the photo was being taken. I just thought: \"There has to be an easier way.\" It took about 100 prototypes to get it right. Every pin, spring, lever and gear had to be up to the job. I wanted each one to last 20 years and be able to withstand use under the sea or in the heat of the Sahara. It wasn't the first time someone had come up with the idea of sticking a camera on the end of a pole \u2013 the BBC claims to have unearthed a picture showing a couple using a selfie stick in the 1920s. Originally, I called it The Quik Pod Extendable Monopod \u2013 we only started using the term \"selfie stick\" when it became part of the lexicon. The first take-up happened in the extreme sport community \u2013 it was really popular with skiers, paragliders and divers. Sales have grown every year since launch but one of the problems I've encountered is cheap, rip-off selfie sticks \u2013 it's too time-consuming to go after any but the most blatant copycats. But money was never my main motivation. I'm far more interested in creating a world where families have good pictures in which everyone is present. In earlier decades, one of the parents tended to be the \"designated photographer\" and was often all but invisible in their photo albums. Now, for the first time, everyone can always be present. CB Aleksandr the meerkat Darren Walsh The original idea came from an A4 piece of paper sent to me from the ad agency, which outlined a very tenuous premise. Essentially, it was, \"If you say Compare the Market in a dodgy Russian accent it sounds a bit like meerkat\". I jumped on it. I thought, \"This has the potential to be completely off the wall and hilarious\". I started coming up with the back story for a Russian meerkat, Aleksander, a real Hugh Heffner-type show off. In the first script, the last word was just 'simple', but Simon Greenall who does the voice turned it into 'simples' with the little squeak at the end. It's now in the Oxford English Dictionary. Competitors in the industry quickly followed suit by creating their own characters. A successful campaign like this brings new pressures. Everyone wants to repeat the experience, but really it was a happy accident. RI Emoji Shigetaka Kurita It was the 1990s, and we were designing a new online language to use in text messages. Before mobile phones in Japan, we used to have pagers called Pocket Bells. They were cheap and really popular among young people, partly because they had a heart symbol. I knew that symbols absolutely had to be part of any texting service. The original emoji were black and white and very simple. I drew inspiration from symbols used in weather forecasts. At first there were 200, for things like food, drink and feelings \u2013 including the heart, of course. Now there are over 1,000. I didn't think emoji would spread and become so popular internationally. When I'm introduced as the man who invented emoji, people are taken aback. Emoji is incredibly useful because it transcends language \u2013 sometimes a single emoji can say more than words. As told to Justin McCurry Bananagrams Rena Nathanson My whole family loves to play games. We make games out of everything: \"Will that piece of cucumber float? Get a bowl, let's find out.\" My mother is a prop and stage designer, and we grew up in a very creative environment. We love word-based games but wanted something that all three generations could play together. We came up with this idea for a fast-paced game where you race other players to see who can use up all their letters by making grids of words. Everyone got involved. It was my dad who said, \"This game is driving me bananas.\" And so the name stuck. My mother designed the banana pouch, based on the old pencil case we'd been using to hold the letter tiles in. We started playing Bananagrams with friends and family, and they were all saying: \"You guys should do something with this.\" The first 500 prototypes went instantly. I said to my dad: \"Why don't we go to a games fair and see what happens.\" The response was crazy. It helped that our stall was fun and loud, and we were all playing Bananagrams. As soon as other people started playing they loved it. We could see it was special. We've sold around seven million games so far. I don't think any of us are thinking that we'll come up with the next Bananagrams. I always ask myself: \"How did we get so lucky?\" RI The Cronut Dominique Ansel I started in kitchens when I was barely 16. My parents didn't have much money but I found a cookery school. I spent some time in the military and then I worked for the French bakery Fauchon, and Daniel Boulud in New York, before I opened my own bakery in Soho in 2011. Someone pointed out that we didn't have any kind of donut on the menu. I said OK, let's try it. But I'm French, I don't know about donuts. Let me work with a texture I grew up with \u2013 the croissant. I spent the next two months experimenting. The dough itself is not croissant dough, there's a different ratio of ingredients. I wanted it to be light but I didn't want to change the flavour. When I finally found the right balance, it had the perfect texture \u2013 the crunch on the outside, the flaky layers within. The team always tastes new recipes together. They said: \"Yeah, it's good. It should go on the menu.\" After that everything happened really fast. By chance, a blogger for Grub Street (New York magazine's restaurant blog) came into the shop and tried the Cronut. He put it on the blog. Then he called me \u2013 overnight, there had been more than 140,000 links to his blog post. He said: \"I think you should make a few more.\" The first day I made 30. The next, 45. By the third day we had more than 100 people queuing and the craze began. The line stretched back over four blocks. The enthusiasm is still as strong. Most days we have a line of between 100-180 people, no matter the weather. We serve them hot chocolate while they're queuing. I don't take this success for granted. We have auctioned Cronuts to raise thousands for food banks and food charities here in New York. I believe in creativity and in innovation. We're always thinking about how we can impress, how we can touch people with food, so we never stop inventing. I get inspired by all kinds of things \u2013 by art, by painting. Recently I was looking at nail art on Instagram. The details, the colour, the mix of techniques are fascinating. Maybe some day I will glaze a cake and be reminded of those details. Baking's still pretty much the same wherever you go: bakeries are mostly French, Italian or German. It's not like cooking, where you have chefs from all kinds of backgrounds fusing different foods. So this is just the beginning. There's plenty of room to grow. RI Aerobie Alan Adler I wasn't in the toy business \u2013 I was an electronics engineer and what you might call a casual Frisbee user. I'd occasionally throw one and I always thought: \"This could be so much better.\" I had to spend a lot of time studying the physics of flying and spinning objects. That's one of the most fun parts of inventing \u2013 you don't need to be an expert, you just learn the science to make a project work. The first flying ring I produced was called the Skyro and was inspired by a Punjabi weapon called a chakram. Testing the prototype was a jaw-dropping moment \u2013 the ring spun away from me and just kept going. I knew I could do better, though, and in 1984 I unveiled the Aerobie. It could fly much farther \u2013 in 2003, one was thrown 1,333 feet (405m), a record that remains unbroken to this day. That's a problem I haven't overcome \u2013 people throw them too far. A guy I know once climbed a tree in Palo Alto to retrieve his Aerobie and while he was up there he found two more. Perhaps that accounts for the high sales figures? An old friend came up to me and said: \"Alan, those rings of yours are great. I've lost 10 of 'em.\" CB Tinder Sean Rad I had been thinking for years about how humans communicate. I kept thinking about the fact that when you want to meet somebody new you don't know if they want to meet you back. You have to walk up to them and you don't know if you'll get rejected. When we launched Tinder, users clicked on a red \"x\" to dismiss or green \"heart\" to select potential matches. Jon, my co-founder, came up with the swipe a couple of weeks later. He was inspired by the action of dealing a pack of cards. It is the way people act in the real world \u2013 you look at somebody in a room, they look at you back and you take it from there. People got it straight away. The best ideas come about as part of a group. If you come up with an interesting idea, I'll tell you it sucks or it's great and here are the reasons why \u2013 I can't do that on my own. CB And the best of the rest ... Joy Mangano, the Miracle Mop A mop that can be wrung out without getting your hands wet might not sound much of a miracle but it turned out to be one for its inventor, Joy Mangano. She sold 18,000 mops in her first 20 minutes on QVC in 1992 and was making more than $1m a year from mops by 1995. Now Jennifer Lawrence is playing her in a forthcoming biography, Joy. Lonnie Johnson, the Super Soaker Water fights turned into full-scale wars in 1991 when the Super Soaker went on sale. The ultimate water pistol \u2013 which uses air pressure generated by arm-pumping to shoot further and faster \u2013 was invented by Nasa engineer Lonnie Johnson. He sold 2m water guns in the first year, total sales now top $1bn \u2013 and it was Michael Jackson's favourite toy. Cheong Choon Ng, Loom Bands Ng, a Malaysian immigrant working as a Nissan engineer in Detroit, made some rubber bracelets to impress his daughters. They were such a hit at school the family invested their entire savings ($10,000) into rubber bands and tools. A year later they had sold $40m-worth of loom bands, which have been seen on the wrists of William and Kate, David Beckham and Pope Francis. Rachel Dixon How to have a million dollar idea of your own By Roy Judkins Creativity matters because it brings us pleasure. We all enjoy the theatre, cinema, games and TV. It adds a deeper dimension to our lives. But it also helps humans to advance \u2013 medical innovations, for example, require creative thinking. There are no rules for when people are at their most creative. You have to find what suits you. Some people get up at 5am and work for two hours every day. That's not right for everyone but it's true that many people are at their best first thing in the morning. Always be prepared We get ideas at strange moments, often when we are not directly thinking about the idea \u2013 while driving or having a bath perhaps. A serious inventor will always carry a notebook with them to jot down inspiration. Any exposure to art forms can help with creativity, especially if it's a medium you're not used to. You see what other people have done, then try to push it further. For example, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque had nearby studios and often visited each other, spurring each other on. Trust yourself \u2013 and others You don't have to be full of self-belief or convinced that you're going to have a brilliant idea. Many artists wrestle with self-doubt. David Bowie lacked self-confidence but that was his energy source \u2013 he was motivated by a need to prove himself. It can be useful to work with others to get the ball rolling. In groups of two or three, one person will come up with an idea and the others will add to it. In advertising, the art director and copy writer will often work together, bouncing ideas off each other. Take chances Randomness can be important. Mozart numbered some random bars of music, one to 50. He threw a dice to select two bars and then set himself the task of writing music to connect them. Giving himself a problem to solve energised him and made him work in a different way. Think how you can bring randomness into your routine, or see if you can create a problem and solve it using randomness. Think laterally If you're feeling stuck, make a list of three things you're interested in and bring them to your idea, however unrelated they might seem. Philippe Starck was interested in animal anatomy and space rockets, and he put elements of both into his iconic lemon squeezer. Break up your routine. If you live by a daily routine, you start to think in a routine way. Even just travelling to work by a different route or mode of transport can help to open your mind. Mitchell Feigenbaum lived by a 26-hour clock, making him move in and out of sync with the rest of the world \u2013 sometimes he'd be getting up in the middle of the night. He became a pioneer in the study of chaos theory. When James Dyson was vacuuming, he thought of the cyclone extractor fan in his factory. Why not combine the two to make a more efficient vacuum cleaner? This is true of a lot of inventions: they are simply combinations of things that already exist. Try anything Salvador Dali was open-minded in his approach. As well as painting, he designed furniture, jewellery, the Chupa Chups lollipop logo and appeared in television ads. Not being an architect didn't stop him designing buildings. If someone asked him, he'd do it \u2013 he wasn't at all snobbish. Sometimes it didn't work \u2013 but sometimes it did. Try to cultivate this open-minded attitude and dabble in all sorts of fields. Stay on course Lots of artists and designers write a manifesto. It can remind you of your values and what matters most to you. Try writing three manifesto sentences to stick up around your computer/house/office/studio. Rothko is said to have written: \"I'm for rough, not smooth.\" It's not a set of rules, more like a signpost that stops you going in the wrong direction.
