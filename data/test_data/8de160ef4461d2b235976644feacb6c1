  "content": "\"The easiest thing to do on Earth is not write.\" - William Goldman It's Tuesday afternoon and, once again, I'm hurtling towards my column deadline. Back from Munich, I'm sitting in my London hotel room, in the world's most uncomfortable leather chair, surrounded by tiny little cans that once contained mini-bar drinks. I've just ordered a chicken club sandwich from room service in the hope it will help my brain start working. But it won't. Because I've just realised \u2013 nightmare or nightmares \u2013 that I've written myself into a corner. Anyone who writes fiction, particularly for the screen, will be familiar with the idea of writing yourself into a corner. It's a trick frequently used by blocked screenwriters to get their inspiration flowing and, in essence, it involves putting your character into a ridiculous situation that they can't possibly escape from \u2013 and then working out a way for them to escape. The Coen Brothers used it to brilliant effect in their screenplay for The Hudsucker Proxy which started with Tim Robbins jumping off a building. A setup that hopeless \u2013 fading in on your main character plummeting to his death \u2013 forced the brothers to use every gram of their creativity to work out how the hell to get him out of it. In the UK, Tony Jordan, the writer of Hustle admits to using a similar technique \u2013 he writes the entire episode, including the final ingenious con, and only then tries to work out how the hell his characters managed to pull it off. It's one of the reasons why Hustle is brilliant \u2013 even the writer doesn't know how they did it until the end. And yet while the technique often leads to genius in fiction, until today I had no idea it was possible to do, accidentally and terrifyingly, in real life. As regular readers will know, in recent weeks I've turned this column into an ongoing postcard of my technological travels: Reykjavik, Paris, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Munich \u2013 every week a different city and a different event or set of people to write about. I've also \u2013 as I mentioned last week \u2013 developed something of a reputation for being \"snarky\" about those cities, events or people. With a formula like that \u2013 travel + new experiences + snark \u2013 the column basically writes itself, which is lucky because very often I'm drunk when I finally make it to my keyboard. But this week I'm in London, recharging and detoxing for a few days after months of constant travel and forcing myself to catch up with all of the dull administration \u2013 changing mobile phone contracts, moving bank accounts, that kind of thing \u2013 that I've been putting off for months. The problem is, while a week locked away in London is brilliant for my sanity and my liver, it's a disaster for my inspiration. A week ago I was watching Julia Allison riding around on a disturbingly phallic-looking mechanical bull while waiting for Lady GaGa to perform at the DLD after-party. The week before that I'd just flown from Las Vegas to San Francisco and America was inaugurating its first black president. Today I'm sitting in a \"boutique\" hotel room \u2013 all pillows and preposterous shower gels \u2013 in West London, staring at a wall, with only a pot of room service Earl Gray and an episode of Flight Of The Conchords with the volume turned down for company. And it gets worse. Last week I urged internet commenters and bloggers to steer clear of bitchy personal attacks as a substitute for actual content, so I should really practice what I preach this week. That means my usual unblocking trick \u2013 to dig out a Ben Cohen press release and break it down line by line \u2013 is out too. I can't write about where I am, because I'm not anywhere, and I can't be a sarcastic wanker, because that would make me a hypocrite. I have written myself into a corner. Desperate for external inspiration, I fire up my IM client and ping all of the friends I can see online. \"Blocked. Any ideas?\" First to reply is my friend James. Fortunately James is one of the most creative people I know \u2013 if you haven't already watched the pilot episodes of The Sitcom, you absolutely must \u2013 and also has his finger firmly on the pulse of what's happening in the world of technology. If anyone can help, it's James. \"Why don't you write about not being invited to TED?\" he suggests. \"Actually, that's not a bad idea. I've always wanted to set up an even more arrogantly exclusive conference than TED. Perhaps one where the entry eligibility requirements are the same as those for appearing on postage stamps. I'd call it DED... Also, it would also be the only conference where people would be happy to see me on the attendees list.\" \"Heh.\" His reaction says it all. \"Yeah \u2026 you're right \u2026 that's kind of a one-joke column. What else is happening?\" \"Google are mapping the bottom of the sea.\" \"Yes! They can't get their malware warning system to work properly, but they can somehow drive a Smart car around the floor of the ocean. Maybe I could write about how they seem to be focussing their genius in the wrong areas.\" \"Meh.\" Well, quite. I close the chat window and turn my attention to the pile of newspapers on the floor. Maybe one of them will have a quirky technology story that can be turned into 900 words of pure gold. But no, it's all just snow, snow and more fucking snow. I waste a few seconds Twittering that over the past few days the British press have found so many different words for snow that the Inuit are making jokes about them. Wait \u2013 maybe there's column in that? But no, within a few minutes, Dave Gorman replies to tell me that the whole Inuit words for snow thing is a myth. Thanks, Dave. Another Twitter follower suggests that if I'm really blocked I should just go on a crazy Hunter S Thompson-style binge. I look around my hotel room; all that remains from the minibar is half a bottle of champagne, a tiny bottle of whisky, two cans of Britvic tomato juice and a little tube of Pringles. No matter where you are in the world, there's always a little tube of Pringles in the minibar. Who puts crisps in the fridge anyway? But I'm getting distracted again \u2013 what was it Thompson said? No need to panic. I'll just lash together a few raw facts, a little bit of wisdom, and this nightmare is over. I don't have any wisdom so I decide to Google for some. Half an hour passes, my sandwich arrives, inspiration doesn't, but if I ever want to open a fridge magnet factory, I'm sorted for slogans. This is hopeless \u2013 my column is starting to look frighteningly like Tim Robbins and that deadline pavement is getting awful close. I'm going to have to admit defeat; to email my editor and confess that without the crutch of snarkiness or global travel, I'm as useful as Adam West's Batman without his utility belt. Ping But what's this? An email from a journalist friend in the US. She's writing her column against a deadline as well, but she's doing a better job of it than I am. She's primarily emailing to gloat, of course, but she's also been following my breakdown on Twitter and has a suggestion... \"You should do a column on this. Surely even the new Paul Carr is allowed to hate on sex offenders?\" By God, she's right! Unless you're the Catholic church or a wearer of long, dirty coats, anyone's allowed to hate sex offenders without it being hypocritical. I click on the link \u2013 in a nut, the story concerns Facebook \"allowing\" people on the US sex offenders register to sign up for accounts while rival MySpace has taken steps to ban them all. The fact that the scandal was brought to light by Sentinel, the company who MySpace paid to do the banning and which \u2013 coincidentally \u2013 hasn't been employed by Facebook, is irrelevant: people are outraged. \"Gross, hopefully someone will force facebook to delete these people right away... I cannot believe no one has called them out on this stuff before.\" says one commenter on Techcrunch. \"This is disgusting. Does Facebook even care about this stuff?\" asks another. And with those outraged words, I know I have my column. Because, you see, I just can't bring myself to agree with them. I just don't entirely understand why Facebook should be attacked for not banning sex offenders, when there is no equivalent ban for \u2013 say \u2013 mass murderers or kidnappers. When most people hear the words \"sex offender\", what they actually hear in their head is 'paedophile' but in fact the sex offenders register covers everything from people who have sex in public to teenagers who swap naked pictures of psychotherapy online. Banning everyone on the sex offenders register sends out a very strange message indeed... Made a webcam video for your 16-year-old boyfriend? We'll chase you away with pitchforks, you evil, sick scum. Murdered your wife and eaten her liver with a stir-in sauce? Welcome to Facebook! Come on in! Play Scrabble! Throw a sheep or two! Of course that's a simplistic view. Maybe sex offenders do deserve to be a special case because, overwhelmingly, they tend to be predatory and many of their crimes involve children. Or maybe the ban should be extended to anyone who has committed any kind of serious offence. Maybe the difference between Facebook and MySpace is that MySpace is an open system whereas Facebook generally only allows you to connect with existing friends. And maybe it's a worrying world in which people who have been convicted of a crime but have served their sentence are banned from connecting with their friends and continuing their rehabilitation back into normal society using social networking tools. There are lots of questions, but fortunately I have a whole column to explore them. I finish my sandwich, wipe most of the mayonnaise from my fingers, crank up Last.fm and start to type. At the very last second, I've found a way out of the corner. Everything's going to be alright. Sweet Jesus, that was a close call... \u2022 Paul Carr is author of Bringing Nothing To The Party: True Confessions of a New Media Whore. He blogs at paulcarr.com."
