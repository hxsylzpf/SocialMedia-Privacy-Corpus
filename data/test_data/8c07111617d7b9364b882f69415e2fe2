  "content": "An innocent television celebrity, Matthew Kelly, has suffered trial by tabloid. Another broadcaster, Sara Cox, endured the indignity of being pictured naked on her honeymoon. Meanwhile, Amanda Holden was embarrassed by being shown topless while holidaying in a private Tuscan villa. These three are personalities and, according to Phil Taylor, associate editor of the News of the World, they should therefore accept their fate. No one, he told a Media Society forum last week, gives a damn about the sensibilities of the famous, and he was encouraged by the fact that a mere three people in an audience of some 200 raised their hands in sympathy with the celebrities. Taylor gets full marks for being honest. He has said openly what most tabloid journalists only ever admit in private: the famous are mere fodder in the circulation war. They exist to be used and abused by the rapacious media on which they depend for their public status. Tacitly, editors view fame as a precious commodity for which those who achieve it must be prepared to pay virtually any price. They must open their hearts and souls to the reporters and photographers who clamour to know every facet of their lives until they have nothing left to reveal. Then, inevitably, they quietly vanish from the pages to be replaced by another ing\u00e9nu dazzled by the lights on the fame assembly line. Taylor cited the usual justification for all this kiss-and-tell muck, sneaky paparazzi pictures and mud-slinging tittle-tattle: the readers must want it, or they wouldn't buy the paper. It's why we have more than 10 million readers, he said. Doubtless, if he had developed his argument, Taylor would also have pointed out that the editors' code of practice constrains invasions into privacy. So what? It hasn't stopped the trade because journalists have found ways to coax many of the famous - especially the here-today-gone-tomorrow TV soap stars, weather women, models, and the pathetic victims of reality TV shows - to compromise their right to privacy. First they are led up the garden path of such magazines as Hello! and OK!, where they are encouraged to gush about their good fortune. Then they are ushered into the comfortable drawing room peopled by friendly interviewers who solicit their views on life and love while stylists pamper them for photographers who cajole them into posing as sexily as possible. Publicists, meanwhile, urge them to take up every party invitation and to smile for the snappers at the doors. All this time spent on the ground floor of the media's house of fame has a purpose because, while the naive celebrity is building what he or she believes to be a positive profile, journalists are probing any example of double standards. When the celebrity goes up to the bedroom or off to the bathroom, can he or she be exposed for hypocrisy? Who did he sleep with? What was that she snorted from the toilet seat? Thus, the stifling code can be circumvented. The problem, as \"honest Phil\" would surely agree, is that squeaky clean doesn't sell. Papers want dysfunction and drama, drugs and sex, rocks of coke and rolls in the hay. Stars prepared to play recklessly in the basement games room make good copy. How dare they complain! They know the rules. We, the papers, make them and we can break them. But hang on. Why am I talking about personalities at this time anyway? The high-minded Commons select committee inquiring into media intrusion into privacy isn't concerned about Kelly, Cox, Holden and their ilk. MPs want to know about invasions of privacy that affect so-called ordinary people. Quite right, too, says the press complaints commission. In its submission to the committee, it states: \"According to some widespread myths, privacy is an issue that affects just famous people, and intrusion is the sole preserve of the red-top tabloids.\" In fact, the PCC has produced statistics which show that more than 90% of complaints it receives are from \"ordinary individuals ... temporarily caught up in some problem with the media\". There are more complaints about intrusion by regional and local papers than by nationals. Of course, it is the transgressions by nationals involving the famous that tend to make headlines, a confirmation of the dominance of the celebrity culture that also infects coverage in broadsheets. Oddly, the PCC tends to confirm it, too. Despite its stress on the preponderance of \"ordinary\" complainants, when it lists the case studies of intrusions that have enabled the commission to build up case law precedent, it is peppered with examples of the famous. Indeed, of the 45 cases it cites to the select committee as instances of its good works in the field, at least 11 involve well-known people, including Tony Blair, Vanessa Feltz, Selina Scott and JK Rowling. The PCC did not provide the committee with figures showing what proportion of complaints were upheld on behalf of the famous as against those from ordinary members of the public, and a call to its offices confirmed that no such figures exist. It might be difficult to compute but it would, I believe, be an interesting addition to a submission which runs to 250 pages, with addenda, plus a separate, militant defence of the PCC's work by its lay membership which, of course, outvotes the six editors who sit on the commission. One of those editors, the Daily Mail's Paul Dacre, made a bullish appearance in front of the committee last week, declaring with some passion his continuing belief in self-regulation and his aversion to any privacy law. \"As someone who has spent over 30 years in Fleet Street,\" he said, \"I have no hesitation in saying that, as regards to such things as privacy, the industry's behaviour over this period has improved considerably. The PCC has been responsible for much of that improvement.\" He argued that the code \"now governs our [the Mail's] every thought and action\". I believe him, and I think that is true of all editors: every journalist, from senior executive to on-the-road reporter, is aware of the rules. That, in itself, does not mean that newspapers are free from misbehaviour. As with the various laws that constrain them, such as libel and contempt, they tend to push consistently at the barriers. Without a shadow of doubt, the introduction of an ethical code in 1991 was a great landmark in British journalistic behaviour. But a code, if it is to have the confidence of the public, has to be obeyed in spirit as well as letter. It also has to be administered with great care. Critics of the PCC's complaint process have raised a range of concerns about continuing problems, from the fears many victims of press misconduct have about papers giving them a hard time if they dare to complain, to the lack of transparency in the selection of PCC commissioners. In spite of a glowing survey of the \"customer satisfaction\" of PCC complainants, much of the criticism from broadsheet newspaper editors is underpinned by a belief that victims get a raw deal. Several lawyers now believe that the courts offer better redress. They can also, as happened in the Holden case, restrain publication through an injunction. The Sara Cox case against the Sunday People, though apparently reconciled by the PCC, is also being dealt with by her lawyers because she did not believe that the apology she received was good enough recompense. There is also evidence that papers are beginning to treat PCC adjudications as they once did those from the old, discredited Press Council - by tucking them away. The People, yet again, was censured for intruding on the privacy of the actor Julie Goodyear, but the PCC finding was placed way back in the paper. The editor responsible for the publication of the Cox and Goodyear pictures, Neil Wallis, is now deputy editor of the News of the World, and still sits on the PCC. This does nothing to enhance the commission's standing. We are back again to the problems of personalities. They may not make up the bulk of press victims, but their profile, and the fact that they appear in the biggest-selling papers, ensure that their cases receive attention. And they are, in case Phil Taylor and his new colleague, Neil Wallis, have forgotten, human beings as well as celebrities. Their rights are the same as those of ordinary people who national editors affect to worry about when they appear before the select committee. The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Wednesday March 5 2003 We suggested in this article that the People had tucked away an adjudication against it by the press complaints commission for intruding on the privacy of Julie Goodyear, by placing it \"way back in the paper\". The editor of the People at the time says it was not tucked away and he has asked us to make it clear that the position had been agreed with Ms Goodyear's representatives, via the PCC. In fact the adjudication was published in more or less the same position as the offending photograph had appeared."
