  "content": "Another week, and another attempt to engage girls in the sciences being widely ridiculed on Twitter. This time it was IBM, whose hastily withdrawn campaign joins the ranks of other criticised efforts, including the European Commission's \"Science: It's A Girl Thing\" video, and EDF Energy's \"Pretty Curious\" initiative. One can't help feeling a bit sorry for IBM and other corporations whose well-meaning efforts fall flat. I personally found nothing offensive about the IBM video, which invited aspiring female engineers to subvert a so-called \"girly\" household object into something more interesting (examples included a hot air-driven clock). In fact, the video explicitly challenged the stereotype that women are only interested in body image. Unfortunately, the territory of \"pinkification\" is so sensitive and fraught that it seems to be off-limits as a hook \u2013 even one that subverts the stereotypes instead of feeding them. We'll never know if the IBM campaign would have worked. But I suspect that such efforts are aimed at an age group far too old for it to make a meaningful difference. When I was in graduate school in Seattle, I used to run an after-school science club for a local primary school. Interest in science amongst girls was strong in the youngest set (age 6), but was already beaten out of the vast majority by the time they reached 11. I gave science a pretty hard sell to these female pre-teens, but I could see it was a losing battle. They seemed embarrassed to show any interest; I encouraged what sparks did flare up during our experiments, but wished that I'd had the chance to intervene sooner. So what exactly made me want to become a scientist? My desires were fixed so early that I cannot recall any pivotal moments. My parents were artists, but my father had a strong interest in the natural world as well. He owned a beautiful Questar telescope, and enjoyed entertaining me and a small band of neighbourhood children with moon-viewing parties. As an infant, I can recall being roused in the middle of the night on several occasions and bundled up to a nearby park to watch a notable meteor shower or eclipse, huddled among lots of adults on the edge of a cliff with steaming thermos flasks of tea and excited chatter. Dad also owned a brass microscope which I spent hours peering down, and he bought me a chemistry set whose test tubes were soon stained and encrusted with burnt colourful powders. I was encouraged to spend most of my time outdoors, and I pressed flowers, polished rocks and collected insects in jars. What about toys? I had Lego and trucks and trains, but also worshipped my Barbies \u2013 I liked dressing them up in the pretty clothes that my mother sewed for me, but more often than not they were tromping through the mud on scientific adventures. I didn't have any real-life role models \u2013 just a male character called Danny Dunn who got up to science-related shenanigans in a series of children's books by Raymond Abrashkin and Jay Williams. (He did have a female sidekick called Irene, but Danny was equally influential.) For me, then, my interest in science was fostered as early as the toddler years, mostly by encouragement from parents who were inspired by the world around them. Unfortunately, school presented a series of obstacles that I had to overcome to keep hold of that early interest: strong peer pressure not to appear interested in science, or indeed in any learning whatsoever. Teasing and bullying for getting good grades. The \"career counsellor\" who, when I was ten, advised me to channel my interest in science into becoming a nurse. Even into early adulthood, the negative pressure didn't abate. I can still remember a male post-doc who was meant to be supervising my summer lab placement at the US National Institutes of Health. He was a proper old-school chauvinist, and I recall the precise words he used to tell me that I wasn't fit to help with his experiments: \"Girls don't belong in the lab\". If I behaved myself, I might be permitted to do some photocopying for him in the library. The look of repellent disgust in his eyes felt like a cold hand on my heart, and I can still feel a ghost of its pressure thirty years later. For a day or two, I considered leaving the placement. Fortunately, I mustered up the courage to speak to the department head and was given a new supervisor; my project flourished. With all this talk about how to get girls interested in science and maths, it should not be forgotten that the job does not end there. In my field of the academic life sciences, unlike in engineering and the physical sciences, early interest and recruitment isn't the problem, with gender parity at the PhD levels and even into the early postdoctoral trainee years. It is retention that's the issue: fewer than 20% of biology professors are women. It's not just academia that suffers from this problem: the percentages of women in leadership positions in biotech is even lower. Like many women, I've frequently encountered overt sexism, denigrating jokes at my expense and unconscious bias, but what's changed with time is my ability to shrug it off and move on ever more easily \u2013 even when I've been trolled for speaking out. I can well imagine that not everyone would keep going in the face of such discouragement. So here I am now, clinging on to my untenured academic position while my fellow female colleagues drop out all around. It's clear that there are complex and diverse issues aside from sexism involved in the stubbornly persistent leakiness of this pipeline \u2013 most notably structural family issues in a landscape where success is often measured by how many unsociable hours you work. But it's going to take more than hacked hairdryers, gender-neutral toys and corporate soundbites to solve the problem. Discipline-specific challenges will require tailored approaches, and we need to look at the entire life cycle as a whole, from primary school through to recruitment and promotion of the top jobs in both academia and industry. And as the world stage moves increasingly online, we will also need to find ways to control the rising tide of misogynistic abuse that strong female voices tend to attract when they dare to question the status quo. Men, too, will be crucial allies. It won't be easy. But I believe there is a will, so one day I hope that science will find its way. Jenny Rohn runs a cell biology lab at University College London, and is the Athena Swan lead for UCL's Division of Medicine."
