  "content": "North Korea is probably one of the hardest places on the planet to tweet from. The web is severely restricted, with access to computers and mobiles phone available to an elite few. Most North Koreans only have access to a state controlled intranet, called Kwangmyong, or bright. The country does have its own twitter account @uriminzok (english translation available @uriminzok_engl), launched in 2010 declaring \"The Web site 'Our Nation' is on Twitter\". At the time of writing the account follows three others: Vietnam, a Pyongyang propaganda site and Jimmy Dushku, a 25-year-old web developer and tycoon from Texas who is as confused as the rest of us as to why. In 2013 they opened up a 3G network, but only for foreign tourists. Associated Press journalist Jean H Lee (@newsjean) was the first person to Tweet and Instagram from it, closely followed by Dennis Rodman. Lee described the experience as liberating, moving on from the days where she had to leave her phone at the airport. Journalists are still incredibly restricted as to what they can depict. David Guttenfelder, a photographer for Associated Press who, like Lee, enjoys more access than most, has to ask permission in writing everywhere he goes: \"There are some very difficult discussions after the pictures are published - we often lock horns because they have a very different idea of how North Korea should be covered,\" he says. Guttenfelder, who won a Time award for his Instagram coverage, believes the secret to covering North Korea is in the mundane detail, \"the piece off the puzzle that when you put them all together reveal something about the place\". Despite the challenge from inside the country, there is a network of expert North Korea watchers tweeting about everything from culture to politics. Start by following @GuardianNK for the latest from our network, as well as our North Korea partners on Twitter. And here's our pick of the rest to get you started, also available as a Twitter list.
