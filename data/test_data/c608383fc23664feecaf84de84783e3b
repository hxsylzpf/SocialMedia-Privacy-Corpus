  "content": "Your article on the problems of race-hate material published on Facebook and apparently authored by British soldiers (MoD investigates race hate on web, 19 January) raises two important issues in the digital age: the first concerns the authenticity of claimed identity; and the second is about where responsibility lies for extreme and offensive language posted on social media sites. It is tremendously easy to impersonate other people online, so anyone trying to make firm conclusions as to the provenance of the comments needs to be wary. Of course if the offensive and extreme material really was authored by soldiers in the employ of MoD, they need to be held to account. But does the issue end there, as purely a matter for individual authors and, in cases such as these, their employers? Your report did not comment on the apparent unwillingness of the proprietors of social media to be held to account too. Waiting for complaints about extreme content may suit some publishers as it keeps their management costs down, but is it morally responsible? Is it not time that social media publishers/proprietors become more proactive in dealing with the darker sides of content whose publication they are both facilitating and marketing?
