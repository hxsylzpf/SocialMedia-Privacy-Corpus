  "content": "Kanye West's career took an unprecedented turn at the end of 2016, when the rapper aligned himself with Donald Trump. West now appears to have changed his mind, deleting his pro-Trump tweets as sources claim he has \"turned against\" the US president following the latter's travel ban. Previous mentions of the Republican politician have disappeared from West's timeline, including his explanation for meeting Trump in December to discuss \"bullying, supporting teachers, modernising curriculums and violence in Chicago\". West also wrote at the time: \"I feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future president if we truly want change.\" This message is among those deleted. According to TMZ, the Trump travel ban, which targets people from seven Muslim-majority countries, was one of the catalysts for West's social media purge. The rapper's meeting with the US president followed a series of surprising statements West made during a live performance last November. Although he previously publicly supported the Democratic party, West said at a concert in California that he would have voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential elections \u2013 had he voted. He was hospitalised for exhaustion shortly after this performance. Last month, the rapper's wife, Kim Kardashian West, showed her support for the Women's March in Washington."
