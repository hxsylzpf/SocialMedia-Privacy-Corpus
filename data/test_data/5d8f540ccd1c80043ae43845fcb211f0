  "content": "An estimated 45,600 computers infected with the DNSChanger Trojan could lose internet access on Monday when the FBI removes a temporary fix for computers infected with the malware. An organized criminal group called Rove Digital deployed the virus, which rerouted internet traffic, generating $14m in revenue for the group. In 2011, seven were charged for the internet fraud scheme that infected more than four million computers across the world. At least 500,000 of those computers were in the US and include computers owned by government agencies, businesses and individuals. Six of those charged were arrested, one remains at large. To keep victims from losing internet access, the FBI worked with a non-profit to provide victims with a temporary solution, which expires on Monday. Is your computer infected? To check if your computer is infected, click this link from the FBI. The site features an image which will have either a green background (which means your computer is clean) or red (which means your computer is infected). If you are outside the US, a list of country-specific sites to check if your computer is infected is available here. What to do if your computer is infected First, back up all valuable information on your computer. Then, take it to a professional. FBI has an in-depth rundown (pdf) on what to do if your Mac or PC has the virus. This website also provides a list of tools to clean up the malware. How the DNSChanger malware works DNS (Domain Name System) converts user-friendly domain names, like guardiannews.com into numerical internet protocol (IP) addresses that computers use to communicate with each other. So every time you enter guardiannews.com (which you should do often!), your computer takes the numeral code IP, sends it to the DNS, which in turn sends your computer to the proper website. The scammers infected computers around the world with the malware, allowing them to control DNS servers. Once they gained control of computers DNS they were able control what sites the computer connects to, interfere with web browsing and make computers vulnerable to other malicious software. This is what tens of thousands of computers in the US are dealing with now."
