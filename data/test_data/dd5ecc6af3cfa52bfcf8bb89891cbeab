  "content": "What constitutes a campaign in 2007? A supposed consumer backlash has begun against the makers of Kettle Chips, who have brought in American union-busters to prevent unionisation at their factories. The Guardian reported on October 9 that: Two groups, \"Boycott Kettle Crisps for attacks on workers\" and \"Boycott Kettle Crisps: the Anti-Trade Union snack\", have been formed on the popular website Facebook.com. They have attracted 130 members, many of whom say they are pledged to persuade friends and family not to buy the product. In August, another report claimed \"victory\" for a 4,000-strong group of students who had forced HSBC to back down on overdraft fees, also via a Facebook group. To put the 130 in perspective, as of 17:00 on the day of the Kettle Chips story, 253 people were members of the Facebook group \"Kettle Chips are just a superior type of crisp\" - one of several dedicated to extolling the virtues of the Kettle Chip - against 181 and 185 in the two mentioned in the Guardian report. Moving off the potato snack theme, 575 people had joined \"I Hate Razorlight and Want the World to Know\" and a frightening 155,287 were members of \"Jeremy Clarkson Should Be Prime Minister\". In fact, Clarkson is well ahead of Conservative leader David Cameron in the virtual polls. With typical lip service to Generation Y trends, Cameron made mention of the power of Facebook in political debate in his speech to the Tory conference last week. Cameron groups include the 580-strong \"David Cameron for Prime Minister - The Original\", and \"We Love David Cameron\" (261 members), facing down \"Am I the only person who doesn't like David Cameron?\" (probably not, at 2,104 members), and \"Stop David Cameron ... his lies make baby Jesus cry\" (1,642). Facebook is not yet a medium for informed debate: by and large the groups are remarkably badly informed, populated through whimsy or a desire to make a superficial statement. It is the Gen-Y equivalent of wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt, but without even the capital expenditure. Most users join because their mates invite everyone they know to join whatever the group du jour is, usually the one with the most amusing name. This is not in any way a substitute for political action, and it is rarely, if ever, translated into real-world effects. Thankfully. Close to half a million people are apparently part of a global movement for physical assaults on irritating pedestrians as part of the \"I Secretly Want To Punch Slow Walking People In The Back Of The Head\" group (define \"secretly\"!). Worse still, a smaller, if significant number of people, just over 55,000, want to take it further, supporting capital punishment, albeit only for \"chavs who play music off [sic] their phones in public\". But the almost total inability of the media to objectively consider the statistics before declaring a Facebook group \"a movement\" is a more worrying trend. At best, it is simple laziness - an easy, stop-gap example of consumer disaffection that can be plugged into any story. Bad reporting, perhaps, as a simple number on Facebook cannot be said to be in any way statistically rigorous. Of the quoted numbers, not all are even necessarily supportive of the \"motion\", because it is not uncommon for users to join in order to attempt to put up some counter-argument (though, since bloggers' law applies, they are, of course, shouted down). There is no tally of how many people rejected or ignored invitations to join the group, and even if there were, there is likely to be significant sample bias ... you generally only invite like-minded people. At worst, this becomes a case of media misrepresentation, a written noddy shot. By blowing out of proportion events in a social network not readily understood by most of their reading demographic, reporters risk creating a campaign where there was none. HSBC may have claimed to be listening principally to its young customers (though, we are unable to tell how many of the 4,000 banked with HSBC), it could easily be suggested that it was the headline coverage that really forced their hand. Internet gossip (and that is what, by-and-large, Facebook groups are) works on an odd system of correlations between sites and ideas, on self-reference and self-promotion, and its trends are caused by snowball effects that act as a distorting mirror for the real world - perhaps concurrent, but by no means accurately portrayed. Draw your own parallels with Cameronite politics."
