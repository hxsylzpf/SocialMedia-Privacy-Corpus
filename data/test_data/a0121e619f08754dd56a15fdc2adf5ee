  "content": "Londoners are to be given the chance to vent their frustrations about travelling in the capital through a new social networking website, launched today by Transport for London. The new online forum, Together for London, aims to get commuters to be more polite and ultimately cut fear of crime. It follows a push by mayor Boris Johnson's predecessor Ken Livingstone earlier this year to get people to think about their behaviour on public transport. Peter Hendy, the Transport for London commissioner, said that the website \"starts with a pledge to be more considerate when we travel together on public transport\". \"This campaign is not about crime, but about inconsiderate behaviour which fuels the disproportionate fear of crime on and around public transport in London,\" Hendy added. The website will condone \"friendly disagreement\" with the aim of opening up debate about public transport. Forum users can create their own campaign about a pledge they want to make about being a more considerate traveller with an option to buy a T-shirt emblazoned with their pledge. The website, which will also have votes on particular issues, marks a major broadening of TfL's contact with consumers: interaction was previously limited to more indirect methods such as telephone and a general email system. \"We think [the new website] highlights to all that they can do something positive to improve the travel experience for everyone in London,\" said Esther Thompson, the head of training at youth club network London Youth. Livingstone's campaign earlier this year included a mini-film created by Leaving Las Vegas director Mike Figgis featuring examples of people being inconsiderate to others on a London bus by listening to loud music, eating food and talking on mobile phones. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
