  "content": "Germany's World Cup final victory over Argentina smashed global records on Twitter, and has become the biggest sporting event in Facebook's history. Twitter said that Germany's 1-0 victory peaked at 618,725 tweets a minute, easily breaking the previous record of 580,166 set during the team's 7-1 demolition of Brazil in the semi-final. However, the total of 32.1m tweets sent during the game \u2013 tracked on a global heat map as the game progressed \u2013 failed to break the record 35.6m set by the Germany/Brazil game. German player Lukas Podolski proved to be something of a one-man Twitter \"selfie\" phenomenon \u2013 a shot of teammate Bastian Schweinsteiger kissing his cheek immediately after the victory was retweeted more than 88,620 times and received 78,169 favourites. A follow-up shot with German chancellor Angela Merkel, which Podolski labelled \"Selfie 2\", managed 25,022 retweets and 29,809 favourites. Facebook said that 88 million global users made a record 280m interactions \u2013 posts, likes and comments \u2013 during the World Cup final. The social networking site said this easily broke through the previous record held of 245m interactions, set by the Super Bowl in 2013. Facebook said that the top five countries participating in the global \"buzz\" were, in order, US, Brazil, Argentina, Germany and Indonesia. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
