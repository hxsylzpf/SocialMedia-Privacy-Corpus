  "content": "Bully for him! Because\u2026 We've seen him before somewhere\u2026 Several \"news\" providers were unwilling (or unable) to translate the balcony-Latin live from the Vatican so simply went with their gut feeling, calling the papal race for stand-up extraordinaire and Bullseye host Jim Bowen. This was later confirmed by the world's reference tome of record . However, doubt was one again cast on the Pontiff's identity when the Huffington Post put forward a further number of compelling names from Mr Bronson of Grange Hill fame to Woody Allen, Dr Strangelove and Mr Magoo. First of many? Because\u2026 Everyone keeps calling him Pope Francis I, which suggests there are already plans for a Pope Francis II. The world has only just got over the shock of the first papal resignation in 600 years\u2026 the last thing we need is another Catholic crisis to pontificate over in the near future. Just Pope Francis is fine, like King John or Queen Victoria; let's not get ahead of ourselves\u2026 Popes need a Facebook friend Because\u2026 Father Ted is still relevant And although 115 electing cardinals may have had their say on Francis, let us not forget the 19,000 plus Facebook fans who voted for Father Dougal to be Pope. What with @pontifex and all that, it seemed the Catholic Church valued social media\u2026 well, actions speak louder than words and 19,000 beats 115\u2026 Argy bargy Because\u2026 The Falkland's 3 might have been \"turned\" In the same week as three islanders favour Argentina in a referendum, we find out the new Pope is Argentinean \u2013 a coincidence? Latest estimates suggest there are 230 Roman Catholics on the Falkland Islands, if they turn against Britain too it'll be \"Bienvenido a las Islas Malvinas\" before you can make a terrible Hand of God joke. Holy for amusement Because\u2026 There aren't enough opportunities to celebrate hackneyed jokes, and we don't know when the next one will come. Who could ever forget? Yes, it truly is an enlightened age we live in. Amen.",
