  "content": "It is rarely easy being the new girlfriend, particularly when the previous one was so cherished, and 2012 \u2013 the new girlfriend in town \u2013 has a tough act to follow. Oh gosh, 2011 was wonderful, wasn't she? No one could produce news like 2011. Remember that adorable way, just when you thought she had surely outdone herself with that charming hacking scandal, the delicious deposition of tyrannical leaders, the extraordinary number of celebrity deaths that happened under her aegis, she'd pull out another corker. A riot, say, or the death of that puppet from Team America. And boy, 2011 sure went out in style, what with Samoa cancelling an entire day on its calendar, and the BBC deciding that a panda bear is analogous to Pippa Middleton, seeing as both made its \"Women of the Year\" list. But 2012 is already looking like she might have a trick or two up her canny fluted sleeve: Rupert Murdoch has joined Twitter. And he has been caught in a ridiculous internet panto. 2011 who? The fantasy of Murdoch being some terrifying, all-knowing being under which much of this country and certainly this country's politicians have laboured for decades began to crumble last July during his appearance in front of the select committee, of course, when he revealed himself to be something more akin to Frank Costanza on Seinfeld \u2013 all shouts and hand pounds and paternal bossiness \u2013 than an international puppet master. This, though, turned out to be only the beginning, and the latest development in the unravelling of the Murdoch myth is like watching a dieter who has eaten one cupcake decide to go the whole hog and snarffle down the whole box. \"Well,\" maybe Rupert was thinking when he signed up on Twitter, \"I've already dented my reputation \u2013 let's totally destroy it and show the whole world that I don't even know how to punctuate.\" Some might view Murdoch's arrival on Twitter with an emotion other than glee. Those on Twitter, for example, might feel like they've been having a perfectly good time at a party only for that embarrassing old dude from next door to crash the event and start rubbing his hands Kramer-style, while he takes over DJ duties and cranks up the Toploader. Those of a more business-oriented mind might view this development as a further dismaying sign that Murdoch is to buy Twitter, as portended last month by the news that Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has bought a 3.75% stake in Twitter. Alwaleed, incidentally, happens to be the second largest shareholder in News International after a certain gentleman who we now must refer to as @rupertmurdoch. 2012: the year Twitter literally becomes the new Myspace. But let's start the new year in a glass-half-full state of mind and view this as it should be seen: a remarkable act of self-destruction. Not since Toto tugged back a curtain with his teeth and revealed the lie of the Wizard of Oz has a reputation been so thoroughly trounced, but it's the Wizard himself doing the curtain-tugging, not least from the mystifying photo Murdoch originally chose for himself, which appeared to have been taken with a webcam in an office in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Doesn't he live in an underground cave? And where's Tony Blair fanning him with peacock feathers in the background? To see Murdoch, the man frequently credited with being the most important figure in the media, incapable of typing properly is almost worse than seeing Salman Rushdie, the winner of the Booker of Bookers, convey sentiment via the noble language of emoticons. Moreover, considering Murdoch has been frequently credited with knowing what to give the public before they want it, his tweets thus far suggest that he must have special foresight because it's hard to imagine anyone in any imaginable future wanting to read his self-promoting tweets for his own movies (\"Very proud of fox team who made this great film\"), his own TV channels (\"Got to watch Fox news at 5 EST\"), his own newspapers (\"Great oped inWSJ today\") and the terrible tortures of holidaying in somewhere called \"St Barths\" (\"Too many people.\") Incidentally, take it as a given that [sic] should follow all of the above examples. Murdoch's tweets almost out-Grauniad the Guardian. But it has been the sight of Murdoch caught up in a typical, petty and belittling Twitter furore that truly demeans the man \u2013 and, let's be honest, the rest of us too. Like Princess Buttercup in The Princess Bride taking tentative steps into the Fire Swamp only to be immediately besieged by evils on all sides, Murdoch, instead of being attacked by Rodents of Unusual Size, found himself surrounded by strange Twitter accounts. The most notable one was @Wendi_Deng, which was verified by Twitter as being authentic, and appeared to be corroborated by News International and was gleefully reported by news outlets, including this one, as being so. But life is full of disappointments and \"Wendi_Deng\" \u2013 who flirted with such luminaries as Ricky Gervais and Piers Morgan and talked to her husband like a healthcare worker attending to a crumbling geriatric \u2013 unveiled herself on Tuesday afternoon, with a flourish, to be a fake. It's difficult to know who comes out looking dafter from this whole hoo-ha \u2013 the media, Twitter, News International, who yesterday admitted to wrongly confirming Deng's account, or Murdoch himself. All in all, it adds a touch of pathos to his New Year's Day tweet: \"Happy 2012. May itbe better than all experts predict. Has to be!\" Not so far, it isn't, Rupes. Not so far.",
