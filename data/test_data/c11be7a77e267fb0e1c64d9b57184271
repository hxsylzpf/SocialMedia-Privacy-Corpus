  "content": "The way that Twitter mixes the private and public spheres was always one of its interesting aspects. But what happened to Stephen Fry and the Twitterer brumplum at the weekend might show that this balance has got a bit out of hand now news organisations pick up stories from Twitter as if it were a wire service. As brumplum posted on his blog after several newspapers picked up the controversy, in which Fry had considered withdrawing from Twitter after brumplum called him boring: \"OK, this is where things get seriously scary. For a major newspaper to pick up a spat between users of an ultimately insignificant glorified chat room is absolutely mind-boggling. To make a national (and international) story of it is beyond silliness. I really would have thought that there were far more important things in news generally, and the tech sector in particular, to talk about?\" Stephen Fry helped to curb the enthusiasm of the press. When he recognised that he had caused a scene by publicly considering leaving Twitter and his nearly a million followers behind, he returned and reached out his hand. stephenfry: @brumplum I am so sorry to hear ppl have been abusing you. You had every right to say what you did. Pls accept my apols. This is so awful. brumplum: @stephenfry Thanks. Can we all be friends again? *tweet favourited* (I have an ego as big as the next man!) ;-) stephenfry: @brumplum You bet. Thank you for being so understanding. I feel more sheepish than a sheep and more twattish than a twat. brumplum: OK folks, @stephenfry and I have asked for this whole sorry saga to go the way of the dodo, so can we all please get back to normal? #bed Thousands of people were angry at brumplum after he mentioned that although he \"admires and adores\" Stephen Fry, he found him a bit \"boring\". But the fact that several bigger news sites reported on the subject reveals how important Twitter has become and how much power \u2013 and danger \u2013 there can be in tweeting. Unless you protect your tweets, they are always open and readable for everyone. And what began as conversations between Twitterers has become a source for newspaper stories. So does the attention of news organisations change the medium? Do you think it is time to quit Twitter? Or has basically nothing changed?"
