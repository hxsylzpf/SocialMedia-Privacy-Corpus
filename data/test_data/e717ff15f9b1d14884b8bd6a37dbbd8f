  "content": "Yesterday, was Data Privacy Day. In Europe it is the fourth time it gets celebrated while the US and Canada are a bit behind, as it was only last year they decided to make it an international holiday. It is a good thing, a day to raise awareness and educate people about the importance of data privacy protection. Is it? Wait! Actually, I am not so sure if this is true anymore. Overall, I get the impression data privacy day gives companies a reason to advertise how much they care about our privacy. Most big firms made announcements for that day. For example, Microsoft commissioned an online reputation survey finding out that HR managers are evaluating candidates online, and 64% of them believe it is appropriate. Well, happy to learn that HRs are not living in last years century. Facebook invited a bunch of important old people to explain to everyone that privacy is a \"core component of the products and features we build every day\". Only Google announces to now make search more personal, using content from your friends and contacts: \"We've been having a lot of fun with Social Search.\" Oh no, wait! They have a colourful video to claim that they \"make privacy a priority in everything we do\". And you know what? They are all correct. They all think privacy is important. Because it is important for their business. These days, companies rely on you telling them information about you. In detail. Instant mobile communication combined with the social web of Twitter, Facebook, Linked-in and Foursquare is all about: You. Your coordinates, your information, your moves. They need all of that to make their search better, their advertisements better, their efforts better. As my colleague Peter Robins recently summed it up in a headline: They want your trust, and then your stuff. And yes, from using your data, you will gain to. They will serve you with better search results, find better books, music, movies and friends for you, and deliver information that is more relevant to you. The advertisement of today is not about persuasion anymore. They don't want to get you to buy something that you don't need. Why should they? There is enough out there, that you want anyway! They only have to find it for you. Today, Companies want to invade your privacy, but they will be careful not giving you the feeling they exploit it. When we communicate online, we often have someone in mind we talk to. Sitting there with a device is a rather intimate situation but be careful, you are talking to everyone. Better behave. In the end, it is good that there is a Data Privacy Day to remind us what is going on with them and with us. While Google's motto \"Don't be evil!\" isn't an ethical statement anymore but an economical statement, we are living with the public at our fingertips. Five important rules to manage your privacy 1. Don't drink and type! 2. Use best friends and good old phone to let off steam. Or at least make sure you don't have to work for the person you just insulted publicly. 3. Unless you aren't a c-celebrity or in the nude business, always keep your t-shirt and pants on outside. 4. In case you missed 1, 2 or 3 feel ashamed. Then remove or ask for removal of information you would prefer to not be posted. If not possible, say you are terribly sorry. 5. Want the old nerd days back where you could speak freely to your geek friends? Simply create an information elite around you, and choose whom you share information with."
