  "content": "Russell Crowe threatened to kill a veteran producer with his bare hands during a 3am phone call while filming his Oscar-winning role in Gladiator, according to a new book. Branko Lustig, 77, a Holocaust survivor, immediately telephoned Steven Spielberg in Los Angeles and asked to leave the production. The claims are made in Nicole LaPorte's The Men Who Would Be King: An Almost Epic Tale of Moguls, Movies and a Company called DreamWorks, which is published next month. It chronicles the history of the film studio, founded by Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen in 1994, which bankrolled Gladiator. Crowe's exact words, according to the book, were \"You motherfucker. I will kill you with my bare hands\". He was apparently angry at Lustig's refusal to pay his assistants what the actor considered to be a fair daily wage. The book also reveals Crowe's initial reluctance when asked by director Ridley Scott to utter what turned out to be Gladiator's most enduring line of dialogue: \"And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.\" Crowe was apparently convinced it was an overwrought sentence, but eventually persuaded to play ball following multiple takes. After the scene in question wrapped, he was said to have told Scott: \"It was shit, but I'm the greatest actor in the world and I can make even shit sound good.\" Gladiator, released in 2000, went on to win five Oscars, including a best actor gong for Crowe, who LaPorte says walked off set twice during filming. The actor took to Twitter to deny the claims in typically robust fashion: \"On Gawker/Defamer, book re dreamworks If mentions of me are eg's of distance from the truth waste of paper written by a lying horse's ass,\" he wrote. The outbursts detailed in LaPorte's book do not mark the first occasions upon which Crowe \u2013 currently promoting his new film with Scott, Robin Hood \u2013 has reportedly lost his temper. In 2002, he took BBC producer Malcolm Gerrie to task for cutting short his award acceptance speech at the Baftas. In 2005, he was arrested and charged with assault in New York after throwing a telephone at a hotel employee who had refused to help him place a call to Australia. The actor later apologised for both incidents."
