  "content": "After the Sun published a front page claiming one in five British Muslims had \"sympathy for jihadis\", the tabloid has been hit with criticism about its polling methods and a record number of Ipso complaints. Twitter users, however, took a different tack. Using the hashtag #1in5Muslims, some much-needed humour was added as people tweeted their own made up and humorous facts about Muslims. They ranged from slice of life humour: To references to popular internet memes: Naturally, animals were involved: And there were references to popular culture: There was also room to discuss discrimination faced by Muslims: Initially, the hashtag was being used to discuss the front page, but campaigner and community activist Furqan Naeem felt it needed to go further to \"send a strong and unequivocal message to the Sun that they can't stigmatise a community\". He and his friends encouraged others to make #1in5Muslims a trending topic. He added: \"The hashtag was a fun way to show Muslims coming together to set the record straight but also to show the light hearted and fun in way to laugh off such ridiculous claims. The message was clear - you try to sensationalise and stigmatise a community then people power will rise up and set the record straight.\" The Sun's poll, conducted by Survation, has drawn scrutiny from several sources, with some pollsters saying the question did not make it clear whom \"fighters in Syria\" referred to. A spokesperson for the Sun said: \"No one agreeing to the statement: 'I have a lot of sympathy with young Muslims who leave the UK to join fighters in Syria' was in any doubt which fighters we meant.\""
