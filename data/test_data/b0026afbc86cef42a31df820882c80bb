  "content": "MySpace is to launch its own developer platform next week, offering tools that will enable external companies to build games, content-sharing and communication features for the site. The MySpace Developer Programme, which launches on Tuesday, February 5, will work with a set of industry-wide standards called OpenSocial, an initiative set up by Google so that developers can build tools that work across a number of sites. Facebook was praised for opening up its site to developers in May last year, creating an ecosystem of small businesses that feed off the site. The social networking site's Facebook Platform now supports just under 15,000 applications including video players, quizzes and messaging tools. Developers were building unofficial skins and widgets for MySpace before Facebook launched its official platform, but the site often appeared uncomfortable with third-party tools and blocked several widgets. Music site Imeem and video-sharing site Revver were among those blocked from MySpace for breaking a condition that widgets must not \"engage in commercial activity\". The new, official developer programme has built on MySpace's early experience with widgets, while taking on board lessons from how Facebook has had to deal with issues of privacy, copyright and how to make money out of them. Facebook game Scrabulous was recently the subject of a high-profile takedown notice over the trademarked Scrabble game. MySpace plans to offer a formal revenue share to developers, rather than allowing them to place their own adverts on their application page as Facebook does. Full details will be announced at the launch on Tuesday from MySpace's new office in San Francisco. The platform is expected to allow developers access to information from users' profiles that will allow them to tailor their applications. Amit Kapur, the new MySpace chief operating officer, will oversee rollout of the developer platform in 28 countries. The site will launch application tools first and later announce a date when MySpace users will be able to add the applications to their profile pages. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
