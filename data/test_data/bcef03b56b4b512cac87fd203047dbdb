  "content": "Last week saw the widespread re-republication of a letter distributed by a group of head teachers that, unlike most letters sent home, garnered massive popular attention. What made this letter especially interesting was that it suggested those who allow their children access some of the most popular contemporary video games and social media are being neglectful parents. The letter concluded that this kind of neglect could leave young people at risk for \"grooming for sexual exploitation or extreme violence.\" Press treatment of the letter has largely focused on the legal and social implications of its threats but has not the scientific basis for its authors' claims. Although scientific citations are missing from the letter we can take some measure of comfort that we need not start reading individual papers from a literature rife with both conflicting findings and researchers. Gold-standard research from Ofcom indicates most parents in this country take active steps, using a range of strategies, to shape the media content to which their children are exposed, and that they accommodate with new strategies as young people approach adulthood. This work suggests that, perhaps, parents are already engaged without the need for threats. Comprehensive studies commissioned by the British and Australian governments, and conducted by a leading neuroscience laboratory in this country, have examined many of the parental and societal concerns regarding the effects of interactive media on the social and cognitive development of young people. Together these data highlight a number of plausible reasons for parents, teachers, and policy makers to keep an eye on digital technologies, but they do not identify harmful impacts from children's media use. In other words, they make salient the ways by which media may present risks to young people, but do not provide empirical support that such technologies cause measurable harm to young people. These conclusions can best be understood as a sharp contrast to known harms from other sources, such as the poor availability of youth mental healthcare services. As is the coda for much of science, reports examining the dangers of children's media use call on subsequent studies to sort out the vagaries and shortcomings of existing work. In line with such calls (and entirely by coincidence), this week one of the authors of this piece (Andrew Przybylski) along with his student Allison Mishkin published a study exploring the potential effects of online games on young people. This study was carried out in a school setting and examined the effects of the quantity and quality of regular video game play on students. Though methodologically simple, this study was intended to introduce three minor \"innovations\" that are largely absent when researchers argue over the effects of technology on young people. First, this study combined data from two sources before drawing any conclusions. Students \u2013 the focus of the study \u2013 reported on their gaming behaviours, and teachers reported on the behaviours they observed in the students. How the teachers saw their students was the outcome of interest. This method allowed us to explore the question \"Does media use meaningfully impact how young people behave at school?\" More importantly, this strategy minimised faulty conclusions made because of young people's mischievous responding - reporting, for example, that 'yes' they play games, and 'no' it does not harm them (or vice versa!). Second, we used measures of young person behaviour that are generally utilised by parents, doctors, teachers, and school psychologists. In other words, the study was grounded in assessments drawn from everyday educational settings. This might sound like common sense, but most research does not do this but instead uses measures from college laboratory settings, which may not translate well to understanding the behaviour of young people. Third, our simple models showed a modest yet statistically significant link between violent game play and conduct problems in school. If we had stopped with this finding and gone to press the work would have been received with headlines linking games to youth aggression. Instead, we took care to balance the number of boys and girls in our sample and controlled for the sex of the young people in our more advanced models. When we did, this relationship \u2013 the simple correlation between violent play and conduct problems \u2013 became undetectable. Young boys, compared to girls, are more rowdy in school and they are more likely, compared to girls, to gravitate towards violent games. Taking our three innovations together, simple steps to ensure high data quality, we did not find the anticipated link between gaming and aggression. Although we confirmed previous findings regarding the positives and negatives of quantity of gaming, it came as a bit of a shock that the general types of games played appeared to matter little. Ultimately, policy makers and those dedicated to educating parents about the potentials and pitfalls of technology will shape how we introduce young people to games and social media. We are optimistic this discourse can be informed by high quality scientific evidence. To do so, our focus must be less on the latest study and more on the body of research that is carefully conducted and transparent, and which can be reproduced by scientists who are not ideologically invested in the results of their studies. For now, it would be best we do not lose perspective. Child neglect is serious and applying this label to popular activities, without direct evidence of harm, risks trivialising a very real problem.",
