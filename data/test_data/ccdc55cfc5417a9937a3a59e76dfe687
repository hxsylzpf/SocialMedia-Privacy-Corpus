  "content": "The attorney general is considering whether to take action over a tweet revealing Vincent Tabak's interest in hardcore pornography that was posted during his trial. During the four-week trial orders were in place to stop the media reporting Tabak's interest in pornography depicting women being strangled during sex. It was feared that if the jury knew of Tabak's interest in such material it would be unfairly prejudiced against him and make a fair trial impossible. But during the trial a man was arrested after he posted a tweet revealing the existence of the pornography. The tweeter is a British man, believed to live in Gloucestershire. He is understood to have claimed that his information came not from the court but from a police source. He is believed not to be a journalist. Tabak, a 33-year-old Dutch engineer, was convicted on Friday of murdering his next-door neighbour Joanna Yeates and jailed for a minimum of 20 years. The attorney general's office confirmed on Monday that it had received papers from Bristol crown court about the case. \"We will be considering this and making a decision in due course,\" it said. The prosecution had tried to persuade the judge, Mr Justice Field, to allow it to present the jury with evidence of the pornographic material found on Tabak's computer. The judge would not agree, accepting the argument from Tabak's counsel, William Clegg QC, that knowing about the pornography would not help the jury decide if Tabak was guilty of murder but would make it impossible for them to treat him fairly."
