So hurrah for the advertising industry, where clients secretly believe agency people are overpaid salesmen or creative types who should dress like they have real jobs, while agencies think clients wouldn't know a decent idea if it came wrapped at Christmas with a sales uplift guarantee \u2013 and which has taken the art of trolling to new depths. Welcome to The Agency is a Cunt.com and its \"sister website\" The Client is a Cunt.com. Don Draper would be spluttering into his old fashioned."
