  "content": "MPs and an older people's charity today called for a review of the Data Protection Act after claims that it prevented social services from being alerted to the case of an elderly couple who died after their gas was cut off. British Gas claimed yesterday that it was barred by law from passing on information about George Bates, 89, and his 86-year-old wife Gertrude, who were found in a decomposed state in their south London home in October. The charity Age Concern today called for a review of the legislation to prevent a recurrence of the \"appalling\" case. Lady Greengross, vice president of Age Concern England, told BBC Radio 4: \"I think it is a real call for the government to review the Data Protection Act. This is appalling. We need to review the legislation and, if necessary, then change it. \"It looks as though we are protecting data at the expense of people. This is something we cannot allow to remain with us.\" The chairman of the Commons health select committee, David Hinchliffe, called for clarification of the act in the light of the couple's deaths. But the Labour MP for Wakefield said he was \"astonished\" that British Gas failed to pass on the couple's details to social services. \"If you are dealing with people of the age of Mr and Mrs Bates, common sense should prevail,\" Mr Hinchliffe told the BBC. \"I don't think there are any excuses for British Gas having cut off this couple.\" The community care minister, Stephen Ladyman, also told the BBC that he was not convinced that the law prevented the company from liaising with social services. He said: \"I will certainly be taking up the challenge to have a look at the act and see how it worked in this case. \"My first instinct is that the act did not prevent British Gas from passing information to social services that they suspected somebody was in a vulnerable situation. \"It certainly would have protected them from passing on why they thought that, the fact that the bill had not been paid, that is the piece of data that is protectable, but the suspicion that somebody is vulnerable and perhaps could do with a visit from social services does not seem to me to be [protected] information under the act.\" Yesterday Westminster coroner Paul Knapman said British Gas had followed the proper procedure in the run-up to the disconnection due to non-payment of a \u00a3140 bill. He said the company had contacted the couple 11 times in 143 days, including two visits to the house they had shared in Tooting for 63 years. Dr Knapman recorded verdicts of death by natural causes. Mr Bates died from hypothermia, while his wife suffered a heart attack. The coroner said he would contact the information commissioner, who monitors implementation of and compliance with the Data Protection Act, to bring to his attention what he described as \"a very tragic story\"."
