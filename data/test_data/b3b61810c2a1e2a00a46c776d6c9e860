  "content": "The Statistical Society of Australia has criticised the Australian Bureau of Statistics for a lack of transparency and failing to explain controversial changes to the census. The Statistical Society of Australia's president, John Henstridge, has warned the current controversies around the census \"may impact upon the quality of the data collected and may be raising unnecessary fears in the community\". After the 2016 census, to be conducted on Tuesday, the ABS will hold the names and addresses of respondents for four years, up from 18 months. The changes, along with the ability to match census information with a wide range of other data because of the longer retention period, have sparked privacy concerns. Nick Xenophon and a number of Greens senators have said they would withhold their names from the census due to the concerns, an approach rejected by the federal government and Labor opposition. Henstridge explained the collection of names and addresses was not new. \"For many years [the ABS] has collected names and addresses, so that field staff can check returns in initial stages of processing; these are not retained,\" he said. \"But the retention of returns with identifying names and addresses for a longer time, and in that time use it to create more comprehensive and useful data sets by linking to other data, including previous censuses [is new],\" he said. He said the Statistical Society of Australia was concerned the changes \"have not been handled well\" although they \"have many potential benefits\". \"In particular the public, whose cooperation is critical for a successful census, does not appear to have been adequately involved and the reasons for the changes are even now not well-publicised. \"This is an issue of transparency where the ABS needs to do better.\" Nevertheless, he praised the ABS for being highly protective of the confidential information collected. Henstridge said he hoped the Australian public fully engages with the census and the ABS \"adopts an approach of taking the community into its confidence in explaining what it is doing and why\". Henstridge said data collected from the census was used to identify places of disadvantage and social need. \"As statisticians we recognise the potential value of more comprehensive data sets to enable better decision making in government. This can be to the benefit of all.\" At a media conference on Tuesday, ABS chief statistician David Kalisch said retaining information for four years allowed it to produce key statistics on the economy, migration and the performance of the national health and education systems. Asked what would happen if Australians didn't include their names, Kalisch said the rest of the information supplied would be used but would be \"less valuable\". He said withholding one's name might compromise services delivered to the local community. Apart from privacy concerns, a number of other complaints have been raised about the handling of the census including people who did not receive an initial census letter, were unable to obtain a paper form, faced long waiting times at call centres and concerns about fines for failing to complete the census. On Tuesday further concerns about the census arose when some people had trouble accessing the website, which said: \"We are experiencing a high volume of calls. \"Do not worry if you have not received your census materials. \"You will not be fined if you complete your census after census night. Try calling again after August 10 when we expect call volumes to reduce.\" Kalisch said he had heard reports that submitting the electronic form could take \"a few minutes\". Concerns have also been raised that census respondents who do not identify as male or female require a special login to access other gender options, a fact first reported by Guardian Australia in February. At a media conference on Tuesday the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said he was \"frustrated that this government has bungled the census so much that we now see these debates in the days before the census about how long they should be keeping the data for\". He also took a swipe at senators who said they planned to withhold their names. \"Some of this information about the census has been in the public domain for weeks and months,\" he said. \"Perhaps there's a bid of grandstanding at five minutes to midnight so people notice you.\" Shorten said he respected people's privacy concerns but he would fill the form in fully and encouraged Australians to do likewise. \"It adds a lot more benefit to the nation than it causes harm.\""
