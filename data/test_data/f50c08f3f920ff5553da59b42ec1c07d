  "content": "\u2022 Less than a week after launching the Pre, Palm is installing chairman Jon Rubinstein as chief executive. Rubinstein, a former big cheese at Apple, has been helping mould Palm since joining in 2007 - and will take over complete control of the company from current CEO Ed Colligan by Friday, in what looks like a vindication of his ideas. \u2022 TechCrunch is reporting that MySpace may be preparing for 'massive layoffs', just a couple of months after new boss Owen Van Natta took over. \u2022 On the subject of MySpace, the company's travails are the cover story in this week's print edition of Technology Guardian - available from your newsagent. Also: the latest twists and turns with Phorm and an interview with senior Intel executive Sean Maloney. Just 90p (you get a newspaper too) or read it all online here. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed."
