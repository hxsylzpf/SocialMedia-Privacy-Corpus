  "content": "Several reports from the US make the point: local is the new buzzword in the land of web entrepreneurship. No wonder. As more and more smart mobile phones are used to check in online, the demand for local information online rises. However, listings magazines have been slow to adapt to the online world, so there is room for new hype, and maybe even a chance to make money. AOL sees revenues in local: Its CEO, Tim Armstrong, announced yesterday in New York that it plans to digitize entire towns with the help of Patch, the hyperlocal network it bought last year. Armstrong clearly sees a hole in the market here and plans to cover every aspect of community life from school boards to restaurants and shops. \"We're hiring reporters,\" Armstrong said according to the business journal Portfolio.com. \"Can you imagine that?\" Patch just switched to OpenStreetMap and appears to be busy with building its own map infrastructure, including designing, rendering and hosting its own tiles, according to zdnet. But that is not all. \"Patch will go into stores, photograph everything and even tell consumers how many parking spaces there are,\" Armstrong said. \"Even though it will have only 30 local communities outside New York City initially, it will scale substantially.\" While AOL invests in local it sheds global, so their new market strategy is to dig deep instead of spreading out wide. The company operates in about 40 countries now but plans for 2010 to be in less markets directly. (via paidContent, zdnet, Portfolio) eBay believes in local: A local news project in Hawaii is nothing special, except when the project is done by the billionaire and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Together with former eBay vice president Randy Ching he started Peer News Inc last year, which is now about to launch its local news service for Hawaii and is looking for an editor. Writing surfers out there, this is your chance! Omidyar announced yesterday to create the \"Honolulu-based local news service that will produce original, in-depth reporting and analysis of local issues in Hawaii\". It will launch 2010 and focus on \"public affairs and civic matters that impact communities across Hawaii\", he said in a blogpost. As the adviser of the project Howard Weaver made it clear that the project is to be as accountable as profitable and \"intends to demonstrate that a digitally native, technologically fluent web organization can profitably serve targeted readers who want sophisticated journalism focused on local civic affairs.\" There is an opportunity here: paidContent reports that Hawaii's largest newspaper, the Advertiser, has cut more than 130 jobs over the last two years and its rival Honolulu Star-Bulletin has also had a series of cutbacks. (via paidContent) Even the new social platform hype is local: As a tool for finding friends, a city guide and a weird competitive bar or shop game which crowns you as a mayor of a place if you have been there more often than other participants, the social platform Foursquare is the latest hot thing among early adopters of digital trends. It is available in 31 cities in the United States, including New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston and Washington, but also operating in London and Amsterdam.",
