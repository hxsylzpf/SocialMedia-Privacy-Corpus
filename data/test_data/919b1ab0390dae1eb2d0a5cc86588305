  "content": "The government expects to take and record all 10 fingerprints from people receiving identity cards, the head of the ID card scheme revealed yesterday. Details emerged when the Home Office started the bidding process for the computer and management contracts, which amount to more than a third of the estimated \u00a35.7bn cost of the scheme. Two of the contracts, worth up to \u00a3500m each over 10 years, include one to produce the fingerprint recording database and another to enrol people on to the scheme. James Hall, chief executive of the Home Office's identity and passport service, said the agency planned to issue the first ID cards to non-EU nationals living in the UK in 2008, and to the first Britons at the end of 2009. The government hopes that ID cards will be issued as passports expire, leading to at least 80% of the population holding cards within 10 years of that time. The government expects to use fingerprints and photographs as identification, but has rejected for now using images of irises. Mr Hall said: \"Our current plan is to capture 10 fingerprints and record those. They won't all necessarily be on the card but we will have a record of them. I say 'current plans' because we are continuing to review every opportunity to reduce cost and risk.\" David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said the scheme was a \"costly white elephant\" that would \"do nothing to improve our security\" and claimed it could collapse within two years of its being introduced.",
