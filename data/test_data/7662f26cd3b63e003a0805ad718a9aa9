  "content": "Most politicians would make rubbish contestants on Just a Minute. The long-running Radio 4 comedy quiz famously requires contestants to speak uninterrupted on a given subject without hesitation, a rule which would bar every \"um\", \"I mean\" or \"Look, you know, frankly \u2026\", and thus see off a good proportion at a stroke. The bar on repetition \u2013 that's every slogan, soundbite or stump speech used only once \u2013 would eliminate most of the rest. As for deviation \u2013 well, Paul Merton is safe for a bit. As his appearance before the Leveson inquiry on Tuesday demonstrated, however, the education secretary Michael Gove would be a natural. Gove doesn't converse, he orates, speaking in carefully constructed sentences, enunciating beautifully, scattering his prose with ostentatiously learned language \u2013 and permitting the interruption of no man. Not even if he's a judge who has summoned prime ministers, police chiefs and the world's most powerful media magnate to attend his inquiry. Gove is a former leader writer on the Times, an ally of Rupert Murdoch \u2013 they had repeated meetings in the 13 months after he took up his current role \u2013 and a member of the coalition cabinet that set up this inquiry. Leveson, accordingly, was anxious to hear from him \u2013 and Gove was certainly eager to be heard, delivering his evidence as if he were addressing, at once, the cheap seats in the back row of the Coliseum, and posterity. His text, however, was not exactly on message. David Cameron may have adopted a penitent pose \u2013 \"we all got too close to News International\" \u2013 but Gove wasn't having any of it, and would not hesitate or deviate in saying so. How would he characterise his relationship with Rupert Murdoch, asked Robert Jay? \"I think he is one of the most impressive and significant figures of the last 50 years,\" declared Gove without a beat. The Daily Mail's Paul Dacre? \"I respect him as one of the most impressive editors of our age.\" The public understand perfectly why politicians and newspaper editors and proprietors must be close, and \"I don't think they need steering, nudging or coaxing towards a sensible view.\" Well how did he account, asked his Lordship, for months of evidence to the effect that the relationship between press and politicians had become toxic? \"I think it's always wise to look at the historical context.\" It was a Latin writer who had said \"O tempora, O mores\", bewailing the decaying standards of his age; this was nothing new. It was magnificent impertinence, both seductive and exuberantly patronising. Leveson was momentarily stunned into silence. The education secretary is not a supporter of substantial further regulation of the press, and did not intend to leave the judge or anyone else in doubt of his arguments. Yes, some evidence of a number of crimes had emerged, but \"I have a prior belief that we should use the existing laws of the land \u2026\" \"Well do you think \u2026\" Leveson attempted to interrupt, but Gove hadn't finished. \"\u2026 and that the case for legislating [for stricter regulation] needs to be made very strongly before you curtail liberty.\" \"Mr Gove,\" retorted the judge, clearly beginning to weary of the performance. \"I don't need to be told about the importance of free speech. I really don't.\""
