  "content": "The only time I actually met Malcolm Fraser was at a Wheeler Centre event last year. He was talking there promoting his book about foreign policy, Dangerous Allies. The evening was a revealing one, and not merely for illuminating the character of the former Liberal party prime minister, who passed away Friday morning, aged 84, after a brief illness. The audience at the Wheeler was conspicuously diverse. Silvery old Tories sat beside scruffy young reds, among curious innercity baby boomers, a few suits and some impassioned activists for refugees. In such a combative era of Australian political culture, Fraser alone could attract such a crowd. 30 years ago, it would have been inconceivable that a Cold Warrior would enjoy such cross-over appeal in old age. I was born to a working class Labor family in the 1970s, and from my childhood Fraser was presented as something of a folk villain. Not only was he the ruthless conservative schemer who'd had himself propelled into the prime ministership with the dismissal of my parents' adored Whitlam, but he represented the class antithesis of our family's lived experience. Born in 1930 to a family of wealthy pastoralists, Fraser was a Melbourne Grammar boy, an Oxford scholar and suit. He spoke with the \"cultivated Australian\" accent, grating on the ears of many clans like mine, as the scion of a received pronunciation culture that privileged posh Australians while we were ridiculed. People like my parents engaged in small acts of symbolic resistance where they could, but Fraser was the white, male, ruling class exclusion culture made incarnate. In the period of his prime ministership from 1975-1983, Fraser governed as the Liberal that he was. He cut the ABC amid accusations of ABC bias, and closed Whitlam's innovative \"ministry of the media\". He did make attempts to wind back Whitlam's signature free education reforms \u2013 although these were successfully fought by an organised student movement. He formed an infamous \"razor gang\" to slash government spending and he messed with the universal healthcare provisions of the Medibank scheme. As the centre-right leader of a western nation in the cold war, he hung out with Ronald and Nancy Reagan, was hostile to the trade union movement as a potential front for world socialism. His comments that a Labor victory in the election of 1983 would lead to \"reds under the beds\" of the nation provoked much derision in the Badham household, with lifted bedspreads aplently. My parents \u2013 and, as it turned out, the majority of Australian voters \u2013 eagerly prepared themselves to vote in the ACTU hero and ocker champ, Bob Hawke. It's important to remember the political character of Fraser in office, given the transformed perception of him in later life has tempted many of us to consider him as some kind of national \"lefty uncle\". For some years before his death, Fraser's main public political engagement was as a commentator on foreign policy and as a champion for refugees and asylum seekers. In a policy environment in which both his Coalition progeny and the contemporary Labor party have abandoned humanitarian obligations, UN commitments and the rule of law to engage cruel symbolic demonstrations of xenophobia to the world's most vulnerable people, Fraser stood alongside progressive organisations like GetUp! and the Greens in a chorus of moral condemnation. He also became active on Twitter, which was how this devoutly \"red\" daughter of Whitlamite parents found herself sheepishly requesting Fraser's autograph on her copy of Dangerous Allies as a gift for my editor. I had written a piece in the Guardian arguing in favour of Australia's return to Fraser's bravest and most significant domestic policy as prime minister: a bipartisan agreement negotiated with the Labor party \u2013 against majority public sentiment of the time \u2013 to resettle hundreds of thousands of refugees within Australia. My piece contained an apology for my first act of political protest as a child: weeing on the lawn of parliament house during his prime ministership. To my surprise, Fraser himself responded to the article online to accept my apology. From there, to my editor's delight and my mother's palpable shock, he became one of my Twitter followers and regular readers, a promoter and frequent retweeter of my commentary. The rapport was surprising, not for his engagement with the \"reds under the threads\" (as I'd certainly describe myself), but for his dry humour and obvious enthusiasm for maintaining his engagement in a civil conversation of breadth and diversity. His engagement was not inspired by any late-life moral revelation, but rather was a demonstration of the truly liberal principles that defined him. The Liberal party's abandonment of liberalism was one of the reasons he rescinded his membership of it in 2009, when Tony Abbott assumed the leadership. That the movement that had shaped and promoted him was no longer \"a liberal party but a conservative party\" was the reason he gave at the time. The diverse crowd had gathered at the Wheeler that evening not because Fraser was a Liberal hero or a lefty uncle, but because his life and works demonstrated that he was an informed and principled Australian with something of value to say to the nation. But perhaps the greatest revelation of his appearance at the Wheeler occurred during the questions that followed it. A member of the crowd asked what his greatest political regret was. Many \u2013 myself included, I'll confess it \u2013 were expecting an apology for the knifing of Whitlam. The old man paused, in graceful consideration. \"I should have talked Jimmy Carter out of boycotting the Moscow Olympics,\" he said. His passing today has provoked in me a very tender sense of loss. Although many like me came to admire and even like the man, Malcolm Fraser never changed. The political conversation around him did.",
