  "content": "Google and Citizens Advice have launched a website offering consumers advice on online security and privacy issues. The Good to Know website features information on a range of issues, from creating a strong password to understanding how cookies work, and is aimed at computer users of all levels. It is being run alongside a series of adverts, which also offer advice on protecting personal data online. Recent research by Ofcom's consumers communications panel showed that 26% of UK internet users had concerns about the safety of their personal details, 14% were worried about privacy and 13% about fraud. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"We are delighted to be working in partnership with Google. \"Citizens Advice is all about straightforward, simple advice on the issues that matter, so helping people take control of their safety and privacy online is right up our street.\" The two partners have come up with five tips for consumers who want to stay safe online: \u2022 Pick a strong password. One idea you can try is to choose a line from your favourite song, film or play, such as \"To be or not to be, that is the question\". Then use numbers, symbols and letters to recreate it: 2bon2btitq. The more unusual the phrase you choose the better. \u2022 Never reply to suspicious emails with your personal or financial information, and never enter your password after following a link from an email you don't trust. \u2022Look for \"https\" and a padlock in the URL bar to check a site is secure. When you go into a branch of your bank you recognise the official staff by their name, uniforms and the services they offer. Having this level of reassurance shouldn't be any different for online banking or other sensitive services. \u2022Always sign out and shut down your browser. Ever gone out for the day and left your front door wide open? Exactly. The same principle applies when you leave yourself signed in to online accounts on the computers you use. \u2022 Use two-step verification for accounts that offer it, such as Google and Facebook. Two-step verification adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring you to have access to your phone \u2013 as well as your username and password \u2013 when you sign in. This means that if someone steals or guesses your password, the potential hijacker still can't sign in to your account because they don't have your phone. On Sunday, journalist Rowenna Davis told how she had had her email account hijacked, with the hacker demanding \u00a3500 to return it."
