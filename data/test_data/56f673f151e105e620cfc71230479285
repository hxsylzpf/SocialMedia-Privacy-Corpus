  "content": "The barrister representing Naomi Campbell in her privacy case against the Mirror has accused the newspaper's editor, Piers Morgan, of \"boxing clever\" in the witness stand. Delivering his summing up on what is expected to be the last day of the court case, Andrew Caldecott QC dismissed as \"disingenuous\" the Mirror editor's claims to have come by the story about Campbell's Narcotics Anonymous attendances through \"a stroke of luck\". Morgan had earlier claimed the Mirror had got its story by chance when a source had spotted Campbell going into the meeting, in the King's Road in London The model is suing Mirror Group Newspapers for breach of confidence, invasion of privacy and breach of the Data Protection Act after the paper published an article headlined \"Naomi: I am a Drug Addict\", revealing she was attending Narcotics Anonymous for drug addiction. Mr Caldecott said yesterday he believed the source of the story must have been a personal acquaintance of Campbell. \"It must have been someone very close to Miss Campbell to have known her specific itinerary,\" he told the high court yesterday. The identity of the source is important because Mr Caldecott has argued that whoever told the Mirror where Campbell was attending her Narcotics Anonymous meeting was under a duty to keep the information confidential. But the judge, Mr Justice Morland, hinted that any possible financial compensation may not be substantial when he said the award of damages would \"have no reflection on the income of the claimant or the financial pockets of the defence\". Mr Caldecott replied that Campbell was not looking for \"casino damages\" in the case. \"That is not why she is here,\" he said."
