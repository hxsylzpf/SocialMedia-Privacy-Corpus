  "content": "Listorious goes some way to solving one of the biggest problems for Twitter users: finding people who are interested in the same topics as you. That could be something as broad as News or as select as the cast and writers from the BBC comedy, The Thick of It . If you want a list devoted to Airports or New York City Food Trucks and Other Street Vendors, you can find them here. If you can't find what you want, you can create your own list on Twitter then add it to Listorious. If you don't add it, of course, then Listorious won't publish it. Listorious provides a more open and democratic source of lists than Twitter's own Suggested User List (SUL), which offers new users a selection of people to follow. The SUL means some accounts now have hundreds of thousands of followers that they have not \"earned\" on the merits of their tweets. Twitter has recently taken a step in the right direction by dividing the SUL into categories such as Books, Politics and Travel, but it's still dominated by American celebrities. If you want to find people in more specialised areas, or a decent sample of non-Americans, then you'll have to try a different directory. The main ones are probably Listorious, Twellow and WeFollow, but there are also more specialised guides such as Sawhorse Media's MuckRack (journalists), Championist (sport) and other subjects. Which is not to say that Listorious couldn't be better. It now offers so many lists that most people are not going to look beyond the first few at the top \u2013 the ones that already have the most followers. Also, Listorious works by using the tags added by whoever created the list, and these are not necessarily accurate. (It makes sense to use lots of tags because then your list appears in lots of Listorious categories, but if you make a mistake, you can't edit the tags later.) If users could search using more than one tag, that would help people to narrow lists down to what they really want. Some form of geo-tagging would also be useful for international users. For those who want a quicker option, Listorious has its own lists, often based on 140, which is the number of characters allowed in a tweet. The biggest is the Listorious 140, which shows the 140 biggest lists by number of followers. Actually, it shows the top 1,400, spread over 10 pages. There are similarly long lists of The Most Followed People on Twitter and The Most Listed People on Twitter. \"Most listed\" is probably a better guide to tweet quality than \"most followed\", though it only includes lists added to Listorious. People have always created lists, and Listorious probably taps into some deep human need, even if it's only to save time by focusing on things you consider important. Listorious means you can save even more time by letting other people create them."
