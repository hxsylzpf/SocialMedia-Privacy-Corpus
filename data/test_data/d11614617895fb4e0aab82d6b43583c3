  "content": "You know you've made it when you're being impersonated on Twitter. It used to be a story when this happened; now it's just an inevitability and increasingly obscure celebrities are being faked. Armando Iannucci is the latest 'victim' - fans were whipped into a sea of frenzy after Fake Armando tweeted that he's working on the script for the third series of The Thick of It. Alas, it's not so. Despite being picked up by several trade sites, the Independent assures us that Ianucci has not yet succumbed to the power of the Tweet. Still, he might be moved enough by the show of support to find that third series somewhere at the bottom of his dry, wry heart. It worked for Wispa on Facebook, after all. \u2022 Update: So we can all rest easy: @armandoiannucci was an imposter but has been exterminated, @aiannucci is real and there will be a third series of The Thick of It, according to Chris Addison. That'll do, pig."
