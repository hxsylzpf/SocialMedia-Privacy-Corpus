  "content": "\"What first attracted you, Debbie, to the millionaire Paul Daniels?\", Mrs Merton once famously asked Debbie McGee. So given Ireland's notoriously low corporate tax regime, what was it that attracted Facebook to set up its international headquarters alongside every other tax-efficient multinational in Dublin? Colm Long, Facebook's director of online operations, oversees operations and global ads policy from the base in Dublin. Since the office opened in December 2007 with a small team including four staff relocated from the US, Facebook now has 200 staff in Dublin - mostly ad sales, account management and platform operations, who work with developers. Within the next 12 months, Long tells the Guardian, Facebook will recruit another 100 staff in Dublin, expanding all those teams. Facebook's director of online operations Colm Long. Photo by channelship on Flickr. Some rights reserved More than 75 multinational tech firms have now established an international base in Dublin, including Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Intel, attracted by Ireland's corporate tax. Despite protestations from Germany and other EU countries who have contributed billions to Ireland's bailout package, the rate looks likely to stay at 12.5%. By using accounting methods that see taxable profits routed through various European countries, companies can reduce their tax level to as little as 2.4% \u2013 though in the UK and US, corporate tax peaks at 28% and 35% respectively. How about that corporate tax rate? Few companies are prepared to discuss the issue, aware of the heightened public sensitivity over the tax arrangements of high-profile companies. Does Long recognise that sensitivity? \"Yes. But I can't comment on that,\" he said. Guardian Tech had been told of the \"brass plaque\" phenomenon \u2013 companies setting up an official but lightly staffed base. Facebook is expected to see revenue rise to $1bn next year, according to eMarketer, and if the company is benefiting from Ireland's \"tax efficiencies\", isn't it obliged to contribute in other ways? \"If we continue to execute well we can create really meaningful employment opportunities for graduates,\" said Long. \"The should be some sense of optimism that they don't have to emigrate for opportunities.\" \"This is not a very popular thing to say, but we've seen time and time again that we can go in and have conversations with the Irish government to solve problems ... there's often more bureaucracy in other countries.\" Dublin. Photo by UggBoy\u2665UggGirl on Flickr. Some rights reserved Long joined Facebook in January 2009, one month after the Dublin office opened, but had already spent more than four years at Google's Irish base, most recently as director of operations for EMEA. From his experience at Google, said Long, he knew Dublin's strengths in quickly building multilingual teams with strengths in problem solving. \"Ireland is very business friendly \u2013 you can get talent quickly not just from Ireland but from abroad ... Other countries are tightening up on immigration and that's understandable. But the Irish government's approach, though they are cognisant of that, is that they understand you are a growing business ... they know that to help our business we'll need more people and the government will need to be flexible and forward thinking. I've appreciated that collaborative approach, and the [Facebook] executive team have been very encouraged by the very commercial focus of government and agencies.\" Supporting startups When the Guardian Tech team was in Dublin, at least one startup told us Facebook doesn't have much of a presence in the local tech scene \u2013 and also expressed frustration that features like Facebook Places aren't active yet for users in Ireland. Long strongly disputed that, saying that as an English-language market Ireland sometimes benefits early when new features are rolled out. Facebook had 633.5 million unique users in October, according to comScore, with 1.495 million in Ireland \u2013 indicating Facebook is used by 74.9% of the population. In the UK, Facebook has 31.3 million users or 81.4% of the population. \"Ireland is small but has great penetration and has seen rapid adoption,\" said Long. \"Sometimes when we roll things out Ireland gets them way earlier than it ordinarily would, but the technical implementation of Places \u2013 specifically lots of aspects of the back end and getting the data itself \u2013 means some markets have been delayed. We have prioritised markets with larger user bases and strategically we're rolling out in growth markets.\" 'Irish developers get more support than UK developers' Long is positioning Facebook as a mentor and advice hub for the tech scene in Ireland, and said the support it gave to Irish gaming giant Jolt, which recently launched a Playboy game for Facebook, is typical. \"I'd say we support local developers more than we support UK developers,\" says Long, defensively. \"I personally feel we've invested quite a bit of time with the local community, and while there's room to do more we have done a lot in the last two years.\" Trinity College, Dublin. Photo by UggBoy\u2665UggGirl on Flickr. Some rights reserved Facebook has run three developer garages in that time, and held talks for computer science students at Trinity College and University College Dublin. Long insists that work in universities is not about soaking up local talent but about reinforcing the link between education and industry and describing the direction of travel for the computer science industry. As for hard cash, Facebook launched the FB Fund to make investments in promising Facebook development, but Long won't say whether the company would pledge dedicated funding for Irish developers \u2013 which could be seen as putting its money where its financial mouth is. \"There are no specific plans, though last year FB Fund opened to global developers so we are raising awareness,\" said Long. \"We can point a company in the right direction where we see a good fit. Outside funding we support companies through mentorship.\" Talent drain? How about the concerns Facebook might be sucking up local talent? \"If we are then I'm worried about the local talent pool,\" he said, adding that local startups who complain about struggling to fill developer roles should do more outreach with universities and offer internships. \"We haven't hired that many people on the technical side.\" Facebook's Dublin office has 200 staff but less than 20 of those are technical; less than 10 work on the platform group and the backend engineering group is smaller still. Developer Charles Dowd has founded two startups in Ireland and advised on a string of others over the past 20 years. After developing a hotel reservation app for Facebook called ticket truck, Facebook recruited him as manager of platform operations for EMEA. Facebook's platform operations team in Dublin is the first outside California, working on policing the developer platform and with outreach and education for the developer community. \"He now has a seat at the table not just in Europe but globally, and he's sought out for his opinion when we role out new products or want to know the temperature for developers on some things,\" said Long, though he admitted being conflicted about taking on such high profile member of Ireland's startup community. Dublin's team has a strong voice at Facebook's base in Palo Alto, insists Long \u2013 who is said to have a close working relationship with Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. \"It's hard to make predictions for Facebook, but there will be a lot of opportunities and we will be trying to grow those for this region,\" he said. \"We've built a reputation internally as a group that can solve complex problems and drive online revenue, so as the company rolls out new initiatives we will hopefully be at the forefront of their mind.\""
