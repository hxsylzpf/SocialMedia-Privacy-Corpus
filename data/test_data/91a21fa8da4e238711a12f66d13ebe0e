  "content": "UPDATE: This problem has now been fixed, and appeared to be a problem with the way Twittervision interacted with the main site. More at the bottom of this post. Twitter, the popular messaging site which has gained traction among the technorati, has come in for plenty of criticism for downtime, bugs and trouble keeping up with the volume of users signing up. But its latest problem takes things beyond the merely irritating and into the realm of dangerous - by undermining user privacy. Users of the site are able to make their profiles and messages private via the website, preventing unwanted eyes from being able to monitor or see what's being said. But unfortunately a glitch in the Twitter API - which is used to let third-party applications mash up Twitter data - has left \"private\" users looking very exposed indeed. First spotted by colleague Meg, the hole is obvious if you look at sites built on Twitter's platform, such as the popular Twittervision, which pins messages onto a map in real time. Private user information is visible on Twittervision's many user pages, which are built from the information extracted from the API. Right now this might seem like only a minor bug. But consider this: Twittervision's pages are indexed by the search engines, meaning that messages that users may have sent privately between friends are now not only visible on the web - they are also potentially searchable forever. I have tried to contact Twitter's team, who are based in California, to point out the issue to them and try to find out what's gone wrong - but as yet have had no response (it's currently 7am Pacific time) However, I have had contact with Dave Troy who runs Twittervision (which is not related to Twitter in any direct way). In an email he told me that he was looking into the issue but that he didn't believe it was a major issue: \"For what it is worth, the number of people who participate in something like Twitter who also opt to keep updates private is a pretty small percentage, and you are the first person to bring this up to me,\" he said. \"If this were a widespread concern I would have heard about it from others by now.\" However, at the point of writing this, Twittervision seemed to have stopped pulling feeds from the main site. UPDATE: I received an initial reply from Biz Stone at Twitter, who said he wasn't aware of the problem - but now (6.20pm London time) it seems to have been fixed; and Twittervision seems to be rebuilding pages to remove private messages that had previously been on display. However, de-privatised entries are still showing up in the caches of search engines. UPDATE: The problem is now fixed; Twitter says it wasn't an actual API problem, but one that resulted from users having to give their ID and password to Twittervision. I'm still trying to get more information on exactly how this came about, but have made some alterations to the post to reflect the latest data. UPDATE: It turns out that basically your information wasn't private if any one of your friends had given their details to Twittervision; effectively it was able to go and read private data you'd been given access to, and then build separate user pages for those people. Dave Troy responds: \"There was no \"glitch\" in Twitter's API (outside of the scaling issues we've all witnessed) but rather in the cumulative interaction between our system and theirs.\" I've now changed the headline from \"Twitter glitch leaves 'private' users exposed to the world' to the current version. The number of affected people is apparently small, but it's the principle here rather than the definite impact.",
