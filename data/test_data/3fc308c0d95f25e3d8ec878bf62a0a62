  "content": "There was, this week, a positive development for activists facing government crackdowns. Many who had long suspected their governments of trying to break into their email accounts now have someone new in their corner. It's not a prominent subversive, or even some political support \u2013 it's Google. The online giant is often the subject of efforts, whether from criminal or intelligence sources, to break into its users' accounts. And now, when it sees evidence such attacks originate from a state, or similar actor, it will give users specific warnings this is the case. On the face of it, activists can now rest easy: if your government is trying to read your emails, Google will do its best to let you know. For those in autocratic regimes, this is true. For those in western democracies, however, the real position is very different: Google will often directly hand your details over. Governments are able to make legal requests to Google for user data. In many jurisdictions (certainly the US), it's possible to \"seal\" such requests, to make them secret, so that your data can be handed over without you being informed this has even happened \u2013 let alone being given a chance to fight it. In one six-month period \u2013 January to June 2011, according to figures Google voluntarily releases \u2013 Google received more than 15,700 government requests for the data of over 25,000 of its users. In more than 11,400 of these cases, more than two-thirds, Google complied with these requests in part or in full. The US government has a particularly successful track record: 93% of its 5,950 data requests were complied with. Russia (42 requests) and Turkey (73 requests), on the other hand, were successful in none of their applications for user data. This creates a troubling double standard: Google actively resists efforts by some governments to get hold of users' data through underhanded means. At the same time, the company will willingly \u2013 and often secretly \u2013 hand over user data to other governments with little to no fuss. For those outside the US, there are almost no conceivable safeguards that could work to prevent this. Whatever the rules, right and protections in your host country, if you use services hosted in the US, and owned by US companies \u2013 such as Google \u2013 and the US government wants your data, it can get it. No one should try to draw equivalence between US information gathering on activists, such as those in Occupy or elsewhere, and the gathering of autocratic regimes. Time and again the latter prove themselves orders of magnitude worse. But nor does this mean efforts by western governments are always justified: surveillance through the 20th century rightly drew scrutiny and opprobrium, and similar efforts in the US, UK and elsewhere should do too: efforts to track Occupy supporters, environmental campaigners, WikiLeaks activists, Anonymous and LulzSec and more, have all raised serious ethical concerns in various quarters. When some governments can track the citizens of every country with relative ease through legal means, while others are left trying to hack into email accounts, it's clear online accountability is in a mess \u2013 and no one, whatever their views on the legitimate extent of national security, should be satisfied with the status quo. None of this is to say Google's effort is an irrelevance: opposition activists in dictatorships and emerging democracies face much greater dangers than those targeted \u2013 fairly or otherwise \u2013 by western governments. Putting technical and human resource into combating such efforts has little direct financial benefit to Google, and few other online email providers (Yahoo, Hotmail, AIM or Lycos) have made any such public stands \u2013 and similar are few and far between on social networks and other services. If states are hacking into the accounts of activists, suspected criminals or others they oppose, any efforts such as this to resist, inform users, or make such activities harder are to be commended. But all too often, they don't even need to \u2013 they can just walk in and take it. Preventing that will prove a much more difficult task."
