They are creating a completely distinct third-party Android software ecosystem that is independent from Google and they are building a heavily-customized userspace stack that integrates with completely different Web services and allows them to deliver the kind of user experience that they want.\" Nokia: a tale of two analyses &gt;&gt; HackingCough \"...anyone who describes the N93 as a 'superphone' has to be a bit deluded. I used to use one. It was a perfectly good phone. But, frankly, saddled with Symbian with S60 layered on top, it was a usability nightmare. Yes, you could surf the web with it, send emails and download applications. But it was all so much trouble. The iPhone environment may be more restrictive and lack the proper multitasking of Symbian - but that didn't matter when I found the iPhone to have simply better utility.\" You can follow Guardian Technology's linkbucket on delicious"
