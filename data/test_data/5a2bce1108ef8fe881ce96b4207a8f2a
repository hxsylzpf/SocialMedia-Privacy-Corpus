  "content": "The figures, alas, are predictably horrible. The Independent's audited circulation in March was down 16.7% in 12 months. The Independent on Sunday fared ever more direly: down 24.3%. Worse, when you strip out giveaway, cut-price and overseas copies, that leaves the daily selling 119,927 full-rate Indies (147,099 last year), while the Sindy looks even sicker: just 79,286 last month against 113,097 in March 2008. For almost two weeks now - as the papers prepare to up sticks and tramp from Canary Wharf to the Mail's Kensington atrium in search of a snugger berth, and after bidding goodbye to another 50 or so journalists - the daily and Sunday have been produced by reporters writing very clean copy and desk editors (plus one sub-editor per department) slipping it into computer formats. Cheap? Naturally, because it wipes out almost an entire legion of the subs who tailor, check, project and vet what you read every morning, the headline writers of history. But practical? Call it toil in progress. This relentless formatting isn't revolutionary, to be sure. Richard Desmond, among others, has long since deemed this a road paved with private gold. But there is something new here for papers of the Independent's quality and complexity, struggling now to stay afloat with an editorial staff way under 200 in a market where bigger rivals can employ between two and three times that number. Cutting, moving, surviving? It is a very tall order - and current efforts to make it work, borne witness to at breakfast tables around the land, have been valiant in the extreme. You'd be surprised if many readers had noticed an increase in typographical garbles or factual mistakes. Change came at the start of the G20 summit. It was well covered. It continued last week through the bloody police aftermath of that summit. Well covered, too. Perhaps there are a few tell-tale signs of strain if you look hard enough: see the balancing of pages between very early stories, for the formatters' menu du jour, and the inevitably late tales that have to be coped with somehow. But they are being coped with so far. And, one step into the future, the power of the name remains. The other kind of relevant reader audit - for online user visitors in February, the last month's statistics available - showed the Indy had 9.4 million readers dropping in, a year-on-year rise of 103.5%. That result may not come close to established giants in this field - the Telegraph, Guardian and Times, all with figures well over 20 million - but in terms of return on investment (including manpower and a relatively tiny editorial web team) it still represents real progress for a real global brand. Does Denis O'Brien, the hi-tech Mr Big among Indy shareholders, value a digital presence which could be dynamic? Will he, at last, give the Indy's valiant warriors a chance? It's easy to see how a little fresh thinking could help - clearing away more of the trees that die to keep 85,000 giveaway bulks and foreign copies dropping into pits of futility, switching marketing away from promotions for great British butterflies to the hard sell of cash across counters. If price matters - and it clearly does when you find Daily Star circulation bouncing up 13.5% at a mere 20p - then the Independent might make a clear killing at 60p rather than the \u00a31 that caused it so much damage last autumn. Small isn't always beautiful. Often it's merely anxious, weighed down by constant crisis. But small can also be nimble in a jam - and sustained by a spirit that spreads round a room. The Independent is fighting to keep that spirit. It wants to survive. Well, over to you - but not out, Dublin? Arianna's investigation team must Post some real results It is not an intrinsically silly idea. The Huffington Post (proprietor and chief cheerleader the blessed Arianna) announces that it's collected $1.75m to employ half-a-dozen or so otherwise unemployed journalists in a not-for-profit investigative unit, probing areas - such as the economy - where stones need turning over. Why not? The idea has some modest appeal. But its attendant hoop-la is very silly indeed. For one thing, Huffington is only putting up $500,000 herself. The rest comes from a couple of worthy foundations. For another thing, the difference between for-profit and not-for-profit seems pretty notional, since the H Post exists in a private world where the prospect of profit surfaces only occasionally, while loss appears a continual bind. So, for a third thing, it's entirely dotty for learned pundits to hail this investigative divide as some kind of template for a future without major papers such as the New York Times Arianna talks some splendid talk and often struts a splendid walk. Her net Post, boasting thousands of unpaid but prestigious bloggers, is a sharp, well-displayed collection of opinion pieces fully deserving its current success. But count the ads - a light task at the moment - and wonder where (apart from benevolent equity capitalists bearing $25m cheques) the cash comes from. The Post's total reporting staff adds up to around seven, if you count hard. Its entire editorial, technical and commercial pay roll - now servicing two offices - hovers between 50 and 60. We're not matching New York Times resources here: indeed, we're basically on a manpower par with a number of small, trouble-making net sites in the Talkingpointsmemo.com style which mount abrasive investigations of their own - and grow because they get stories, not because they grandiosely announce what stories they may one day hope to get. Moreover, investigative reporting for most serious newspapers isn't a separate, charitable activity; it comes when journalists notice something odd. Heaven bless the good ship Arianna and all who sail with her. But make sure you know the difference between hype and history before you leave port. Making the media look like the good guys Two stark lessons emerge from the quagmire of evasion surrounding Ian Tomlinson's last walk home. One is that if police-controlled cameras can trawl for crime, then press and spectator-held cameras can show us policemen baton-bashing innocent strollers. The second lesson has even wider ramifications. How many times have judges told journalists who wanted to publish and be damned that their real duty as citizens was to tell what they knew to the \"proper authorities\"? And how many times have the police cried \"privacy\" as a mantra for keeping reporters away from grieving families who \"just want to be left alone\"? The resonant thing about the Tomlinson debacle is how both these lines, officially peddled through the five days after his death, proved utterly frail. The Guardian, in a searing account by Sandra Laville and Paul Lewis last Thursday, showed the Independent Police Complaints Commission plodding round to the paper (accompanied by a City of London policeman) to demand the first damning video be taken down from the website. It also detailed statements from the Yard not so much economical as vestigial with the truth - and far too many private pleadings and semi-public warnings to stay away from Tomlinson's wholly misled family for fear of causing them more \"upset\". The IPCC looks credulous, craven and chummy: the police look slippery going on stinky: and the media - raising questions doggedly, refusing to be fobbed off, but also blanking out Bob Quick's terror memo the moment they were asked to - looks rather better than the last grisly opinion poll might have you believe. Terror trials and prejudice There's \"an atmosphere of impunity in relation to prejudicial reporting of terrorist trials\", says Louise Christian, battling defence solicitor. But there's also a feeling of total unreality about the 1981 Contempt of Court Act in the internet age, according to the Society of Editors, arguing for some sensible reform. Gordon Brown describes \"a very big terrorist plot\" with \"links to Pakistan\". Students with easy visas take briefings centre stage. All of which, you might think, is necessary public information at a time of vigilance and threat. But it's also potentially prejudicial information delivered from on high with complete impunity, even before you start crawling through the internet.",
