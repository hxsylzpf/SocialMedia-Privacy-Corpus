  "content": "First it was racing pigeons; now another iconic piece of English life will provide the backdrop for an experiment to demonstrate the need for faster rural broadband \u2013 cricket. In what's being described as the 'world's first' live broadcast of a village cricket match, a group of people with an interest in improving rural broadband have organised themselves using Twitter to film the Easter weekend match. Organiser John Popham told me Wray had been chosen because the village has 30 megabits per second (Mbps) symmetrical community network which was installed by Lancaster University - meaning that it achieves both download and upload speeds about eight times faster than the typical UK household's broadband download speed (and about 60 times faster than the typical upload speed of 0.5Mbps). Over to Popham: \"Has it been done before? So far, no one has challenged my assertion that it's a first, and, if someone has done something like it, I am sure no one has done a whole match in the way I am intending to do it. \"As far as the technology. I probably can't say until I've done a proper test, but I will probably use livestream because that allows for multiple cameras and switching between them. I'll probably use at least two, and ideally three, laptops with USB HD webcams placed in different positions and use livestream to switch between cameras. This will be dependent on being able to get power to three different locations. I am assured it can be done. \"I'm confident we can do this, because the village Wi-Fi has a 30Mbps upload speed. Even though you switch the output between cameras, it does mean that all the cameras you use are actually streaming constantly to the network.\" The ideas has snowballed since it was first tweeted and this morning was even picked up by the prolific celeb tweeter Stephen Fry. But the point isn't (just) to let you watch cricket, explains Popham: It's a bit of fun, but it has a serious purpose too. The serious side is to demonstrate that it can be done, it IS possible to live broadcast events like this using relatively cheap equipment and a good internet connection. It will also demonstrate the importance of good internet connectivity in rural areas, and the need for fast UPLOAD connections if we are to realise the aspiration to use the internet to enable more people to produce their own content. Given fast broadband in communities, you can see the potential: \"televising\" (online) of your local cricket match, parish council meeting, whatever. The key difference about the Wray system is its fast upload as well as download speed - meaning it's known as SDSL (Symmetrical Digital Subscriber Link) rather than the ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Link) that almost everyone at home has. The only way to get good SDSL though is to have optic fibre connections to homes and villages - which is a challenge that BT and other operators have fought shy of because of the cost. Maybe Wray will show the promise and get things moving. Follow the progress of the project at Popham's blog: http://johnpopham.wordpress.com.",
