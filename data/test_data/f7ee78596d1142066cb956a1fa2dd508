  "content": "Vine has already been a launchpad to stardom for musicians like Shawn Mendes, whose six-second loops on Twitter's video-sharing app propelled him to a major record deal, chart-topping sales and a tour with Taylor Swift. Where Mendes and fellow Viners Jack &amp; Jack and Us the Duo have blazed a trail, other musicians are following. Now Vine is making music even more of a priority with new features within its app. They include a new \"Featured Tracks\" section with samples of popular songs for people to use as the soundtracks for their videos, and a feature called \"Snap to Beat\" which will trim their clips to ensure the music loops seamlessly. \"To date, our creation tools have focused on the visual components of your Vines. By focusing on how your Vines sound, you can make better Vines, and share new music for the world to uncover,\" explained Vine in a blog post. For now, the new creation tools will only be available in Vine's iPhone app. Another new feature \u2013 the ability to tap on a music-note icon to identify the song playing in a clip being watched \u2013 will be available on iPhone and Android. Vine's editorial team will choose which songs to add to the Featured Tracks section, with the company licensing the tracks from music labels and publishers. Vine also hopes that artists and labels will see the new features as valuable for promotional purposes, including the ability to add a link to their Vine clips directing viewers to download stores, streaming services or other sites of their choice. The number of people watching Vine videos \u2013 in the app, on Twitter and online \u2013 has doubled in the last year from 100 million in August 2014 to 200 million now. The new features are not a complete surprise. Earlier in August, Twitter's UK director, Bruce Daisley, posted a clip titled \"Test\" that featured music looping independently of the video cuts, sparking reports that Vine was planning a soundtracks feature."
