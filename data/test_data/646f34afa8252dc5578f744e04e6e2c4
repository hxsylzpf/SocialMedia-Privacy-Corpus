  "content": "The chief executive of the Chinese network and handset supplier Huawei says that last year's Snowden revelations about the extent of western government surveillance have been \"good and bad\" for business. Speaking at a global analyst summit in Shenzhen, China, where the company has its headquarters, Eric Xu said that the stories published in the Guardian and other papers \"did not have a big impact on business growth\" but that it had affected its relationships with its potential partners in mobile networks around the world. \"It affects us on communicating with our partners and stakeholders,\" Xu said. \"It makes us simply more tiresome for them.\" Huawei, whose founders include a former member of the Chinese Red Army, has been banned from network contracts in the US, and more recently from providing network capability for Australia's next-generation network. US politicians have expressed fears that the systems it provides could have \"back doors\" that would allow them to be tapped or subverted by state-run hackers. But it also emerged during 2013 that the US National Security Agency had stolen some of Huawei's code used to control its exchanges \u2013 making the company look like the victim rather than a malicious player. Despite being shut out of the US, Huawei is the world's second biggest supplier of network systems, after Sweden's Ericsson and ahead of Finland's Nokia Siemens Networks. On Wednesday its vice president of accounting, Fan Shen, announced full-year results of 239bn yuan (US$39.5bn), up 8.5% year-on-year, operating profits of 29.1bn yuan and net profit of 21bn yuan. Revenues in the Americas, including the US, fell by 1% \u2013 the only geographic area where the company's revenues fell. During the year it became the third-largest supplier of smartphones, after Samsung and Apple, according to the research company IDC. Huawei is angling to win more contracts to install 4G networks worldwide; it claims to power 70% of the 4G networks in place worldwide, being used by the UK's EE network along with NSN, and having last year won the contract to build out the 4G network for China Mobile, the largest carrier in the world. But security concerns have dogged the company in recent years as it has expanded out of China and begun to work significant contracts. Its first key overseas contract was with BT to provide a fixed-line network - a deal that last year led to calls for the source code for the network systems to be reviewed for back doors - something that had already been done ahead of the contract win. Xu said that it was important for the industry to agree on standards for security. \"We have always believed that the issue of security is a collective challenge faced by the industry, government and consumers \u2013 it therefore requires collective efforts to address this challenge.\" He added that \"security should be a priority. Looking into the future, I think it's possible Huawei could become one of the leaders in this area, and move global clients to meet requirements and standards for security.\" Such standards will become more important as networks move towards \"software-defined networks\" (SDNs), where data for real-time networks can be routed over abitrary networks by configuring them using software, rather than building specific vendor-owned systems to carry the data. \u2022 The Guardian's trip and accommodation to Shenzhen was paid for by Huawei.
