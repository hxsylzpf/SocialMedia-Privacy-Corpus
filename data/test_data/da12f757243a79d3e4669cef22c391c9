  "content": "Our right to privacy and the role of the media are just some of the issues being examined by the Leveson inquiry into press standards, making it a perfect vehicle for exploring a number of citizenship themes including human rights, bullying and the safe use of social networking tools. The British Red Cross has produced a lesson plan, available on the Guardian Teacher Network, which uses evidence from the Leveson inquiry to help students reflect on attitudes towards privacy. Pupils consider questions such as \"How much does personal privacy matter to you?\" and \"Where do you feel the line should be drawn on press coverage of people suffering personal tragedy?\" It also uses evidence from the inquiry to highlight the harm that can be caused by the circulation of gossip and the sharing of photographs and videos online. The resource contains four activities that you can use to create a lesson suited to the age and interests of your pupils. The network also gives you access to specially selected articles from the Guardian's coverage of the Leveson inquiry. \"News of the World axed by News International\" details the phone-hacking scandal that sparked the inquiry; \"Guilty media executives will be banned\" covers the prime minister's announcement of the inquiry; and \"JK Rowling tells Leveson inquiry of tabloid 'siege'\" contains evidence given by the Harry Potter author. You can access more information on the Leveson inquiry, including live blogs and video footage, at the Guardian's dedicated website (http://www.theguardian.com/ media/leveson-inquiry). \"Who Guards the Guardians?\" is a lesson plan that suggests how you could use the newspaper articles mentioned above with your class. Pupils consider the events that sparked the Leveson inquiry, using role-play to explore their attitudes to phone hacking; they investigate the remit and aims of the inquiry using a video of David Cameron's announcement to parliament; and they examine JK Rowling's attack on newspapers for publishing pictures of her children, revealing her family's home address, and placing a letter addressed to her in a schoolbag belonging to her five-year-old child. Pupils are directed towards the Leveson inquiry website or more information. \"Taking Liberties\" is a resource created by the British Library that includes a lesson on press freedom. Pupils consider what information about celebrities or politicians might be in the public interest, and whether people who encourage media attention forfeit their right to privacy. The resource is supported by the Taking Liberties website. It includes videos about press freedom and interviews with a media lawyer. Pupils can also share their views on how free the press should be by taking part in an interactive poll. Other topics covered by the resource include online censorship, lowering the voting age to 16, euthanasia and the use of \"stop and search\" powers by police. \u2022 The Guardian Teacher Network has almost 100,000 pages of lesson plans and interactive materials. To see and share for yourself go to teachers.theguardian.com. There are also hundreds of jobs on the site. For a free trial of your first advert go to schoolsjobs.theguardian.com."
