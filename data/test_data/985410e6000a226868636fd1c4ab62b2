  "content": "Surprise was swiftly followed by anger on Twitter as Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt's move against Gordon Brown spread swiftly across the web. As soon as the news was broken by Andrew Sparrow on theguardian.com, Think Politics, Tweet4Labour, Guido Fawkes and others cited Sparrow on the microblogging site. Tony Cross wrote: \"Patricia Hewitt + Geoff Hoon are about to do something so fucking incomprehensibly stupid that they can only be ex-cabinet ministers.\" Will Straw, son of the justice secretary, posted: \"Hewitt &amp; Hoon are Labour's dumb and dumber.\" Matthew Champion wrote: \"Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt launching campaign to oust Gordon Brown... bit of a bombshell.\" Johnmcg wrote: \"Blimey, Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt are challenging Gordon Brown's leadership. That'll help the election campaign.\" And JasonPOrme said: \"Thanks for bringing a Tory govt just that little bit closer.\" Brian40mk said: \"MPs Geoff Hoon, Patricia Hewitt, Charles Clarke and Frank Field are all bitter has-beens and will lose Labour the election.\" Thomasbobs said: \"Labour have just lost the election \u2013 no way are they winning after this. Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt are fools.\" EfficiencyGain said: \"Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt mastermind the Tories election campaign \u2013 hope Gordon packed the Imodium today.\" Some were dismissive: \"Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon have as much impact as a vampire with no teeth,\" wrote Welshracer. Oliverdrew said: \"So we have lift-off on the Brown-out coup ... surprisingly from Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon! Didn't think they had the bottle.\" And some pointed to Brown's involvement in plots against Tony Blair when he was prime minister. richardm56 said: \"Its all over the rolling news \u2013 Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon have called for a secret ballot on Brown's fitness to lead. Et tu, Brute!\" Jimboboh turned on a Labour backbencher: \"Geraldine Smith calling Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt 'stupid'. Pots and kettles spring to mind! Just call an election! Get it done!\" A few were pleased. Padpad added: \"Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon calling for secret ballot on Gordon Brown's leadership! Took them long enough. Should've done this a year ago.\" Canny_lass said: \"I'd like to thank Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt for providing the BBC with a news story that doesn't involve snow;).\" And afroirish made an early leadership bid: \"Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt call for secret ballot over Gordon Brown's leadership ... Do you think I could throw my hat into the ring?\"",
