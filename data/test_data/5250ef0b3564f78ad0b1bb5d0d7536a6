  "content": "Naomi Campbell has once again defended appearing naked in Madonna's controversial book, Sex, in her ground-breaking privacy action against the Mirror. The model became impatient with Desmond Browne QC, for the Mirror, when he asked if her evidence yesterday that she was never ashamed of that shoot was accurate. Scowling under a heavy fringe that almost concealed her eyes, Campbell said she told Jonathan Ross in a TV interview that her grandmother in particular \"wasn't too thrilled seeing me with my clothes off frolicking around\". She added: \"But I don't regret what I do for my job in the past. Everything I do, I do with my full commitment. My grandmother, who's older, said she did not think it was pleasing to her but I didn't think it was vulgar.\" Campbell, dressed in a dark grey pinstripe suit over a white, partially open shirt that showed off a large silver crucifix at her throat, said she did not think she had told Ross she wished she had never done it. \"I have a lot of respect for Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that,\" she said. Mr Browne said the model could not have been surprised that her family was upset. But Ms Campbell, refusing to give ground in a tense exchange, said she was an adult who could do what she pleased. \"I am an adult and I've been modelling since I was 15. I choose to do what I please,\" she said. Campbell is suing the Mirror for breach of confidence and unlawful invasion of privacy after it published a photograph of her leaving a drug counselling meeting in the King's Road in London a year ago. The newspaper said she had been receiving regular counselling in a \"courageous bid to beat her addiction to drink and drugs\". In her evidence Campbell said: \"I felt shocked, angry, betrayed and violated by the article.\" She is trying to argue that the article and accompanying picture breached privacy laws under the Human Rights Act. Campbell's case is the first to test the act since it was incorporated into British law in October 2000.",
