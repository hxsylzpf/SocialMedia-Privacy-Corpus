  "content": "It's a strange sensation being surrounded by coconut palms and rainforest, more than 4,000 miles from home yet knowing you are, technically speaking, still in Europe. Unlike independent Guyana and Suriname, French Guiana is still an overseas department where the roads are filled with Peugeots and Renaults, the supermarkets sell Boursin and cassoulet, and breakfast consists of croissants and baguettes. As far as tourism goes, it's an untapped market. There's a scattering of French visitors, mainly over here to see family, but that's about it. The country's pristine interior may speak for itself (although it needs to raise its voice a bit - how many people know that 90% of French Guiana is covered by some of the world's most pristine rainforest?); but, beyond that, the holiday market is hampered by a sea turned brown from Amazon outpourings and, with the euro as its currency, a status as the most expensive country on the continent. In many South American countries it's possible to pick up a dorm room for under a fiver, but a bed for the night in French Guiana will set you back around \u00a340. Unless, of course, you use couchsurfing.com. There are few places where couchsurfing hasn't spread, and French Guiana is no exception, with 55 listed members willing to host a traveller or show them around. To my delight, the first one I email is happy for me to stay. Alina, 27, is based in Kourou, the country's third biggest town with 20,000 inhabitants. It is also home to the two biggest attractions outside the rainforest: the European Space Centre and the \u00cdles de Salut, which once held the 18th-century penal settlement and murderer-turned-bestselling-novelist Henry Charri\u00e8re, aka Papillon. Alina, a space-centre engineer, has been in Kourou for two and a half years, having studied in France, and spent her childhood in Romania and Germany. She makes me feel instantly at home in the house she shares with a dietitian and a teacher. On the evening I arrive, she takes me for a driving tour around town. It's evident that the space station has defined it, with its functional post-60s architecture, and little indication of its previous life as a small village of descendants of runaway slaves. Today, practically all that remains of the old \"Village Saramaca\" is a couple of food shacks, where Alina takes me to sample bami and nassi (fried chicken dishes, served with noodles and rice respectively) and ti'punch, potent rum mixed with lemon and sugar. Being a couchsurfing host in French Guiana isn't easy. Whereas you can usually leave guests to their own devices, here the lack of public transport induces a certain dependence. Alina, of course, has no obligation to help me get around town, but she takes it upon herself to do what she can. When she's unable to drive me, she organises lifts with various colleagues, and even arranges my onward trip to the capital, Cayenne, via her housemate's parents. It's a busy week at the space station, with an impending satellite launch, and I can't help thinking a house guest is the last thing Alina needs - especially when I manage to break the front door key in the lock so she has to come and rescue me in her lunch break. Yet nothing seems to faze her. She treats me like a friend. There must be something in the water here - apart from Amazon sediment - because my next host is equally hospitable. Michel (pictured), a 23-year-old cartographer, originally from Alsace, writes on his couchsurfing profile that he can offer a \"big house with cocoa trees all around\". It's an offer that's hard to refuse. A long-haired music enthusiast, Michel turns out to be just as laid back as his profile picture implies, and he invites me to \"treat the house as my own\". He shares it with three friends in R\u00e9mire, a residential community 8km outside Cayenne, which, again, has limited transport. As we tuck into a prawn dinner in his garden, he offers a solution: \"If you have your licence, you could use my car.\" The generosity I've encountered on this trip never ceases to amaze me. Just a few hours ago I turned up on his doorstep as a stranger and now he trusts me with his car for the day while he's at work. \"Or,\" he adds, \"there's always my bike.\" Having not driven for five years, I decide that going on two wheels is a better plan. So the next day, with a hand-drawn map, I cycle to the nearest beach. With its chilled, tourist-free vibe and backdrop of palm trees, it is one of the most beautiful beaches I've seen on my trip. That evening Michel returns, we share a few beers and plan a night out at a house party. He and Alina have made me welcome and given me an insight into French Guiana. But am I really \"going local\" by only mixing with \"metropolitans\", as those from mainland France are known? Next week, I'm heading to Cayenne, where I hope a couchsurfer called Daniel can help me discover the Creole side of life. Michel's tips \u00b7 A popular weekend getaway here is to take a pirogue (long wooden boat) with a motor and head up the rivers from the coast. The route is scattered with riverside cabins, known as carbets. There are no walls and no doors; they offer just a simple shelter. We go with friends to grill freshly caught fish and drink rum, then sleep in hammocks. To hire a boat and guide, try Loca Pirogue in Cayenne (+594 25 09 98). \u00b7 Awala-Yalimapo, near the border of Suriname, is famous for observing turtles, but you can also spot smaller ones at the beach near Remire or \"plage de l'auberge\". Go at high tide - if you're lucky, you'll catch experts monitoring their movement. Have skill, will travel \"I once heard about a Thai girl who was travelling around my country using Hospitality Club,\" says Javier, one of the site's Venezuelan members. \"When word got round that she could cook Thai food, everyone wanted to host her.\" Many hospitality site users like to give something back to their hosts, and cooking dinner is a popular choice. Javier did this on his 10-month trip around Europe. He couldn't cook when he left home, but taught himself while on the road via instructional online videos, such as foodwishes.blogspot.com and ifoods.tv. Offering a skill (a dance lesson, DIY expertise) can enhance the travel-networking experience and increase the chances of being put up. Mariah, a couchsurfer from Michigan, lists her mission as \"travelling the USA with a sewing machine\". Her profile says she \"can help with mending for ragged travellers\", and she in turn, is interested in \"learning about everything from sailing to farming to shoe making to music theory\". You can find groups dedicated to skill sharing on couchsurfing.com.",
