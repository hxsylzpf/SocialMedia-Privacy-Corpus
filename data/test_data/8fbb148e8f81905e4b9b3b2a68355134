  "content": "1 Mensch v Morgan, 20 July 2011 Mensch first rises to political prominence as a member of the parliamentary committee that scrutinised the role of Rupert Murdoch and Rebecca Brooks during the 2011 phone-hacking scandal. The hearings are televised, and Mensch initially stands out for her striking looks and her loquacious rhetoric \u2013 a technique honed in the showy debating chambers of Oxford University. But soon it becomes clear that Mensch wants not to nail Murdoch, but to spread the blame for phone-hacking across the rest of Fleet Street. In one notorious exchange, she wrongly accuses former tabloid editor Piers Morgan of admitting to hacking phones in his autobiography, leading to a showdown on CNN that evening with Morgan. \"Why don't you try reading the book?\" Morgan rails. 2 Mensch and the drugs accusations, 29 July 2011 Barely a week later, a journalist accuses Mensch of taking drugs at jazz club Ronnie Scott's with violinist Nigel Kennedy, while working in music PR during the 1990s. Without making any reference to drugs, Mensch quickly and humorously bats away the allegation. \"Although I do not remember the specific incident,\" she writes, \"this sounds highly probable \u2026 I am not a very good dancer and must apologise to any and all journalists who were forced to watch me dance that night at Ronnie Scott's.\" 3 The social media showdown, 12 August 2011 In the space of three weeks, Mensch has become one of the stars of social media. But then come the riots of August 2011: some rioters organise via Blackberry messenger, and false rumours spread through Twitter. As a result, Mensch controversially calls for the government to be given the right to shut down sites such as Twitter in moments of mayhem. \"What she's arguing is actually for a media blackout at times of national crisis, when people need to know what's happening,\" says the Guardian's Paul Lewis, during a televised argument with Mensch. \"It's amusing to see people get their knickers in a twist about this,\" replies Mensch. 4 Have I Got News For Louise, 25 October 2011 Appearing on Have I Got News For You, Mensch calls anti-capitalism protesters outside St Paul's hypocritical for drinking coffee from Starbuck's. \"You can't be against capitalism and then take everything it provides,\" she argues, to derision from Private Eye editor Ian Hislop. \"You don't have to want to return to a barter system in the stone age,\" says Hislop, \"to complain about the way the financial system affected large numbers of people.\" 5 Mensch v the troll, 12 June 2012 Mensch writes about her ordeal at the hands of Twitter troll, Frank Zimmermann. \"The nature of the internet,\" she writes in the Telegraph, \"is that you don't know who is behind the screen. Is it Zimmerman [or] is it some demented teenager with a gun?\" Zimmermann, a recluse, had called Mensch a \"slut of Twitter\", and told her he would kill one of her three children, and that she should decide which. He initially failed to turn up to be sentenced \u2013 but was later given a suspended six-month jail-term. 6 Don't Menshn it, 19 June 2012 In a curious partnership, Mensch teams up with Luke Bozier \u2013 a junior Labour official who recently defected to the Tories \u2013 to create Menshn, a widely derided alternative to Twitter. According to Mensch and Bozier, it's Twitter without the bile. According to Gizmodo, a tech website, it's Twitter without the expertise. \"Don't Menshn the Crippling Security Holes in This Tory MP's Twitter Rival,\" reads one Gizmodo review."
