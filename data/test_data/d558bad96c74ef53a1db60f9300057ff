  "content": "Advertising often sells the idea of a better life. Buy this product and become a better version of yourself: smarter, healthier, happier, more attractive, a better partner, friend or parent. Buy and be liked. Buy and be loved. But some brands look beyond the vision of a better life. They try to explain how to live it. These brands aspire to be the friend you'd phone about a problem; the trusted advisor who gives good counsel. They embrace the notion that product attributes and benefits may not be the answer to every customer question or concern. It's not brand storytelling. It's certainly not a hard sell. It's being useful. As the American marketing consultant and best-selling writer Jay Baer put it: \"If you sell something, you make a customer today; if you help someone, you make a customer for life.\" So meet Kim Gelling, who runs Making Friends All Around The World at organic baby and children's food brand Ella's Kitchen, based in Henley-on-Thames. The clue is in the name of Kim's department. The challenge is to build a community of advocates in the UK and beyond \u2013 consumers who will love the brand enough to recommend its products to their friends. \"The priority for us is to engage both parents and little ones with our brand through innovative activity which will differentiate Ella's in their eyes and promote Ella's to being one of their trusted love-mark brands,\" Kim explained. \"Our digital strategy is a fundamental part of our overall communications strategy, which is all about connecting with parents with the right information at the right time in the right way.\" Look to Facebook and you'll find the Ella's Kitchen community is 69,000-strong. Here the brand shares recipes, \"Tuesday tips\" about parenting and infant diet, cute pictures and hosts a monthly question and answer session with the in-house nutritionist Claire Baseley. \"Understanding parents' mindset is key for digital channels,\" Kim said. \"We have developed a particular tone of voice for this channel and we plan our messaging strategy in advance. To engage with parents, our Facebook page is a great balance of fun, generosity, advice and sense of community.\" What the brand publishes is only part of the equation. You'll also find an album of scores of baby photos. This isn't the result of the kind of competition that are two a penny on Facebook. It's the result of proud parents sharing images of their infants with their peers through a brand they are happy to be associated with. It's a similar pattern on Twitter, where the 7,200-plus followers are given advice and have a forum for questions about products and availability. It's also where you'll find founder Paul Lindley tweeting stories of advocacy and campaigns that go beyond nutrition to literacy and child poverty. It's personal and passionate. Indeed, advocacy about the brand's social and environmental commitments \u2013 even research reports about infant diet and development \u2013 feature prominently on the Ella's Kitchen website. Yes, the site has an online shop, but it is also selling a world-view. \"Understanding how mum wants information is key, and digital will continue to provide an essential role,\" said Kim. \"We believe this will move increasingly to content on demand. This allows for specific content to be delivered directly to mum and dad as and when they need it.\" Even the delivery box can be \"personalised to the little one who the food is for\". The most recent major addition to the site is a weaning app, a platform-neutral tool to guide parents through the different stages of introducing babies to new food flavours, consistencies and, yes, ultimately relevant products. \"We're delighted with the results,\" said Kim. \"A great balance of new and returning users; they are spending even longer interacting with the weaning guide as they do on our website.\" Precisely how long users are spending on the site and using the app was unclear. But it's not a digital-only strategy. Turn on children's TV channel CITV in the mornings in recent weeks and you will have seen a traditional TV ad, complete with dancing food pouches, the brand's signature packaging. \"Since 74% of parents go online while watching TV and spend over 14 hours per week online, our offline and online marketing strategies really are one of the same,\" Kim said. \"We see a spike in ellaskitchen.co.uk traffic during our TV ads which in turn drives sign up to our friends database. We can engage parents along our journey to becoming an advocate who can help us shout about the brand.\" So the TV ads complement the strategy of community building and trying to reaching parents wherever they are seeking information. Inevitably, this includes the ever-growing ranks of parenting blogs. How do you persuade a parenting blog to talk about your brand? Create and share useful content with them. \"As an emotional brand, social and organic channels work best for us,\" said Kim. \"Parents' word of mouth and getting product into new parents hands are key for Ella's Kitchen. We prioritise sampling and advocacy programmes with bloggers as they provide some of our strongest results. \"We do spend a limited sum on paid advertising to build awareness, or for very targeted campaigns. However, we concentrate more effort and resource into running a vibrant and engaging Facebook page and blogger engagement programmes.\" So what does the future digital marketing strategy hold? More personalised content delivered on the right channel at the right time seems to be the clear direction of thought. Likewise a continuing emphasis on engagement, social channels and advocacy \u2013 but all driven by a very clear business objective: organic growth.
