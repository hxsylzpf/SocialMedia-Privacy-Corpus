  "content": "\u2022 Big changes are afoot at MySpace, after it was confirmed last night that co-founder Chris DeWolfe was stepping down, with former Facebooker Owen Van Natta likely to be his replacement. Meanwhile Apple - in rude health with $1.2bn profits over the last three months - insisted that unwell boss Steve Jobs would definitely be back in the top job at the end of June. \u2022 Desperate criminals are offering up to \u20ac25,000 to get their hands on old Nokia 1100 phones, according to PC World. Why? Nokia's not sure - but it could be part of an attempted online banking fraud. \u2022 May I remind you that you can pick up a copy of Technology Guardian with today's newspaper at any reputable newsagent (and some less reputable ones). This week's agenda: What Oracle's purchase of Sun really means, the rise of robots for the garden and an interview with AVG boss JR Smith You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed."
