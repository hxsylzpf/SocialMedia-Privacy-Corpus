  "content": "Instagram is boosting its journalistic team, advertising for a senior features editor and a community editor, plus three more writers. The features ed, incidentally, must have at least eight years' editing experience. According to a Digiday report, their journalistic \"mission\" will be \"to identify and popularise budding Instagram stars\". They should find interesting Instagrammers and write short features about them for the site's 300m monthly users (yes, it's bigger than Twitter). Digiday snarkily points out that the current 12-strong editorial team \u2014 known as the community management team \u2014 is part of the marketing division at the photo-sharing and video-sharing network. AdWeek blogger Chris O'Shea is similarly unimpressed: \"This is not journalism, this is advertising\". He continues: \"Anyone who applies for these jobs is being hired to promote Instagram. Nothing more, nothing less. If that sounds like fun to you, then have at it. On the bright side, like advertising, it probably pays more than journalism\". There is more sarcasm too when he asks whether you can find the hidden meaning in a photo of a hedgehog or see the point of Jen Selter's latest gym selfie. \"You must be extremely qualified\", he suggests, \"to write 300 words about a 13-year-old who enjoys pictures of clouds\". Okay, Chris, have your fun. But I suspect journalists will jump at the chance to be part of this phenomenal enterprise. Even though the clich\u00e9 tells us that a picture is worth a thousand words, it's obvious that the stories behind pictures count too."
