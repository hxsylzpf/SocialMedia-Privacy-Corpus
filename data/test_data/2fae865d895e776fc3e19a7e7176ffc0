I do things We'd also recommend picking up the accounts of our global development blogs and partners all of whom use Twitter to share their content. Plus do check the byline profiles of anyone who writes for this site as they often have a Twitter name included in their profile. Hashtags are also worth investigating, we often use #globaldev, but others like #smartaid or #opendata often highlight interesting commentators and debates, as well as simpler searches like #India, #health, #mdgs, or those linked to events eg: #UNGA2011 #WorldWaterDay. Well worth having a search for key terms if you're researching a topic. And of course you can also follow us \u2013 @GdnDevelopment. Do say hello if you join up.",
