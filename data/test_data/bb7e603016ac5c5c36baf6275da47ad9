  "content": "Digital Twitter-who? The media industry must be wishing Twitter had a different name. News Rod, perhaps, or Hammer of Truth? As it is, when Sky News announced Ruth Barnett's new job last week, the slightly ridiculous press release read: \"As Twitter correspondent, Ruth will dedicate her time to scouring the Twittersphere for news stories on a daily basis.\" The comedian Chris Addison argues that \"if your opinion can be given in 160 characters or less it's not worth giving\", but that's not stopping Sky News. And why? Because for 24-hour newsgathering operations it means \"free foreign correspondents\". \"We've used it many times to help report breaking news stories from the UK and abroad - most recently at the Oscars,\" explains Jon Gripton, the online news editor at Sky. Indeed, from the terror attacks in Lahore to the Hudson River plane rescue and the Turkish Airlines crash at Schipol Airport, Twitter broke the stories - because punters sent their snaps or thoughts to the site, where eager hacks were hunting for stories. CNN's coverage of the Schipol crash began when the reporter Errol Barnett spotted mobile photos posted on the site. Interestingly, the pics weren't on the front page of Twitter so that people monitoring the public search system would probably have needed permanent searches for phrases such as \"plane crash\", \"nuclear missile\" or \"global collapse of capitalism\" to secure the story. Does that mean in Errol Barnett CNN actually had the world's first Twitter correspondent (no relation, we assume, unless the Barnett clan are the Illuminati of the Twittersphere)? \"To be honest, using these new media tools like Twitter is now such an instinctive part of our newsgathering process that we don't think twice about it,\" a spokesperson said, in a rather withering tone. Indeed, it's almost as if Ruth Barnett is simply doing the work she's always done but has been given a fancy job title to get a bit of \"we're forward thinking\" PR for the channel. Fortunately, in the cynical online world of blogs and citizen journalists, such things are no longer possible. As long as you ignore the 922,000 breathless posts about Barnett you find if you Google the words \"Twitter correspondent\". Stephen Armstrong Broadcasting Blurring the lines Like every news channel, the 20-year old US financial station CNBC has a lust for ratings. But that surpassing drive, according to the White House and critics led by the comedian Jon Stewart, is not CNBC's only sin. Earlier this month the station, with its love of noise and sensation, was drawn into the debate over the separation of news from opinion and entertainment when White House press secretary Robert Gibbs chided Rick Santelli, a CNBC presenter and former derivatives trader, who described people who default on their mortgages as \"losers\". \"I feel assured that Mr Santelli doesn't understand what he's talking about,\" Gibbs said. Jim Cramer, a former hedge fund manager and the raging host of CNBC's Mad Money, then damned Obama's economic rescue package as \"the greatest wealth destruction I have seen by a president\". CNBC is not the only news station to blur the line between reporter and pundit, but it has been more aggressive in doing so than most. The station, and reporters such as Cramer and Santelli, are accused of being so busy cheerleading for Wall Street that they failed to detect that the global financial system was at the point of collapse. CNBC, sometimes known as \"the recession network\", has few doubts about its strategy. Ratings are up by nearly 50,000 over two years - a figure the station says is underestimated. Cramer defends his style, saying: \"People do not want to come to a show each night and hear how poor they are.\" Stewart, the self-styled voice of conscience on Comedy Central, invited Cramer on to his show, where he accused CNBC of selling \"snake oil\". As the risks financial institutions have taken with ordinary savers' money become clearer, popular sentiment appears to be with Stewart. \"People believe there are two markets,\" he told Cramer. \"One for people who put their money in pensions and another real, backroom market that's dangerous and ethically dubious. As a layman, it feels we are capitalising your adventure and it's a game that you, as a network, pretend isn't happening.\" Edward Helmore Internet TV A joke on women Got nice hair? Like biscuits? Demonise food but fetishise shoes? Cry all the time for apparently no reason? Congratulations! You're a woman! Welcome to A Woman's World! Excuse me, if you find extra letters in the middle of sentences, it's only because I'm sitting in front of this new internet series and smacking my head against the keyboard. And it seems like such a silly thing. Only in a Woman's World (http://awomansworld.com) is a set of cartoons promoting Frito-Lay snacks about four friends - two white, one black and one latino - and their everyday struggles and comedies. \"Meet the girls: Fab, funny, fearlessly female\" it says, as you enter the site - which, in itself, might lead a reasonable person to believe that this was a promotion conveying all the complex and beautiful human emotions involved in being a lady. And one day it might - if they ever talk about things other than shoes or calorie counters. One mini-cartoon is about the tragedy of having been abandoned by one's favourite stylist. The next, a paean to friendship revolving around hoping to catch your best mate's stomach flu in the belief it'll help you lose 4lb so you can fit into your \"thin\" jeans. The next is about ... well, it's about adivhu vsliu jkkkkz gh because that was when the keyboard headbutting started. Animation is a medium able to reflect life, while stretching the possibilities of ordinary, solid flesh people, and its cheapness makes it possible to stretch boundaries. So I just don't understand where something this archaically vacuous fits in. A Woman's World? Really? And caring about them is supposed to make you buy snack food? Meanwhile, a very different project with a concept that basically explains itself is Old Jews Telling Jokes (oldjewstellingjokes.com), for which the father of filmmaker Sam Hoffman gathered 20 of his friends to share their favourite stories. It suggests a vital element of making a web TV project work is setting yourself simple boundaries and doing as much as you can within them. In this case, take people with warm, wise faces, place them against a plain background, point a camera at them, and let them do the rest. And some of them are even women. Anna Pickard",
