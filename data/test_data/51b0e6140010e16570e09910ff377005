  "content": "Angus McBride (Comment, 17 May) highlights the current spectacle of the media bemoaning the fact that only \"the rich and famous\" have access to superinjunctions. The reason for this situation is that legal aid is not available in that area of law. It is telling that few newspapers have covered the current government proposals for legal aid reform. These will mean that only the rich and famous have access even to the most basic advice in many more areas of law. Benefits stopped? It's your problem. Legal aid is one of society's safety nets, but most people can't envisage how it would be of any use to them until they need it. Lucy Hogarth Sheffield"
