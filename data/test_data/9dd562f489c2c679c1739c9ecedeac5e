  "content": "Just a few years ago, government departments relied on whole buildings full of files rather than a collection of virtual folders on a computer. In those days, it would have taken a feat of awesome incompetence to lose thousands of people's information. After all, it is difficult to imagine a Whitehall mandarin managing to leave a room full of filing cabinets on the train. Today, however, the digital revolution is causing headaches for the government's database gurus. When a memory stick smaller than a cigarette lighter can easily store thousands of pieces of information, the scope for error is increasing by the day: last year, details of 25 million people were lost after being stored on just two CDs. With the government promising a thorough investigation, experts have warned that ministers should react to the real problem - a lack of basic security protocol - rather than the perceived threat of technology. \"Had the data on the memory stick been encrypted, its loss would have posed no risk,\" said Greg Day, a security analyst with internet company McAfee. Some fear a ban by some government departments on workers using gadgets such as mobile phones and iPods focuses on the wrong part of the problem. \"There is nothing illegal in storing information on a memory stick, provided the information is encrypted or not taken off the premises,\" said Peter Carey, editor of the Privacy &amp; Data Protection Journal."
