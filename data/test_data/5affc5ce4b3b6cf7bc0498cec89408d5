  "content": "It was a clever PR ruse designed to promote Vodafone as generous, Christmas-loving and hip: the mobile phone operator would give away free handsets to lucky Twitter users who used the tag #mademesmile to tell the company what made them beam. In less than 24 hours the term had proved so popular it was the most discussed Twitter topic in the world. The only snag? It was being used to draw attention to the company's alleged tax avoidance. Vodafone launched the 12 days of smiles competition yesterday, inviting people to \"use Twitter to share something that made you smile today\". After a relatively quiet start, today there was a sudden surge of interest. Thousands used the tag to express their displeasure at the company's alleged accounting procedures, egged on by the the anti-cuts group UK Uncut, which has triggered dozens of protests outside Vodafone stores over the last two months. \"Hey everyone @VodafoneUK are giving away prizes for the best tweets with hashtag #makesmesmile. Anyone have any good ones?\" @UKUncut posted with faux innocence to its nearly 10,000 followers. It retweeted any subsequent posts that were critical of the company, which denies any wrongdoing over its taxes. \"Haha #mademesmile Someone who was googling their local Vodafone shop and saw the anti-[alleged] tax dodging tweets is now going to Carphone Warehouse,\" said @shayguitarra. In addition to appearing on Twitter, all tweets containing the hashtag were posted, unmoderated, on to Vodafone's website, compounding the negative publicity and showing campaigners' sentiments to people who might otherwise have been unaware of the controversy. The company declined to comment on the protest but said in a statement: \"It is completely untrue to say that Vodafone has an unpaid \u00a36bn tax bill. HMRC itself has called that figure an 'urban myth'. Vodafone has not been 'let off' any tax, [it] pays its taxes everywhere that it operates. \"Earlier this year Vodafone and HM Revenue &amp; Customs agreed to settle matters surrounding their legal dispute over controlled foreign companies law for \u00a31.25bn, the largest corporate tax settlement in UK history, which we are paying. In the UK, where we are based and where we employ almost 10,000 people, our business contributes over \u00a3700m every year to the Exchequer in tax, VAT, PAYE, national insurance and the fees we pay for our mobile phone spectrum.\" ,Among the smiling Twitterers, perhaps @probablydrunk will now have the largest grin of all. \"The thought of an ill-conceived PR stunt getting in the mainstream media #mademesmile,\" she posted. Other internet wags drew attention to the terms and competitions Vodafone had imposed on the competition, number 11 of 18 providing particular mirth: \"Check to see if there's any tax implication by winning a prize as you'll be responsible for this.\"",
