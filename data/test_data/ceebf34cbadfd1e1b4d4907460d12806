  "content": "Joanna Yeates's former landlord, Christopher Jefferies, has called for an independent inquiry into allegations the police leaked information about him to journalists following his arrest on suspicion of her murder. In a statement issued through his lawyers on Wednesday, Jefferies said evidence given to the Leveson inquiry confirmed his concerns about the way Somerset and Avon police handled his arrest in December 2010 and in particular about leaks to the media. Jefferies was responding to evidence \u2013 disputed by Avon and Somerset police \u2013 that the Daily Mirror editor, Richard Wallace, gave the Leveson inquiry into media standards earlier in January. Jefferies called for an independent inquiry into \"this potentially criminal conduct\" by Avon and Somerset police officers and the Crown Prosecution Service. Jefferies, a retired teacher, was later released without charge and in July 2011 received apologies and substantial damages from eight newspapers for libellous allegations made against him. Also in July, the Daily Mirror was fined \u00a350,000 and the Sun \u00a318,000 for contempt of court over their coverage of Jefferies. His statement, released by law firm Stokoe Partnership, said: \"It has become apparent that evidence put before the Leveson inquiry confirms our earliest concerns about the confidentially with which the arrest and detention of our client was dealt with by those investigating the murder of Joanna Yeates. \"As a result of our attendance at the police station and of our reviewing of the material in the media, it became apparent that information had been deliberately leaked by as yet unidentified individuals in flagrant breach of their duty. \"Our client strongly believes this to be the case, as there was information within the public domain which was only known to those privy to the investigation material. \"Our client is of the view that this information had been leaked and we share that view. \"There needs to be an independent inquiry into this potentially criminal conduct on the part of officers from Avon and Somerset police, as well as the Crown Prosecution Service. \"As regards any legal action against Avon and Somerset police for wrongful arrest, this is a matter which remains under review.\" Colin Port, the chief constable of Avon and Somerset police, denied the claims made by Wallace and said the force was \"actively challenging\" his comments. Port said in a statement: \"I now have a copy of the letter sent by these solicitors direct to the media 12 months after the event, and which has not been directed to Avon and Somerset Constabulary. \"I am surprised by the contents of the letter which appear to be based on the opinions expressed by Richard Wallace, editor of the Mirror, when he gave evidence to the Leveson inquiry last week, and which we are actively challenging.\" Wallace apologised to Jefferies and told the Leveson inquiry that his judgment was affected by off-the-record briefings from the force in which they appeared confident that Jefferies \"was their man\". In his witness statement submitted to the inquiry, Wallace said: \"In the article of 31 December [2010], we reported that a source close to the police investigation said that it was believed Jo's murderer had tried to conceal her body. \"This information, to the best of my knowledge, came from one of the off-the-record briefings referred to above. \"The police also give more general guidance to the press. When Mr Jefferies was arrested on 30 December, the content desk informed me that off the record the police were saying that they were confident Mr Jefferies was their man.\" Jefferies told the Leveson inquiry when he appeared as a witness in late 2011 that the national press \"shamelessly vilified\" him. During the trial of Yeates's killer, Vincent Tabak, who was jailed for life in October, it was revealed Tabak had implicated Jefferies by phoning the police and making false claims. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
