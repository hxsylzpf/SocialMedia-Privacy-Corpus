  "content": "Piers Morgan, the editor of the Daily Mirror, displayed a \"touch of the Bill Clintons\" as he tried to defend his newspaper's decision to publish details of Naomi Campbell's Narcotics Anonymous sessions, the high court heard today. Andrew Caldecott QC, acting for Campbell, said the Mirror editor had been \"disingenuous\" and \"evasive\" in his evidence at the libel action taken by the model against the Mirror. He compared Morgan's quibbling over the meaning of the word \"cooperate\" to the former US president's famous prevarication over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. When asked earlier in the week whether he thought Campbell's agent, Carol White, had cooperated with the Mirror on the story, Morgan said it depended upon what was meant by \"cooperation\". The model is suing Mirror Group Newspapers for breach of confidence, invasion of privacy and breach of the Data Protection Act after the paper published an article, headlined: \"Naomi: I am a Drug Addict\", revealing she was attending NA for drug addiction. Mr Caldecott conceded there were some \"real inconsistencies\" in Campbell's testimony, after the judge, Mr Justive Morland, described her as an \"unreliable witness\". On the issue of the model's evidence of drug taking, Mr Caldecott said the court had to look at the issue in a pragmatic and humane way. \"The taking of drugs to the degree of having a dependency is, on the face of it, an escapist exercise. The phrase 'in denial' has evolved - no doubt from experience,\" he said. \"People who have addictions of this type clearly have difficulty in owning up to then, which is the first stage of facing up to them and doing something about them.\" But he said it would be wrong to brand Campbell a dishonest witness in a general sense. Mr Caldecott said follow-up articles by the Mirror attacking Campbell were \"rubbing salt in the wounds, kicking a lady when she is down\". He added: \"This is a classic example of hypocrisy. \"Mr Morgan substantially demands his own rights to correct untrue statements in the media made by Miss Campbell but when she seeks to correct untruths she is vilified. This is disgraceful conduct.\" Caldecott said Campbell had the right to seek treatment for her drug addiction away from the glare of publicity. \"In the real world, one would accept recovery is a fragile process and it is something she would want to keep private,\" he said. The case continues."
