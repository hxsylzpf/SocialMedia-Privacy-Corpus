  "content": "Michael Acton-Smith on what Moshi does next London-based Mind Candy was stalling five years ago, but took a punt on an idea for a social networking game site for children. By 2013, the children's game network had become ubiquitous at every supermarket checkout and at every toy store - a runaway brand extension success. Founder Michael Acton-Smith insists that revenues are holding up, but admits the company has struggled with the speed at which children are switching to tablets and mobiles, and has yet to release its tablet app. On the eve of Moshi's fifth birthday, Jemima Kiss asks Acton-Smith how he plans to keep the Moshi magic alive."
