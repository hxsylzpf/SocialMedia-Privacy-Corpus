  "content": "Since more and more people spend their time in front of computers, the digital trace we find when they leave us is getting bigger. What's to be done with these traces? Should we take them down? Or freeze them like they were left behind? Facebook decided differently. It allows friends and family to \"memorialise\" a profile page of those who have died with an obituary or news article. \"When someone leaves us, they don't leave our memories or our social network. To reflect that reality, we created the idea of 'memorialised' profiles as a place where people can save and share their memories of those who've passed,\" explained Max Kelly, Facebook head of security, on the company's blog. But what does it mean, that an account gets \"memorialised\"? The contact information and status updates are removed, and the profile is set private. No one can log into it any more. Only Facebook friends can locate the profile via search and leave posts on the wall for remembrance. With this Facebook reacts to problems of the new \"reconnect\" feature it rolled out at the weekend. Obviously the algorithm, which was programmed to find old friends, asked Facebook users to connect with loved ones who had passed away. Facebook user Richard Thames from San Antonio said: \"Facebook's algorithms are suggesting I reconnect with a deceased friend by writing on his wall... awkward.\" \"We understand how difficult it can be for people to be reminded of those who are no longer with them, which is why it's important when someone passes away that their friends or family contact Facebook to request that a profile be memorialised,\" responded Max Kelly in his blogpost to that problem. Facebook used to delete the accounts of users who had died. The option of leaving them up was introduced after the Virginia Tech shooting."
