  "content": "The old adage goes that you should never feed the troll. The more you engage, the more likely those devious beasts are to store away the courtesy, allow it to fester and then pelt it back full in your face, as Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones has discovered so horrendously. Jones, a breakout star of Paul Feig's critically-acclaimed yet hugely divisive remake, has posted what appears to be a final farewell to the social network in the wake of appalling racist abuse. After months of attacks, the final straw seems to have been when a Twitter user started an account in the comic's name and began posting homophobic comments. Of course the Saturday Night Live star is entirely blameless. Jones is guilty only of a profound inability to comprehend how her fellow human beings can summon the bile to make hideously hurtful, dehumanising attacks, purely on the basis of their target's involvement in a comedy film. Plenty of movies have previously attracted the ire of fans, and many more have been loved so ardently that those who demur come under fire. The LAPD are currently investigating a fan of Superman reboot Man of Steel who hearted the film so much he issued a death threat to a (female) critic who posted a mildly negative review. But no movie has inspired such a venomous, sustained campaign of spite as the Ghostbusters remake. Studios are used to a different kind of fan. Step into San Diego Comic Con, or the recent Star Wars Celebration in London, and the overwhelming picture is one of an excited, open-hearted, open-minded audience ready to lap up everything that comes its way. If anything these events can be a little too fawning, but the positivity is infectious. And yet geek culture has also been built on a kind of entitlement, particularly in its infancy, which saw non-professional bloggers taking studios to task for producing movies that failed to treat the movement's icons - the Supermans, Batmans and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles of canon - with due respect. The nerds won that battle: Hollywood now treats audiences for genre material much as football clubs treat their fans, with reverence and even deference. Film-makers go out of their way to build positive hype by promising to honour the roots of the cultural icons they are reimagining. No childhoods were ruined in the making of this movie. But the attacks on Ghostbusters suggest Hollywood may have unwittingly created a monster. For the mild trolling that often accompanies a controversial release has morphed into malignant new forms. And it seems that the old respect for the film-making process that once ran through geek culture, at least in the blogosphere, has been ripped away in a whirlwind of hostility. It is not just the really nasty trolls who have become embroiled in anti-Ghostbusters sentiment. Others, many of whom have not yet seen the movie, have allowed themselves to be caught up in the flow of negativity. Jones has received support from her fellow Twitter users in the form of a popular #loveforlesliej hashtag. But there remains a sense that large corners of the internet - larger than just the particularly fetid Men's Rights brigade that targeted last year's Mad Max: Fury Road - is taking pleasure in her pain. Can Hollywood disengage with the trolls without removing the umbilical cord between audience and film-maker that has helped studios increasingly make movies their audiences actually want to see? Of course it can, but this will involve further sanitisation of the spaces where fans meet their heroes. There will be more events like Star Wars Celebration - great fun for those who are there, dressed up as Princess Leia and Han Solo, perhaps less fascinating for those who are not - and fewer loveable social media loose cannons such as Leslie Jones. Film-makers such as Feig, an active Tweeter who has used the social network to build hype for his remake, may consider it is better to keep schtum in future until their movie hits cinemas. Every comment the Bridesmaids director has made in interviews about Ghostbusters or its naysayers over the past couple of years has been picked up by the media and endlessly recycled. Yet none of it really helped change the negative buzz surrounding the remake. Those who had already decided they hated the movie were simply handed more ammunition to build their ridiculous narrative of a betrayal of the original 1984 film's cast, director and fanbase. In the end, Sony would have been far better off trusting its product - Feig has a spectacular record of making sharp, spunky comedies - and getting a few key critics to see the movie early. A better box office return would surely have followed, even though Ghostbusters is off to a decent start, all things considered. Everything else just ended up being more food for the trolls."
