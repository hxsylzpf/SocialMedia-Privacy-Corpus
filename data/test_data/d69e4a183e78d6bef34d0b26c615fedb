  "content": "Your leader column on open data paints a picture of government \"approaching the whole open data project with the subtlety of a smash-and-grab raider\" in its \"attempt to monetise data\" (Open data: slow down, 18 April). But what this, and the rest of the article, refers to, is not open data but shared data. This confusion is understandable when the government tries to justify its data sharing as satisfying its wider open-data policy. But we need to be careful with our terminology to avoid throwing the baby out with the bath water. Open data means providing unrestricted data to everyone. It is seldom worthwhile selling open data when anyone who would buy it can give it away to anyone else. Open data is not a \"valuable revenue stream\" for government. It is a public good. There are cases when data about living people (personal data) is made available as open data: for example, if the law says it must be published (such as insolvency notices in the London Gazette) or if the individuals have given their permission. But personal data cannot be open without explicit consent or a legal requirement to publish. On the other hand, data sharing is providing restricted data to restricted organisations or individuals. Sometimes shared data is restricted because it provides a revenue stream \u2013 it is only available to people who will pay for it \u2013 or, more frequently, because it is sensitive in some way, either because it is personal or because of security issues. Your leading article states that Whitehall \"has already jeopardised its own care.data project\", and that \"HMRC is using sleight of hand to release information about VAT to credit reference agencies\". But these are concerns about data sharing, not open data. There are lots of companies, charities and individuals who would benefit if all the data the public sector holds was shared with them, particularly if it was shared only with them. Those benefits have to be balanced against the rights of individuals to have their data protected by government, and the risks to individuals and to society of too much data being available (for example, through making fraud easier). At the Open Data Institute we believe the government should move away from restricted data sharing and towards open data. This ensures a level playing field for everyone who can benefit. It also means that organisations can get a lot of the information they need without being given personal data to process themselves. Open data can also be used to minimise the number of restricted data releases that are made by supplying the anonymised statistical data people really need. Opening up data about what data is shared, with whom, for what purpose and for what cost makes the process transparent. And requiring the open publication of the results of data analyses ensures the benefits are available to everyone. There is lots of data within the public sector that should be open. There is also lots of data that the public sector holds that should only be shared very carefully, or not at all. We must take care not to confuse the two."
