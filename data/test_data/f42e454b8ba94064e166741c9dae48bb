  "content": "Far from being complex attacks, most technology breaches come from simple failures, according to the head of security strategy at NTT Com Security, a global cybersecurity firm. Garry Sidaway, the company's global director of security strategy, argued that too many businesses file \"security\" away in a separate department, and so fail to spot basic errors which could lead to breaches down the line. Even when such companies do decide to look specifically for security flaws, they tend to be purely reactive, patching holes where similar breaches occur. \"If you look at any of the breach reports, most of them still come through the simple things. Doing the simple things well, and proving that you've done them, is still the biggest challenge for organisations,\" Sidaway said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. \"If you change the way that you embed information security and risk management into your business, then you know that those things are in place. So you know that your password is protected properly, you know that your data is protected and stored properly, you know the steps that you're going to take, from the board all the way through to operations, to protect that business stream.\" Sidaway's comments come after a security breach at Adobe which left 150m email addresses and passwords exposed. The number of affected accounts was initially disclosed as just 3m, but has since risen significantly. Cracking the code Adobe stored passwords in a manner which renders them difficult to read initially, but relatively easy to crack given a bit of time. Known as \"hashing\", this turns each password into a string of characters with an algorithm which can't be reversed. But methods to break hashed passwords have got better in recent years, meaning that good security requires a practice known as \"salting\". This step appears to have been missed by Adobe. Users can check if their log-in was one affected with a tool built by developer @hilare_belloc. \"Doing the simple things is easy to say,\" said Sidaway, \"but invariably, a lot of organisations miss it. Or they've done it at the start, and then don't go back and check it over time. So as the business changes, they still assume that it's embedded, and it's not.\" A new report prepared by NTT finds that fears around cybersecurity are frequently seen as showstoppers in the workplace.Concerns have stopped ideas progressing in nearly half of the hundred IT professionals the company surveyed. Comfortingly, the financial sector shows higher than average concern, with 56% of professionals reporting ideas had been halted due to concerns. But the report backs up Sidaway's conclusions that businesses don't plan ahead. Only one in five organisations base their spending on assessed risk, and the figure is even lower for businesses in financial services. \"While the majority see a benefit to having a proactive approach when assessing the risk of information assets, the fact that still only a fifth base their spending on assessed risk shows there is plenty of room for improvement and that there is still a lot of work to be done,\" said NTT's Neal Lillywhite. \u2022 How a new open email standard aims to keep the Government out of your emails."
