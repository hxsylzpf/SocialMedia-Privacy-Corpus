  "content": "All-male panels are a familiar sight for anyone who has ever attended a work conference \u2013 or spent time at SXSW. For the uninitiated, an all-male panel is exactly what it sounds like: a group of (mostly white) men plunked on stage at a conference, usually under the auspices of being the \"experts\" in their fields, whether that field is agrarian developments in the Sudan, developments in the music industry, advances in chemical engineering, global banking regulation, or even women's reproductive rights. After years of noticing this phenomenon, Dr Saara S\u00e4rm\u00e4, a researcher in International Relations at the University of Tampere in Finland, began collecting images of them on Facebook. Soon, people added their own to the collection, leading to the creation of All Male Panels Tumblr. She added a photo of Baywatch star David Hasselhoff giving a thumbs up to each post to further make light of the situation. It's clear S\u00e4rm\u00e4 has struck a nerve, as several of the images have gone viral. The Guardian talked to S\u00e4rm\u00e4 about the photos, the changes she's hoping to see, and why David Hasselhoff is the perfect mascot for the project. Where did this idea come from? I've been seeing this thing for a long time. I'm an international relations scholar and I've seen in security studies and foreign policy \u2013 these hardcore fields \u2013 there's a lot of all-male panels. I've been talking about it for a long time with my feminist colleagues all over the world. In February 2015 I decided to start doing something about it and started collecting these pictures. First it was just in Finland. There were a few events that really brought it on. There was a course called \"Politics and Facts\" and it was advertised as having the best experts in the country as lecturers \u2013 - and it was 11 men. I work with women who would have been perfect for this class. So I started collecting these and they started piling up. What has the response been like? First it was slow. Some of my immediate academic circles were sharing it and some feminist and academic organizations shared it on Facebook and Twitter. Then Buzzfeed picked it up and it went on from there. It has been great. I've gotten a lot of amazing feminist connections all over the place and getting amazing feedback. I have about 400 submissions now. Where have the submissions come from? Mainly from the west, the States, the UK, Australia, the Netherlands, Mexico quite a bit. Someone asked if they could start one in Spanish and I said yes, go ahead, do the same thing. I don't mind. Your Tumblr seem to tap into a zeitgeist that's happening right now, where people are paying more attention to things like all-male panels. Yes, I think that's true. There's also Owen Barder's The Pledge, where men take a pledge not to be on all-male panels. Then there was a Stop Man Panels site, which is by Article 36, which is the anti-nuclear movement. I think that movement has been doing this for a year or two. But I think the humor added on it is what made it go viral. Speaking of your site's humor, what made you think to incorporate David Hasselhoff into it? I think it's really funny! It was a joke to begin with, but he's this '80s Knight Rider type. He's the embodiment of white masculinity, so I think it worked really well to have him congratulating these people on their job well done \u2013 you put together an all-male panel. He did a talkshow in Finland this year. It's airing now. I actually went to a taping, which was quite funny. It was in January, which coincides with this whole man-panel project. What do you hope will come from your efforts? I'm a realist in the way that I don't think we can achieve equality very quickly. I'm hoping that people will no longer organize all-male panels and won't go on all-male panels. At least a small change. If there are fewer all-male panels from now on, that would be a good outcome. As an academic, why do you think diversity on a panel is so important? It brings different viewpoints. We have to think about diversity more and how to make it happen and how to get different viewpoints across. Also, I think it's important to learn how to listen to different viewpoints. It's not about counting, though. It's not just the number of women and men on a panel \u2013 and nobody wants to be the token woman on a panel or in these really masculine fields, which can be quite hostile. Instead I want to challenge the culture in academia to think about how we do panels and how we treat each other. While your Tumblr focuses on gender, it could just as easily apply to racial diversity, too. I actually started an all-white panel Tumblr, as well, but it only has about four things right now. I've been asking people to go through the All-Male Panel Tumblr and download the ones that are all-white as well and submit it to the other one, so I can upload them there. I just don't have time to do it all right now. Someone sent me a link to a seminar on indigenous studies and it was all non-indigenous people. It's the same with the women's world summit, or whatever it was called, that had an all-male panel. Just classic. Or the US Senate hearing on reproductive rights, which was an all-male panel. I guess the one woman wasn't qualified or something? [Laughs.] The panels that have to do with gender that are all male are always surprising, although they shouldn't be. It's where the power is, and wherever the power is located is where you find these all-male panels. In Finland, we are in the middle of government negotiations and they are really manly. Since 1991 we've had a nearly equal number of women and men ministers in the government. Now there is a real fear that the principle is getting thrown out the window. They are saying that they are going to have the most qualified person, but who is most qualified is not an objective thing. It's a value judgment. We tend to see men as more qualified, or as more of an expert. Generally, Finland is considered progressive on gender issues, so the fact that you're seeing these all-male panels is a little disheartening. In Finland we tend to think \"Oh we're so equal\" and people say: \"Oh feminists, what are you complaining about here?\" Gender equality is a process. It goes backward and it goes forward and it's really dangerous to think that we've already achieved it. There's a lot of that kind of thinking in Finland that we've achieved gender equality and now feminists are taking it too far. As if you could take equality too far, when by definition you can't be too equal."
