  "content": "You're a funny guy, Ricky Gervais (@rickygervais). There are seven Baftas, three Golden Globes and two Emmys that prove this fact. This is why, when you recently embraced Twitter again after a two-year hiatus (\"I fucking love Twitter now. I'm still not sure of the point, or how it will end, but its fun trying to work it out\") there was understandable excitement. A comedy heavyweight, poised over his keyboard, ready to share the lolz with the entire Twittersphere. Unfortunately, it has not quite worked out like that with your feed developing into something of a comedy Siberia. Maybe it's time to try being a funny guy again. Here are some pointers. Stop the gurning Your Twitter signature piece seems to be posting pictures of yourself gurning to the camera like a wrong Les Dawson. Picture after picture, tweet after tweet \u2013 always with the faces. Whether it's the \"fat, coked-up, Tory MP dying on a rent boy\" face or the \"38-year-old Glaswegian Tramp\" face, they have all had exactly the same thing in common \u2013 none of them are even slightly funny. Perhaps you are loth to give away the good laughs for free. But seriously Ricky, no tweets at all would be better than this. \"Mong\" It takes a lot to make us wince but your love of the word \"mong\" (\"Good Monging everyone\"; \"Mongalist Massive!\" etc) is making our teeth itch. By way of explanation you tweeted: \"Just to clarify for uptight people stuck in the past. The word Mong means Down's syndrome about as much as the word Gay means happy. ie I never use the word Mong to mean anything to do with Downs Syndrome.\" This argument was somewhat undermined by the accompanying picture of you belming into the camera. FYI, you're not changing the way society thinks with this stuff, you're just looking like a tosser. More Johnny Depp pictures It's only fair to tell you what you are doing right. My advice is to post more pictures of Depp (\"This isn't in shops either. My life-size Johnny Depp penis holder. Only \u00a312,000,000.99\"). Straight women and gay men will thank you for it. Lots of love @scouserachel"
