  "content": "When I was young, it was considered wrong to criticise any member of the royal family because they \"couldn't answer back\". I never understood why they couldn't answer back, but anyway, they never did. And this seemed rather clever because it made those who raised their voices against them look petty and spiteful. That has all changed. As the volume and outspokenness of the criticism grew, so did the royal family's resentment of it; and in the end their self-restraint gave way, and they started descending into the arena to take on their critics. This is a risky activity and can produce the opposite of the desired results, as Prince Charles found in his legal action against the Mail On Sunday, which was intended to stop circulation of his private Hong Kong diary insulting the Chinese leadership but resulted in its being read by far more people than would otherwise have been the case. The prince would have done far better to remain aloof, but I can see what drove him to such foolhardy action, for he faces a new circumstance that must make his role as heir apparent almost unbearable: he is surrounded by traitors. Until recently, courtiers were renowned for their loyalty and discretion. Members of the royal family were, as they still are, required to watch their words in public, but at least they had people around them in whom they could confide without risk of betrayal. Now Prince Charles must constantly be asking himself who among his servants he can trust; whether the footman bringing him his cocktail is keeping a diary to be sold one day to the Sun, or whether the secretary taking down an indignant letter to a cabinet minister is going to save a copy for the Daily Mail. Someone on the prince's staff leaked his diary to the Mail On Sunday, which must have been unsettling enough. But what can he have thought about Mark Bolland's witness statement siding with the very newspaper the prince was suing? Et tu Marce? Bolland is a man the prince must once have thought he could trust above all others, a man who served him with loyalty as his spin doctor and who brilliantly managed against the odds to reconcile the media to his marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles. Now he's turned out to be no better than Paul Burrell. Until quite recently, such behaviour by a royal servant would have been unthinkable. In 1949, Marion Crawford (\"Crawfie\") outraged the royal family by writing a book about her time as governess to the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. The king and queen ostracised her, but all Crawfie had done was to write a doting memoir about the children in her charge. Unlike some of today's palace staff, whose actions undermine the already fragile institution of the monarchy, she sought only to raise its standing in popular esteem. Why can't the royal family find trustworthy servants? Is the monarchy so discredited that no one feels a sense of duty towards it? If I were the prince, it is that fear that would worry me most."
