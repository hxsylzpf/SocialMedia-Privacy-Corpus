  "content": "Every week sees at least one event on how the internet and social networking will affect the upcoming general election. The most recent installment last night at City University saw the panel and audience concluding the the real game changer in this election wasn't Twitter or Obama-style internet campaigning but the just agreed upon debates. Moderator Evan Davis of the BBC introduced the BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson as \"new media and old media personified\", but last night, Robinson extolled the primacy of old media and cast new media as partisan, personal and poisonous. Robinson said that much of the conversation about new media was \"self-important, narcissistic tosh\" but what was really likely to affect the election was \"good old self-important narcissistic television\" and the debates. He cast himself as a social media early adopter-turned-sceptic. \"I used to come to these sort of dos 10 years ago and tell everyone about blogging,\" he said. Now, he says that he rarely reads the comments on his blog. \"It's a waste of my time. People either abuse me or a abuse a politician.\" He cast new media as \"passionate and partisan\" and said that it risked creating a focus on the personal rather than on policy. However, DJ Collins, Google and YouTube's director of communications and public affairs, said: \"Nick is describing the average Sunday tabloid.\" Yes, some of the comments on blogs and YouTube can be offensive, he said, but added that we shouldn't pretend that personal political attacks are an invention of the internet. Robinson continued his point, saying that he worried that new media would reinforce a focus on \"politics as horse race\", but Davis said: \"That is totally old media.\" Scepticism about the debates Robinson and others on the panel seemed more excited about the debates than many in the audience who expressed profound scepticism about how much they would learn in the carefully stage managed events. A member of the audience asked, \"If the debates are so strictly controlled, what's the point? Isn't it just a marketing campaign?\" Robinson called the cynicism in the room about the debate rules \"over the top\". For those who saw it as a gimmick, Professor Ivor Gaber of City University, said, \"Four and a half hours is a bloody long gimmick if you want to compare the parties. We've waited five and a half decades for debates on television. What more do you want?\" However, Matthew McGregor, with the UK office of Blue State Digital, said that the debates would be a mix of old media and new media. The conversation on Twitter between voters will help frame the debates. And Gaber did say that Twitter was a wild card, a \"joker in the pack\" in terms of the debates. He said: Twitter is not like the blogopshere. Twitter is anarchy. In the blogosphere, you know who you are dealing with, but Twitter can explode. And you don't know where it comes from or goes to. Local campaigns For all of Robinson's scepticism, a comment late in the discussion from the audience reminded him of what's exciting about new media \u2013 that it lowers the barrier to entry for people to organise around an issue. Alex Perkins, a Liberal Democrat on the Canterbury council, told of how his community started a campaign online which rallied hundreds of people to stand in the streets and protest the closures. It helped save the museums. \"It's a way to create communities of interest,\" Robinson said. \"That's what politics is about and you don't need me or a political party.\" One of the points made by Rishi Saha, who was a Conservative candidate in the last election and is now working with the party on new media, is that many of the things that were \"most crucial about organising are the least interesting for media\". As opposed to social media, campaign organising techniques such as email outreach and search engine optimisation weren't \"story-driven\" so weren't covered by the media, he said. The media is obsessed with social media, and that is a profound mistake, he said. Blue State Digital built much of Barack Obama's internet campaign infrastructure such as web hosting and internet fundraising, but McGregor said that a rather pedestrian technology, email, was far more effective than social networking. The Obama campaign had an email address for 1 out of every 5 people who voted for the candidate. \"It helped turn enthusiasts into advocates.\" \"Tweets don't win elections. People win elections, and new media can organise them,\" McGregor said. A few other points: \u2022 McGregor said that parties would try to use new media to bypass traditional media and speak directly to voters, but those efforts will \"largely fail because they don't have anything interesting to say\". \u2022 Collins declared the death of the campaign slogan. In a show of hands, most of the audience had seen parodies of Conservative campaign posters. In fact, more people had seen the parodies than the original campaign posters. \u2022 Despite his sceptical view on new media, Robinson said that the prime minister's wife, Sarah Brown, had emerged as a national political phenomenon on Twitter and was trying to woo middle class voters back to Labour after the Iraq war. \u2022 Near the end of the discussion, Collins said: \"There seems to be a massive fear of ordinary people getting involved in elections.\""
