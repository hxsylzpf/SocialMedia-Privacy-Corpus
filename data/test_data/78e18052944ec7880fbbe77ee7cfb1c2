  "content": "The founder of ReallyWorried.com thinks he's come across a way to make money from Twitter. Richard Rubin's site invites users to sign up, post their worries and get advice from other people, but also pulls common concerns out of Twitter under a section called 'ReallyTworried'. At the moment these channels are determined by what the site editor chooses to search for, rather than automatically pulling out the most popular trending subjects, but include money worries, feeling ill, losing weight and hair and fashion. What these have created, Rubin says, are bespoke audiences for advertisers who can reach people that have expressed an opinion or asked for advice in real-time. \"For two years we've been pulling our hair out... this is what will make the difference to a site that has been non-commercial for two years. In the first 24 hours we were contacted by six large, multi-national brands,\" said Rubin, who thinks the opportunity is a marketer's dream. ReallyWorried's channels need plenty of polishing; inevitably tweets picked out by keyword aren't always relevant, though Rubin insists that refining the selection by filtering words that contextualise the post - and cut out jokes, for example - maintains the quality. That had better be true if any of those multi-national brands do sign up - they'd expect it to be squeaky clean with no room for #budget mischief. This is not the first proposal to make money out of Twitter by aggregating messages around certain subjects, and pulling in relevant advertisers. The recently founded Twitter Partners is exploring more strategic models around audience profiling, ecommerce and branding through Twitter. There's also ExecTweets, which places ads around posts from influential executives (thereby assuring a certain quality standard, generally) and a handful of nascent recruitment sites including Twitter JobSearch and TwitJobs, which pull out any job-related messages."
