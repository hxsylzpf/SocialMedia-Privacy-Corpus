  "content": "Some things you never forget. The time, long ago, just as son number two was being born upstairs, when son number one, aged two and a half, slipped out of the front door and went for a walk along the main road. The time number two son, aged 12 months, crawled under the wheels of a donkey cart and was yanked to safety in a trice. The time, only last year, when grandson number five locked himself in the loo at the Imperial War Museum and required an operation only slightly less complex than the Falklands to get him out. But now we're right up to date on the awful moment front. Welcome to Blackpool Pleasure Beach. There are three grandsons, aged 12, eight and five. The Pleasure Beach is a bit of a summer ritual for them. My wife's dad spent his working life there. Thrills and spills were a family rite of passage. And now a third generation is on the case, flushed from the Derby Racer, recovering from the ghost train \u2013 and looking for dodgems. They run past the Gold Mine, down towards the River Caves \u2013 with granny and grandpa puffing behind. I see 12 and eight scooting left into a palace of slot machines. I assume Cosmo (five) is with them. \"Can I have some money, grandpa?\" asks Charlie, eight. \"Where's Cosmo?\" I say, looking round the slots. But he isn't there. He must have run straight on, then: one small boy in a livid orange soccer shirt with Messi on the back. He isn't at the bottom of the slope, though. I take a big loop left, my wife takes a big sweep right. Still nothing. \"Can I have some more money, grandpa?\" says Charlie. By now security has moved into action, fanning out, muttering into walkie-talkies. The awfulness of the moment engulfs us. Has it been two minutes, 10 or 20? Time and terror truncated. And then \u2013 blessed relief \u2013 a smiling security man finds Messi sitting on another granny's knee at the top of the hill. He doesn't seem bothered. He grins. A bag of donuts changes the subject. The moment is gone, but not forgotten: played over in a shuddering mind. \"Did they have a good time?\" asks my daughter, the mother of eight and five, when she calls. She wants a ride by ride description, among other things, to pass on to her partner, who's away in Cologne playing basketball. And so the event of the day gets insouciantly inserted between Magic Mountain and Zipper Dipper. \"Oh, Cosmo went missing for a minute or two, but we soon found him and he's absolutely fine.\" On one hand, that's sort of absolutely true. Tony Blair could repeat it to Chilcot and never feel a blush. On the other hand, it's a tonne of emotion short of a load. He's back, he's OK. Why make a drama out of a vanished crisis? But you know Charlie will mention it to his mother, so something has to be said, calmly, soothingly. \"Just a minute or two, then,\" says my daughter. \"Um, yes, more or less.\" A benign blanket of silence covers all. But now, days later, we're far away, talking to my other daughter, Kate, letting all the worries hang out. Golly, what a chastening interlude! Pause. \"Oh!\" says the basketball partner, chatting on the phone. \"The neighbour's been round to say you lost Cosmo in Blackpool.\" How did she know? \"It's on Kate's Facebook page. You're famous.\" All over the family world. Famous for sweating incompetence. Famous for not being obeyed. Famous for lack of sprinting speed. Famous for incipient tragedy turned to farce. But at least we remember what it's like when you can't find a child, the scariest feeling of the lot. And at least we know who not to tell if we want to keep things dark next time, steering far clear of festering Facebook."
