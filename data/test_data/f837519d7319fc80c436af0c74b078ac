  "content": "The point can be personal, and sharp \u2013 when, for instance, Janine Gibson, a dynamic but disappointed contender to be editor of the Guardian, leaves the paper to become editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed UK. Or that selfsame point can be sweeping and general: the latest Reuters Institute Digital News Report says routine watching of British TV bulletins is in steep decline, down among people under 45, from 56% to 46% in just the last two years, while only 43% of Brits pick up a printed newspaper from one week to the next. The future of news seems set to arrive via smartphones and tablets. The future is Facebook and Twitter. The future (according to this global survey) is the Huffington Post, Vice, Vox et al \u2013 plus BuzzFeed. And you can, of course, wheel out acres of imposing statistics to make this future seem a mighty, inevitable cash machine. Here's HuffPost, vaulting way over 100 million unique visitors and claiming victory in the US. Here's BuzzFeed, doubling its American and British reach (and launching a special news app). Here's Vice, which sold a 5% stake to Rupert Murdoch a couple of years back for $1.4bn. (Compare and contrast the recent failure to sell US group Digital First Media \u2013 75 daily papers plus 100 other sheets \u2013 for under a third of that to some sharp venture capitalists.) There's no doubt where the money mountain lies. But pause and ask a different question: are clicks, views and visitors the only way to measure digital success? What about quality, as in quality journalism? In the print world, we don't say USA Today is better than the New York Times because it sells and gives away more copies. We don't reckon the Sun the UK's finest daily. Size matters, but so does the range and depth of news on offer. So why rate digital's shooting stars purely in terms of stock-market proficiency? There's more to \"content\" than this. Michael Massing, distinguished former executive editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, has lately been playing a different kind of critic across the news web. In a three-part assessment for the New York Review of Books he, among other things, finds the Huffington Post running rather wearily on the spot. \"It came under relentless pressure to turn of profit. The only way to do that was by increasing ad revenues, which in turn meant drawing in more readers \u2026 That explains the perpetual motion, non-stop expansion and proliferation of sections. In its early years, the Huffington Post seemed on its way to defining a new type of digital journalism. Ten years on, it seems stuck in place, struggling to recapture the innovative spirit that once defined it.\" Massing isn't much impressed by the familiar following pack \u2013 Slate, Salon, the Daily Beast \u2013 which \"all seem to blend into one another, rarely break news or cause a commotion\". And he doesn't worship at the altar of BuzzFeed, going way beyond familiar carping over its sponsored advertorial and \"rivers of froth\" about \"21 Celebrities That Prove Left-Handed People Are By Far The Sexiest\". Yes, they've hired good journalists from the New York Times, ProPublica and the Guardian. Yes, they run vivid war dispatches from Kenya and Ukraine. Yes, he might add, they've got Gibson on board now. But \"I was surprised how conventional \u2013 and tame \u2013 most of its reports are. Much of BuzzFeed's news feed seems indistinguishable from that of a wire service.\" It needs to be to be bolder \u2013 \"otherwise it will be remain known mainly for its cat photos\". Two of Massing's points hit home hard. One concerns web news's own little bubble. \"BuzzFeed, the Huffington Post, The Daily Beast, Gawker, Quartz, Business Insider, The Intercept, Talking Points Memo and ProPublica are all located a short walk from each other in lower Manhattan, forming a sort of journalistic counterpart to Silicon Valley and replicating the parochialism of the New York media elite\". So much for the diverse democratisation of an open net. The other is all about impact \u2013 and audience fragmentation. \"With so many sites and outlets competing for attention, it becomes harder for stories to find a foothold.\" Indeed, \"when it comes to impact, traditional news organisations retain an overwhelming edge\". Massing unrolls a long list of memorable scoops \u2013 none from the web. The basic lesson of ancient Fleet Street remains in place. Stories that make a political earthquake still need to embrace all media. They need to be validated and pursued on TV, on radio, on printed pages as well as on smartphones. \"Viral\" is one instant thing, a phenomenon, the dream of sites and advertisers alike. But it is not impact; neither, very often, is it news. So the problem \u2013 for digital news teams as well as for us \u2013 is potentially serious in a way Reuters's surveys can't yet reach. We have a new world arriving, news media carrying the message. The Huffington Post contacted me excitedly last week to announce it had discovered arevolutionary breed of ad-friendly readers it calls \"Thrivers\" \u2013 desirables with \"five distinct traits: Digital Discoverers, News Interrogators, Solution Seekers, Self-Starters and Mindful Empathisers\". People who'll presumably hope to thrive by reading very long-form articles on their Apple Watch. You cannot be serious \u2026 Nor, perhaps, can you make a fresh future by skilful hires. BuzzFeed is coy about the figures, but some educated guesses put consumption of its news (as opposed to entertainment areas) at under 20% of the total. Vice is what it has been for 20 years: a magazine, not a newspaper, a product that picks and chooses \u2013 not covers the waterfront. Welcome, in short, to Transitionland. The speed of change is formidable, but don't automatically expect to be better informed. There are some splendid new entrants: Theconversation.com is one; Politico.eu another. But the real nitty-gritty of consistent coverage, a picture delivered whole? Reuters can tell us where we're going \u2013 but not how we'll survive the din when we arrive."
