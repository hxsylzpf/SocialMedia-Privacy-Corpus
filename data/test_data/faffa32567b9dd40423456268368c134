  "content": "There was no small amount of scepticism to the fanfare around Facebook's polling tool, as unveiled by Randi Zuckerberg at the World Economic Forum over the past few days. Does it indicate that Facebook plans to use its userbase as a giant market research tool? Does that mean a way for the social networking site to start making a bit more money? Will it lead to as much controversy as Facebook Beacon; the public are inherently suspicious about how their data will be used, even if they don't give enough thought to the information they make public. Facebook disputed the idea, suggested by the Telegraph, that polling its users is part of some market research masterplan because they are nothing to do with the site's engagement ads. No doubt, someway down the line, there will be some way to tap the value of all the every rich user data that the site gathers, as well as the data it can build in real-time through these kind of polls. But Facebook will be cautious about any steps in that direction after previous pitchforks-at-dawn demonstrations from users over the newsfeed and Facebook Beacon. This project at Davos - which was suggested, according to Facebook's global markets director Randi Zuckerberg, by the World Economic Forum itself - involved using real-time polls during 12 panel discussions, with the results from 3,000 randomly picked users flashing up on screens behind the speakers. Questions for the polls included 'Which renewable energy source do you find most promising?' and 'Will Pakistan and its neighbors experience greater instability in 2009?'. At peak, they received 2,500 responses in 3 minutes. Randi Zuckerberg, global markets director at Facebook. Photograph: David Sifry/Flickr/Some rights reserved Zuckerberg said that she would like the polls to be developed to give a more definitive breakdown. \"These are general numbers, and we'd love to take a deeper dive to see what gender the user is, where they live and what their interests are and also give them follow up questions that would allow us to go much deeper [into the subject],\" she said. \"The interesting thing is the quality of the responses and the immediacy. It takes a very long time for a focus group or a poll by phone.\" The Obama experience has demonstrated a new appetite for these kind of tools and also perhaps a new credibility for these sites. MySpace and YouTube were at Davos too, and the sight of Facebook's logo and poll results flashing up behind the Prime Minister of Pakistan is extremely good profile for them. As a global research base goes, Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook is not representative of the true global population - in which case its insights would be far more illuminating. What it does give is a representation of the views of the politically mobile, engaged, privileged and internet-savvy global class. And they are also the ones with the money."
