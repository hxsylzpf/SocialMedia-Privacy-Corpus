  "content": "What will 2013 be remembered for? We've reached H in our alphabetised review of the year... Hailo Hailing a taxi has never been quite so easy. The Hailo smartphone app promises to flag down a cab straight to your location with a touch of a virtual button and lets you instantly pay for your ride too. Now available across New York city and other key US locations, the company won a key lawsuit in 2013, defeating a case put by traditional rivals that would have restricted its potential to grow. \u2022 Hailo's future of self-driving cabs 'will still rely on humans' Hate Plus Expanding on the 'sexnology' game Analogue, this revelatory game explores sexual desires, the female expression of fantasies and is a sterling piece of original, imaginative and thought-provoking storytelling. Designer Christine Love has been described as 'gaming's Margaret Atwood'. \u2022 Hate Plus review Healthcare Obama's flagship affordable healthcare programme was let down by its online registration tool, which couldn't handle demand and was plagued with bugs.  \u2022 Healthcare.gov fault displayed hacking suggestions in search box Helpouts Google has made arguably the biggest strategic shift in its history by refocusing on social, which means bending over backwards to raise the profile of its social service Hangouts. Designed to promote the social platform, Helpouts lets users pay for live one-to-one web chats with experts in specific fields such as computing, health, fitness and fashion.  \u2022 The internet is already the world's greatest educator, and Google has found a ruthless a way to monetise it Hudl High street giant Tesco surprised investors by announcing a budget tablet computer powered by Google's Android software. The Hudl turned out to be such a success that stocks soon ran dry - and competitors including Aldi and Argos tried, but failed, to compete. \u2022 Tesco to unveil second-generation Hudl in 2014 Hyperloop A concept for a revolutionary form of transport linking Los Angeles to San Francisco in under 30 minutes, the Hyperloop would propel train-like pods at up to 800mph inside an elevated metal tube. The $10bn concept announced by Elon Musk captured the imagination of engineers, although it will take a lot more than an idea to make a reality.  \u2022 'Concorde meets a railgun meets an air hockey table' IFTTT To the uninitiated, IFTTT is a random series of letters but to believers, this ingenious service will help knit one service to another. If you can think of anything that you need connected - your photostream to your Dropbox, an auto email when it looks like rain, or auto-save all your tweets in a much more searchable spreadsheet. And this year, IFTTT - If This Then That - found the mainstream with its mobile app. \u2022 'Using your foot to hold a door open, standing a coffee cup on papers to stop them blowing across your desk - simple modifications of your environment that everyone does 100 times a day' Instagram Direct Instagram released its newest feature following the introduction of video in June. Instagram Direct allows users to send private images to individuals and/or groups of people, and sees the company assert itself in the face of stiff competition from private messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Snapchat. \u2022 Instagram mulling groups feature Internet of things The internet of things is the idea that everyday objects \u2013 such as a coffee machine \u2013 can be connected to the internet. Many still consider the \"internet of things\" to be a buzzword that's been blown out of proportion, but the introduction of the iBeacon and Belkin's WeMo range \u2013 that people could use to send a message telling your coffee machine to switch on when you wake up \u2013 could start playing a bigger role in our daily lives. \u2022 Progress doesn't seem to match the 'internet of things' predictions of the past 25 years iOS7 Apple's seventh iteration to their operating system finally saw a major aesthetic redesign - touched by the hand of chief designer Jony Ive. After five generations of phones with software that looked the same, a number of users found that it wasn't quite as intuitive as Apple's previous products. Despite the bumpy landing iOS7 had reached more than 70% of Apple device users by December. \u2022 Why iOS7 is making some users sick iPad Air Another major release form Apple this year, the updated iPad Air was lighter, slimmer and much faster. \u2022 iPad Air review - raising the bar for its rivals iPhone 5s And the third major launch was an updated iPhone - thinner, lighter, faster and with TouchID fingerprint security. And available in gold. \u2022 iPhone 5S review James Bridle Writer and artist James Bridle applied some much needed intensity and skill to the debate about ebooks and their impact on the industry, but also continued to question and investigate the UK's forced rendition programme and the politics of drones. \u2022 Planespotting: watching the deportation flights Jawbone Part of the trend for wearables, the Jawbone monitors all physical activity including sleep, marking how mainstream data tracking has become. \u2022 Jawbone could affect healthcare for all of us Jordan Hatch The talented teenage programmer became known on the hackathon circuit and was picked up by the Government Digital Service, which has managed to build up recruit some of the country's most talented developers. \u2022 How geeks opened up government Kano A kit computer for the rest of us, the Kano project turned a Raspberry Pi into Lego-like computer, and provided a whole host of simple, fun ways to teaching kids to code."
