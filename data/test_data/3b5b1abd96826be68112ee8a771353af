  "content": "The News of the World's parent company, News International, today broke its silence over the phone hacking affair, saying it was \"prevented by confidentiality obligations\" from discussing \"certain allegations\" made by the Guardian. The company said in a statement that its journalists fully complied with relevant legislation and codes of conduct from February 2007 \u2013 after the News of the World's royal editor, Clive Goodman, and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, had been jailed for four and six months respectively for hacking into the mobile phones of royal household staff, and the paper's editor, Andy Coulson, had resigned over the affair. \"News International is prevented by confidentiality obligations from discussing certain allegations made in the Guardian newspaper today,\" the company said. \"Since February 2007, News International has continued to work with its journalists and its industry partners to ensure that its journalists fully comply with both the relevant legislation and the rigorous requirements of the PCC's Code of Conduct,\" the statement said. \"At the same time, we will not shirk from vigorously defending our right and proper role to expose wrongdoing in the public interest.\" The company's statement set out a chronology of events involving the Information Commissioner report into private investigators and the News of the World phone hacking scandal that led to its royal editor being jailed and Coulson, now the Conservative party's director of communications, to resign. News International said the company \"fully co-operated\" with the police investigation that led to the arrest and charging of Goodman Mulcaire in August 2006. The company said that Coulson resigned in January 2007, after \"taking ultimate responsibility\" for the phone hacking. When Colin Myler was appointed the editor of the News of the World in February 2007 he wrote to every member of the paper's staff ordering that all journalists must operate within the law and adhere to the Press Complaints Commission code of conduct. He also told staff that they must all \"represent the News of the World in a professional manner\" and attend regular training seminars on legal and PCC issues. The company said that, in March 2007, Les Hinton, then executive chairman of News International, appeared before the culture media and sport select committee and testified that, \"to the best of his knowledge, following internal investigations, Goodman was acting alone\". News International pointed out that the Information Commissioner's report into newspaper use of private investigators found 31 newspapers and magazines from News International, Trinity Mirror, Associated Newspapers and the Guardian Media Group \u2013 which publishes MediaGuardian.co.uk \u2013 had used private investigators between 2001 and 2003. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857. For all other inquiries please call the main Guardian switchboard on 020 3353 2000. \u2022 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
