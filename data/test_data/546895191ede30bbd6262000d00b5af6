  "content": "He is a world renowned novelist whose books have sold in the millions and gathered dozens of awards - along with an infamous death threat. But Salman Rushdie has discovered that even his high profile is not enough to satisfy Facebook's real name police. Rushdie became embroiled in a battle with the social networking website after his account was deactivated for breaching its strict real name policy. Facebook claimed that Rushdie, who refers to himself by his middle name, Salman, was an imposter. The author had to send a photograph of his passport to the security team to prove his identity, but when his account was reinstated he found his name had been changed to Ahmed - the first name on his passport. The novelist, whose books include Midnight's Children and The Satanic Verses, took to Twitter to vent his frustration, appealing directly to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to reinstate his preferred name. In one tweet about the conflict, he wrote: \"Morons. @MarkZuckerbergF? Are you listening?\" Rushdie faced a similar ordeal with Twitter just months ago when users of the site questioned whether he was the man behind the @salmanrushdie1 account. After having his identity verified by Twitter, the imposter using the @SalmanRushdie account was forced to hand over the name. This time, Rushdie used his dedicated Twitter followers to make an impassioned plea to Facebook to reinstate the name he uses on his novels and is known by millions of fans across the globe. Making references to other famous figures, he tweeted: \"Dear #Facebook, forcing me to change my FB name from Salman to Ahmed Rushdie is like forcing J. Edgar to become John Hoover. \"Or, if F. Scott Fitzgerald was on #Facebook, would they force him to be Francis Fitzgerald? What about F. Murray Abraham?\" Scores of followers retweeted his pleas and after two hours he claimed a victory after Facebook reverted his name back to Salman Rushdie. He wrote: \"I'm Salman Rushdie again. I feel SO much better. An identity crisis at my age is no fun. Thank you Twitter! \"Just received an apology from The #Facebook Team. All is sweetness and light.\""
