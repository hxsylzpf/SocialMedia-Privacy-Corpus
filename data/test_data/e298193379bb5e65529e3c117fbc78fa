  "content": "Have you been abused because you are a journalist? Evidently, according to some tentative initial research, people are often using social media in order to insult, and even threaten, reporters. Researchers at the University of Central Lancashire are hoping to discover whether the problem is widespread and how abused journalists are dealing with it. They want media professionals to take part in a short online survey - it's here - which allows respondents to see the current results. Senior lecturer Amy Binns, a former Yorkshire Post reporter, says: \"We already have plenty of anecdotal evidence about the abuse journalists experience. \"Frankly, some of the things I've been reading make me feel a bit ill. But we want to go beyond particular cases to gather some data about the level of this problem and how journalists respond to it, both practically and emotionally. \"Of course journalists often have to deal with people who are very emotional. The culture is usually to laugh off distressing experiences back at the office, and that can be a good way of dealing with it. \"However, my initial results show that relentless online abuse, whether on Twitter or in the comments stream, is taking its toll.\" So far, just 87 people have taken the survey, most of whom were news or sports journalists. The most common insults - experienced by 70% of the sample - were about journalists' work or the outlet for which they work. Almost half had received personal insults, some 27% had been threatened, with 8% receiving sexual insults and a further 6% being sexually threatened. So how have abused journalists reacted? Most, about 58%, replied in public. Almost as many had blocked the user, while 15% had deleted their own original post in response to abusive messages. Binns says that despite the newsroom tradition of black humour and macho behaviour, 75% of male journalists said they were sometimes or often upset, with 30% saying they had been very upset and 11% reporting that they were frightened or intimidated. Anger was the most common reaction: 43% were sometimes angry and 30% were often angry. Among female journalists, their reactions were stronger: 95% said they were sometimes or often upset, with 66% sometimes or often very upset. Nearly half were sometimes or often frightened or intimidated. Unsurprisingly, they were even more angry than the men, with 50% sometimes angry and 45% often angry. Binns says she is concerned about journalism students' welfare. She had encouraged her students to build public profiles in order to help them break into the business and to engage with their audience. But she now admits that \"this is likely to expose them to trouble.\" Survey here"
