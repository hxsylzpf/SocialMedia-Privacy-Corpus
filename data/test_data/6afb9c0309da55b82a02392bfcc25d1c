  "content": "The Co-op's big summer TV ad is facing a backlash from its own employees who have taken to Facebook and Twitter to demand the retailer \"stop playing it\". The TV campaign, created by ad agency Leo Burnett, uses imagery and motifs more closely associated with Christmas than summer. The ad features a child making snow angels in a sandbox and a couple are seen kissing under a sprig of salad instead of misletoe. Music accompanying the ad is The Most Wonderful Time of the Year, by Andy Williams, which is also closely linked to Christmas. Co-op employees have taken to Co-op's Facebook page and Twitter to vent their spleen, with comments ranging from mocking the ad to outrage. One disgruntled employee said: \"What is the deal with the next advert! CHRISTMAS MUSIC? IN JUNE?! It's depressing enough as it is with Christmas stock coming in as earlier as it does!\" Another said: \"The Co-op have really annoyed me using a Christmas song for their advert.\" Others though have praised the ad with one describing the ad as \"really quite clever\". In response, Helen Nunn, head of marketing at the Co-op Food, said: \"Love it or hate it, our latest ad has certainly got people talking, but, judging from our scorching sales over the Wimbledon weekend, the Andy Williams soundtrack isn't putting people off shopping with us!\" The Co-op said it had no plans to reduce the exposure of the TV ad but said it would be reducing the airtime of the Williams song on the Co-op's in-store radio service, in light of the criticism. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
