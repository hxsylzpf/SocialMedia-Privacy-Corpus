  "content": "Lulz \"Giggles\" or \"laughs\", with the flavour of schadenfreude. Dox Documentation relating to the real-life identity of a hacker. A cause of huge paranoia for senior aficionados whose activity relies on remaining anonymous. Botnet Network of infected computers to remotely attack other websites. Botnets change hands for cash in the internet's criminal underworld. Ryan Cleary, the Essex teenager in custody over LulzSec-related attacks, is charged with distributing a botnet. DDoS In a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, a network of computers (often a botnet) bombards a website with simultaneous requests to load, making it inaccessible for others. You don't need thousands of people: groups such as LulzSec are composed of a handful of people with access to botnets. IRC Internet Relay Chats are forums, public or private, for hackers and IT specialists. Taking part in the chats requires some tech expertise \u2013 the easiest way is through a downloaded client, which bars entry to police and journalists. VPN A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, is an anonymous internet connection, making it difficult to trace your real-life location. Used to prevent government spying (and in China to evade the \"great firewall\"), VPNs encrypt information the user sends over the internet. Bitcoins The world's newest currency. Bitcoins are an untraceable, cryptographically created, online currency that can be exchanged for real-life currency in certain online locations."
