  "content": "By 2014, the number of mobile internet users will surpass the number of users browsing the internet via a desktop computer, says a former adviser to Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and member of technology panels on the United Nations. Professor Manuel Castells told a conference on web science at the Royal Society this week that the internet is a \"key technology of freedom\" for those able to access it, predicting that the planet will achieve \"quasi-universal coverage of internet access as my generation fades away\". In that time, he said, a \"major disparity in the quality of connection around the world is a major issue of policy\" for governments to tackle. The timescale for the shift echoes comments made by John Herlihy, head of global advertising operations at Google, who earlier this year said \"In three years time, desktops will be irrelevant\", predicting the mass adoption of smartphones. Speaking about the \"phenomenal\" societal impact of the emergence of social networks, Castells said the number of users \u2013 500m on Facebook alone \u2013 is only at \"the tip of the iceberg\". \"The deepest social transformation of the internet came in the last decade with social networks,\" he said, adding: \"Increasing sociability, increasing happiness, an increasing feeling of being autonomous \u2013 all this relates to use of internet. The most important thing in this is that it's not anonymous \u2013 this is real people doing real things, sharing things. They're not just friends, they're contacts also. They're doing things together, they're not just chatting. \"Social networks are living spaces. People share with limited emotional effort. This is a constantly networked world that evolves with human experience, and individuals choose the terms of their co-evolution. Entrepreneurs build these sites, not corporations. The important thing is that even if people go into these sites, they can't do whatever they want. People will create another and take all their friends with them. The entry barriers are so low, the capital [outlay is] almost nothing, and [the barriers to entry are] so diffused. \"If Facebook becomes nasty people disappear. This is constructed by individuals who organise, and their companies are in the business of selling freedom \u2013 if they don't give it people go away. This is transforming social movements and politics,\" Castells said. He cited the example of Barack Obama's election as one which could not have happened without the internet. Obama's Democratic Party campaign is credited as the first that attempted to connect directly to the voting public through social websites such as Facebook and YouTube. From the outset, Obama's campaign is said to have galvanised and organised the young American vote while rivals \u2013 and some pundits \u2013 tried to centre his candidacy around race. On Facebook, Obama had more than 2 million supporters; the Republican party candidate, John McCain, had just over 600,000. On Twitter in 2008, when the service was just a year old, Obama had 112,000 people following his campaign trail; McCain had 4,600. Many have acknowledged that Obama's election marked a significant shift in the way elections are fought, but Castells is one of the most-qualified people to make the judgement. He said the election of Obama would have been an \"unlikely\" event if it wasn't for the internet, and said that the right-wing US Tea Party is already exploiting online campaigning methods pioneered in the States by the Democratic Party. \"The unlikely election of Obama \u2013 which was a hope of many \u2013 could not have happened without the internet,\" Castells said. \"But the Tea Party movement is already using the internet in extraordinarily effective ways.\"",
