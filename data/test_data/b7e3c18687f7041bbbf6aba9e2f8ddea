  "content": "Intercepting communications is a vital tool in countering international terrorism, British security and intelligence have insisted. Sometimes GCHQ, the government's communications headquarters, targets an individual when there are grounds to suspect he or she is involved in terrorism, serious crime or other activities covered by the very broad criteria laid down in the 1994 Intelligence Services Act. Often, however, GCHQ and America's National Security Agency, with which it has a symbiotic relationship, trawl through communications they pick up from the airwaves in search of possible leads that might help in foiling a plot. Intelligence officers say that unusual \"chatter\" could lead to a successful anti-terrorist operation. That chatter is intercepted not as the result of any tipoff, suspicion, or evidence that an individual is up to no good. It is intercepted as a result of the huge retrieval and storage capabilities of GCHQ and NSA giant computers. For example, this is what first tipped off GCHQ about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Unsurprisingly, security and intelligence agencies now concentrate on terrorism. \"Every single major international terrorism investigation has involved the interception of communications,\" an intelligence officer said on Monday. \"It matters because terrorists have to communicate.\" Plotters communicate even if they know they risk being discovered, say intelligence sources. They may use their own code words believing they will be less likely to come under scrutiny. An important part of GCHQ's task is to decode those communications. GCHQ has the capacity to tap every single mobile phone in Britain, insiders say. The only obstacle in the way is practical \u2013 the scale of the human resources required to analyse and if necessary decode the conversations. MI5, the domestic security service, has cited the need to make priorities as a reason why it did not pursue two of the ringleaders of the 7/7 London suicide bombings in 2005. Though intercepting communications, including social media, may help prevent a terrorist attack or other criminal act, it may also stop GCHQ and its partners seeing the wood for the trees. The wholesale harvesting of personal information has important implications for the public, not only over the issue of the accountability of the intelligence agencies but also international law \u2013 in the shape of European and UN human rights conventions. Carl Miller, a research director at the thinktank Demos, said on Monday: \"As more people \u2013 including terrorists and criminals \u2013 communicate online, the intelligence services need to be able to access this data and use it in their investigations. But this must be on a legal and publicly argued basis.\" He added: \"What the Prism leak has revealed is that much of this surveillance is already happening, but without a legal grounding or oversight structure that is clear enough to command public confidence. In reality this was a scandal waiting to happen.\" Miller added: \"Any secure and prosperous society rests on the public knowing and accepting the measures taken to protect itself. The government must update Ripa [the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act] for the social media age to guarantee that the measures to keep us safe are proportionate, accountable and effective.\""
