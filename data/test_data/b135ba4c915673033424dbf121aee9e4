  "content": "The European court of human rights has ruled that French courts should not have ordered Paris-Match to pay damages to Prince Albert of Monaco over its coverage of a woman's claim that he was the father of her child. According to the ECHR judges, sitting in the fifth section chamber, the judgment breached the publication's right to freedom of expression. They held, by a four-three majority, that the French courts had made no distinction between information which formed part of a debate of general interest and that which merely reported details of the Prince's private life. In addition, the case did not simply concern a dispute between the press and a public figure because the interests of the mother, and of the child in having his identity recognised, were also at stake. The case is the latest of a series in which members of Monaco's ruling family has sought to restrict media reporting of their activities. It was taken to the Strasbourg court by Anne-Marie Couderc, publication director of Paris-Match, and its publisher, Hachette Filipacchi Associes. In May 2005, despite a notice against publication served by Prince Albert, Paris-Match carried an article in which Ms C said that Albert was her son's father. The salient points of the article had previously been published by the Daily Mail. The Paris-Match report, with photographs showing the prince with the child, appeared simultaneously in the German weekly magazine Bunte. On 19 May the year, Albert sued on the basis of article 8 of the European human rights convention, which protects privacy, and the French civil code. The court, in deciding that the publication had invaded the monarch's privacy and his right to the protection of his own image, awarded him \u20ac50,000 (\u00a340,200) in damages and ordered details of the judgment to be printed in a full-page feature on the front cover of Paris-Match, under the title \"Court order made against Paris-Match at the request of Prince Albert II of Monaco\". Paris-Match and its owner appealed and obtained a suspension of the judgment's immediate enforceability. The prince later issued a statement publicly acknowledging that the child was his. A French appeal court judgment agreed that the Paris-Match article had caused Albert irreversible damage because the fact of his fatherhood, which was secret until the article's publication, had become public knowledge against his wishes. It upheld the damages but amended the order for publication. Meanwhile, in Germany, an application lodged by Albert against the magazine Bunte was dismissed, a judgment subsequently upheld by its appeal court. The German courts gave precedence to the public's right to be informed over the prince's interest in protection of his private life. It was accepted that the question of a possible male heir was of decisive importance in a hereditary monarchy and that it was for the child's mother and not for the prince to decide on the disclosure. The ECHR judgment tacitly supports that view. Ms C had used the press to draw public attention to the situation of her child, who was born outside marriage and had not yet been formally recognised by his father. Even though the child could not succeed his father to the throne, his existence was apt to be of interest to the public, particularly the citizens of Monaco. The public had had a legitimate interest in knowing of the child's existence and being able to conduct a debate on the possible implications for political life in the principality.
