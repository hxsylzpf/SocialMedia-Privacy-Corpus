  "content": "The BBC is attempting to embrace social media by appointing a social media editor in its newsroom and redesigning its website. As the September traffic figures for US political blogging site Huffington Post reveal, the strategy is clearly a wise one. In short: embracing social media boosts traffic. The figures speak for themselves: after the Huffington Post launched a Social News site with Facebook Connect in the middle of August, comScore credited the site with 6,825,000 unique users in September. That is up impressive 50% year on year, and slightly overtaking the Washington Post website. According to the Nielsen's September report, the Huffington Post is at 9.47 million unique users, compared with the BBC's 7.2 million. When Staci D Kramer from paidContent got a chance to interview the Huffington Post CEO, Eric Hippeau, he revealed some more details: Facebook referral traffic is up 48% since the launch and accounted for 3.5 million visits, so 15% of all the comments now come from Facebook. And according to the Huffington Post's internal statistics, those numbers continue to build. So what is Social News in detail? Apart from Facebook Connect, which allows users to log in using their Facebook identity, it is the much deeper integration of Facebook into the Huffington Post \u2013 and vice versa. Links to articles can be posted directly from the Huffington Post to your Facebook profile using a pop-up window, and you can see on a special section of the Huffington Post what your Facebook friends are reading. Due to the socialisation of news the Huffington Post is building a brand people trust and seek out, as Kara Swisher of AllthingsD puts it. This shrinks the overloaded news world down to the news that are important to the user and their friends. They are the people who decide what is important to know \u2013 perhaps this was meant by the much-quoted saying that that journalists' reign as \"gatekeepers of information\" is over. What friends are reading is at least as important as the news displayed on the homepage of a news site. The New York Times is experimenting with this approach, too. A year ago it launched TimesPeople, but traffic figures are not available. Like the Huffington Post's Social News, it connects readers directly to each other \u2013 like a Facebook for news. Registered readers are able to share what they read and recommend with other TimesPeople, and see the comments of friends directly. Recently this experiment to focus more on readers' opinions was strengthened with the \"Health Care Conversations\". Here the New York Times curates its readers' debate. News organisations understand more and more that users' friends can help prevent information overload by flitering news. Indeed, news organisations are realising that in a fragmented world readers are no longer afraid to miss out on information. Instead, their attitude is that, as the saying goes, \"If the news is that important, it will find me.\" Social media is just one way in which web users pick up on news. Compared with other digital news sites, newspaper websites generally performing well in attracting traffic. comScore figures for August show an average growth of 4.3% year on year in US newspaper websites' unique users, which is above the 3.7% for CNN and -9.2% for FoxNews.com, while Yahoo! News gained 6.8% and AOL News lost 4.0%. However, Huffington Post's 64.8% increase shows that there is a new competitor on the field. Not all experiments might work out, but social news looks like it is here to stay."
