  "content": "\"Twitter in acquisition talks with Google and Facebook\" screamed the headlines earlier this week. \"Oh God no!\" screamed the internet even louder. \"First the AOL-Huffington Post acquisition, now this! Is nothing sacred?!\" Not for the first time, the internet needs to stop being so bloody hysterical. Perhaps I'm out of touch. A few months ago I stopped using social media, including Twitter. Not because of any paranoid concerns about privacy, or fatigue from the vapidity of hashtag memes, but because my day job involves writing about myself and doing it for free was becoming a distraction. Maybe it's only the fact that I have no skin in the Twitter game that allows me to be blase about the hideous prospect of the revolution-igniting microblogging platform selling out to the man. No, that's not it. The reason I can't muster any outrage over a possible Twitter acquisition is that I've seen this movie a dozen times before. Spoiler alert: everything's going to be fine. For one thing, this is Silicon Valley. Everyone here is in acquisition talks with Google and Facebook. Twitter certainly is; Quora probably is; Foursquare, Tumblr, Instagram, Instapaper \u2013 they're all likely sitting round a Mountain View conference table at this very moment, pens poised. They'll all deny it of course. They're in it for the long haul \u2013 they have no interest in selling. Until they do. And if not to Google or Facebook, then to someone equally evil. Last September, I heard a rumour that TechCrunch \u2013 where I write a weekly column \u2013 was about to be acquired by AOL. I was actually standing off-stage at a TechCrunch conference when the tip came in. Being careful to cover my clip-on microphone, I turned to CEO Heather Harde and asked her outright. \"Hey Heather, is TechCrunch being acquired by AOL?\". She shook her head. No. Not a chance. Uh-uh. The very next day, AOL's Tim Armstrong stood on that same stage and announced \u2013 corporate-cutely \u2013 that \"We got TechCrunch\". Being acquired, of course, is bad. It involves \"selling out\" your core principles in pursuit of profit. Which is evil. As an independent company, Twitter can tell the American government to go to hell when it secretly demands access to the message logs of Icelandic MPs. As part of Facebook or Google on the other hand, it would have to follow its parent's lead and roll over. Then there's the inevitable merging of features: much of the panic around the idea of a Twitter sale has centred on the possibility that the service could be subsumed into either Facebook or (ugh) Google Buzz. The only problem with the independence v acquisition, good v evil narrative is that \u2013 well \u2013 it's bullshit. You know who refused to sell out to the man? Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is famous for having turned down multiple acquisition offers \u2013 including one from Google. The payoff? Facebook grew so big that it ended up being an evil acquirer itself. Google also turned down multiple suitors, before swelling into a public company with a market cap of almost $200bn. The \"don't be evil\" kids are now so powerful that even the Chinese government is scared of them. Then there's the ludicrous fantasy that Twitter is still a plucky little upstart, just because its not yet profitable. Please. The company has raised a total of $360m, it has already acquired eight other companies, and has had more than its fair share of grown-up machinations, included an ousted co-founder. It's even been suggested that Twitter created the recent acquisition rumours to plump up its own valuation ahead of a sale or IPO. Plucky indeed. As for the argument that an acquisition will inevitably kill Twitter's functionality: sure, it's possible that a buyer would be dumb enough to destroy the simplicity that made the service so popular. But the internet was designed with redundancy in mind: if one cool service is smothered, another six pop up to take its place. The real issue here is that since David pwned Goliath, we've been conditioned to root for the little guy, even if the little guy is really just a slightly smaller giant. We love being the first to discover a wonderful new thing \u2013 a new website, or social network, or radio station or brand of running shoes. And when \u2013 as usually happens \u2013 our wonderful new thing is acquired by an evil old one, we throw an almighty fit. It happened with MySpace, it happened with Flickr, it happened with Last.fm, it happened with the Huffington Post and TechCrunch \u2013 and now it's Twitter's turn. Here's what happens next: either Twitter is acquired, it goes public or it continues to grow until it's as big as Facebook. In the meantime, someone invents an even shinier, newer service for us to root for. Like Twitter, that new thing will change the way we communicate, it'll revolutionise commerce and \u2013 who knows \u2013 it might even kick-start a revolution. \"We'll never sell out!\" the founders will cry. And we'll all believe them. Until one day they do \u2013 possibly even to big, evil old Twitter."
