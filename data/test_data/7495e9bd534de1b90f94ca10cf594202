  "content": "So, West Midlands Police has a tweeting CSI dog. Smithy, a two-year-old black labrador \"trained to find blood and human remains\" passes on such gems as \"back home soaking wet coat . . . dinner and a nice warm kennel\". He may need to step up his act if he's going to compete with the undisputed king of the Twitter jungle. Sockington, a grey-and-white cat who lives in the town of Waltham, Massachusetts, has notched up more than 1.5m followers \u2013 Smithy could only boast 316 by lunchtime yesterday. It helps that Sockington is a prolific tweeter with his own website; you can even buy the T-shirt. His owner, Jason Scott, a 39-year-old computer administrator and historian, has also hinted there's a book in the pipeline. Just so you know what you've been missing, here's a tweet he made earlier: \"CAN'T REALLY COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS COUCH wait I'm a cat HEY WHAT'S UP WITH THE HALF-SIZE COUCH WITH NO INLAID FOOD BOWL.\""
