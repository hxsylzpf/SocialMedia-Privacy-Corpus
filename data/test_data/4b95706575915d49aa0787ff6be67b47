  "content": "\u2022 With regulators receiving complaints about Google, the company's competitive. So who better to offer advice than Microsoft? In a post on the Microsoft blog one of the company's most senior competition lawyers makes a series of digs at its rival - and ultimately tries to bolster its own opinion that Microsoft never did anything wrong, while simultaneously suggesting that if Google falls foul of competition law, it will only be getting what it deserves: \"Microsoft would obviously be among the first to say that leading firms should not be punished for their success... our concerns relate only to Google practices that tend to lock in business partners and content... and exclude competitors\". \u2022 The Operation Aurora attacks - those ones that hit Google, Adobe and others - may have been more widespread than previously thought. Research by security company ISEC suggests that more than 100 companies may have been targeted. The web woven around these strikes just keeps getting bigger. \u2022 And a piece of Monday morning reading courtesy of Ars Technica, which takes a look at the A4 chip that will power the iPad (or more accurately, what we do and don't know about it and what it can do). You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
