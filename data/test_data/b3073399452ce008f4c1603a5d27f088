  "content": "While celebrities quiver at the thought that they might be in the bargain 71p category, the rest of us have to wonder whether we'll really be prepared to pay to contact them. Facebook has started a trial among 10% of its UK users, charging them to send \"priority\" messages to people outside their friends list, on a sliding scale ranging from 71p to just under \u00a311. The price depends on which country they are in, whether anyone else has paid to send them a message and how many friends they have, which is why it will probably cost more to contact celebrities. \"The challenge was how do you [send a message to someone's inbox] and it not become a mechanism for spam. If you put some sort of financial tariff on it, that would be an instant disincentive,\" says Iain Mackenzie, Facebook's European communications manager, who wants to stress it will just as likely be used to contact non-celebrities (he gives the example of a company approaching someone with a job offer). I can see why it might appeal. As a child, I was a prolific letter writer. I wrote \u2013 for the price of a second-class stamp \u2013 to numerous people, including Margaret Thatcher, Geoff Capes and favourite authors (I remember receiving a lovely letter from Nina Bawden). I wrote to Sinitta, my favourite pop star, but she never replied. I think the picture I had drawn of us holding hands at Top of the Pops might have put her off. I can only find a Sinitta page on Facebook, not a personal account, so I can't send her a direct message \u2013 same for Maya Angelou, who I'd also pay to contact. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger might be on Facebook, but with hundreds of people with that name, all pretending to be the Arsenal manager, how do I know which is the right one? The Sunday Times reported that it costs \u00a310.68 to send messages to fake Ed Sheeran accounts. Truly, the end days are upon us. The diver Tom Daley is one of the celebrities highlighted as attracting the highest charge (\u00a310.68), so I should get in quick and send him a message before I have to pay. The problem is, I don't know what to write that doesn't sound predatory so I write something banal about the Olympics. He doesn't reply. Facebook appears to have settled on the charges after a similar experiment in the US (at one point they were charging people $100 to contact Mark Zuckerberg) but surely there should be a wider scale, using a complex algorithm based on how little they would like to hear from you \u2013 50p for Geri Halliwell; \u00a3500 for Meryl Streep; \u00a35,000 for Thomas Pynchon. If Facebook wants to charge me more than \u00a310 to send a message to Daley, surely it should be able to force him to reply? Perhaps this is something they could look at. If it could guarantee me a personal reply from, say, Barack Obama or Paul Hollywood or Sinitta, perhaps by filling their timelines with nothing but baby scan photos until they relent, I would save up and pay big money. Zuckerberg can have that idea for free.",
