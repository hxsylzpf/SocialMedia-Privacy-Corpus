  "content": "Kevin Pietersen is facing disciplinary action after reacting angrily on Twitter to being dropped from England's squad for the Twenty20 and one-day internationals against Pakistan. Pietersen's outburst, several hours before England's squad was officially revealed, will be investigated by the England and Wales Cricket Board, which has issued strict instructions to all players that Twitter should be used in a responsible fashion. Pietersen, dropped by England for the first time after a summer of torment, vented his feelings on his account kevinpp24. The post, quickly removed, read: \"Yep. Done for rest of summer!! Man of the World Cup T20 and dropped from the T20 side too.. Its a fuck up!! Surrey have signed me for l ...\" Pietersen had found himself up against Twitter's 140-character limit. What he wanted to say was \"...for loan\". England believe Pietersen will benefit from a change of scene ahead of the Ashes, although initially at least they failed to convince him of that. His pride has been stung by his omission so close to the start of the Ashes tour, although his response did not go down well with Geoff Miller, England's national selector. \"I don't like that kind of language and I don't use that language at all,\" Miller said when asked his views on the rant. \"I don't follow Twitter and I'm not a great believer in that kind of thing. I don't think it is necessary. I'm still the national selector and what I do is select sides with my co-selectors that we think is right for England. My priority is the England side and it is not about individuals. \"We make our decisions honourably and loyally for the England cause and we'll continue to do so. It is not about and individual it is about the team. \"I'll talk to KP. Whether there is an apology or not I'm sure [coach] Andy Flower will have a word with him. I'll be watching games that he is participating in before the end of the season and this won't stop me talking to Kevin Pietersen, and if he wants to apologise or thinks there is a need to apologise then so be it, I will certainly explain to him what my feelings are.\" Pietersen's outburst contrasted markedly with his emollient, ECB-approved words released later when the squad was officially announced. \"I fully understand the reasons... I have no issue with the selectors omitting me... my sole focus is now working on my game.\" The 30-year-old has signed for Surrey for the rest of the season, an arrangement agreed at the ECB's request, as they try to plan his recovery of form in county cricket in the build up to the Ashes. England have harboured fears that he might fail to win a county deal after his Hampshire contract was ended early because he wanted to play for a county close to his Chelsea home. They will hope that the Surrey move proves a forced marriage made in heaven. Chris Adams, Surrey's professional cricket manager, said: \"I have no doubt Kevin will be a positive influence on and off the field.\" Pietersen was a key contributor in World Twenty20 as England won their first major one-day title, and was named player of the tournament, but since then he has seemed mentally drained and technically vulnerable. He briefly returned from World Twenty20 for the birth of his first child and, although a hard worker in the nets, he has occasionally seemed a distracted figure. He has managed just one half century all summer, an error-strewn 80 in the second Test against Pakistan at Edgbaston when he laughed at his good fortune. And his season reached its low point with a first-ball dismissal in the Lord's Test when he drove feverishly at a wide ball from Mohammad Amir and was caught at the wicket. England suspended Azeem Rafiq, the England Under-19 captain, for a month and fined him \u00a3500 after an expletive-laden tirade on Twitter. Rafiq had been dropped during an U19 Test series against Sri Lanka as punishment for staying out into the early hours and called the man who made the decision \u2014 John Abrahams, the ECB's elite player development manager \u2014 a \"useless wanker\". Pietersen's offence might not reach the same heights, but the ECB will be obliged to consider disciplinary action and may press for an outright ban on Twitter. Pakistan trio to be axed, page 2 The biggest beneficiary in England's selection is Surrey's wicketkeeper Steven Davies, named in both squads. Davies will keep in preference to Craig Kieswetter in Twenty20 and is also expected to open in the absence of the injured Michael Lumb. He replaces Kieswetter in the ODI series. Kieswetter will regard Somerset's 50-over match against Pakistan at Taunton as a chance to prove the selectors wrong.
