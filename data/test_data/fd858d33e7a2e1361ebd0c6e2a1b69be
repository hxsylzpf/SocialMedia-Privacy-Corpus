  "content": "And lo, it came to pass. The BBC finally published details of what it is planning to do with online-only BBC3 when it axes the 11-year-old TV channel next year. Twitter seized on two strands of today's proposals \u2013 the twin pillars of \"make me laugh\" and \"make me think\" around which the new BBC3's content will be based. And the unfortunate fate that lies for factual entertainment shows such as Snog Marry Avoid, Don't Tell The Bride and Sun, Sea and Suspicious Parents, which look to be on the way out. But first, those pillars. What's that all about then? It was a theme picked up elsewhere. And here... Yes, yes, but how will it play with the viewers? You know, the kids? Better still, find a younger viewer and ask them. The imminent devise of Snog Marry Avoid wasn't about to change anyone's minds, either the best thing about BBC3 or the worst (invariably but not universally influenced by how old you are). But what kind of programmes can we expect on the new BBC3? And it would be remiss not to find room for a (comedy) conspiracy theory. The proposals to axe the TV channel and take the BBC3 brand online-only remain just that at the moment, with final approval required from the BBC Trust, after a public consultation which kicks off in January. The stakes are high."
