  "content": "Walsall council's Twitter experiment has concluded with positive results, after staff used the social networking site to share news of all its activities for 24 hours. A council spokesman said there were 1,347 tweets with the hashtag #walsall24 in the period 6am Thursday to 6am Friday which included tweets from council employees as well as retweets and people talking about it. \"We'd hoped ambitiously for around 1,000 but that figure and the feedback we received has wildly exceeded our expectations,\" he said. Tweetreach says the #walsall24 hashtag on Twitter reached 116,273 people via 1,349 tweets. he added. The population of Walsall is 250,000. The most significant thing that happened overnight was the temporary closure of Bloxwich High Street for resurfacing from 8pm to 2am while other services were operating as usual, the spokesman said. Here's some of the middle-of-night activity from the local authority. The 24-hour initiative is believed to be the first time a local authority has tweeted its activities. Walsall council leader Mike Bird said: \"Things have gone really well today and there has been some amazing feedback, not just from Walsall but internationally. \"It really does show that it's something that works to get a message out. \"I think we're showing the good work that we do for council taxpayers that often goes unheralded. \"Twitter is not everyone's cup of tea and we understand that, but it's something that is growing in importance.\" What did you think of the project? Would you like to see your council services tweeted or featured on social networks? Let us know below."
