  "content": "Vodafone's chairman, Gerard Kleisterlee, has promised to protect the right to privacy, saying the mobile network will engage with the UK government's review of how the intelligence agencies intercept and collect data on its customers. \"We will engage with governments when and where legal frameworks are being reviewed and that holds for the UK,\" he said at the firm's annual shareholder meeting in London on Tuesday. \"We are very much focussed on protecting the rights of customers and protecting their privacy.\" The home secretary, Theresa May, has asked the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC, to lead a review of the interception and data collection powers required by law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and the legal framework under which they operate. The inquiry will look at whether new legislation is needed, and whether the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) needs to be amended or replaced, and consultation responses are due by 3 October. Kleisterlee said Vodafone's response would echo the principles outlined in its report on government surveillance, which showed around half a dozen countries can access its network without warrants and without obtaining permission from it. In the report, published in June, Vodafone called for governments to \"balance national security and law enforcement objectives against the state's obligation to protect the human rights of all individuals\", and \"discourage agencies and authorities from seeking direct access to an operator's communications infrastructure without a lawful mandate\". The campaign group Access urged the firm to reduce the number of countries which use secret wires to gain access all data on its network without warrants. Peter Micek of Access said: \"Vodafone have already called for an end to unfettered access. Put some action behind those words and announce five years from not that it's no longer happening.\" Asked about protests in Vodafone high street stores by the tax campaign group UK Uncut, which has questioned the firm's lack of corporation tax payments in the UK, Kleisterlee said: \"Protesters are aiming at the wrong target because they are ill-informed. It's totally unjustified, we don't deserve that treatment. If people based their action on information and not emotions this will go away.\" In a packed shareholder meeting, the audience expressed anger at a share consolidation which for many has resulted in dividend payments halving. There were calls for the resignation remuneration committee chairman, Luc Vandevelde, a former Marks &amp; Spencer boss, on the grounds that he has been a director for more than 10 years and can no longer be considered independent. While motions on Vodafone's pay policies, which saw the chief executive, Vittorio Colao, collect \u00a39m in the year to March, were approved by more than 95% of votes cast, pensioners criticised the drop in their dividend income. Vodafone halved the number of shares in issue after paying out a windfall from the sale of its stake in America's Verizon mobile network. Despite an increase in the dividend, this year the company will pay an estimated \u00a33.6bn in cash in dividends, compared to \u00a35bn last year. A pensioner who bought shares in Vodafone for 185p seven years ago \u2013 they are now worth 202p after the consolidation \u2013 said: \"I'm getting half the dividend because I've got half the shares. I bought Vodafone shares seven years ago hoping I would make a profit. I can't see any shareholder value at all after seven years.\""
