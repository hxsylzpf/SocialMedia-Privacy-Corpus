  "content": "It is hard to think of many American business executives who have been detained for dissent against repressive regimes. It is more usual for them to be actively engaged in reinforcing dodgy dictatorships than tearing them down. But the brief imprisonment of Google's head of marketing for the Middle East and North Africa, Wael Ghonim has heightened the sense that the search company is an active player in the democracy movement. It is unclear what the view of Ghonim's activities are from the Googleplex. Ghonim's 12-day detention in Egypt and his subsequent release have not been obviously marked or celebrated on the Google site, nor has its logo been decorated in his honour, as it is for events such as St Patrick's Day. Ghonim was not simply detained for working for Google. His arrest was more likely to be linked to his activism in the region. However, Ghonim's activism is likely to have met with approval from Google's new chief executive and co-founder, Larry Page. Ghonim's detention was the second time Google had hit the headlines in relation to Egypt. The first time was the company's development of a censor-busting \"workaround\" in the form of a speak-to-Tweet service SayNow, aimed at Egyptians cut off from the internet. According to the journalist Ken Auletta, author of Googled, one of the reasons for the recent top management shakeup at the company was differences in how to approach China. Page's approach was based on vision, Eric Schmidt's was based on corporate pragmatism. Both are focused on a capitalist goal of market domination but both represent very different ways of getting there. Google's willingness to be actively associated with democracy movements and software developments that support pro-democracy activists feed into the company's philosophy of \"don't be evil\" and underwrite its mission to organise the world's information. But it also gives Google a corporate voice that takes a position, it makes the company an active ingredient in political debate. It does in fact give Google one of the attributes of being a news organisation, even though it facilitates rather than creates the news. The idea that Google will ever be a neutral player in a world where information is so highly political has always been nonsensical. Google in truth has as much a claim to being a \"stateless news organisation\" as WikiLeaks, not through secrecy but through highly distributed regional power and large corporate profits. Viewing Google in this way makes its interest in Twitter even more interesting. Early reports that Twitter was talking to both Facebook and Google about a potential purchase for the small consideration of $10bn (\u00a36.25bn) has sent media and investment communities into a flat spin. It would be an absolute disaster for Google if Twitter was purchased by Facebook. It would be shut out of the world of \"social search\", the idea that people increasingly find things out through networks of friends rather than search engines. But Twitter also has something of an authorial voice and personality, which is very much about supporting the open web. Facebook is already a part of the ecosystem of digital political support although its users are also made uncomfortable by its endless changes to privacy settings and the feeling that they lose control of their personal information the moment it is uploaded. Which, of course, is true of all distribution platforms."
