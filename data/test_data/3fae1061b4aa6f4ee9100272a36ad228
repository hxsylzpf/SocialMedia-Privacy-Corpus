  "content": "MySpace has launched a new advertising system targeted at small businesses, in a move it hopes will boost the company's profits and help it reclaim the No1 spot in online social networking. The MyAds system, which is due to go live today, allows anybody to buy advertising space on the social network. Using tools developed by MySpace engineers, advertisers can target banner ads at specific groups of users depending on their gender, age, location and interests. Chris DeWolfe, the co-founder and chief executive of MySpace, told the Guardian that he hoped the move could take the website to the next level and boost its income during a time of economic uncertainty. \"It's something that we've been working on for the last year and a half and we're ready to roll it out on a wide-scale basis,\" he said. \"There's over 20m small businesses here in the US that we're not servicing at all. It's a complete market that we think is huge.\" Pricing for the adverts, which are paid for on a cost-per-click basis, begins at 25 cents and rises depending on the scale and popularity of the targeted groups. At the moment the MyAds scheme is only being launched in the US, but DeWolfe said that he expected it be available in other countries, including Britain, \"probably some time in the next quarter\". The site will continue offering advertisers the option to buy slots based on the number of views they receive, rather than the number of clicks \u2013 its main method of generating income so far. Opting for an open advertising system in this way is a shift reminiscent of Google's AdWords scheme, the system which helped turn that company from yet another internet search engine into the dominant force in the market. \"I'm not going to make any Google comparisons, but I really think that small businesses are looking for an alternative to what's out there,\" said DeWolfe. The use of social networking information to target advertising messages also has echoes of moves made by Facebook last year to insert ads into its users' news feeds. That effort was largely condemned as unsuccessful, even though the site itself has taken MySpace's crown as the world's biggest social network. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg last week admitted the company was still looking at a number of options, but did not expect to have a solid business model for another three years. DeWolfe remained upbeat about the prospects for the MyAds scheme, pointing out that the internet has so far proved resistant to an overall slump in the advertising market. \"Advertising on the internet in general last quarter was up 8%, while advertising as a whole was down. We're cautiously optimistic that we're going to continue to hit our numbers.\" He even suggested that Fox Interactive Media, the parent company of MySpace and a division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation empire, would consider purchasing other companies and technologies \u2013 particularly if an economic slowdown lowers the asking price. \"We're always open to that,\" DeWolfe said. \"We've made several acquisitions over the last year and a half. Certainly we'll be looking at companies in the next year or two \u2013 especially as we expect valuations to go down.\"",
