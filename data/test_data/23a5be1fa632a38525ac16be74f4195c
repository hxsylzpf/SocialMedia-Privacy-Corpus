  "content": "The cost of creating a national list of addresses for the next census has risen to \u00a312m, the government has admitted. The figure \u2013 \u00a32m up on previous estimates \u2013 is the latest revelation of the true cost of \"unfree\" data across the economy. As we reported in December (ONS to spend \u00a310m on single-use database), the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has to build its own address database for the 2011 census in England and Wales (Scotland has its own parallel exercise) because none of the three existing, state-owned address databases is comprehensive enough. Without that, any hope of a high response rate to the census \u2013 already threatened by mounting public scepticism \u2013 is doomed. Attempts to create a unified list have failed because of arguments about intellectual property. The three list-owners \u2013 local authorities, Ordnance Survey and Royal Mail \u2013 all treat address lists as their commercial assets. In response to a question by the Conservative MP Eric Pickles last month, Karen Dunnell, the ONS's chief executive, explained to parliament that the additional estimated cost \"is due to a decision following successful piloting to match fully the two key national address lists \u2013 the Royal Mail's Postal Address File and local government's National Land and Property Gazetteer\". This address register will contain a list of \"household and communal establishment addresses\" for each geographic area used for the census. However, this list, which could be of value to emergency and other public services, will be used only once. After the census is carried out, the keepers of the nation's addresses will continue to market their rival wares. The sorry saga of the owners of postal address lists behaving like jealous children playing at shops is one of the longest running of the Free Our Data campaign. However, there is hope. In its draft report, the ministerial taskforce set up to promote the government's adoption of web 2.0 ideas calls for the creation of \"a freely available single, definitive address and postcode database for the UK \u2026 maintained by the Ordnance Survey, Royal Mail and local government\". However, in the current climate of suspicion about ID cards, citizens may not be enthusiastic about the proposal. Like so many problems in life, the creation of a sensible, reusable list of addresses would have been best tackled when policy-\u00admakers first thought of it \u2013 not when they were driven into a corner."
