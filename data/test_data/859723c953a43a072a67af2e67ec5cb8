  "content": "As crowds gather in central London in advance of the G20 summit, Jessica Reed and David Shariatmadari will be in the thick of the action, tweeting away. You can follow their progress in the window below, from 11am tomorrow morning. David will attend the church service led by the Bishop of London in Westminster Central Hall. Jessica Reed will join the main Put People First march at Embankment station. If everthing goes according to plan, they'll meet up at Parliament Square, before making their way to the rally in Hyde Park.
