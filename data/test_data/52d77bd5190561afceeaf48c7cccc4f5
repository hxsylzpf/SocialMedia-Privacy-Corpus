  "content": "Leading construction firms were named and shamed by an official watchdog for unlawfully blacklisting trade union activists. Construction group Balfour Beatty was prominent on the list of 14 companies published today by the information commissioner, Christopher Graham. The commissioner found that the construction industry had been funding a clandestine blacklisting operation for at least 15 years. He believes workers may have been unfairly denied work as a result of the blacklist. \"Sensitive\" personal details of more than 3,200 workers were kept on a secret \"intelligence\" database. The files recorded individuals' trade union activities and employment conduct, with warnings that they could cause trouble. Comments included \"Do not touch\", \"Communist party\", \"ex-shop steward, definite problems, no go\". Graham ruled that the firms had broken data privacy laws and ordered them to stop using details from the database or gathering covert information. A 66-year-old private investigator, Ian Kerr, was fined \u00a35,000 last month for his role in administering the database. He has since stopped running it. David Smith, the deputy information commissioner, said : \"Fourteen firms paid for personal details about construction workers without those people knowing. The individuals were denied the opportunity of explaining or correcting what may have been inaccurate personal information about them.\" Six of the firms on the list are subsidiaries of Balfour Beatty. Others include Kier, Emcor, Whessoe, CB &amp; I, and SIAS Building Services. Balfour Beatty and Emcor said they did not condone the use of \"blacklists\". Another firm, Shepherd Engineering Services, said it had stopped using Kerr two years ago \"following minimal historical use\". NG Bailey said it would be \"strengthening\" its procedures to comply with data protection laws. A confidential document seen by the Guardian suggests that the blacklisting operation was more organised than previously thought. Kerr ran the database as the Consulting Association. Its constitution shows that it was \"collectively\" owned by the companies which paid an annual subscription. It was managed by a chairman, chief executive and finance committee which met regularly. Companies wanting to join the operation had to \"meet agreed criteria covering size of undertaking and management style\". One industry executive said the firms' personnel directors gathered for annual meetings, adding: \"Everybody in the industry knew about Kerr because it was long-standing. It was an open secret in the industry\". The information commissioner found invoices from 40 firms when Kerr's office was raided in February. However, he did not take today's legal action against some of these firms as he did not have enough evidence. It is understood that some firms only communicated orally with Kerr, leaving no written record of any information they used from the database. Other firms had gone out of business. Trade unionists criticised the information commissioner for failing to mount prosecutions and for taking no action against the \"worst offenders\"."
