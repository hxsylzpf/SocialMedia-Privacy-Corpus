  "content": "The developers at Facebook have hit upon the perfect way to celebrate Adele Day. It might be a coincidence, but just as the megastar singer releases a highly anticipated album about lost love and break-ups, the social media platform has revealed that US users will have a brand new set of online options for dealing with their exes. In America, if you amend your relationship status on the mobile app, you'll be asked if you want to \"take a break\" from your ex. You can choose to make sure that their posts or tagged photos don't appear in your feed, without having to unfriend or block them, and you can ensure they don't see your new photos or posts. But the creepiest element of all is that you can request to be untagged from any old photos and status updates that include your ex. Now you can pretend that you never dated them at all! This reminds me of the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind \u2013 a chilling piece of dystopian fiction disguised as a romcom, in which the characters can opt to have their brain wiped of bad memories when they finish a relationship. The message of the film can be summed up by the famous line in George Santayana's The Life of Reason: \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" Obviously, Facebook isn't yet offering us the option of brain surgery. But the end of a relationship is supposed to be painful. If we can go online and erase the information, a part of us will never get a chance to process the pain, which means we can't heal and grow. Social media has an indisputable influence on our lives. Facebook has 1.55 billion users globally. Researchers in Denmark found that users of the site were less happy, more worried and more lonely than non- users. A Sydney University study found that women who spend time on Facebook compare their appearance with others and feel negative about their face, hair and skin after using the site. We all know that Facebook is full of people putting their best face forward, sharing news of promotions, engagements, holidays, pregnancies and pets. Hearing good news about a friend should bring us joy. But if you're post break-up and broken-hearted, you really don't want to see your cousin looking stunning in her wedding pictures, or watch an old college pal looking sunkissed and snogging her boyfriend. Online, we only ever see life highlights. Erasing your failed relationship means you can join in with this veneer of pretend perfection. But is there any point in faking it if it just widens the gulf between the way your life looks and the way you feel inside? If you airbrush your online world, your Facebook profile might make you feel worse about the life you think you should be living. After all, you've created a convincing vision of it. To be fair to Facebook, this new development is a little more thoughtful and sensitive than some of its other trialled features. Last year an apology was issued for the Year in Review feature, where users were automatically shown a slideshow on their timeline that featured posts and events from the past 12 months \u2013 and were confronted with exes, trauma and troubling images of deceased relatives. Many bereaved users have complained that Facebook's \"memorial\" feature prevents them from acting as digital executors and managing the profiles of relatives and loved ones they have lost. At least Facebook is finally recognising that there are some life events we don't wish to be reminded of. However, it also seems like a rather desperate way to keep us on social media, no matter what is happening to us. Most of us don't want the option of staying friends with an ex in real life, so why offer it online? Of course we don't want to be reminded of them. In any case, I doubt it will actually work. We know we don't want to see what our ex is up to, but seeing them in our timeline isn't usually the problem. The real issue is that it's hard not to become a social media stalker, endlessly, masochistically refreshing their profile page. Unless Facebook can introduce a \"like\" thumb that comes to life and springs out of the screen to slap our hands away, we'll still find it hard not to check up on our exes when we're online. However, if we're not logged in at all, we're bound to cheer up more quickly, and we'll have more time to spend on living an enviable life instead of maintaining a fabulous lie. I believe there's only one way to get over someone in the internet age \u2013 you've got to break up with your social media accounts. It's not you. It's definitely them."
