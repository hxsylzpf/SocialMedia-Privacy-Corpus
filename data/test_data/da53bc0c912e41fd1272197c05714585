  "content": "Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas have won their landmark action against Hello! magazine, which published sneak photographs of their wedding even though arch-rival OK! had bought the exclusive rights to the pictures. In a devastating indictment of Hello!, the judge said the \"conscience\" of the defendants was \"tainted\", that they had deliberately set out to get photographs of the couple even though they knew \"a very considerable sum\" had been paid by their rival for the wedding deal. \"There was an intrusion into individuals' private lives without consent... I do not hold the intrusion to have been justified,\" Mr Justice Lindsay said today. However, the judge specifically said their legal victory was not based on the allegations of a breach of privacy but on the grounds of commercial confidentiality under the law of confidence and the Data Protection Act. The judge dismissed nine other claims made by the couple and OK! including the allegations that they had conspired or commissioned the snatch photos or had intended to damage the Douglases. However, in a significant warning shot, Mr Justice Lindsay said that if parliament did not consider introducing a law of privacy, judges may have to. He said the fact the couple were famous had no bearing on the case. \"What they looked like was well known to the public. But that does not deny the quality of commercial confidentiality,\" he said. The fact they were public figures did not lessen their right to complain about intrusion. He said Hello! executives deliberately kept \"their eyes shut\" to the laws and if they had opened them they would have at least known \"the taking of the photographs which they bought had involved at least a trespass\". The judge said he had arrived at his decision because Hello! had breached the code of practice laid down by the press complaints commission. Hello! magazine \"broke their own industry's code\", he said. And he said he had \"no doubt that Mr Douglas and Miss Zeta Jones both suffered real distress... an aspect of their distress, which led Miss Zeta Jones to tears, was their wondering, if it was a guest, which of their guests it was that had betrayed them\". Mr Justice Lindsay said the Hollywood couple and OK! had won their case against Hello! \"under the law of confidence, as well as data protection\". The judge also said Hello! was liable in damages to Mr Douglas, Ms Zeta Jones and OK! but that these would be decided at a later date. \"An important step in my coming to that conclusion has been that, on balancing rights to confidence against freedom of expression for the purpose of granting or withholding release, I have been required by statute to pay, and have paid, regard to the code of the press complaints commission. The Hello! defendant broke their own industry's code.\" During the hearing, which lasted six weeks, Ms Zeta Jones told how she had felt \"devastated, shocked and appalled\" when she realised that paparazzi had gatecrashed her wedding at the Plaza Hotel in New York in November 2000. Hello! published several snatched shots of the wedding reception including one photograph of Ms Zeta Jones eating wedding cake. She and her 58-year-old husband had signed a \u00a31m deal with rival OK! for exclusive coverage of the event after turning down a higher offer from Hello!. Ms Zeta Jones, 33, said she felt \"violated\" when Hello! published the unauthorised photographs, which she claimed were \"sleazy and unflattering\". The Hollywood couple said today's ruling was confirmation that everyone had the right to protection from \"excessive and unwanted media intrusion\". Hello! said the rulings bore out what that have always said - \"that this case was not brought about privacy, but about a commercial deal: money and control\". In a joint statement today the couple said: \"We deeply appreciate that the court has recognised the principle that every individual has the right to be protected from excessive and unwanted media intrusion into their private lives.\" Hello! issued a statement saying it was \"enormously pleased\" that nine out of the 13 claims made against them by Mr Douglas, Ms Catherine Zeta Jones and OK! had been dismissed. \"We are all very pleased that the vast majority of the claims against us have been thrown out and that we have been completely exonerated on the question of conspiracy, commissioning unauthorised photographs, interference with the business, and above all with intention to damage the Douglases,\" said Sally Cartwright, the publisher of Hello!. Ms Cartwright added that the areas in which the judge had found against Hello! were commercial. \"He also said that the Douglases had no claim in law on an invasion of their privacy - that in fact there is no law of privacy here in the UK, as Mr Justice Lindsay feels it would be wrong for him to construct one,\" he said. \"These rulings bear out what we have always said - that this case was not brought about privacy, but about a commercial deal; money and control.\" Mr Justice Lindsay gave his judgment in one of the most publicised cases ever to be heard at the high court and which has cost more than \u00a33m in legal fees. The Hollywood couple are claiming \u00a3500,000 damages and OK! magazine a further \u00a31.75m. The pair signed a \u00a31m deal with OK! for exclusive pictures of their \u00a31.2m wedding, but the magazine's arch-rival Hello! snapped surreptitious photos despite tight security. When the couple learned that Hello! planned to hit the newsstands with a \"spoiler\" three days before OK!, they won a high court injunction to stop publication. But the injunction was lifted by the court of appeal in time for both magazines to appear on the same day. The couple sued Hello! for \u00a32m for stress, loss of income and damage to their professional careers because of the poor quality of the photos. They also claimed the privacy of their \u00a31.2m wedding at a top New York hotel was invaded by the unwanted photographer. The judge said the wedding \"was as private as was possible consistent with it being a socially pleasant event. \"The wedding was not a celebrity event and I accept Miss Zeta Jones's evidence that it was not intended to be one.\" Hello! had argued that the Douglases had taken action to keep out the press from their wedding to protect their exclusive deal with OK!. \"I see their expectation that an exclusive contract to one selected publisher offered the best strategy for obtaining a wedding of the kind they both wanted and offered also the certainty of fair coverage of it as their chief reasons for making such a contract,\" he said. The judge said that the fact that the magazines had competed to cover the event showed there was a commercial confidentiality. \"As for the Hello! defendants, their consciences were, in my view, tainted; they were not acting in good faith nor by way of fair dealing,\" he said. \"They knew that OK! had an exclusive contract; as persons long engaged in the relevant trade, they knew what sort of provisions any such contract would include and that it would include provisions intended to preclude intrusion and unauthorised photography.\" He said \"a wedding was an exceptional event for any bride and groom and I do not hold that Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones' position as public figures or as persons who had, as to other events, no doubt been tolerant of or even welcoming to publicity, as lessening their right, as any might have, to complain of intrusion at their wedding or of the consequences of that intrusion. \"It was an intrusion against which elaborate steps had been taken. \"I have in mind too that the steps taken by the Douglases were not taken solely for reward or as hype but were taken in a genuine and reasonable belief that thereby an offensive media frenzy would be avoided.\" There was no doubt that the couple suffered real distress, said the judge, and that Ms Zeta Jones had cried when she learned of the unauthorised photographs. Mr Justice Lindsay said that if the existing law of confidence was not enough to protect an individual, and no new legislation was brought in to fill any gaps, then further developments of the law were likely to be made by judges."
