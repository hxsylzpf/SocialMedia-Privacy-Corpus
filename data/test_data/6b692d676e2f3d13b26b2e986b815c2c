The app beloved of teenagers who want to send pictures of their privates to potential playmates is hosting what is claimed to be the \"world's first Snapchat travel show\". This piece of branded content from Topdeck Travel is presented by Londoner James Hill, who has more than 80,000 subscribers to his Jimmy0010 YouTube channel, and the first episode of Topdeck Snaps went live on Thursday morning, featuring Budapest. This being Snapchat, it's only 60 seconds long \u2013 but it still feels to Monkey like a crossing the Rubicon moment. As long as Caesar was in an almighty hurry.",
