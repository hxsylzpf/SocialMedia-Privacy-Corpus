  "content": "Former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie has urged his protege, Mirror boss Piers Morgan, to go to the House of Lords in the hope of overturning today's \"absurd\" court judgment in favour of Naomi Campbell. He added no celebrity should believe any \"money-grasping lawyer\", who advises them this is a precedent for a privacy law. \"He [the judge] had to find an obscure Data Protection Act on which to hang the case against the Mirror,\" he added. \"I would urge the Mirror to appeal and I think the Lords would chuck out this judgment,\" MacKenzie told Sky News. Mr Justice Morland refused the Mirror leave to appeal against his ruling, which means the paper will have to take the case to the House of Lords if it wants to pursue it further. Morgan, who rose to prominence in the 80s while working for MacKenzie on the Sun's Bizarre column, said outside the court today he was \"bored of the whole thing\" but added the Mirror would be challenging the judgment. MacKenzie said, despite Campbell's victory, today's ruling and another recent case - in which a ban on the Sunday People publishing details of a Premier League footballer's extra-marital affairs was overturned - meant \"celebrities would not be marching off to court every time\" they wanted to protect their privacy. \"My advice to celebrities is quite clear - having seen this case and the footballer's case - whatever your agent, manager or money-grabbing lawyer says, don't go down to the high court. It's too expensive,\" MacKenzie said."
