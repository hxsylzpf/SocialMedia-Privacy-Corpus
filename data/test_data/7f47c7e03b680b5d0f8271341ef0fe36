  "content": "Threatening to disclose intimate images would become a criminal offence under amendments to the policing and crime bill to be tabled by the Liberal Democrats. The clause will also criminalise individuals who disclose revenge porn images in a \"reckless\" manner, in a bid to prevent perpetrators escaping prosecution because it cannot be proved that the images or video were shared in a malicious way. The Lib Dem amendments also advocate giving victims of revenge porn the right to anonymity. The move would bring revenge porn \u2013 the disclosing of private sexual photographs or video without the consent of the individual and with intent to cause distress \u2013 into line with other laws on sexual offences. Lack of anonymity may act as a disincentive for victims to come forward, as media coverage in court cases can lead to embarrassment or humiliation. Brian Paddick, Lib Dem shadow home secretary and a former Metropolitan Police senior officer, said: \"Revenge porn is a horrific crime that has an appalling impact on victims. Victims should be given anonymity just like all other victims of sexual offences and the threat of disclosing intimate images must also be criminalised, as is the case in Scotland. \"These are commonsense measures that work for victims and will encourage victims to come forward and seek justice. I hope the government and Labour will support us and stand up for those who at the moment are suffering in silence.\" The policing and crime bill is at the report stage and will be debated in the Lords this week. Revenge porn, which carries a jail term of up to two years and a fine, became a criminal offence in England and Wales in April 2015 following a series of high-profile cases that raised awareness of the issue. Prominent victims of revenge porn include Paris Hilton and Tulisa Contostavlos.There were 1,160 cases reported between April and December 2015 to 31 police forces in England and Wales. Three victims were 11 years old. In 61% of cases no action was taken, with lack of evidence or the victim withdrawing support given as the reason"
