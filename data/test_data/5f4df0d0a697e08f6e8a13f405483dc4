  "content": "Broadcasters are contributing to \"a lot of the problems\" of so-called media scrums during large-scale news events, according to a senior Press Complaints Commission official. Speaking from the audience at Tuesday's Westminster Media Forum seminar into press regulation, PCC director of communications Jonathan Collett said: \"A lot of the media scrums \u2013 you will find that broadcasters are causing a lot of the problems.\" He added that PCC guidance issued at the height of major news events was an important restraint on this and was valued by broadcast media as well as the press. Speaking afterwards to MediaGuardian, Collett declined to name the news events he was referring to because the guidance issued by the PCC during large-scale news events is confidential and often reflects the private concerns of members of the public. But it is understood that among recent examples, the PCC issued guidance to print and broadcast journalists in July 2010 when Raoul Moat went on an armed rampage in Northumberland and also a month earlier when Derrick Bird killed 12 people in Cumbria. Collett told MediaGuardian that pre-warnings issued by the PCC are also adhered to and valued by broadcasters and that there is an \"almost 100% compliance rate\". \"We are not talking about issuing instructions, we are talking about the PCC drawing attention to the concerns, for example, of people living in the communities about the activities of journalists.\" However, enshrining the principle of pre-broadcast regulatory intervention into law was opposed by many at the seminar including veteran Panorama reporter John Sweeney, who said that the subjects of investigations already have the power to make their views known before transmission of a particular programme. Speaking at the same event former PCC commissioner Eve Salomon proposed introducing a new regulatory system obliging papers to publish their own individual code, and to report every year on how it meets the requirements. This would compel newspapers to publish its policy on \"everything\" from issues ranging from paying sources to how it uses press releases, she said. Salomon added that the post PCC-regulator should also open up its \"internal procedures\" and should consult more widely outside the industry on how to implement best practice. She said that she had no prior knowledge of the scale of phone hacking and that when the story emerged she was \"shocked\" when the \"whole level of the filth came out\". Also speaking was Martin Moore, Hacked Off founder and director of the Media Standards Trust, who said that many bloggers have better ethical standards than conventional media. Moore cited political blogger Paul Staines, aka Guido Fawkes, who he said is \"honest\" about his mischievous intentions, and blog network Gawker which frequently links to its online sources, unlike most newspapers. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
