  "content": "This week's question comes from geoffharris: A friend of mine, who is a non-EU Canadian resident, currently residing in this country, sent me the following message: \"My UK passport expires this June, and I'm going to Canada in May so I need a passport that's valid for six months afterwards. If I apply for a new UK passport now, does that mean I will have an ID card (ie non-EU biometric visa) forced on me?\" Can you help? What can she do to avoid giving her biometric information? This is surely a breach of privacy, so is there anything she can do to avoid being dragged in for profiling and tagging, apart from crossing her fingers? Isn't there a right to opt out rather than being forced to carry one? It is unclear from the question whether geoffharris's friend is a British citizen or a foreign national. As the government has decided to phase the ID card scheme in gradually there are now several different timelines for both categories. The ID card scheme for British citizens was established under the Identity Card Act 2006 (ICA). The ICA permits a large amount of personal information, including biometric information, to be held on a national identity register (NIR), which can be accessed without consent, by a wide range of named public bodies and agencies. The ICA also allows a record to be made of every occasion where information in the NIR is provided to anyone. This means that a detailed record of everyone's movements and what services they have accessed will be collated. Although it has been suggested that the ID card scheme will be optional (in the foreword to the National Identity Scheme Delivery Plan 2008 (pdf), the Home Secretary states that she wants people to \"choose how they participate in the scheme\"), in reality compulsion remains a key part of the scheme. Even if a person \"chooses\" not to get an ID card, they will still have to pay a fee and from 2012 (under current government plans) details of those applying for a UK passport will be automatically entered onto the NIR. The government currently intends that the first domestic ID card guinea pigs will be airside workers and regulations to establish pilot schemes for Manchester and London City airports have recently been consulted on. We are told that the pilot will commence in autumn 2009. As of 2010, ID cards will be issued to a limited number of volunteers and the government has said that young people, in particular, will be targeted. ID cards for foreign nationals are provided for under the UK Borders Act 2007. Since 25 November 2008 (under the UK Borders Act 2007 and the Immigration (Biometric Registration) Regulations 2008) foreign nationals, granted an extension of their stay in the UK as a student or as a spouse/partner of a permanent resident, are required to obtain an ID card. Applicants are required to provide their biometrics (fingerprints and photograph), which are checked against existing records and then stored on the NIR and within the microchip card. As of 31 March 2009, the requirement to obtain an ID card was extended to seven other categories of non-EEA nationals applying for leave to remain or for a transfer of existing conditions. The immigration categories now covered include: postgraduate doctors and dentists; academic visitors granted leave exceeding six months; visitors for private medical treatment who extend their stay; domestic workers in a private household; commonwealth citizens with UK ancestry; retired persons of independent means and overseas employees recruited by an overseas company to act as their sole representative in the United Kingdom. The main concern with the ID card scheme relates to the NIR and the privacy implications that flow from having millions of individuals' personal data contained in one multipurpose database. Basic details such as name, gender, place and date of birth must be provided when applying to be entered onto the NIR. More intrusive data, such as current and previous residential status and, under proposed regulations, whether a person is subject to a court order preventing her/him from travelling or whether s/he owes money to the United Kingdom for repatriation or any other form of consular relief will also be included. The act is also riddled with reserve powers allowing the Secretary of State to extend the scope of the NIR by parliamentary order. Liberty has consistently warned that it is inevitable that the type of information stored and the purposes for which ID cards shall be required will expand with time. The last time the UK had ID cards was during the second world war and its aftermath. At the time it was introduced (two days after the beginning of the second world war, using emergency legislation) there were only three purposes for the ID card (conscription, rationing and national security). By 1950 this had mushroomed to 39 different functions. Liberty has long argued that the introduction of ID cards and the creation of the NIR symbolise a shift in the approach of the state towards the collection of information: a move away from a society where information is not shared unless necessary, towards one where it will be shared unless there is a reason not to. Debate the law in the comments below, and post your query for Liberty's lawyers in the Liberty Clinic open thread.",
