  "content": "Ever since my band the Dumb Waiters (we were dreadful) split acrimoniously in 1982, I've had too few chances to rock out or get funky. But Steve, Graeme and I have only had Guitar Hero 5 out of its box for five minutes and already I'm fulfilling one of my minor childhood dreams \u2013 I'm playing Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter's guitar break from Steely Dan's Do It Again. Or rather, I'm not. Instead, I'm trying to match the notes that are scrolling on a virtual fretboard across the TV screen in front of me to six coloured buttons on the pretend fretboard of a small plastic \"guitar\". What is coming out of the TV speaker is pure Skunk, but what I'm doing is so easy that it reinforces my prejudice about computer games: they are created for lame-ass invertebrates who can't hack the real world (no offence). Admittedly, I've selected the beginner's level, but still. The experience flatters my ego for a moment, but leaves me with the nagging sensation that I'm cheating. And that I'm cheating nobody as much as myself. My case against computer games runs like this: we don't have the dedication any more to do difficult things such as learn Arabic, cure cancer, read War and Peace in the original Russian, understand quantum physics or boss tricky early 70s MOR West Coast guitar solos. But handily, capitalism makes it seem as if we are achieving things when really we aren't. The ease with which I play Steely Dan's lead guitar on Guitar Hero 5 seems of a piece with the barmy fact that the worldwide market for virtual goods for online computer gaming is expected to hit $5bn (\u00a33.08bn) by the end of the year. This, incidentally, is the sum that Morgan Tsvangirai estimated would be necessary to rebuild Zimbabwe. But we don't want to rebuild Zimbabwe, not really: we'd prefer to spend our money on things that don't really exist, such as a 9mm computer simulation of a pistol for Facebook's Mafia Wars game (cost $10). Actually, we're worse than I feared: we can't hack it in the real world, and we can't hack it in the virtual world either. Recently, a 23-year-old hacker was arrested for stealing players' identities, skills, weapons and virtual money in RuneScape, a medieval fantasy game played by more than 100 million gamers worldwide. If there is a better symptom of the decline of civilisation, let me know. Don't give me that innocent look. We're all doing it \u2013 playing BlackBerry BrickBreaker, iPod Parachute, Facebook Scrabble,and pre-ordering Winter Sports 2010: The Great Tournament for the family Wii as part of a pitiful new year's resolution to get fit. Even our greatest sports stars are happier winning in cyberspace than in the real world. It was reported that Andy Murray and his girlfriend split up because he played PlayStation 3 for seven hours a day. \"I have played a lot of tennis on PlayStation 3 games,\" he said earlier this year. \"I've won all the tour events and Wimbledon a few times. Unfortunately, it's a bit easier on a computer than winning Wimbledon for real.\" Here's a prediction: Murray will never win real Wimbledon, not with that mindset. But perhaps these ill-founded prejudices need to be exploded like a (frankly offensive) stereotypical Arab terrorist in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. After all, billions of people around the world play videogames and not all of them \u2013 surely \u2013 can be acne-ridden sociopaths who will post intemperate responses to this article in the blogosphere lickety split (again, no offence). Steve Boxer, a computer games journalist, is helping me to think again. \"This is such fun!\" he says, as we play Nirvana's About a Girl. I'm Kurt Cobain biffing out dismal chords, Graeme the photographer is gamely struggling to keep pace with Dave Grohl's lolloping stick technique, while Steve is Nirvana's bassist. When we manage to hit 86% of the right notes I feel a glow of achievement. Then we're Blondie playing One Way or Another, and it all goes wrong. The virtual crowd is booing and the Debbie Harry on screen is looking at my on-screen guitarist with contempt. I've been here before: in 1982 during the Dumb Waiters' gig at the Cape of Good Hope pub. Virtual boos, it turns out, hurt as much as as real ones. It was fun. Not something I'm going to repeat but, you know, quite diverting. Now to shoot some bad guys. We strip the cellophane off Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Soon, I'm tooled up with rifle and sidearm and I've murdered several innocent children in place of the Arab-looking terrorists who were my targets. A virtual American sergeant major is giving me GBH of the earhole. There doesn't seem to be a way to turn either of those weapons on him or my virtual self, though it would be better for the wellbeing of everyone in this virtual world if I did. Next, having told the game that I'm not easily offended, I receive another mission: I am a CIA agent tasked with killing civilians at an airport. I didn't realise until that moment how accurate a simulation of real war Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 could be. Ever since Baudrillard wrote The Gulf War Did Not Take Place in the early 1990s, it has been commonplace to suggest that wars will be fought like videogames. In this context, perhaps it's no surprise that the Royal Navy is issuing PlayStations to sailors to encourage them to study at sea. Inadvertently killing children in cyberspace has been a challenging experience, but again this immersive shoot-'em-up isn't something I want in my life for more than a morning. So I try a different computer-game challenge: I spend an evening with Kate, a work colleague, who shows me how to play World of Warcraft. WoW \u2013 as it's known \u2013 is the world's most most-subscribed massively multiplayer online role-playing game, with 11.5m subscribers worldwide. If you pay \u00a39 a month you can join them \u2013 and if you buy expansion packs the experience can be even richer. I've not met Kate previously and, such is my ignorance about the demographic of WoW's devotees, I'm worried she'll cut off my face and wear it as a trophy once I get round to her place. To make that less likely, I offer to bring snacks. But what snacks should one buy for a woman who has a level 36 WoW fire gnome mage? (She seems happy enough with M&amp;S stollen slices.) Hold on, you say. What, is a mage? It is a caster of spells, who can teleport, conjure up food and drink, and lots of other stuff. You find mages all over Azeroth, the virtual world that teems with feuding sub-Tolkeinesque critters. Bet you wish you'd never asked. But World of Warcraft seems expressly designed to contradict my \"videogames don't need dedication\" theory. \"It's easy to learn but difficult to master,\" says Kate. She lends me WoW's official strategy guide, which is as thick as a phone directory and only slightly less baffling than my guide to German idioms. WoW is light years ahead of the games that blighted my youth. Black and white Tetris, Frog Crossing, the blip! blip! blip! of Binatone TV Master tennis! Remember Maelstrom? I do: I shot at space boulders through most of the late 80s to earn points so I could go to the next level and shoot more space boulders. Talk about Sisyphean. Happy \u2013 though spiritually worthless \u2013 memories. Sam Leith wrote in this paper recently that WoW resembled Chartres cathedral. It is, he argued, \"a supreme work of art that is, on a brick-by-brick basis, the creation of hundreds of artisans and craftsmen, many of whom will be long gone by the time it comes to completion\". The parallel \u2013 in terms of the vast collaborative, often anonymous, artisanal enterprise that is WoW \u2013 is well made, but a supreme work of art? \"It is very beautiful,\" agrees Kate, directing me to a snowy landscape where her mage is slaying a tiger. I'm not sure: to me it is clunkingly rendered characters in a landscape you'd laugh at if it appeared in an art gallery. But I've been wrong before. There's more to this WoW than alleged beauty. It offers a communal experience and a chance to meet like-minded real people. \"One of the attractions for me is that WoW's a great social-networking site as well as a great role-playing game,\" says Andrew, my IT consultant friend. \"I know so much about people in my World of Warcraft guild. [Guilds allow members to go questing in groups, strategise about how to collaborate on a slaying a giant and chat about real-world stuff.] \"One guy in my guild and I sat in a WoW pub and he told me all about his divorce. We really bonded. I don't know what he looks like or what he does in the real world. But in WoW he's a warlock who throws frost at his enemies.\" Kate helps me create a WoW character. Daph is a rogue blood elf named after Kate's cat. We tried Daphne, but somebody else had already taken that name. Don't mess with Daph, WoWsters, yeah? She may sound nelly, but she's got an eviscerating knife with your name on it. Daph's first task is to slay eight mana wyrms (note spelling), which she does with aplomb. Daph collects things from her victims' corpses (tiger meat, tools, food) to trade at the virtual pub later on. I could buy Daph goods on eBay to use in WoW (cheat codes for example), but I don't roll that way. And the virtual economy isn't, as I'd thought, just aimed at making it easier to cheat, but actually enriches the experience. Kate readily agrees that WoW is as immersive an experience as a good novel or film. But she gets a kick out of something that novels and films don't offer \u2013 killing pretend adversaries and completing quests. The appeal of the latter, is something I don't get yet. \"Some evenings I'd sit down at 10pm and think I'll just do one quest and then I get sucked in and it would be 3am and I'd have completed five or so overlapping quests. It's very satisfying.\" What other games does Kate enjoy? \"I loved Grand Theft Auto IV.\" Isn't it violent and sexist? \"Running over prostitutes and taking money from them is fun,\" says Kate. \"It's just a game. I'm not violent or sexist in real life.\" In the future, computer and video-gaming is likely to be even more of a pernicious time-suck for more people than ever before because of two developments. This time next year you'll be able to play videogames on television thanks to Playcast, a British company that plans to offer up to 20 games on a channel that you subscribe to as you would with a film channel. But that development dwindles into insignificance beside the release next year of Project Natal. It is a 9in box of tricks being developed by Microsoft that uses several cameras, plus a microphone and lots of software, to track the gamer's body and interpret their voice. You move your hand, and the character \u2013 who will look like you \u2013 moves their hand. It's similar to the motion-capture technology that the Hollywood director Robert Zemeckis has been using on the films Beowulf and A Christmas Carol. More importantly, it delivers the dream that gamers have fantasised about since the 1982 film Tron, in which the hero hacker (Jeff Bridges) was digitally broken down into a data stream and reconstituted into the 3-D graphical world of computers. Thanks to Microsoft, we may soon be able to choose a similar fate. Project Natal will, quite possibly, be the next step on the road to transhumanism and further demonstrate our decadent desire to get away from the real world. But, like most of the games I've played, it will probably give us a lot of unjustifiable fun too. Already I can see one application for Project Natal. I'll be able to reform Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes by digitally reconstituting myself in Teddy Pendergrass's place and singing The Love I Lost before a booing crowd of virtual fans. Clearly this would be another symptom of the decline of civilisation but, truly, it would be the fulfilment of a dream.",
