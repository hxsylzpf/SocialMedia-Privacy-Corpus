  "content": "The most brilliant shows come from the simplest ideas. For Rob Thomas, creator of Veronica Mars, it all started with the image of a teenage girl in a car spying on a motel, feeling impossibly jaded about love. From there was born one of the great teen shows of all time, a drama about a high school Philip Marlowe determined to discover the truth behind her best friend's murder. Its arrival was perfectly timed. By September 2004, fans of witty teen shows with strong female characters were in need of something to fill the Buffy-shaped hole in our lives. Ms Summers had slain her last vampire the previous May and television was a duller place for it. Enter the tiny, blond and very angry Veronica Mars: daughter of the town's disgraced former sheriff, best friend to the murdered Lilly Kane and popular girl turned town pariah. As the tough but loyal Veronica, Kristen Bell, best known at that point for a brief but memorable turn in Deadwood, gave us a heroine for the ages, both witty and wounded, as ready with a dirty quip \u2013 \"You got a trophy for a rim job?\" \u2013 as she was handy with a Taser. Nor was she the only outstanding cast member: Jason Dohring gave \"obligatory psychotic jackass\" and collector of inspirational phone messages Logan Echolls showed a touching vulnerability behind the sarcasm and smirks. Percy Daggs made the sweet-natured Wallace Fennel more than a mere sidekick, Amanda Seyfried stole every flashback she appeared in as naughty, knowing Lilly Kane, and Enrico Colantoni imbued Veronica's dad Keith with just the right amount of down-to-earth charm. It was a surprisingly dark show. \"You wanna know how I lost my virginity? So do I,\" remarked Veronica in a voiceover during the first episode as a series of flashbacks unveiled a terrible story of privileged teens, spiked drinks and rape. Later episodes dealt with predatory teachers and relationships gone sour, while most of Veronica's classmates had unpleasant secrets, from physical abuse to oppressive parents to hide. Set against that darkness was the brilliance of Veronica's relationship with Keith. Probably the coolest father in television history, Keith Mars might occasionally vanish to solve cases out of state and clearly struggled with food products that weren't processed and bright orange, but he's also supportive, affectionate and just the right mixture of protective and piss-taking. The heartfelt, complicated and honest relationship between Keith and Veronica grounded the show, giving the audience something to root for in a shifting world where nobody was entirely what they claimed. Underneath the lies and subterfuge was a world that felt real. The quest to find Lilly's killer was perfectly paced over 22 episodes, and the murderer's unveiling was both logical and satisfying. A second season was more erratic and network meddling butchered the third, which additionally suffered from the age-old curse of teen dramas: the arrival of university. But at its best Veronica Mars was entirely addictive. Those who love it do so passionately, which is why it took fans less than 24hrs to raise $2m for the long-mooted Veronica Mars movie on Kickstarter. Can it possibility be as good as that glorious first season? I'm doubtful, but it will be wonderful watching them try."
