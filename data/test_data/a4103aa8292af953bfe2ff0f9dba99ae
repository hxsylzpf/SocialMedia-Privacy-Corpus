  "content": "The News of the World and the Sun have paid England footballer Ashley Cole more than \u00a3100,000 in damages for falsely suggesting that he was involved in a \"gay orgy\", according to sources. The Sunday tabloid yesterday printed a page three apology to the Arsenal star and Choice FM DJ Ian Thompson, known as DJ Masterstepz, after an out of court settlement with both men, despite not naming either man in its stories. The total damages to Cole and Masterstepz have not been disclosed, but MediaGuardian.co.uk understands the footballer will receive at least \u00a3100,000 plus costs. The News of the World, which, like the Sun, is owned by News International, published articles on February 12 and February 19 about two Premiership football stars and a DJ involved in a \"gay orgy, who had used a mobile phone as a \"gay sex toy\". Between those dates, the Sun, which also did not name either man, printed several suggestive stories about Cole with frequent references to mobile phones. The News of the World said in its apology: \"We are happy to make clear that Mr Cole and Masterstepz were not involved in any such activities. We apologise to them for any distress caused and we will be paying them each a sum by way of damages.\" The News of the World and the Sun also agreed to pay the two men's legal fees. In its apology, the News of the World said it printed a photograph of Cole and Masterstepz with the February 19 story, adding: \"Although the photograph was pixillated, some readers understood Mr Cole to have been one of the footballers and Masterstepz to have been the DJ concerned.\" Cole and Masterstepz took the News of the World and the Sun to court for libel after an internet website, PinkNews.co.uk, claimed the pixillated photograph matched a photograph of Cole and Masterstepz. News International apologised for its libel, but was not required to apologise for three other claims that formed part of Cole's case, involving breach of data protection, harassment and invasion of privacy. The Sunday newspaper ended its apology with a reference to the England team's progress in the World Cup, saying: \"We wish Mr Cole the very best of luck in today's match against Ecuador.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
