  "content": "Parents are using social networking sites to form online campaigns targeting school staff, teachers will warn this week. Members of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) say they are alarmed at the detrimental effect the sites can have on those working in education, from incidents of harassment to pupils wanting to be their \"friend\" online. One told of a headteacher who had been suspended after allegations were made about him, and discovered that a group of parents had formed a group \"to further slur his name\" and seek support to have him sacked. \"After some months, he is still suspended,\" the ATL member said. In other cases, pupils who were annoyed with teachers set up online groups cruelly mocking them, to \"get their own back\". Executive committee member Alison Sherratt, who is backing a motion at the union's conference this week calling for teachers to get advice on the perils of social networking, said that in one incident a female teacher found that an ex-student had created a group for people to join if they thought she was \"still a virgin\". \"She was very unhappy and upset,\" Sherratt said. In a survey for the union, one member said they and several colleagues had been distressed by comments made on websites inviting pupils to rate their teachers, with one falling ill as a result. \"The comments are anonymous and therefore there is no way of controlling them \u2026 [even though] the person making the comments can be doing this for malicious reasons,\" the member said. Others voiced concerns that children as young as 10 or 11 were using social networking sites and posting photographs of themselves in their school uniform. Another was worried about primary school children chatting online with older children, including those in the sixth form. One told how a student had developed an online profile in which they pretended to be a member of school staff. \"I and several colleagues added this person and had them as a friend for several months until said person started to send sexually inappropriate comments to another colleague,\" the teacher said. A number of members spoke of the problem of pupils \u2013 and their parents \u2013 wanting to become their friends on Facebook. \"I really don't want their parents \u2013 many of whom I have met only briefly at parents' evening \u2013 wanting to be my friend and then having access to my private life,\" one said. One pupil got a warning from the police after downloading photos from a school website, doctoring them to include homophobic references and uploading them to the Bebo networking site. Sherratt said the motion had first been proposed by a group of newly qualified teachers concerned by the problems social networking sites could cause them. \"The government is expecting us to use more and more ICT,\" she said. \"We want to really pick up some guidance for our members.\""
