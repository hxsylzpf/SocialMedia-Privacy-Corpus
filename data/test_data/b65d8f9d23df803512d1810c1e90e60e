  "content": "It was budgeted to cost \u00a3300m, but the final bill is now likely to be \u00a3800m. It will house the most powerful computing facility in Europe and will be home to more than 4,000 linguists, mathematicians, computer wizards and what the Security Commission has described as \"staff with esoteric specialisms\". Welcome to the \"doughnut\", the space-age new headquarters of GCHQ, Britain's most powerful intelligence gathering agency. Encouraged by its biggest budget increase since the end of the cold war, GCHQ, is preparing to move into the bombproof circular building with a hole in the middle next year. The new four-storey signals intelligence centre, built on a 176-acre site in Cheltenham, is 70ft high and more than 600ft in diameter - easily big enough to hold the Royal Albert Hall. Surrounding the structure are spaces for 1,750 cars and 200 bikes in concentric rings. With some 3,000 signals specialists from the armed forces also seconded to GCHQ, the agency is now launching a recruitment drive for extra civilian experts. Indeed, so fast is it growing that the new building will be too small to house them all. Some will continue to work at GCHQ's old network of buildings on the outskirts of the Gloucestershire town. GCHQ takes up the lion's share of the \u00a31bn-plus annual budget of the three security and intelligence services, including MI5 and MI6. Its task, according to the 1994 Intelligence Services Act, is to \"to monitor or interfere with electromagnetic, acoustic and other emissions\". In a word, eavesdrop. At the centre of its phenomenal snooping capability is a computer system of vast complexity. \"GCHQ harnesses cutting edge technology, not only in terms of its ability to intercept intelligence across a broad spectrum of communication systems, but also in its ability to process that data effectively,\" the agency states. Intelligence sources say GCHQ has the capacity to intercept every mobile phone in Britain. To avoid codebreakers and transcribers from being submerged by an overload of information, GCHQ and its partner eavesdropping agencies have developed a computer, called Dictionary, which automatically searches through millions of intercepts for key words and numbers its handlers feed into it. What the agency's publicity does not make clear is the extent to which it is not really a master of its own destiny. A confidential staff manual leaked to the Guardian makes clear that its budget - over which parliament has no control - is determined in part by US intelligence requirements. The manual, called Strategic Direction Summary, says that GCHQ's contribution to the \"UKUSA intelligence relationship\" must be \"of sufficient scale and of the right kind to make a continuation of the sigint (signals intelligence) alliance worthwhile to our partners\". It adds: \"This may entail on occasion the applying of UK resources to the meeting of US requirements\". Mark Urban, in his book UK Eyes Alpha, quotes an intelligence officer as saying: \"When I went there, I thought of GCHQ as a great British institution. But the managers themselves told us that 95% of all sigint handled at GCHQ is American.\" The relationship between GCHQ and NSA raises fundamental constitutional issues, about both sovereignty and the use of taxpayers' money, which successive British governments have refused to face. At first, GCHQ and America's National Security Agency, to which it is tied by an umbilical cord, concentrated on military and diplomatic targets, including Soviet and Chinese missile tests. They still play a valuable role monitoring missile programmes and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. GCHQ has also devoted more resources to countering terrorism and serious crime. For example, it played a key role in the seizure of cocaine in 1996 at Heathrow airport - a success attributed at the time to customs officers. The agency has a special unit devoted to Northern Ireland, intercepting communications within the territory as well as those between the province, mainland Britain, and the Republic. This, combined with computers recording car numbers and personal details, help, as Tony Geraghty put it in his book, The Irish War (which the government tried to suppress), \"provide total cover of a largely innocent population\". The Intelligence Services Act extended GCHQ's remit, originally limited to international - foreign - targets, to include \"the prevention and detection of serious crime\". Subsequent anti-terrorism laws have further increased its powers, without adequate independent monitoring or accountability. Even the government admits safeguards included in legislation can be overriden. Staff of GCHQ admit that whatever the law says, it cannot be enforced. Legislation simply cannot keep up with developments in intrusive technology. Dennis Mitchell, a senior cryptanalyst who resigned from GCHQ in protest at the Thatcher government's ban on unions there in 1984, told the Guardian: \"GCHQ is an industrial complex. Its product is intelligence. Intelligence imparts power, power which may be used to withstand a threat - or to apply one to avert an ill, to bestow a benefit - or to exploit. Intelligence shared is power shared. Intelligence withheld confers power over the unaware. GCHQ provides power to the British government and governments with which it is allied. GCHQ staff have a moral responsibility, both corporate and individual, for the use to which that power is put\". \u00b7 Richard Norton-Taylor is The Guardian's security editor."
