  "content": "According to a survey by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, more than half of all American kids between 12 and 17 use online social networking sites such as MySpace or Facebook. What this means is that they inhabit a parallel universe to that in which their parents dwell. If you doubt that, consider the interpretation of 'friend' in the two universes. In the real world, a friend is someone with whom one has a meaningful relationship; the term implies affection, commitment, emotional interaction. In the online social networking world, a 'friend' is just about anyone who gets in touch with you. Thus Tom Anderson, the founder of MySpace, had - as of 9.42am on Friday 30 March - 167,144,385 'friends'. This is not because he is exceedingly sociable, but because anyone who signs up on MySpace automatically becomes one of Tom's friends. By the time you read this, he will have another 500,000. (MySpace is adding 250,000 users a day.) The MySpace concept of a friend may seem contrived, but is much closer to what a businessperson would describe as a 'contact'. This may be why the corporate world is gazing anxiously at the social networking phenomenon and wondering if it has anything to offer. Two studies - by Forrester Research, a market research firm, and McKinsey, a consultancy - offer conflicting views. The Forrester study, conducted last December, involved quizzing 119 chief information officers (CIOs) in mid-size and larger US companies. It indicated that Web 2.0 developments are being widely introduced into companies, with 90 per cent of respondents having adopted at least one of six prominent Web 2.0 tools - blogs, wikis, podcasts, RSS, social networking, and content tagging - with over a third already using all six of them. The study also found that CIOs saw 'relatively high business value' in RSS (the syndication systems used in the blogging world), wikis (user-editable websites) and tagging, but relatively low value in social networking and blogging. Which is what one would expect. CIOs are control freaks: they have to be because their jobs involve keeping vital IT systems up and running. They don't like innovation, especially of the sort that allows employees to do things that aren't in the company manual - which is what Web 2.0 is all about. But then came the McKinsey study, conducted in January, based on a survey of 2,800 executives (not just CIOs) in a number of countries. It found strong interest in many Web 2.0 technologies, but much less widespread adoption. McKinsey also looked at six Web 2.0 tools and found that social networking was the most popular, with 19 per cent of companies having invested in it. Two surveys, two contradictory findings. It brings to mind the judge who interrupted FE Smith, the famous Edwardian barrister, in the course of an extended rant. 'Mr Smith,' he said, 'You have been going for two hours and we are none the wiser'. 'No, your honour,' replied Smith, 'but you are much better informed.' Spaced out by Rupert 'MYSPACE' is also a bit of a misnomer. It implies a tiny slice of cyberspace that is all yours, but of course it isn't; it belongs to Rupert Murdoch. The BBC's online commentator, Bill Thompson, illustrates the distinction with the analogy of a public park versus a shopping mall. You can do your own thing (within the law) in the former, but do it only at the proprietor's pleasure in the latter. So it is with MySpace - as Tila Tequila, a singer who is one of the site's most visible users, discovered. She had attracted attention by linking to more than 1.7 million friends on her MySpace page. The New York Times reports how, in an attempt to promote her first album, she added to the page a new music player and music store, called the Hoooka, created by an LA-based start-up. MySpace users listened to her music and played the accompanying videos 20,000 times over one weekend. But the Hoooka disappeared on the Sunday after her oldest 'friend', the aformentioned Anderson, personally contacted Tequila to object to what she had done with 'her' space. It turns out that MySpace objects to software widgets that enable users to sell items or advertise without prior approval or without entering into a direct partnership with News Corporation. So any social networkers shocked and apalled to discover that MySpace is really RupertSpace should ask themselves a simple question: why do you think he bought the thing in the first place?",
