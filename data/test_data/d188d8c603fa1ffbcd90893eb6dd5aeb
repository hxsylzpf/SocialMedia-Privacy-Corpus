  "content": "The online battle for the hearts of Scrabble players has intensified after RealNetworks, one of the official rights holders of the game, rolled out an authorised version on Facebook to rival the popular Scrabulous application. Scrabble by Mattel, which is still in trial version, has had a rather shaky start because the complex rights ownership of the Scrabble brand meant that players in the US and Canada cannot access the game. Hasbro owns the rights to Scrabble in the US and Canada, and Mattel for the rest of the world. The divisions appear to have confused Facebook users, many of whom still feel loyal to Scrabulous, an unofficial and unlicenced version that popularised Scrabble on Facebook. Scrabulous was developed by two Indian brothers, Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla, and even Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg has admitted playing Scrabulous with his grandparents on the site. Both Mattel and Hasbro threatened legal action against Scrabulous for trademark infringement in January. A RealNetworks spokesman said it had been working with Mattel on the new version of the game for several months, despite comments the firm made last month saying that it was talking to the Agarwalla brothers about saving Scrabulous. \"It is important to remember that even if we reach an arrangement with the Scrabulous owners, both Hasbro and Mattel must approve,\" the spokesman told the New York Times this week. Scrabble by Mattel has 2,436 daily users today, compared with 629,256 daily users of Scrabulous. Comments from Facebook users indicate that Scrabble by Mattel has some way to go before it meets the expectations set by Scrabulous. One US user, Elyssa LeFevre, wrote on the Scrabble by Mattel page: \"I work in intellectual property, and I boycotted Scrabulous on your behalf, yet I can't use the official beta due to my residency in the US.\" Another, Michelle Mewburn, from Australia, said she thought the game was great at first but then realised she couldn't play against friends in the US. \"Somehow I don't think the Facebook Scrabble is going to be much competition for Scrabulous unless that is changed. I think we'll stick to Scrabulous.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
