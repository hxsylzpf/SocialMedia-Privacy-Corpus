  "content": "The head of Facebook's virtual reality headset maker, Oculus, has had his Twitter account hacked, making him the latest in a long line of celebrity and tech bosses to have had their social media accounts compromised in recent weeks. The account of Oculus chief Brendan Iribe was taken over at around 7am UK time, when a tweet was sent out to his 16,000 followers announcing that \"we here @Oculus are very excited to announce our CEO. @Lid ! :)\". From there, the hacker @Lid \u2013 who apparently lives in \"Space\" and is a fan of the cartoon Dexter's Laboratory \u2013 went on to tweet at users, ridicule TechCrunch, and then chastise Iribe for using an old password: Imagine creating the coolest shit to ever be introduced to gaming and technology but using the same pass for 4 years lol... silly mr CEO! The account was apparently reclaimed within hours, but not before the hacker could tweet the following: If Brendan wants his twitter back i want a free oculus rift so i watch porn the cool way. It is unknown if Iribe gave in to the hacker's demands. As hacks go, it wasn't as bad as it could have been for Iribe, being more embarrassing than offensive. But it illustrates the importance of account security for social media, email and any other internet service. The embarrassing account takeovers, which have also included Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai, show the dangers of weak security and trusting interconnected services. Using an old password \u2013 as Iribe allegedly did \u2013 is not recommended by security experts. Strong, unique passwords and using two-step verification wherever possible are advised for keeping accounts secure lest you join an increasingly less exclusive club whose membership list also features Katy Perry, Channing Tatum, and Twitter's former head Dick Costolo as well as Iribe, Zuckerberg and Pichai."
