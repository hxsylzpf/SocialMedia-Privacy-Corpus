  "content": "As the world grows smaller, the temptation to fall back on national stereotypes grows bigger \u2013 especially when it comes to social media. Look at the Spaniards, noisily tweeting on top of one another in the corner! Check out the Brits, eager to compose that perfect Wildean witticism in 140 characters. And here are the cocky Americans, confidently retweeting their own praise. Germans in particular appear to live up to national stereotype when it comes to social media. Until recently, it was considered a foregone conclusion that Twitter had crashed and burned in Deutschland. Facebook was big, LinkedIn was a success, but Twitter, where chatting with strangers and eavesdropping in on conversations is the norm: nein danke. While Twitter had an estimated 7.5 million active users in the UK last October, Germany barely had 3.4m, most of whom were passive users. Online, it seemed, Germans were all too eager to recreate the classic pub-going experience: the Stammtisch, where you meet with your set group of friends at a set place at a set time and do your best to ignore the rest of the room. When news magazine Focus announced this week that Germans were finally cottoning on to Twitter \u2013 the site reaching a record 3.5 million users \u2013 it was met with the digital equivalent of a shrug. One blogger suggested that Germans just don't know how to deal with social media: \"What they fundamentally do not see and get is the obvious, namely that Social Media is about communication. Communication/conversation is a dark hole in German culture. For Germans, talking first and foremost means conveying information. Conversation as a bonding agent in any form of interpersonal encounter is literally a non-starter in Germany. (If you've ever been to an awkward German office party where people have no problem with facing one another without saying a word for, oooh half an hour, you'll know what I mean.)\" Most Germans will recognise at least a grain of truth in that. Even back in the late 19th century, the sociologist Friedrich T\u00f6nnies wrote in despair about the German inability to get its head around the concept of an open and interactive Gesellschaft or society \u2013 tight-knit, closed-off Gemeinschaften or communities was apparently all they could do. Few young Germans still keep up the Stammtisch tradition, though small talk can still be a struggle. I recently attended a German conference in which the last item on the programme was billed as Kommunikatives Beisammensein, \"communicative socialisation\". Or, as people might call it in Britain, \"going to the pub\". But do national characteristics really translate straight into the digital sphere? If Germans are supposedly so shy about sharing things online, how come the Pirate party with its radical agenda of openness has been such a success there, while it has struggled to make its voice heard in Britain? There are plenty of German politicians \u2013 lefties such as Bavarian Green Dieter Janecek (@DJanecek) and conservatives such as Peter Altmaier (@peteraltmaier) \u2013 who seem to \"get\" Twitter. I reckon Twitter's struggle in Germany tells less about national traits and more about German newspapers and their reluctance to engage with new media. It's remarkable that while most German newspapers have an account on Twitter, their relationship with their followers is very top-down: a matter of handing links to stories down to the masses, rather than genuine interaction. Check out the timeline even of a progressive newspaper such as the taz (@tazgezwitscher) \u2013 it looks desperately short of retweets and replies. Few, if any, big German journos are on Twitter: the ones that are are either also working for Anglophone papers \u2013 Raphael Honigstein (@honigstein), Ulrike Guerot (@ulrikeguerot) or Mercedes Bunz (@MrsBunz) \u2013 or freelancers who used to get into trouble for tweeting \"off message\". There's a reluctance to personalise journalism in the way it has increasingly happened in the UK \u2013 the bestselling weekly Der Spiegel still runs multiple bylines tucked away at the bottom of their pieces. This strikes me as a missed opportunity. Twitter, for all its sins, is brilliant for reaching out and deserves to be taken seriously as a journalistic tool. Does that mean that Germans are actually \"worse\" at using social media? In fact, it's quite easy to argue the opposite. Social media played a huge role in the downfall of Angela Merkel's defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg last year, when users created the Guttenplag Wiki to scan his PhD thesis for plagiarism. Compare that with the demise of Liam Fox in the UK, which came as a result of more traditional journalistic muck-raking. For those who reckon Twitter is only good for creating short-lived shitstorms, Germany provides a heartening tale. After it had been announced on Sunday that Germany's leading parties would all support the former human-rights activist Joachim Gauck as the next presidential candidate, a number of German tweeters started voicing their discontent via the hashtag #notmypresident. A claim started circulating that Gauck had called the outspoken anti-immigrant polemicist Thilo Sarrazin \"a brave man\". Rather than ignore the brewing storm, digital journalist Julia Seeliger (@zeitrafferin) researched the rumours and found that the interview from which the quote came was actually more complex than it seemed: a deepening of the public debate, not a dumbing down. All of which is to say that a little bit of office-party awkwardness might not always be such a bad thing."
