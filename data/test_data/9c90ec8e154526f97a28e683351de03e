  "content": "There are several ways to think about the appointment of Jill Abramson as the editor of the New York Times. One is that it represents a long overdue moment for women in journalism. It is the first time a woman has held the top post at this world-renowned news organisation. Another way is to think of it as an endorsement of the status quo; as outgoing editor Bill Keller's managing editor Abramson was regarded as a natural \"no surprises\" successor. Finally, Keller is getting out of the hot seat after eight years of strong editorial performance, largely helped by its digital presence. Abramson takes over a newsroom that is steadier than the one inherited by Keller in the wake of Howell Raines's editorship and the Jayson Blair scandal. But Abramson faces different challenges, most of which are external and relentless. In the time Keller was in charge, the Times moved into a shining sliver of a building in midtown Manhattan, complete with a core atrium feature of birch trees planted ostentatiously in the midst of the world's most expensive office space. A soaring temple to the historic economics of the news business, supporting around 1,200 journalists. It is impossible to imagine that Abramson will be expanding the forestry, but she might be compelled to get out the chainsaw at some point \u2013 as, realistically, news businesses need to scale for a digital economy rather than a distribution monopoly. It could have been that the ongoing prospect of this wearying task contributed to Keller giving up his chair a couple of years earlier than was strictly necessary. There was no pressure for him to quit \u2013 the transition was as smooth as an East Hampton pond on a still day. Despite his rather stiff and defensive persona, Keller presided over a strong editorial run at the Times . Like the BBC, the NYT's omnipresence makes its liberal heartland audience love to hate it, and despite Keller being regularly kicked for being too much part of the establishment, he did publish the WikiLeaks embassy cable stories \u2013 while the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal ran op-eds calling for tighter security around national secrets, rather than more transparency. Keller also took on Murdoch, pillar of the right, with extensive coverage of the UK phone-hacking scandal at Murdoch's tabloids. A task undertaken with such gusto it even gave the New York Times's public editor cause for concern. For Keller, after a purple patch of covering the Arab springs and leaked documents, the opportunity to leave well, rather than stay longer, must have been overpoweringly appealing. The salaries and lifestyles of editors of Keller's generation have gone, quite possibly for good, and some of the hardest and least interesting work in the coming years will be to scale down the temples of print production, which, even a decade ago, were regarded as indispensable. The fun in journalism is in the new opportunities, created often outside the establishment, and always in a digital format. The job of dragging the New York Times intact into this challenging era is going to take longer than Keller has, and needs to be a new editor's project. Although his recent columns on the shortcomings of social media and web journalism, seemed willfully calculated to provoke derision memes on Twitter, Keller presided, accidentally or deliberately, over an impressive digital era at the New York Times. It has a brilliant interactive newsroom, which is still better resourced and more cutting-edge than many rivals. Its journalists, if not its editor, have embraced social media. Star correspondents such as Nicholas Kristof publish journalism from conflict zones through Twitter, Facebook and the NYT's site seamlessly. Even the erection of (yet another) paywall was executed with great technical skill. One of Abramson's pre-coronation duties was a \"web immersion\" tour. Cynics might point out that this was cut short , and four months' observation does not a \"digital native\" make. Abramson's task will be increasingly digitally focused as the print circulation of the New York Times will inevitably continue to decline. In the era of editors past, Keller's eight years do not seem that long, but in the years to come, the exhausting treadmill of 24/7 plate-spinning that every news outlet has to perform, Abramson will need all her resilience and energy for the years ahead."
