  "content": "Chris Brown has been criticized after posting a picture of a woman who allegedly broke into his house on Instagram. \"I get home and find this crazy individual in my house,\" begins Brown's caption on the photo-sharing website, beside the stark image of a woman wrapped in a towel, staring into the camera lens. It has more than 204,000 likes. Brown said that the woman had broken the hinges off the doors to his house while he was away, presumably in Las Vegas, where he spent his 26th birthday on Tuesday. In March, Brown was released from felony probation for assaulting his then girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. It is unclear how long the woman was in Brown's home for, though he said that she cooked several meals. He said she also wrote \"I love you\" on the walls and wrote her name on his cars. \"She threw out my daughter's clothing as well as my dogs' stuff,\" Brown said. \"Then had all these crazy voodoo things around my crib.\" The Los Angeles County sheriff's department told KABC radio that deputies responded to Brown's home at 8.31pm and arrested a suspect for felony vandalism and burglary. \"I love my fans but this is some on some real real crazy shit! I pray she will get help,\" Brown said. Though he wrote that compassionate comment, Brown has attracted criticism for posting a photo of a possibly mentally ill person online."
