  "content": "Becta may be gone - or at least going, given that the government is withdrawing its funding - but it is not forgotten. If you're a Becta alumnus, there's a LinkedIn group for Becta staff, contractors and partners. Set up by Paul Wareing, it says that \"It is not a prerequisite that you have a particular view on Becta, but more that you have shareed the experience of working with or in it. \"It is expected that you will share the values and aspirations and common culture of Becta. Though not so much the official strategy of any given time as the general belief in the potential of technology.\" At present it's already got 86 members - some way short of the 240 staff (+120 contractors) on Becta's books. There will also be a website at a future date to be determined."
