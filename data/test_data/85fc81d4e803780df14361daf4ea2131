  "content": "We start this opinion piece with some late-breaking news: sometimes hotel staff take a peek at your stuff. We'll have the full story, reaction and analysis over the next 12 hours. But first, a final plea for some small measure of sanity. Our story starts in a hotel room at some undisclosed city in the US where one guest decided to leave a camera filming the goings-on in his unoccupied room. His footage \u2013 luckily for him \u2013 proved interesting, as the hotel cleaner riffled through his possessions, took a look at his videogames and tinkered with his computer. The cleaner didn't steal anything, and did clean the guest's room. Yet still more than 1 million people at the time of writing have viewed the video, while the Mail Online, AOL, Telegraph and some serial crap-mongers have naturally run the footage and extensively described the events therein. Lest you forgot since two paragraphs ago, this is footage of a low-paid American worker indulging in a couple of minutes' nosiness while going about her job. We can wonder whether the guest's filming \u2013 if it was real, rather than the almost inevitable \"viral hoax\" \u2013 was justified in the first place. Maybe he'd noticed stuff moving around and got worried about theft, or maybe he was just overly paranoid. But why do 1 million people need to see it? The ugly truth of a world in which almost everything can be recorded and shared is that, as a public, we have almost no self-control over our impulses to indulge in watching other people's private moments, whether it's a real estate agent helping himself to a chocolate bar (he was fired), footage of a cleaner taking time out, or \u2013 more darkly \u2013 trying to get a peek when footage of naked celebrities leaks out. Is our impulse to watch and to share the petty misdemeanours of strangers justifiable? Few would say that an estate agent nabbing chocolate from a flat during a viewing is OK, but does the offender truly deserve to lose his livelihood, then face public shaming \u2013 for entertainment \u2013 in most of the world's major media outlets? Our power as individuals to spy on those around us is clearly unprecedented: secret filming has, in under 20 years, gone from being a highly specialised skill to something anyone can do effortlessly. It can easily be accompanied with monitoring of electronic communications, and a whole host of other tricks, and the intentions behind it can be good: parents wanting to know about their children, or their elderly relatives. But it can also fuel our paranoia. If we film everyone, all the time, and make every slip from the rules public, that's not merely a threat to trust in our society: it's the end. If you're monitoring someone every time you interact with them, you never need trust them, and they never need demonstrate they are trustworthy. A relationship can never grow. That's sad when it's your cleaner, but tragic when it's your child: who could grow up with their parents tracking their every move? And when a parent has never adjusted to having a little time not checking up on their child, what happens when they finally stop? Is it any surprise that GCHQ and the NSA have built up such an overwhelming array of surveillance tools, hoovering up the messages of whole countries at a time, when given the chance many of us \u2013 it seems \u2013 build similar versions for those around us? We can only hope they have more self-control than the rest of us when the time comes to take a look."
