  "content": "The Obamas' use of social media to reach the American public is well documented. But a slightly perplexing Vine which is doing the rounds on social media might just signal the start of a new era in political communications. The six-second video shows Michelle Obama saying \"turnip for what?\", before nodding her head along to DJ Snake and Lil Jon's Turn Down for What. The Vine was posted as part of a Q&amp;A organised by the First Lady's office on Tuesday afternoon to promote her \"Let's Move\" healthy lifestyle campaign. The questions were collected from various social media platforms and seven of them were answered in Vine and SnappyTV videos posted to her Twitter account. This one has had nearly 6m plays and counting. Michelle's answer was in response to a question from the actor/director and online Obama impersonator Iman Crosson. American politicians have embraced Vine with much more enthusiasm than British ones. The Senate only approved the use of Vine in June last year and early offerings from US politicians were slightly, erm, dry \u2013 here it's being used by congressman Mark Takano. But with time has come a bit more wit and technical skill, like this from the House Republicans account. Or this from the House Democrats account. British politics has been much slower to get involved. The Conservative party does have a Vine account, but has posted no Vines. Same goes for the Liberal Democrats. David Cameron's Vine account is similarly empty, but No. 10 has the reasonably active UK Prime Minister account. The best UK political force when it comes to Vine is the Labour party, although it's all relative. And the overall winner in the fledgling art of British political Vines is \u2013 surprise, surprise - John Prescott."
