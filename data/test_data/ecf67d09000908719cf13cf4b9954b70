  "content": "Parents face a dilemma when it comes to their children's use of the internet. On the one hand, there are the perceived dangers, whether that means risk of contact with predatory adults operating online, \"cyber bullying\", inadvertent exposure to violent or sexual content or targeting by advertisers. Adults also agonise over the amount of time young people devote to the computer - especially in the age of Facebook, MySpace, Bebo and other online social networks. On the other hand, the internet and associated technologies play an ever-increasing part in learning - at home as well as school. Children need to develop IT literacy - the skills to enable them to operate safely and effectively in order to capitalise on the wealth of knowledge and opportunities offered by the online world. The parent who bans all online activity risks depriving their child of a tool that can enrich their education. Balancing the need for protection with the need for children to develop their IT skills is all the more difficult in an age when even very young children's grasp of new technologies routinely outstrips their parents' understanding. Earlier this year, the government published the Byron report, an in-depth exploration by child psychologist Dr Tanya Byron of the potentially harmful effect of children's use of the internet and video games. Byron, familiar to parents for her TV programmes on child behaviour, pointed out that, while technologies are opening up vast opportunities for young people, their parents' lack of confidence and awareness means they feel ill-equipped to protect and guide their offspring. Guidance for parents Byron's recommendations include the creation of a UK council for child internet safety reporting to the prime minister and a one-stop shop on e-safety guidance for parents. Websites, social networks and other businesses targeting young people online will be expected to tighten up their codes of practice, how they control advertising and to improve access to parental control software, making it easier for parents to set computers to limit what their children can look at online. The government has pledged to implement Byron's recommendations in full, but there are already steps parents can take to improve their understanding of IT safety and the online world. The Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre (Ceop), part of the UK police force, targets paedophiles who aim to befriend children online. Its Thinkuknow campaign includes advice for parents and carers aimed at helping them understand what their children do online and how their behaviour might differ from their behaviour in the real world. It explains what terms such as grooming mean in an online context, explains the good and bad sides of social networks and mobile phones, and offers a list of safety tips. Ceop recently launched Hector's World, a new online safety programme for parents with children as young as five. If you think that's too young for children to be fascinated by the internet, note that 59% of 5- to 7-year-olds access the internet at home and that 21% do so unsupervised, according to Ofcom. The charity Childnet International runs a range of projects designed to promote internet safety to young people. Know IT All for Parents, available online or as a CD-rom, is an initiative to help parents get to grips with the internet (and mobile phones) so they can understand how their children use them. It also features a set of activities for parents to do with children to generate discussion about safe online behaviour. For parents who want hands-on help, the government-funded UK Online centres across England are running \"using the internet safely\" courses, giving anyone worried about internet risks a simple introduction to some of the potential pitfalls and how to avoid them. Besides information on helping children to stay safe online, the course includes basic information on computer security and protecting personal data. Those who have internet access already can do the simple course online. Less confident people or those without internet access can go to their nearest UK online centre (they are often based in libraries, community centres or the high street). Internet safety is a hot topic for schools too, of course. Schools have a duty of care towards young people, which means they must take every step possible to ensure students are protected from bullying, violence or other harm - online or otherwise. A school's acceptable use policy (AUP) sets out what they will and won't tolerate in terms of behaviour from pupils (and staff). Certain websites and online services are banned by schools and the local authorities who host schools' internet services. MySpace, the online social network, for example, is off limits in the vast majority of schools. Where to go for help If you have any worries about this issue, ask to see your school's AUP and talk to the ICT coordinator, or whoever has responsibility for e-safety on the school's leadership team, about what is being done to ensure children learn to use the online world safely but effectively. Finally, if you are concerned about your child's use of the internet at home, there are a couple of basic rules you can follow. First, talk to your child about what they do online. Ask them to show you their Facebook or MySpace profile, so you can see how it works and what they have posted there, for example. Also, keep the computer in a family area, rather than a child's bedroom, so it's easy for you to monitor. They will be less inclined to behave rashly online if at any moment mum or dad is likely to rear up in the background to look over their shoulder. Weblinks Byron review: dcsf.gov.uk/byronreview Ceop's Thinkuknow: thinkuknow.co.uk Know IT All for Parents: childnet-int.org/kia/parents Explainer: Social networking sites Online social networks are hugely popular with young people. Some 49% of 8- to 17-year-olds in the UK have an online profile, according to Ofcom. The most popular networks include: \u00b7 Facebook.com \u2013 probably the best-known site used by teens. Users create their own profile listing their interests, hobbies, friends and favourite music tracks and can post messages. \u00b7 Myspace.com \u2013 music is the common factor that binds users together here; alongside their profiles, bands and artists have their own pages offering music and short films. Users can decorate their pages to reflect their personalities. \u00b7 Bebo.com \u2013 bright and breezy site where young people can share minutiae about their lives with lots of music and film recommendations. \u00b7 Habbo Hotel (habbo.co.uk) - virtual hotel where young teenagers can socialise with each other using cartoon figures (avatars) to represent themselves. Users can furnish their Habbo guest rooms with items of virtual furniture and adopt a virtual pet. Sites are moderated, though that doesn't necessarily stop young people circumventing the controls to indulge in inappropriate online behaviour. Lurid photographs and explicit sexual conversations are not the worst of the items posted by youngsters seemingly oblivious that, once on the internet, the material can be shared by millions. In April this year, the Home Office published guidance on social networking. The advice for parents, children and others on how to use the sites in safety was developed by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, the children's charity NSPCC, industry and other charities. The guide can be found at: police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/operational-policing/social-networking- guidance. Parents who are school governors will also find useful information in the Young People and Social Networking Services report, published by Becta, the government's education technology agency. It sets out the different types of social networking services, the benefits and risks of social networking services and looks at how educators are using social networks.
