  "content": "Paul McMullan, the former News of the World hack, was one of the most memorable witnesses to appear at the Leveson inquiry, famously telling the judge that \"privacy is for paedos\" and showing a red-faced David Barr an explicit picture of France's former first lady, Carla Bruni. Now McMullan is back to his old tricks, according to the Independent diary column on Tuesday. The ex-NoW man was apparently unrepentant when visited at the pub he owns in Dover on Monday by detectives from the Metropolitan police's Operation Elveden investigation. The Indy reports him as saying this afterwards: \"I told them there is nothing wrong with paying for information, Operation Elveden is bollocks and they should try investigating real crime instead of hanging around my pub, and they left.\" No doubt he offered to buy them a drink first."
