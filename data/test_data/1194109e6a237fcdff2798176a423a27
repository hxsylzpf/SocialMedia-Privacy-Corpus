  "content": "Harry Potter fans are on tenterhooks before a press conference in which JK Rowling has promised to lift the veil on her next venture. The author last week directed readers to a cryptic website, Pottermore.com, which says \"coming soon\" next to Rowling's signature. Clicking on two owls perched on branches leads to a YouTube video showing a countdown clock ticking towards an announcement at 11am on Thursday. A Twitter account, @Pottermore, has tweeted: \"Looks like the owls are getting ready to deliver some exciting news\" and already has more than 75,000 followers. Speculation has been rife over the announcement. The possibilities include: \u2022 An online game. This idea has gathered steam after it was discovered Warner Bros registered the Pottermore trademark two years ago, describing it as \"providing multiple-user access to a global computer information network\". \u2022 The long-awaited dictionary of the Potterverse which Rowling has been promising for years. \u2022 The launch of the seven Harry Potter novels as ebooks (the site notes that Harry Potter and Pottermore publishing rights belong to Rowling). \u2022 A social networking fansite. \u2022 A new book, which is most wished for among Potter fans. \"Maybe the stories of the next gen of Hogwarts students?\" said one reader, wistfully. Another hoped it could be a prequel to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Daniel Radcliffe, who plays the bespectacled wizard in the films, told the LA Times that \"I don't think that she will\" write another Potter instalment. He added: \"I'm sure that Jo will be writing a lot more in the coming years. I'm sure she has a lot more in her than we've read and a lot more stories to tell. As long as they don't involve Harry, I'm quite happy to buy them.\" Rowling told Oprah Winfrey in an interview last year that she could \"definitely write an eighth, ninth [and] 10th book ... I think I am done but you never know,\" but she has previously said it was \"highly unlikely\" that she would write more Harry Potter novels. On her website, Rowling wrote: \"I've got enough story for seven books and I never planned to carry the story beyond the end of book seven. I might do an eighth book for charity, a kind of encyclopaedia of the world so that I could use all the extra material that's not in the books ... we'll see!\" The author's PR company, Stonehill Salt, would only say that the project \"is not a new book\". An editor at the fansite HPANA said they had seen a \"sneak preview\" of the site \"and it is breathtaking in scope, detail and sheer beauty\". Andrew Sims at Mugglenet agreed: \"[I] can tell you that it is fantastic. I'd say more but I had to make an unbreakable vow concerning its secrecy.\""
