  "content": "\"Frat nerd\" best sums up Mark Zuckerberg, the 22-year-old Harvard dropout who looks set to become a multi-millionaire if he sells the online networking phenomenon he created after a week of sleepless nights two-and-a-half years ago. Zuckerberg came up with Facebook.com in his sophomore year at Harvard, as a way of helping students deal with the sometimes unfriendly atmosphere in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The site allowed students to create their own online identities, find out who else was on their course and forge virtual acquaintances that could turn into real friendships by stepping out of the dorm room. Other colleges joined the network, then schools, then workplaces until the site became one of the most popular in the US. After a series of approaches and rebuffs worthy of the campus dating scene, Yahoo! looks set to snap up Facebook in a deal that could be worth up to $1bn (\u00a3526m) and leave Zuckerberg pocketing $300m. If it comes off the deal will see Zuckerberg take his place in the ranks of the youthful dotcom mega-rich alongside such luminaries as Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google and the founders of internet telephony company Skype, Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis. A self-professed lover of programming - he got his first computer at about the age of 11 and never looked back - Zuckerberg is the antithesis of corporate man. He cuts a laid back figure more suited to the bedsit than the boardroom. No lover of early mornings unless he sees them as a result of having been up all night programming, he is most often seen sporting jeans and a T-shirt. Junk food seems to play a pivotal role in his culinary life, often in the early hours of the morning, and he seems to have something of a short attention span. He originally planned to study classics at Harvard, but switched to psychology and computer science before dropping out when Facebook took off. Anecdotes have him bunking off for a summer weekend in the middle of an earlier unsuccessful set of takeover negotiations with Yahoo!, to spend time with his girlfriend. With executives welded to their BlackBerry, he committed the ultimate corporate sin of switching off his mobile phone, much to Yahoo's annoyance. During a later set of talks with Microsoft over a crucial $200m advertising deal, his team is reported to have told negotiators from the Redmond-based software group that there was no point holding an 8am conference call as their boss would still be in bed. That is not to say that Zuckerberg is \"cool\" in the traditional sense. He was raised in New York state rather than the Big Apple itself. When he started Facebook he was legally too young to drink. He said at the time that friends made fun of him because, while he might have been a computer whiz, he never turned his hand to making fake IDs - the best friend of any thirsty undergraduate struggling under US liquor laws. Facebook is not Zuckerberg's first project. Early in his abortive Harvard career he produced Facemash, an online site which essentially farmed the university's online database of undergraduates and allowed students to assess their attractiveness; a service similar to the popular \"hot or not\" voting competitions which have become one of the staples of traditional media companies looking to appeal to a youth audience. It was a roaring success. At least it was for the four hours before the college authorities yanked Zuckerberg's internet connection and hauled him before a disciplinary board accusing him of a security breach. Chastised, he returned to the drawing board and after a week's programming he released Facebook in February 2004. The meteoric rise of sites such as Facebook and MySpace has caught the attention of traditional media and online players. From a standing start just a few years ago, such online community sites rank among the web's most visited domains. Last year Rupert Murdoch's News Corp swooped on MySpace while Facebook has been courted by American media conglomerate Viacom as well as Yahoo! Many in the blogosphere are wondering whether Zuckerberg is right to cash in his chips, pointing to the early bid made by Excite for a small search engine business created by two Stanford alumni. They turned it down, believing they could expand the business themselves. That company was Google. Backstory Facebook sees itself as more than a social networking site like Myspace or Bebo, because its visitors are linked by an offline connection such as going - or having gone - to the same college or high school. The fact that its nine million registered users are located in more than 40,000 college, school or work-related networks may draw advertisers. MySpace has about 100 million registered users. Last month Google signed a three-year advertising tie-up with MySpace worth $900m (\u00a3475); a week later Microsoft forged a $200m, three-year deal with Facebook."
