  "content": "First internet sites such as MySpace turned the music world on its head, enabling bands like Arctic Monkeys to become hugely popular without the patronage of radio stations or record labels. Now a new website set up by the Britart patron Charles Saatchi that aims to have a similar effect on the rarefied gallery world is attracting work from hundreds of artists every week. Described as a \"godsend\" by dealers and collectors, Your Gallery (saatchigallery.com/yourgallery) allows artists from around the world to post examples of their work on the Saatchi website together with their biography and contact details. Resulting sales are commission-free and artists exhibiting on the site claim that some dealers are already spending upwards of \u00a3100,000 on paintings without seeing them in the flesh. Since the site launched a month ago, 1,750 artists have displayed their work via the Your Gallery site and it is attracting upwards of 1.4m hits a day. The gallery owner Bernard Jacobson, one of the world's leading modern art dealers, said he had already bought several pieces through the website. He said the site was \"wonderful\", allowing him to pick up work by up-and-coming young artists that he would ordinarily miss because he is focused on higher value work by more established names. \"I couldn't do the legwork. My staff are very good but it's got to be my eyes,\" Mr Jacobson said. Painters Sacha Jafri, an acclaimed young British painter, said the role of the internet in establishing younger artists could not be overestimated. \"My work is now quite expensive and I'm lucky enough to do shows and exhibitions around the world,\" he said. \"But a few years ago when I was starting out, if I'd had this sort of exposure things could have moved a lot quicker.\" He said he primarily used Your Gallery and his own site to introduce interested parties to his work. With no restrictions on adding work to the site, the range of quality and subject matter is vast, from art school efforts to established artists whose work sells for thousands of pounds. Stella Vine, the controversial painter who enjoyed the patronage of Saatchi, said the internet had transformed the way she related to potential buyers and fans of her work. \"I wouldn't be where I am without it. It's all very lo-fi and DIY but it's exceptional,\" Vine said, adding: \"Young people want their work to be seen. In the art world, doors get shut in your face all the time. Saatchi is tapping into a spirit that's rebelling against that. \"To me, it's an honour to be up there with all sorts of people, from a 90-year-old grandmother to a student at Goldsmiths.\" Dealers Mr Jacobson accepted that there would be a lot of chaff among the wheat but said the cream would rise to the top. \"My eye is pretty highly trained. If you're a music A&amp;R man you might occasionally pass over the Beatles or Kurt Cobain, but it doesn't happen very often.\" Those close to Saatchi, who rarely gives interviews, claim that the site is partly an attempt to puncture some of the pomposity in the art world, while also uncovering future stars. This week Your Gallery also launched a companion online art magazine and blog that aims to get visitors talking about the featured work and point them towards new additions. Some contributors to the blog have begun virtually curating their own shows from the available material. And after Saatchi closed his eponymous gallery on the South Bank in London last year after a legal row with the landlord, his online presence has assumed greater importance ahead of the opening of a new gallery in Sloane Square in London next year. Your Gallery is the latest in a list of \"web 2.0\" technologies that allow anyone with a computer to become a publisher or broadcaster. Meanwhile, sites such as Youtube.com and Google Video allow users to share their home videos. Internet analysts expect those sites that can act as a filter and hub for certain niches of creative endeavour, such as Your Gallery, to become increasingly important. Musicians In the music world, Sandi Thom has become the latest in a string of artists who came to attention via a combination of the internet and initiative. After performing a series of webcasts from her basement to ever-increasing online audiences, she was signed by a major label for a reported \u00a31m and is now set to hit No 1 in the singles chart this weekend with her debut single I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker. While many artists, writers and musicians have used the web as a fast track to becoming established, there are signs that it could eventually help then cut out the middle man altogether. Just as Your Gallery puts potential buyers directly in touch with artists, the digital music distributor 7 Digital yesterday launched Indiestore.com, a site that allows bands and artists to quickly and easily set up their own digital store to sell downloads directly to fans. For sound and vision, a space to show off Flickr.com Hugely popular photo sharing site that evolved from an idea for an online community game and is now owned by the web giant Yahoo!. It allows users to upload pictures from their digital cameras for all the world or selected friends to see. Photographs can be tagged with relevant keywords to make them easier to find and organise. The site also allows bloggers to add photos to their sites quickly and easily. Youtube.com Online video repository that contains hundreds of thousands of videos uploaded by amateur film-makers, from You've Been Framed-style snafus and a proliferation of amateur karaoke to professional-looking mini films and concert footage. Broadcasters have also caught on to its popularity and are starting to use it as a promotional tool. In April 35,000 videos a day were being added to the site, with an estimated 30 million clips being viewed daily. See also Google Video. MySpace.com Endearingly ramshackle, vast social networking site, first popularised by teens in America and now a global concern owned by Rupert Murdoch's NewsCorp. It allows real and fictional posters to quickly launch homepages, complete with blog, photos and music, and link to like-minded \"friends\". Artists including Arctic Monkeys have witnessed the promotional effect of the site with Lilly Allen, musician daughter of Keith, tipped as the next big MySpace-assisted star. Now has dozens of rivals including Bebo and FaceParty and recently launched a UK-specific version."
