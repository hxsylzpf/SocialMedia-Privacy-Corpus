  "content": "Social networking websites are not just a time-wasting diversion for office workers but can increasingly be a way of running a money-making business, according to a report commissioned by MySpace from the trends research consultancy, The Future Laboratory. Nearly 3 million people in Britain have made money from their page and millions more are set to do so in 2008, according to the report, 'MySpace08', published tomorrow. The report says: 'MySpace has been the incubator of teen and twentysomething \"culturepreneurs\", a new generation of business-minded culture obsessives who generate income from arty pursuits - club nights, fanzines, handmade jewellery, street theatre, stand-up, indie clothing lines, films, street art, DVDs - that have previously been notoriously poor sources of revenue.' The Future Laboratory spoke to 2,500 people, and calculates that thanks to social networking: \u00b7 2.3 million people have found love. \u00b7 6.5 million people have discovered a new band, artist or pop star. \u00b7 777,810 people have started a new business. Women are more likely to network, averaging 22.5 hours online a week, against 20 hours for men."
