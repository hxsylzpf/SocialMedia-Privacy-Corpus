  "content": "A recent study by market research firm Nielsen claimed that the average person uses 27 apps a month, which sounds like very few considering that Apple and Google's app stores both have more than 1m apps available. The key, of course, is that the 27 apps can be almost entirely different, depending who you ask. Some apps do have mass audiences: Facebook and Twitter in the social networking category; WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Snapchat for messaging; Google Maps for getting around; Spotify for music; YouTube for video; Kindle for reading ebooks; Instagram for photo-sharing; and so on. Beyond these 900lb gorillas of the apps world, though, there is a wide selection of software that can improve your smartphone's capabilities: often replacing the default apps that come preloaded on it, from email and calendar apps to mapping and music. One of the important trends in this area is apps working better together, whether through partnerships between them \u2013 pretty much every fitness-tracking app works with a range of complementary services \u2013 or by features in the smartphone software from Apple and Google making it easier to move tasks and content between different apps on your device. A trend that's in its earlier stages is the growth of companion apps for smartwatches, usually designed to take two or three key tasks from the main app to your wrist, to avoid you getting your smartphone out of your pocket. Look for Apple Watch offshoots for iPhone apps on the App Store, and separate Android Wear versions for Android apps on Google Play. App developers also have a growing awareness of issues around privacy, from messaging apps such as Telegram that make encryption one of their key features, to controversies like recent criticism of an update to Spotify's privacy policy, which was (wrongly, as it turned out) seen as opening the door for its app to root through users' photos and listen to their conversations. App makers have to be sensitive to these concerns as apps continue to be big business. In 2014, Apple paid out $10bn (\u00a36.5bn) to developers of iOS apps, while Google paid out $7bn (\u00a34.5bn) to developers of Android apps. That money includes upfront payments and in-app purchases, but not advertising \u2013 a big money-spinner for companies like Facebook, which made $7.5bn (\u00a34.9bn) from mobile ads in 2014 alone. For anyone relatively inexperienced in smartphones and apps, this roundup offers a good starting point to improve your handset: even if you don't find 27 of them useful, several will have a meaningful effect on your daily life. Meanwhile, even smartphone veterans may find some apps in here that demand a slot on their homescreens. Lifestyle/health Moodnotes iOS (\u00a32.99) Moodnotes is a digital diary for tracking your moods, from low to high.

Installed on your smartphone at your bedside, it measures your sleeping patterns, while its alarm aims to wake you at the best time within your cycle \u2013 avoiding morning grumps. Bumble iOS This aims for a more female-friendly spin on dating. Browse and swipe right like Tinder, but if the woman doesn't chat for 24 hours, the connection disappears. For same-sex couples, either has to act to stay connected. Peak \u2013 Brain Training iOS / Android (Free + IAP) Remember when Nintendo's Dr Kawashima's Brain Training was a craze? Peak is doing a similar thing on smartphones and tablets, with dozens of mini-games designed to test thinking skills and track your improvement over time.

A proper story from Naomi Alderman keeps your interest high. Travel Citymapper iOS / Android From tubes and trains to taxis and buses, Citymapper suggests several routes, each with a projected time, with alerts on weather, strikes and other issues. In the UK, it works in London, Manchester and Birmingham. UK Bus Checker iOS / Android / Windows Phone There are dozens of bus-checking apps, but this is the pick of the bunch. Covering more than 300,000 bus stops in the UK, it's a fast way to check arrivals, or plan your journeys. Hotel Tonight iOS / Android / Windows Phone A growing number of people are choosing not to book accommodation but to pitch up and use this app on the day. Its speed and simplicity play into that: a few taps and you're all booked up. Yahoo Weather iOS / Android The weather might be grim but at least the forecast looks pretty in this app. Yahoo's weather tool isn't just nice-looking though: there's plenty of detail to dig into as you browse ahead for daily and hourly forecasts.

Hopper gives bargain-hunters an advantage again: analysing prices and trying to predict when they will be cheapest.

WifiMapper has a database of more than 500m hotspots around the world, and will guide you to them.

It also works on smartwatches for even faster access. Entertainment MixRadio iOS / Android / Windows Phone Much of the chatter about streaming playlists focuses on Spotify and Apple Music. MixRadio might be the curveball alternative though: its themed playlists are a match for its high-profile rivals. Songkick Concerts iOS / Android Songkick picks up your tastes by scanning your music collection or Spotify profile, then pings you when tickets go on sale for gigs by your favourite artists. Dangerous for your wallet, but wonderful for your ears. TuneIn Radio iOS / Android / Windows Phone (Free + IAP) TuneIn has a database of more than 100,000 stations streaming online, including all the key UK channels. A premium subscription adds audiobooks and ad-free stations, too. Goodreads iOS / Android Goodreads is a well-established community of bookworms recommending books. You can write your own reviews, check those of friends and \u2013 most useful \u2013 scan barcodes in shops to check reviews before buying. Pocket iOS / Android (Free + IAP) Pocket is the best in the \"read it later\" category of apps, which help you collect articles from a range of sources throughout the day, and save them for a time that suits you. Sensible social features help you share with friends too. Star Walk 2 iOS / Android (\u00a32.29) The best entertainment is often distinctly un-digital: staring at the night sky, for example. But Star Walk 2 is a discreet companion for your stargazing, helping you identify constellations, planets and satellites. Magic Piano iOS / Android (Free + IAP) A welcome app for anyone who ever dreamed of tinkling a piano, but lacks the skills. Magic Piano helps you play along with a range of songs, play with other people over the net, and learn a few tricks to help with the real thing. Vessel iOS / Android (Free + IAP) YouTube is a spawning ground for a new generation of video stars, but Vessel is pitching itself as the app for their superfans. Get early access to videos from popular YouTubers, and discover shows that you'll love. Social/Media Flipboard iOS / Android / Windows Phone Apple's soon-to-launch News app has been hailed as a \"Flipboard killer\", but Flipboard's features make it hard to kill. It turns your favourite topics and sites into a flippable digital magazine, bringing in social feeds too. Periscope iOS / Android Twitter's live-streaming video app seemed a bit of a novelty when it launched but it's starting to find its place, from celebrities broadcasting directly to fans to journalists reporting live from the scenes of breaking news stories. Telegram Messenger iOS / Android / Windows Phone A big theme of messaging apps in 2015 is security, with more adopting encryption technology to keep your chats safe. Telegram's appeal goes beyond its self-destructing \"secret chats\": it's well-designed and compares well with WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Pocket Casts iOS / Android / Windows Phone Real-life whodunnit podcast Serial sparked renewed interest in the spoken-word genre, and Pocket Casts is one of the best ways to browse, download and listen to podcasts on your smartphone. A wide catalogue and sleek interface impress. VSCO Cam iOS / Android (Free + IAP) Built-in camera apps have improved in leaps and bounds, but VSCO Cam remains a connoisseur's choice for mobile photography. Excellent shooting and editing tools, plus plenty of filters to try out. FireChat iOS / Android FireChat seems like magic until you have the technology explained to you: it's a messaging app that works without 3G or Wi-Fi, using a network created by the devices around you. Great for a group travelling, as well as public demonstrations and sports/music events. Google Photos iOS / Android Even iOS users see the appeal in Google's photography cloud service, which uploads your snaps to its servers and makes them searchable and shareable with friends and family. Useful if you start running out of phone space. Feedly iOS / Android RSS feeds haven't always been the most user-friendly way to keep tabs on digital news \u2013 at least, not for mainstream internet users. Feedly walks the line well between an accessible interface and features for more experienced users to drill into their feeds. EyeEm \u2013 Photo Filter Camera iOS / Android / Windows Phone On one level, EyeEm is yet another app for taking photos then applying stylish filters. But you can also add your best shots to its market \u2013 and maybe end up selling them to media and brands. Pinterest iOS / Android Facebook and Twitter hog the social media attention, but Pinterest, where people \"pin\" products, places and ideas, has stealthily become a visual way to research holidays and purchases, building your own collections as you go. Productivity Slack iOS / Android / Windows Phone Slack is a messaging service for your work spanning desktop and mobile. It's a quick way to ping colleagues. When used well, its biggest benefit is reducing your email inbox clutter. Trello iOS / Android If Slack is for messaging, Trello is more about project management \u2013 the two work well together \u2013 using \"boards\" and \"cards\" to break down projects and divide tasks between co-workers. The apps provide a quick way to make edits or additions. Sunrise Calendar iOS / Android Microsoft liked this calendar app so much they bought the company, rebranding it as \"an Outlook app\" in the process. It works with Google Calendar and Apple's iCloud too: pulling your diary dates into a clean and clear design. Wunderlist iOS / Android / Windows Phone (Free + IAP) Microsoft bought Wunderlist too this year. This to-do list app takes some beating: from individual tasks to complicated projects, it's easy to divide, conquer and neatly tick everything off. Pushbullet iOS / Android Pushbullet can be hard to explain, but once you've installed it, you'll see what the fuss is about: it pings files and links between your own devices, or to friends.

From uploading your social photos to Dropbox to saving stories from news sites, it's useful in hundreds of small ways. SwiftKey Keyboard iOS / Android (Free + IAP) One of the best apps for replacing your smartphone's default keyboard, due to its ability to learn your writing style for more accurate auto-corrections. Emoji, a range of themes and translation on the fly are also impressive. iA Writer iOS / Android (\u00a37.99) As word processors go, it looks minimalist, but that's the point: its interface gets out of the way to let you focus on writing. Designers dribble over the typography, but it's the efficiency as a writing tool that shines. Mailbox iOS / Android Currently the best tool for reaching (or at least approaching) Inbox Zero. You swipe emails out of your inbox, including making some return later at a time of your choice. For now, it works with Gmail and iCloud email. Scanner Pro 6 by Readdle iOS (\u00a32.29 + IAP) This does the job of a physical scanner well: whether you're having to print and sign PDF documents before returning them digitally, or simply keeping digital copies of documents and receipts, it's the best option. Dropbox iOS / Android / Windows Phone (Free + IAP) Your Google, Apple or Microsoft phone will have a cloud-storage service attached. But Dropbox makes for an excellent alternative, whether you're storing photos, documents or music. 1Password iOS / Android (Free + IAP) We all (hopefully) know not to stick notes with passwords over our computers. But if remembering passwords is proving challenging, try 1Password. It stores all your details, encrypted, so you can login safely and quickly.
