  "content": "Today's high court victory is a vindication for Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan, who labelled Naomi Campbell a \"lying drug abuser\" after she defeated the newspaper in a legal battle earlier this year. The appeal verdict also allays fears of a backdoor privacy law being introduced into the UK through the European convention on human rights, which was brought into national law two years ago. When Campbell won her case, lawyers said the ruling had failed to create a new law of privacy but it confirmed celebrities could rely on the existing law of confidentiality, enhanced by the human rights legislation. Mr Justice Morland ruled in March that the Mirror had committed a breach of confidence by printing details of the model's treatment for drug addiction at Narcotics Anonymous in February 2001. He said the paper only learned Campbell was receiving treatment through information obtained surreptitiously. Although the paper may have been within its rights to publish a photograph of the model in a public place, \"every aspect and detail of their [celebrities'] private lives are legitimate quarry for the journalist\" Mr Justice Morland said. Campbell was awarded \u00a33,500 in damages for the article and for a comment piece in the same newspaper, written by Sue Carroll, which branded the star a \"chocolate soldier\" for complaining about the coverage. The judge said the term had racist connotations and the article was \"highly offensive and hurtful\". Campbell argued details of her therapy, and the publication of photos of her leaving the NA meeting in London, were a breach of confidence, an invasion of privacy and an infringement of the Data Protection Act. Morgan was joined by the rest of Fleet Street in condemning the original ruling, which the outspoken editor branded a \"complete nonsense\". There was a genuine fear on Fleet Street that Mr Justice Morland would use the European convention on human rights to impose new restrictions on what the media could and could not report. But those fears were unfounded. The judge, who branded Campbell a \"liar\" when she denied in court that she suffered a drug overdose in 1997, said it was entirely legitimate for the Mirror to expose the model's drug addiction but it had breached her confidentiality by going into detail about the treatment. Mark Stephens, a media lawyer, said at the time of the ruling that Campbell had won on a \"mere technicality\" and it had stopped the attempt to bring in a privacy law \"dead in its tracks\". \"The court's ruling is that you can satisfy the public interest by telling the facts but you don't have to give the intimate details,\" he said. However, Dan Tench, a lawyer at media law specialist Olswang, said the most important part of today's appeal covered the Data Protection Act, introduced in 1998. The press thought it had secured an exemption from its terms but in March Mr Justice Morland ruled this only applied before publication. Once an article is published, newspapers must comply with the act, including the right of an individual to see what information the publication holds on him or her. \"That would be a back door, front door and through the upstairs bathroom window privacy law for the UK press,\" he said."
