  "content": "After the successful event this February, where Twitter users came together to party for charity and raised $250,000, last night they gathered again. And now we know: Twitter isn't just for nerds anymore, it is becoming mainstream. In 22 UK cities parties were thrown by volunteers and attended by twitterers and their friends. In Barnsley, which is on a mission to be the first town totally online, the Twestival started with a Twitter debate. Live updates were screened as they were posted and the debate was joined by over 30 attendees online and offline and connected people. Around 90 people met up in Reading in a Cocktail bar and enjoyed the blue Twitter Cocktails. Their first tally was over \u00a31,300 cleared for Daisy's Dream, a local charity for bereaved children. In Galway about 20 people met and raised over \u00a3400. The party in Cardiff was as well a big success, as you can see in these pictures, but the coolest team pictures were made in Cornwall. A lot of twitterers were happy to get a cause to meet offline: \"good to meet some people face to face finally - looking forward already to the next one\", posted the twitterer Fundamentals about the Twestivals. And London? Since a couple of hours the following message is all over twitter: London twitter festival ends in chaos as crowd clashs with facebook enthusiasts. Sounds like a wild night, but actually it is a hoax. The truth is, in London the twitterers partied and tweeted till the early morning. \"Drinks, cupcakes, crafts, facepaint, great people, music... wow. fantastic night.\", wrote MaryWbn. \"London Twestival was an amazing night.\", agrees the London organizer Elizabeth Varley. \"It's so great to see the twitter community in London and beyond come together for a great cause like ChildLine. Plus Newton Faulkner and The Hours absolutely rocked the house at Vinopolis!\" Twitter is a service which allows you to send 140 character long messages known as tweets. It was founded 2006 and became a huge success. Today it is one of the fastest growing online communities.",
