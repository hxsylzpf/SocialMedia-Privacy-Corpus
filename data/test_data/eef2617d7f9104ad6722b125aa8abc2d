  "content": "Cond\u00e9 Nast is launching a online lifestyle offering closely resembling Pinterest, House, replacing its House &amp; Garden and Easy Living websites. The publisher is launching House on Thursday, 13 March, which it is billing as a \"sophisticated design, decoration, food and lifestyle\" website. House will use the template of the Easy Living website, which has the look and feel of Pinterest. House will effectively replace the House &amp; Garden and Easy Living websites which will be closed. The Easy Living website audience \u2013 it had an average of 192,000 monthly unique users in the three months to the end of January 2014, according to Google Analytics figures \u2013 will be automatically redirected to House. Cond\u00e9 Nast is aiming to build this figure to 300,000 within 18 months and 500,000 in three to four years. Cond\u00e9 Nast closed Easy Living as a print magazine in May 2013 and made the title online-only. Susan Crewe, editor of House &amp; Garden print magazine, will oversee the running of the House website, which will target an upmarket readership who are \"digitally savvy, with a passion for Pinterest, design blogs and fashion magazines for inspiration.\" House will feature a mix of House &amp; Garden print content, along with original content across design, food and travel. It will feature design news, art exhibitions and photo galleries, covering everything from wallpaper designs to how people display books. The content will be produced by the House &amp; Garden editorial team and journalists who worked on the Easy Living website. Cond\u00e9 Nast digital director Jamie Jouning denied the axing of the House &amp; Garden and Easy Living websites marked a climbdown. Jouning said: \"By taking the successful design approach of the Easy Living site, migrating all relevant existing content and adding new features and ideas from the House &amp; Garden team, we have a very strong brand proposition with an established, engaged and passionate audience from the get go.\" Jouning has set an ambitious target of hitting 500,000 monthly unique users within four years. He said: \"I think it is realistic within the next 12 to 18 months to reach an audience of 300,000 and then push on to 500,000 over the next three to four years.\" \"House will become a new home for all those who regard their surroundings as a means of self-expression, in the same way they do their wardrobe, stylish entertaining or the food they cook,\" added Kate Slesinger, publishing director of House &amp; Garden. House &amp; Garden had an average monthly circulation of 120,008 in the second half of 2013. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
