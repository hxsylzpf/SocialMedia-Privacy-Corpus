  "content": "Update So what did you think? We asked for your thoughts on the new iPlayer \u2013 and here's what you told us. There were a few glitches with the new iPlayer yesterday \u2013 although, given that it is a beta (ie testing) site, that was probably only to be expected. eviebee had problems accessing the new site, and WordsmithForHire found it difficult to upgrade, in part because there \"was no clear link to the new desktop version\". \"Why has it taken me almost 2 hours to figure out how to download and install the beta desktop app?\" mjbsen said that the new player \"does not seem to include the low band-width option\" and ended up watching a programme back on the original site, while Briantist managed to download a programme shown the previous evening, only to be told he couldn't watch it until May 30. But there were also plenty of positives. The social networking elements went down well with willyg0433, pscobie, hk147 and kitsua, who had an interesting exchange with marcdraco on whether the BBC should be promoting Facebook and Twitter. marcdraco felt that the licence fee should be spent elsewhere, but kitsua thought otherwise: \"If the BBC has to cater to the largest number of people and give the people of Britain a way to connect online, then these sites are clearly the way to do it\". Elsewhere, there was praise for some of the new functionality. \"I'm pleased that I can add my favourites (such as EastEnders) so that the beta version flags up when new downloads are ready,\" commented WordsmithForHire, which the tyorkshiretealass agreed with, adding: \"Now all I want is some kind of rolling personalised 'channel' where all your programmes just play on continuously.\" And also for the content: \"They've started actually keeping their cool BBC4 Docco's on iPlayer,\" posted an excited Berzerker. But it wasn't all perfect: clearwood was mourning the loss of \"now and next\" and pleading for the function to be added to the \"otherwise super iPlayer please!\", and there were several questions raised over radio. Why can't I favourite programmes from my local radio station? asked WordsmithForHire. \"Is there a reason why radio programmes (still) can't be downloaded?\" asked SyCo. My personal favourite comments, however, came from aindreas , who had \u2013 what I think I'm being fair as describing as a bit of a cross reaction to the new iPlayer, before sheepishly posting: \"I may have been hasty. I think I may have had a facebook redesign moment there.\" It will certainly be interesting to see how the new iPlayer works long-term. Wednesday This morning the BBC unveiled the latest version of the iPlayer. So what's new? A few things: you'll now be able to customise iPlayer; share content via Facebook and Twitter; and there will be links through to the catch-up services of ITV, Channel 4 and Channel Five. My colleague Mark Sweney reports on all the added extras \u2013 and their implications \u2013 over on MediaGuardian. The site is launching in a beta (testing) mode. Which got us thinking: who better to test the iPlayer than the people who use it all the time? We'd like to hear what you think of it: so hop on over, have a play around, get some tips courtesy of Rufus Hound if you fancy them, and then report back. Is it everything you expected? What else would you improve? Post your thoughts below, and we'll form them into a kind of crowd-sourced iPlayer review later this afternoon."
