  "content": "I was about to have a shower when I looked at myself in the mirror and realised how much I don't hate myself. At 15, I finally feel comfortable in my own body, which is \u2013 quite an achievement for me because a year or so ago I would sometimes feel physically sick looking at myself. It seemed to me that I was totally failing as a girl because I was not a size eight or because I had body hair. I constantly worried about what people would think of me if they saw a roll of my fat or some stubble from shaving my underarms. I know now that people just don't really care if I am a size smaller or if I don't wax my bikini line, all that matters is how I feel about myself. Of course there are always times when I don't feel as confident and sometimes I have a little breakdown, but I have amazing friends and the feminist community helps me through it. The problem is, most girls my age feel how I used to feel. Should we feel this way? Why do we feel this way? And mMost importantly, how can I make it stop? This is why I am a feminist. I want to be allowed to love myself for who I am. I have found a great community of feminists on Twitter and through the London Student Feminist Network. Of course I could not talk about my feminism without talking about the Twitter Youth Feminist Army,. I would not be the same without them. I have met so many amazing friends, learned so much and been given so many amazing opportunities because of the Twitter Youth Feminist Army. This is why I am trying to spread the word of feminism: it has given me some life-changing personal experiences and is working towards a better world for everyone, hope for the future."
