  "content": "Alison Goldfrapp carries her camera pretty much everywhere, she says. \"I've always got it in the car with me. If I go out on a walk. I try to take it.\" Better known as a singer and the frontwoman of the duo that takes her name, Goldfrapp has become something of a photographer in recent years. Her Instagram account, with more than 30,000 followers, is an intriguing mix of strange and dreamlike nature shots, graphic snatches of buildings and artful closeups of plants and flowers. And her dog, of course. Goldfrapp has, she admits, photographed few people \u2013 mainly her partner and friends, and a handful of people on the street. \"I like that intimacy you have with the person \u2013 it's really special,\" she says. More used to being the subject of a snapshot than the person wielding the camera, Goldfrapp has been commissioned to take portraits of two artists performing at Somerset House's Summer Series in London \u2013 Jack Savoretti and Laura Mvula. She did a gig there herself in 2013, and liked the idea of becoming a performer-turned-portraitist. Did her own experience of being photographed give her any insights ? \"Being relaxed is really important. Not having too many people around looking on, things like that. Having that relationship, connecting with someone, really helps.\" She will be making two sets of images \u2013 the first taken during the day at Somerset House, to get a flavour of the venue's historic surroundings \u2013 \"and some kind of anticipation\", she adds. \"Then I'm going to be photographing Laura getting ready to go on stage, and the concert. That will be a more candid style, much more frantic. I'll be trying to melt into the background, not impose myself. It will be a good challenge.\" Growing up, Goldfrapp loved photography, poring over the pictures in magazines. \"I was a big fan of Sarah Moon as a kid and Helmut Newton. Soft-focused, dreamy images. I remember having a camera and playing about with that at the bottom of the garden, putting Vaseline on the lens to make it softer.\" She did some photography when she went to art school, often taking pictures of herself performing. \"Then I didn't touch it for years.\" She was, however, behind the look and feel of her band's imagery. \"It's part of the narrative of making music,\" she says. Goldfrapp became the most visual of music acts, fuelled by the inventiveness of its frontwoman: one moment Weimar-era severe tailoring and platinum ringlets, the next fairytale folk. There have been horses' tails, peacocks' trains and giant owls, harlequin suits and bubblegum pink all-in-ones. Visual arts were vital to the band's success, and in 2013 Goldfrapp was asked to do an exhibition, Performer as Curator, for the Lowry in Manchester, bringing together images and artists that have inspired her, including the dark and ethereal work of photographers Deborah Turbeville and Francesca Woodman, and surrealist collages by Toshiko Okanoue. You can see vestiges of these influences in the work Goldfrapp posts on her popular Instagram account \u2013 the app that inspired her to get back into photography. \"I love it. It's something that has opened up another world for me. I feel like it's great to have another creative outlet in parallel with writing music \u2013 I think that's the case for a lot of artists.\" She is in the middle of writing her new album, which should be out next year, so that is taking up most of her creative focus. \"But these things run parallel together, they work alongside each other.\" She describes her camera as a \"a shield I can hide behind\" \u2013 a protective force. \"I feel I can go anywhere and do anything when I've got a camera round my neck. On the street, sometimes I pretend I'm taking a picture of a church when actually I'm taking a picture of somebody eating a McDonald's.\" She took a short course in digital photography, but really she is self-taught, practising all the time and setting herself projects. \"A few weeks ago, I bought some flowers and ended up setting them up in my bathroom and making stills out of them.\" \"My friend who plays in the band has this amazing Chopper bike and we went out on a little jaunt. It was like being teenagers, sat in this yard. I love little adventures with a camera. I'm drawn to character and colour and shape, and making a narrative within that.\" Like her music, that's what interests her, says Goldfrapp. \"That there's some kind of story there.\" Summer Series at Somerset House with American Express, London, runs from 7-17 July \u2013 amexsummersounds.co.uk"
