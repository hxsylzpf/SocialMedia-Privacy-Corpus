  "content": "Yes, the police will soon follow you on Twitter as forces start not only to use Twitter to broadcast, but to engage with the community. Among the 40 forces or so on Twitter, West Midlands police was the first to start using the micro-blogging platform. The next step is to get interactive, revealed the force's head of press, Chief Inspector Mark Payne, at the 140 Characters conference in London today. So why did he start to engage with Twitter and what does he expect to gain from it in the future? \"We started because we struggled to engage with young people,\" said Payne. \"We thought Twitter, YouTube and social media, that was where they were talking. So 18 months ago we had no presence anywhere at all. But then we saw a mobile video of a murder \u2013 and none of my officers could access the social networks. In the meantime we totally unblocked the net, any officer can now go online. And let me tell you, we had tremendous success finding criminals with the help of social media.\" Gordon Scobbie, the assistant chief constable of West Midlands police, added: \"We had an investigation in Birmingham, and if we hadn't used Facebook we wouldn't have been successful. Another thing is that social media is a good place to explain why we proceed in a certain way. We can now explain how we act at certain events and keep the general public informed. In that way we can make sure that the public have the democratic right to be somewhere, but also explain our way of approaching something. In posting the event, that becomes transparent.\" Posting on social media also changed the way that the police deal with the press, as officers used to have a lot of control. Nowadays it's different: \"We post something on YouTube or Facebook and then talk to the local journalist. It is a very productive force.\" Payne then outlined the next step: \"We want to allow officers to talk to people in the area of social media. We want officers to talk to the public and engage with the public.\" And Scobbie explained further: \"There is lots of nervousness about social media, but I try and convince police forces that it is a new dynamic and we have to face it. Yes, people will make mistakes, officers may do stupid things, but then we will deal with the individuals. We have trust in our staff. We have got really talented people who understand how to act on social networks. We have to be a part of this. It is important.\" You can give them guns, you can give them tasers, now you can give them Twitter. Do you feel it is the right move for the police to get engaged with social media? Do you feel safer?"
