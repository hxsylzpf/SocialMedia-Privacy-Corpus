  "content": "A crown court judge today described the News of the World's story about the father of England footballer John Terry selling cocaine as a \"very, very clear case of entrapment\". Judge Christopher Mitchell made the comment as he sentenced Edward Terry, who faced a maximum 14 years in prison, to a suspended prison term of six months at Basildon crown court. He was also ordered to do 100 hours of community service and pay \u00a395 costs. \"It is a very, very clear case of entrapment solely to create a newspaper story,\" Mitchell told the court, as he spared Terry from a prison sentence. \"The facts in this case are highly unusual. In fact the offence was actually created by the actions of the newspaper sending a journalist to set you up. It is clearly an entrapment case and the only reason they did this was to create a story because of your connections to a well known footballer,\" the judge added. A News of the World spokesman defended the paper's story, describing the sentence as \"disgracefully lenient\" and a \"green light to dealers\". \"'Judge Christopher Mitchell insists that our investigation was 'entrapment solely to create a newspaper story'. Absolutely not so. We investigated Terry based on information received,\" the spokesman said. \"Terry pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing not to an offence of possession, but to supplying a seriously addictive and dangerous class A drug. He must have been astonished to escape with just a suspended sentence and community service.'' Terry, 56, of Chafford Hundred, Essex, admitted supplying 3.5 grammes of the class A drug to a News of the World journalist, who was posing as a chauffeur, last November. \"Employees of a national newspaper decided to mount what was in effect a sting operation against Mr Terry to ascertain whether he could or would supply class A drugs,\" prosecutor Paul Scothern told the court. The court also heard that the News of the World reporter, Dan Sanderson, had befriended Terry at a wine bar he frequented near his home in Essex, Unit 4, over a six-week period. On 5 November last year, Sanderson, who was posing as a chauffeur, asked Terry where he could buy cocaine for his boss and his friend. Terry said he could supply it and agreed a fee of \u00a3120 and also asked for \u00a340 for facilitating the deal. He left Unit 4 and returned about 15 minutes later with the cocaine, which he handed over to Sanderson in the wine bar's toilet. His lawyer, Neil Saunders, told the court: \"Mr Terry would not have acted in the way he did and committed this offence but for being enticed by the journalist who befriends Mr Terry, meets with him on a couple of dozen occasions at the minimum, simply for a tabloid story.\" John Terry was stripped of the England captaincy in February after a superinjunction preventing newspapers reporting allegations that he had had an affair with an ex-girlfriend of his former Chelsea team-mate Wayne Bridge was overturned. The superinjunction was originally imposed to prevent the News of the World publishing a story. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
