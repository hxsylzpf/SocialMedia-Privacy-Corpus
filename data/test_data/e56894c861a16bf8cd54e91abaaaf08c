The code would be an updated and more concise version of the code for privacy online (PDF) which is used by the Information Commissioner's Office. Facebook said of the proposals: \"We look forward to hearing more about Mr Vaizey's plans and continuing to work with both him and the ICO.\" Google declined to comment.",
