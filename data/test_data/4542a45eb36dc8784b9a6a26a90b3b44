  "content": "Sir Alex Ferguson has warned Rio Ferdinand to be careful when tweeting in future after the defender was fined \u00a345,000 by the Football Association for his reference to the term \"choc ice\" on the social forum. Ferdinand was found guilty of improper conduct in a case where Lord Ouseley, the chairman of Kick It Out, gave evidence in the case. Ferguson said: \"Although Rio is mature he has still got to remember that one word can make a difference on these things, you can't [take] it back.\" The manager questioned why Ferdinand had been charged by the FA and why the case was heard in secret. \"The only thing that surprises me is players have tweeted for years and it's not been challenged by the FA, he said. His status in the game has caused that, who he plays for could be another issue. \"I don't understand Twitter, I don't know why anyone should get involved with it. We have given instructions to the players that nobody should tweet about Manchester United.\" Ferdinand received the charge for making comments two days after Ashley Cole gave key evidence on behalf of his Chelsea team-mate John Terry during the latter's trial at Westminster magistrates court in July. Terry was acquitted of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, Rio's younger brother, when Chelsea played at QPR last October, and the United player had been responding to another Twitter user describing Cole as a \"choc ice\", meaning black on the outside and white on the inside. Ferdinand responded: \"I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic. Hahahahahaha!!\" He later deleted the tweet and claimed on Twitter that it was slang for someone being \"fake\", but the FA charged him with making improper comments that included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race. After his case was heard in Manchester this week, a statement from the FA on Friday confirmed: \"Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand has been fined \u00a345,000 after an Independent Regulatory Commission found proven a charge of improper conduct in relation to a comment posted on Twitter. \"The Commission decided that the comment was improper and brought the game into disrepute. In addition, the Commission found that the breach included a reference to ethnic origin, colour or race. Ferdinand was fined \u00a345,000 and warned as to his future conduct.\" In its written reasons for the case, the Commission stated that: \"Ouseley's evidence was that 'choc ice' is an offensive and insulting term such as coconut or bounty, used to question a person's identity based on the notion that they have a dark outer skin but inside they act as a white person. Lord Ouseley accepted in cross-examination that there are other interpretations of the words. Mr Ferdinand stated that the words 'choc ice' ... was a reference to race, has the same meaning as coconut or bounty, but it means the person is fake\".",
