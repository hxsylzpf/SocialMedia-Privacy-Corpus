  "content": "Google is set to keep a closer eye on what you do online with a new service that tracks of every web page you visit. Web History, which is already available for American users, is being released to users worldwide in 26 languages today. The service allows surfers to keep tabs of the sites they have visited, and allows Google to provide more targeted results based on the sites users have looked in the past. The system requires a piece of software to be installed which monitors your surfing habits and feeds the data back to Google. The system will then learn that a football fan who regularly searches for \"Chelsea\" is more likely to want match results than property listings in south west London. \"What it boils down to is how big and broad the web is getting,\" said Sep Kamvar of Google's personalisation team. \"You're getting millions of results from each query... we use Web History to do things to increase the relevancy of the search results.\" Users can also look through their web history to find sites they have visited in the past. The information is retained until users choose delete it, but Peter Fleischer, Google's privacy counsel, said that the system incorporates numerous privacy controls. Web History is one of an increasing number of tools aiming to constructively use personal information, from Yahoo!'s My Web service to British music recommendation site Last.fm. But Google's increasing power and control of information about people could raise privacy concerns, particularly in some parts of the world. Web History is available in languages such as Arabic and Mandarin, which could see surfers in politically repressive countries such as China and Syria to use the system - and may encourage governments to try and get hold of that information. Google said it was not beyond the realm of possibility that a repressive government, but that it would only comply with completely legal requests. \"There's always a possibility that a government will want to get hold of such information,\" said Mr Fleischer. In 2006 Google successfully rebuffed an attempt by the White House to gain access to personal search information about American users, but the company has come under fire from human rights groups for capitulating to the Chinese authorities by censoring search results on its google.cn site.",
