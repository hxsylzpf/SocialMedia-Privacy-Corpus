  "content": "As America's 44th president, it's not that easy for Barack Obama to make history. Think of any original act by an incumbent of the Oval Office \u2013 bugging a political rival, say, or not having sexual relations with an intern \u2013 and they've already been done. Twitter to the rescue! At 2pm local time on Wednesday he stood at the White House podium and became the first sitting president to face the American people through a live \"Twitter town hall\". \"It's only 140 characters,\" Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder, reminded Obama as he tapped out a tweet. (It wasn't Obama's first signed tweet \u2013 he did that last month on Father's day.) Dorsey was moderating the meeting three months after Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of that other social media monolith, Facebook, had his hour in the limelight with Obama. Obama gained plenty of brownie points with the Twitterati simply for showing up and engaging with them, taking questions posted around the US on broadly economic themes, from the debt ceiling to taxes and education spending. He didn't do so well on Twitter's overriding principle: brevity. In his answer to one randomly selected question, he took 387 words \u2013 that's words, not characters \u2013 to make his point. Come to think of it, the whole Twitter town hall format was a bit of a con \u2013 Obama received the questions as tweets but answered them through that most old-fashioned of media: opening his mouth and talking. The question with the 387 word reply was in fact composed by a Twitter user with the name of John Boehner, who just happens to be speaker of the House of Representatives and Obama's arch nemesis. That got some Twitter users riled. \"He can talk to the @WhiteHouse any time. Shouldn't @TownHall be a chance for the rest of us?\" lamented Seth Oldmixon. But it at least gave Obama, who is locked in bitter debt ceiling negotiations with Boehner, the chance to take a poke at him because his tweet was mistyped. \"John needs to work on his typing skills,\" Obama said. Another question put to Obama came from Nicholas Kristof, a columnist for the New York Times. He asked Obama whether he had made a mistake by failing to get the Republicans to commit to raising the debt ceiling when he agreed to their demand to extend tax cuts for the rich. Kristof too came under a Twitter battering for having had his question selected. \"I am getting lots of complaints that Twitter questions for the president shouldn't have come from an NYT columnist. I hear you,\" he said in a later tweet."
