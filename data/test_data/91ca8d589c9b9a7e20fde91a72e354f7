  "content": "Heather Mills McCartney said she intends to sue the News of the World over allegations she was a prostitute who engaged in group and lesbian sex. Lawyers acting for Sir Paul McCartney's estranged wife said claims in the paper that she was paid thousands of pounds to have sex with wealthy Arabs while she was in her 20s were \"untrue and highly defamatory\". In a statement, Mills McCartney's representatives said she would sue the News International title, edited by Andy Coulson, but not until the couple's divorce was complete. \"Heather is very distressed by this article,\" said the statement. \"She continues to recover slowly from her revision amputation operation and has suffered weight loss, anxiety and sleeping problems as a result of the stress and anxiety of the break-up of her marriage. \"The coverage of this in certain newspapers has caused further distress and illness to her. \"The interests of her daughter are of paramount concern. She will defer issue of legal proceedings until the arrangements in relation to the divorce are concluded but intends to sue at that stage all parties (including individuals) who are intent on damaging her reputation.\" The McCartneys announced their decision to split last month after four years of marriage. Last week, Mills McCartney was pictured in the Sun posing in a series of topless shots from a 1988 German publication, which the paper called \"obscene and pornographic\", but which she said was a \"lover's guide\". A spokeswoman for the former model said lawyers for the couple were negotiating the terms of their divorce settlement. It has been reported that she could receive up to \u00a3200m. The settlement will include custody arrangements for the couple's two-year-old daughter, Beatrice. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
