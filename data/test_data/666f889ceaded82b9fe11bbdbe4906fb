  "content": "In the past 10 years the defence and security industries have undergone a fundamental shift in emphasis. There has been an increase in research and development funding of internal security and anti-crime applications; terrorism and the drugs trade have become the new enemy. Since September 11, surveillance and internal security have become the priority. The change in emphasis has also seen technological adaptations flowing in the other direction. Military and intelligence agencies now monitor commercial developments for anything that might be useful. Thales Formerly Thomson-CSF, this vast Anglo-French electronics concern was renamed after a Greek philosopher in 2000. It employs 12,000 staff in the UK, mainly in the surveillance and detection field. It manufactures unattended ground sensors, which can detect a range of different disturbances. Their CLASSIC (Covert Local Area Sensor System for Intruder Classification) system can be used with magnetic anomaly detectors, piezoelectric sensors to detect vibration, or infra-red cameras. Thales also produces recognition software and is working on pattern recognition. The hope is that anomalies in a broadly predictable pattern - commuters waiting on a station platform for example - might be detectable and allow action to be taken before potential suicides jump. Raytheon The fourth largest US defence contractor, their best known product is the Tomahawk cruise missile. Since September 11 they have turned their attention to \"homeland security\", developing a Knowledge Mining and Visualisation System capable of simultaneously monitoring and harvesting information from multiple streams of data, including the internet, audio, text and cable broadcasts. Allied to a realtime translation system, they claim that keyword analysis will allow agencies to gather information automatically, freeing up agents to concentrate on analysis. Raytheon also produces radars the size of a mobile phone, capable of detecting an intruder at 200 yards, smart ID cards with biometric identification signatures, and automated fingerprint systems, all aimed at the airport security market. BAe Systems The Campaign Against the Arms Trade describes Britain's largest arms manufacturer as having \"a history of selling [equipment] indiscriminately to repressive regimes and regions of conflict around the world.\" BAe says it is \"a systems company innovating for a safer world.\" The bulk of its operation is military hardware, but among their surveillance/intelligence applications are mobile surveillance vehicles (MSVs). In 2000, BAe was awarded a \u00a310m contract to provide MSVs to the Romanian government for day and night border patrol. The converted VW vans are fitted with binocular image intensifiers and in-vehicle and hand-held thermal imaging cameras which detect body heat. Oracle, ICL and other software manufacturers Integrated database technology is an increasingly valuable tool for security agencies monitoring specific targets, like potential terrorists, or government agencies tracking dissidents. It is an essentially benign technology with the potential for abuse. A database of addresses and geographical information - who lives in a particular street - accessed via a touch-screen system can be cross-referenced with a database of criminals, or trade unionists and political activists, to make tracking and arrests easier."
