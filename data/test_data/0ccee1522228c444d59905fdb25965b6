  "content": "Nigel Havers has complained to the Daily Express about an article in yesterday's paper, denying he spoke to a reporter despite being quoted in the piece. Lawyers representing the actor have written to Peter Hill, the editor of the Express, about the page three article, headlined \"The Charmer's new love\". Havers denies giving the paper any quotes for the story, which was written by Liz Thomas. Sources said the disputed quotes came from a local news agency. \"Mr Havers has not spoken to a reporter and is anxious to avoid other newspapers picking up the quotes and treating them as his own words,\" the actor's solicitors, Stitt &amp; Co, said in a statement. Havers, 56, rose to fame in the film Chariots of Fire in the early 80s and recently appeared in BBC1's Little Britain and ITV1's comedy drama Open Wide. Stitt &amp; Co claimed the article breaches the Press Complaints Commission's code of practice in relation to accuracy and privacy. The Daily Express had not commented at the time of publication. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
