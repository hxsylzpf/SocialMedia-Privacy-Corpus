  "content": "France's privacy watchdog got more than it bargained for when it forced Google to display a link to a privacy judgment against the search engine on its front page: the traffic crashed its servers after the link was added to the Google.fr site over the weekend. The link, to the CNIL's decision in which it fined Google \u20ac150,000 as part of a long-running dispute with the US company over its privacy policies, was prominently displayed on Google's French site below the main search box. The CNIL - the National Commission on Informatics and Liberty - is the equivalent of the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), with responsibility for implementing the European Union's data protection laws in France. \"Press release: the CNIL has fined Google \u20ac150,000 for violating the law on \"information and freedoms,\" said the notice. \"The decision can be accessed at the following web address,\" it said, providing a link. The CNIL had demanded that the notice stay on the site for two days. Google first posted the notice on Saturday, but the search engine's huge user numbers meant that thousands of people clicked the link to read the decision - overloading the CNIL servers. CNIL has objected to Google's method of combining data collected on individual users across services such as YouTube, Gmail and social network Google+. Its new data storage model began in March 2012, combining the privacy policies of 60 services into one policy, and giving users no opportunity to opt out. The web giant appealed against the CNIL's fine last month as well as the order to post a notice of the sanction on its google.fr homepage for 48 hours. Google specifically asked the Conseil d'Etat, France's top administrative court, to suspend that order while it re-examines the case. On Friday, the Conseil d'Etat ruled that there was not enough urgency nor proof of damage to Google's reputation to warrant such a suspension. This meant Google had to post the CNIL's decision on its French homepage even while it keeps fighting it in court. \"We've engaged fully with the CNIL throughout this process to explain our privacy policy and how it allows us to create simpler, more effective services,\" a Google spokesman told Reuters in an e-mailed statement. \"We will comply with the order to post the notice, but we'll also continue with our appeal before the Conseil d'Etat.\" Spain, Britain, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands have also opened similar cases against Google, arguing that its privacy policy breached local rules protecting consumers on how their personal data is processed and stored. The CNIL explanation of its imposition of the fine says that \"the company does not sufficiently inform its users about the conditions and purposes of processing data\" and that \"it does not set retention periods for all data process\" and that \"it allows, without any legal basis, the combination of all the data it collects about users across all of its services\". Google has previously been told to post a similar statement about a judgement against it in Belgium in 2006 relating to newspapers. In that case it was required to post the content of a ruling - though not a link - for five days or face a fine of \u20ac500,000 per day. Google complied."
