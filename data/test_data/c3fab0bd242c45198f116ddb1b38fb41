  "content": "Under the dynamic and attention-grabbing leadership of Arianna Huffington, the Huffington Post led the spectacular rise of native digital news, partly thanks to a legion of unpaid bloggers. By 2012 it had also snagged a Pulitzer, but in the fickle new media world the excitement and \u2013 according to reports \u2013 US traffic is now shifting towards sharp-elbowed, freshly financed upstarts like BuzzFeed, Vice or Vox. Jared Grusd, the 40-year-old new chief executive poached from Spotify four months ago, may need some of the stamina of his ironman triathlon training to maintain HuffPo's reputation as a pack leader while keeping up with the relentlessly energetic Huffington, who remains president and editor-in-chief. At his first sit-down interview since taking charge, Grusd explains that HuffPo's future will be global and played out in a new, largely mobile era he has dubbed \"post-social\". Key to this is the changing role of social media sites like Facebook from places where people share news, to ones where they consume it. \"Companies like Facebook and Snapchat are saying: 'We have already attracted one billion people in the world to our platform. Rather than refer them back to your site, we actually want to keep them',\" says Grusd, flanked by Huffington and 27-year-old operations supremo Koda Wang after announcing the next stage of its global expansion plan in Madrid. \"So post-social is, in many respects, coming full circle to where we began in the old days when people would go to AOL and Yahoo and you would just consume all your content on their portals.\" While some fear online news will be monstered by Facebook, which will demand an ever larger slice of advertising revenue, Grusd insists the change is good for HuffPo, saying it \"gives an opportunity to reach audiences on a scale we have never seen before\". That may seem a bold statement at a time when the distributed content phenomenon \u2013 led by Facebook's Instant and Snapchat's Discover \u2013 remains in its infancy, with uncertainty about just how much traffic will be diverted to, or created by, these new platforms. However, Grusd is already excited about a content distributor that many in the west have still not heard of, China's WeChat, which delivers news to 600m mobile phones. \"WeChat is one of the world's biggest messaging apps and in China it is the biggest,\" he says. HuffPost is providing it with lifestyle content, aware that reporting hard news in China is a minefield. One of Huffington's big hires after Grusd's arrival was executive editor Liz Heron, formerly head of Facebook's news partnerships and before that social media editor at the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Heron, who joined a month ago and sits just behind Huffington in the editorial pecking order, is experimenting with everything from Facebook-friendly videos to virtual reality, where HuffPo expects to acquire a company this month. Expanding into China and other countries is the other major change that Grusd will oversee as HuffPo rolls out an average of a new edition every seven or eight weeks to reach 50, up from the current 15, by 2020.And while many still think of HuffPo as an outlet for campaigners, politicians and obscure academics to post their thoughts, future growth will be led by journalists. Already only 18% of HuffPo traffic goes to blogs, as most of the audience heads to home-produced content ranging from the inevitable cat videos (with this year's UK-produced greatest hit, Cats Train their Humans, getting 90m views) to the new Highline long-form section that produced more than 1m hits for a report on the mothers of Isis recruits. An accompanying ambition is to grow a global newsroom, with HuffPo dropping Associated Press at the end of this year and national editions pooling resources when events like the Paris attacks impact on the world. \"One [aim] is to deliver at a local level. In Spain, for example, our content has to be highly engaging and relevant to the Spanish market or it is a waste of time,\" Grusd says. \"You can then zoom out and really cover the globe. Take something horrible and tragic like what took place in Paris. By having a global point of view on the world, we can talk about what is happening in Paris in a way that the story is different.\" So HuffPo now awaits bids to partner up locally on multiple national editions, as it already has with Le Monde in France or El Pais publisher Prisa in Spain. \"We have very carefully selected major players who are leaders in their markets,\" Grusd says, adding that a new, out-of-the-box model \u2013 covering editorial style, technology and advertising \u2013 makes new editions easier to launch. \"We feel like we have cracked the code.\" In the race to expand internationally \u2013 where BuzzFeed and others also compete \u2013 Grusd sees targeting 50 countries, rather than the whole world, as taking a steady approach - \"we will do it in a measured way so we still learn from each roll-out\". Older HuffPo editions in Canada and France are now making money. Spain and Italy are about to do the same and recent launches in Australia and India help explain the new strategy. In both cases, HuffPo sold the entire first year's advertising inventory before launch, making them profitable from the start. But does HuffPo make an overall profit? It was bought for $315m by AOL in 2011 and received two separate $1bn offers before AOL itself was bought by Verizon this June for $4.4bn. But AOL does not break out figures and Grusd refuses to confirm reported revenues of $146m last year. A significant drop in US traffic this year has levelled out since Grusd arrived, while competitors continue to grow, according to comScore, but he claims he does not want HuffPo to fret overly about metrics that do not reflect the new post-social, global market. It remains the biggest multiplatform news site in the US and the largest desktop site globally. \"We still have a massive lead,\" he says. \"I believe you have to look at all of the metrics to get a snapshot of what is happening.\" Analyst Ken Doctor, of newsonomics, sees the international expansion as similar to that successfully pursued by lifestyle magazines decades ago, but he believes HuffPo's problems lie elsewhere. \"I get the sense that, in the international conversation, the Huffington Post has become one of the crowd rather than a leader,\" he says, adding that the brand is beginning to look tired. Grusd disagrees, pledging that HuffPo will continue to surprise. \"All brands, all media properties have to constantly innovate, iterate, grow, refresh themselves and prove themselves to the audiences,\" he says. \"Huffington Post has always done that and is continuing to do that.\" Curriculum vitae Age 40 Education University of Pennsylvania, University of Chicago Law School, Columbia Business School Career 2000 associate, Skadden Arps 2004 assistant general counsel, Capgemini 2005 managing counsel and executive management, Team for the Americas, Google 2009 chief strategy and business development officer, AOL 2011 global head of corporate development and general counsel, Spotify 2015 CEO, Huffington Post \u2022 This article was amended on 7 December 2015 to clarify that Liz Heron was not hired by Grusd, but Arianna Huffington"
