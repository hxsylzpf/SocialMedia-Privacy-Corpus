  "content": "The former chairman of the Press Council today called on the government to set up a royal commission to investigate the \"malaise within the media\", saying the existing system of self regulation had \"reached its end\". Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC, who chaired the Council until it was replaced by the Press Complaints Commission in 1990, said there was now a \"pretty strong case\" for saying the press should no longer be allowed to regulate itself. \"The days of self-regulation have gone,\" he said today. \"People have been saying recently that the legal profession can't police itself. Well I think there is a pretty strong case for saying the media ought not to be regulating itself.\" Sir Louis, himself a former journalist, said fears that statutory regulation of the press would lead to a diminution of press freedom were misplaced, although he admitted sanctioning the press could create a \"dilemma\". Sir Louis made his comments at the launch of a new report published by the media ethics pressure group, Mediawise, which he chairs. In his introduction to the report, entitled Satisfaction Guaranteed, he backed calls from the former Sunday Times editor, Harold Evans, and the Guardian columnist and leader writer, Martin Kettle, for a Royal Commission on the press. \"There have been three royal commissions on the press since the second world war - in 1949, 1962 and 1977. Is the time ripe for a fourth, at a moment when the print and electronic media are largely indistinguishable in ownership and function - the former self-regulated, the latter supervised by Ofcom?\" he wrote. Sir Louis said the current code of practice, revised this year, \"does not carry conviction\" because it was framed exclusively by the industry. And he called for a new code to be written by the public. \"Only a code defined by the public can hope to achieve public acceptability. And it needs proper enforcement, conceivably by appropriate sanctions,\" he continued. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
