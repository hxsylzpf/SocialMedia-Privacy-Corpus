  "content": "\u2022 It turns out that the 2,579 people who signed up for Maya Angelou's droplets of inspiration on Twitter have been getting a raw deal. Gems such as \"Let's remember something very important: it is as important to love ourselves as much as the world around us\" that have been surfacing intermittently since 3 February are the work of an imposter, according to the poet's agent. On closer reflection, \"History, despite it's wrenching pain / Cannot be unlived, and if faced / With courage, need not be lived again\" does sound more like the kind of cosmic ordering doggerel you would expect from mixing Paulo Coelho with Jonathan Livingston Seagull than something from a prizewinning US poet. But since one of the main functions of Twitter is to blur the distinction between the meaningful and the meaningless, there was always a faint hope that Angelou had taken a rare detour into irony with some artful artlessness. Still, where one door closes, another opens. With Angelou out of the cybershot, the field is clear for British and Irish poets to corner the market in Twitterrhyme. Pam Ayres is the obvious front-runner in that she's been turning out the kind of \"I went outside and saw a cat / it was black and white, how lucky is that?\" drivel that is the lingua franca of the Twitterati, but that doesn't mean there's no room for anyone else to carve out a niche market. These days Seamus Heaney seems to be rather more interested in gardening than in translating the epics, and regular horticultural updates would be sure to attract a strong following. \"Quiet flows the Monty Don / Past potatoes lined in drills / To ancient bogs of sweaty peat / There to find my Da with spade / About to plant a particularly nice ligularia dentata I found him at the garden centre this morning.\" Wendy Cope looks as if she knows her way round a Twitter gag - she's the only person I know who has rhymed Byronic and ironic, though I'm sure Alanis Morrissette wishes she'd got there first - and she could develop a nice line in Stephen Fry-style \"I'm stuck in a lift\" pearls with a poetic twist. \"Now that I've read some verse by Shelley / I'm off to go and stuff my belly.\" As a professional northerner and Barnsley supporter, Ian McMillan could happily twitter his way through 90 minutes from Oakwell. \"Staying up is going to be hard if / We don't get a win at high-flying Cardiff.\" Meanwhile, JH Prynne could string almost any words together at random - he usually does - and someone somewhere would probably claim to make sense of it. \"Shell gentility freezes the moral candour of meltwater / The Golden Fleece of English localism / Becomes a resin of asymmetric elegance.\" The best gig, though, is reserved for Andrew Motion. Twitter trades in slebs, so who better to be our royal correspondent than the poet laureate? And don't forget, Motion's already made his \"down-wiv-da-kidz\" mark with his never-to-be forgotten Prince William 21st birthday rap. So let's hear it for \"M 2 the O 2 the T to the Shun / MC Andy is having some fun / Me an' da Queen, we're havin' a scene / Get movin' those feet, da Tweet's da new beat\". John Crace \u2022 Paul Baggaley, Picador's new publisher, announced his first acquisitions this week, with 11 novels by the late Roberto Bola\u00f1o (\"challenging, weird, extraordinary but also completely readable\") the most notable results of his shopping spree. \"We are creating a whole look for Bola\u00f1o,\" he said, \"creating a brand.\" No clues were given about this look, and Picador's jacket for 2666 is not auspicious: the symbolist kitsch of Gustave Moreau's Jupiter and Semele (a 19th-century French artist depicting a Greek myth) seems to have been chosen to illustrate a Latin American novel set in the 20th century - and partly in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the murder-blighted Mexican border city - mostly because it's gaudy and crowded; and a large gold band across the centre, carrying praise for the Chilean author, clumsily obscures much of it. Picador's current efforts with its most eminent living novelists also fail to inspire confidence. Its jackets for Don DeLillo are dominated by white, with small multicoloured collages that do little to encourage you to try to decode them. The Naipaul brand is a disaster, with some covers sharing a glum off-white look but others wildly dissimilar in colour and layout. The Cormac McCarthy designs are at least uniform, but inane literalism makes them ridiculous: fallen fruit for The Orchard Keeper, pretty horses for All the Pretty Horses, a young man for No Country for Old Men and - you guessed it - a road for The Road Does it make sense to turn a literary novelist into a \"brand\" in this way? Imposing a uniform design is more apt with, say, Ian Rankin's Rebus novels, which fit the definition of a brand as a class of products. But Vintage's current jackets for Thomas Pynchon, for example (which incongruously resemble Where's Wally? pictures with their plethora of tiny people and objects), in no way reflect the differences between works such as Gravity's Rainbow and The Crying of Lot 49. The sepia postcard-like template used by Penguin Modern Classics puts the dissimilarities not just between books, but also between writers, through the branding blender. Branding can work - Haruki Murakami benefits from designs playing elegant variations on white, grey, black and red, and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez has no reason to complain about covers that resemble \"found\" colour photos taken in Colombia. But it does so when the rules are loose - as with Martin Amis's paperbacks, visually similar only in being boldly simple - and deviation is allowed. Cape and Vintage's jackets for Ian McEwan, for example, tend to feature buildings, empty spaces or large objects. For Atonement, however, the publisher forsook the brand in depicting a girl sitting on stone steps, and created one of the most memorable cover images of recent times. John Dugdale \u2022 Profile, the publisher whose authors include Alan Bennett, Lynne Truss and dons galore, has just released an autumn catalogue in which it announces an unlikely new signing - the controversial rapper 50 Cent. Disappointingly, his Profile debut is not a call for literate gangsterism co-written with Truss called Beats, Shoots &amp; Leaves, but a collaboration with Robert Greene, the author of bestselling manuals on power, war and seduction. The 50th Law will teach hustling skills and \"reveal how to become a master strategist and supreme realist\", drawing on \"the lore of gangsters, hustlers and hip-hop artists, as well as 50 Cent's business and artistic dealings\". Hopes are high that he will chat with Bennett at the publisher's annual summer garden party. John Dugdale \u2022 Dealers in celebrity signatures, as featured in Zadie Smith's The Autograph Man, will gather this lunchtime at a Heathrow hotel to sell and bid for the scrawls of movie idols, pop idols, scientists, statesmen, musicians, artists and writers. To judge by the estimates, literary greats face humiliation: \u00a3100-\u00a3150 for a Tennyson cheque, for example, and \u00a3150-\u00a3200 for a Henry James note compare poorly with \u00a3400-\u00a3500 for a contract with Judy Garland's signature on it or \u00a3800-\u00a31,000 for a signed photo of Humphrey Bogart. Edward Lear does better (\u00a3800-\u00a31,000), because there are drawings too, and so do Agatha Christie (\u00a3600-\u00a3800) and Dashiell Hammett (\u00a3600-\u00a3900) with a letter to his mistress. Particularly pitiful are the novelists bundled together in a single lot of signed photos (\"including Julian Barnes, Nick Hornby, Kurt Vonnegut, Elfriede Jelinek, G\u00fcnter Grass, Bret Easton Ellis, John Irving, Imre Kert\u00e9sz ...\"), all of them potentially yours for just \u00a3100-\u00a3120.
