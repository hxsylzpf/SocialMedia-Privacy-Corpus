  "content": "Are you ready for your 90s revival? Did the decade contain anything worth reviving? Or were we just slowly sliding into the disaster that is post-politics, like the fat people in Wall-E sliding off their space ship, neutered by a debt bubble and intoxicated by Cool Britannia (also, literally, by intoxicants)? The core sign that such a revival is on its way is, of course, the rehabilitation of Chris Evans, about to take over Top Gear just as TFI Friday has its relaunch. Plainly, Evans embodied the decade, catalysing its cultural flashpoints, dominating the tabloids, so that every strop and sulk was a Sun splash (I can only think this is before they figured out how to hack celebrity's phones; even at the time Evans's arguments with his employers didn't really feel like news). However, apart from being a gingery fin-de-siecle zeitgeist, Evans is also an incredibly instinctive, charismatic broadcaster, and radio and TV channels really ought to grow up and find a way to deploy people's talents all the way through their careers, rather than needing them to fall out of favour for a decade before they can remember that they were actually really good. I think he's a genius, and I'm positive I don't only speak for myself when I say that. Aside from Evans, there was, certainly, a kind of nihilistic, floppy anomie about the decade. It was a time when you were constantly told that things were \"post-ironic\" by people who didn't know the meaning of the word \"irony\". The standards of the previous two decades \u2013 which had done so much of the heavy lifting in terms of how much your identity could be used against you, how much racism, sexism and homophobia were acceptable in public life \u2013 were more or less overturned by the kind of shoulder-shrugging adolescent mischief of the post-modern 90s. Nothing meant what it said it meant; if you complained about sexual objectification \u2013 well, then weren't you the idiot; the cover of Loaded was never intended to look like an updated Playboy. It was an ironic reference to a time when women were just meat. And yet, that wasn't all there was to it. There was not, and this may surprise the twentysomethings of today, really a rape-joke culture. The era may have rehabilitated pole-dancing and fishnets (I spent so much time in fishnets outside pubs that in the summer of 1998 I got a tan in the shape of a net). But the casual nastiness towards women that we fight about so much now, the rape jokes on Unilad, the derisive \"persona\" of Dapper Laughs, just wouldn't have happened in the 90s. It wasn't really because of orthodoxy \u2013 if anything, the mood was more anti-orthodox then \u2013 but just because nastiness as a modus operandi didn't really exist. \"Trolling\", having a backlash, seeking people out to abuse them \u2013 all of this antisocial behaviour that collectively drags down the minimum courtesy standards of our whole culture: is it the internet, or is it the coarsening impact of three decades of the politics of self-interest, finding its expression on the internet? I cannot tell you for sure. But I'm trying to imagine how the ladettes \u2013 Zoe Ball, Sara Cox etc \u2013 would be treated if they were today as they were then: sometimes drunk, fantastically successful, witty, self-determining, unabashed. The Daily Mail would, in its modern-day emboldened form, be campaigning for their imprisonment. Every time they opened their mouths, someone would loudly proclaim a desire to rape them, while someone else mused aloud how disgustingly ugly they were. The difference between 1995 and 2015, in a way, is similar to that between Chris Evans and Jeremy Clarkson: they both, broadly, do the same job, and you wouldn't divine any profound difference in outlook between the two. But whereas one was puckish and alive, the other is sour and racist and punches people in the face. Maybe I'm being too harsh on the present; yet a revival of the 90s, if it came with some 90s manners, might surprise and delight us.",
