  "content": "Modern communications are not expanding our social circle, but anthropologist Stefana Broadbent says that mobile phones, instant messaging and social networking are actually strengthening our core relationships. Research has shown that with instant messaging, if there are 100 people on your buddy list, you'll only chat with at most five people on your list. Eighty per cent of phone calls are to four people. With voice-over-internet service Skype, that number drops, with most people calling only two others. Initially, sociologists thought people were cocooning, closing themselves off from public life, but she said that modern institutions were more responsible for isolation than modern communications. Fifteen years ago, factory or office workers were cut off, having no contact with the \"private sphere\", she said. If you were lucky, there might a public phone, but isolation was the norm in professional life. Now, modern communications has \"democratised intimacy\", she said. Through their communication channels, they are breaking an imposed isolation that institutions are imposing them. They can call their mom from work, using IM or texting under the desk. Young factory workers on night shift will sneak out of the sight of CCTV cameras to call their girlfriends. Migrant Filipino mothers are using Skype to remotely parent their children. This is why she is concerned with legislation that leads to the dismissal of bus drivers in New York if they are seen with a mobile phone in their hand on the grounds of safety and security. This is not about security and safety. This is institutions trying to determine whether people can decide whether to be isolated. They are trying to block this greater possibility of intimacy.",
