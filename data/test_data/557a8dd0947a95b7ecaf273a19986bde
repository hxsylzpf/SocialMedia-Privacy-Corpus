  "content": "When The Jackson 5 sang \"A-B-C, it's easy as 1-2-3, as simple as do-re-mi,\" it is unlikely they were lamenting the lack of effort by future generations when choosing internet passwords. However, the song's lyrics would form a sage 21st-century warning, with a startling number of web users apparently using woefully inadequate passwords such as the song title. A security breach of RockYou.com in December \u2013 a website which offers applications that can be used on Facebook and MySpace \u2013 saw hackers access the usernames, passwords and email addresses of around 32m users. The passwords, without the usernames and email addresses, were then posted on the web, allowing data security firm Imperva, to explore common trends. The analysis revealed a large amount of users had chosen \"easy-to-crack\" passwords, the most common being \"123456\", which was chosen by 290,731 users, or almost 1%. \"It is simple to remember, and in a row on the keyboard,\" said Amichai Shulman, Imperva's chief technology officer. \"Like 'qwerty', but easier.\" Indeed; qwerty is one of the more common passwords, the 20th most popular, according to the data. Number sequences make up six of the top 20 passwords, while \"Password\" itself, remains a favourite, at 4th on the list. \"iloveyou\" was the 5th most common, followed by \"princess\" in 6th place. Curiously, \"Nicole\" was the 11th most commonly chosen code, followed by \"Daniel\" in 12th. Shulman said this could be due to the popularity of both names during the mid to late 80s; there could potentially be a large number of users in their early 20s either called Nicole or Daniel, or with friends with those names. According to the new search engine WolframAlpha, the most common age for a Nicole in the US is 25, the same age as Daniel. Other names appearing in the top 20 passwords include Jessica and Michael. Around one-third of users chose passwords of six characters or less, while Imperva said the most common had changed \"very little\" since a password security study in 1990. Shulman said passwords should have a combination of numbers and lowercase and uppercase letters to be secure. He added that users should consider using longer 'pass phrases' \u2013 to protect their identity online. \"A pass phrase compiling 50 characters gives you more room for creativity while not compromising the safety,\" he said. \"Choose something your dad used to tell you or a sentence from a book you like.\" He said most people would struggle to remember a different password for every internet service they use, \"but should keep at least a couple\". \"One for more sensitive accounts and another for social networking sites and places that are less critical.\" The most commonly used passwords 1 123456 2 12345 3 123456789 4 Password 5 iloveyou 6 princess 7 rockyou 8 1234567 9 12345678 10 abc123 * Taken from a sample of 32m passwords used on rockyou.com"
