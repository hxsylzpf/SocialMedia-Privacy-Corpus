  "content": "Over to Her Majesty's Daily Telegraph, where hard-pressed hacks have apparently been commandeered onto Twitter and told to update their followers regularly with pithy missives. Forget the deadlines, which look decidedly old-school in a 140-character world: reporters are now required to tweet an average of once an hour, with editors advised to update their Twitter feed every 15 minutes, according to the Independent's diary column. There is no secret about journalists' love affair with Twitter, but could the Telegraph's new regime bring the honeymoon period to an end?"
