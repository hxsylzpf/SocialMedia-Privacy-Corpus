  "content": "THE OLD SAYING that \"if you're not thoroughly confused you don't fully understand the situation\" applies with a vengeance to our new media ecosystem. Take the strange case of teenagers, whose brains are being scrambled and rewired by nature to make them fit for adult life. Until the 1960s, \"teens\" (as they are called in the US) barely existed as an interesting social category. Like sex in Philip Larkin's poem, Annus Mirabilis, one might say they were \"invented in nineteen sixty-three/\u2026 Between the end of the 'Chatterley' ban/And the Beatles' first LP\". Then they acquired spending power and became interesting to retailers and advertisers \u2013 and therefore to the mass media \u2013 to the point where our society is now obsessed with them. This obsession is particularly neurotic whenever cyberspace is mentioned, and leads adults to project on to the younger generation all kinds of fears and fantasies. Thus they are perceived as confident \"digital natives\" of cyberspace, whereas we are merely nervous \"immigrants\". They supposedly have a legendary facility with communications technology, and indeed may be evolving overdeveloped thumbs from incessant texting. They think that research involves typing queries into Google, never read newspapers, regard Wikipedia as more reliable than the Oracle of Delphi, have no concept of privacy, are accomplished multi-taskers and are the early adopters who drive every internet trend. Or, to sum up adult conventional wisdom in a single ugly phrase, teenagers are more \"tech savvy\" than we are and, as such, the best guide to our networked future. Hmm, I wonder. At the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco last week, an entire session paid homage to the myth of teenage omniscience. A troupe of Bay Area kids were invited on to the platform and interviewed respectfully by a former investment analyst. It was not illuminating. \"It rambled and eventually degenerated to teenagers free associating on different companies ('Google?' 'Simple!'),\" wrote one observer, \"but the most compelling part for me was seeing their visceral dislike of Twitter.\" They simply couldn't see the point of it. \"If I were using Twitter, I would just say I'm sitting on a couch in front of a bunch of people,\" one said, adding that he couldn't see the point. At this point, your columnist sat up and blinked. Twitter, after all, is the cyber-sensation du jour. It's growing like crazy and is even impinging on the British legal system (as evidenced by its unravelling of the Trafigura super-injunction). Yet the kids who supposedly drive every internet phenomenon have little interest in it. The statistics support this: Twitter is a preoccupation of older generations; according to comScore, only 11% of its users are aged 17 or younger. Ah well, you say, at least teenagers are the motive force behind social networking, which many people see as the most important online development of the past five years. Here again, the statistics tell a different story. According to the New York Times, for example, teenagers now account for only 14% of MySpace users and 9% of Facebook's. Yet it is Facebook that is growing like crazy: it now has over 300 million users (and is adding 600,000 new users a day at present). And most of them are oldies. A further intriguing twist was added to this story last week when the new chief executive of MySpace told the Financial Times that the company was no longer interested in competing with Facebook, in effect conceding defeat in the race to become the largest online social network. He said his company instead aimed to become an online hub for music and entertainment. \"Facebook is not our competition,\" he declared. \"We're very focused on a different space.\" In truth, MySpace doesn't have much choice: it has to do something to arrest its decline. According to Hitwise, Facebook took more than 58% of US social network traffic last month, while MySpace's share fell to 30% (compared with 66% a year ago). Four years ago, Rupert Murdoch's purchase of MySpace for $580m was widely regarded by an awestruck media world as an inspired move. Now it's looking like an old man's punt on something he didn't really understand: teenage psychology. And the meaning of all this? Simple: when it comes to predicting the future of cyberspace, the only certainty is that no one knows anything, least of all teenagers. Now where's that walking stick..?"
