  "content": "Besides Mark Zuckerberg's keynote at the f8 conference on Thursday, there were a number of panel sessions taking place, kicking off with a session on digital music. Moderated by Facebook's Justin Osofsky, it featured music manager Troy Carter (Lady Gaga), Spotify's Daniel Ek and Clear Channel's Bob Pittman. Carter was the most voluble on the panel, saying that the changes announced today by Facebook play into a wider trend of artists making their music widely available to listen to, rather than putting all the effort into making people buy it. \"What we're looking to do is not just about selling the CD or the digital file. It's how many people can we get the music to. How many people can experience it?\" he said. \"If it was up to me, I'd give away the next album and put it on every handset that I can put it on, to get that scale,\" he said. \"You can't be scared to fail. Sometimes we're going to get big results, and sometimes you learn a lesson, make an adjustment and move on.\" Pittman focused on the age-old social properties of radio \u2013 including dedications \u2013 \"How do we let people communicate as a group\u2026 in real-time?\" he said. \"We've chosen the platform of Facebook to enable this behaviour that people want to do.\" Meanwhile, Ek said that Spotify believes that there has been a transition from \"the MP3 to the URL\" \u2013 something he's said regularly \u2013 with the URL being \"inherently social\" because people can ping links to one another. Spotify's Ek, who revealed earlier this week that his service has 2 million paying subscribers worldwide, was asked about how business models will evolve in music. \"We're trying to create a better experience, and we believe the better experience is what will fight piracy. You can't fight piracy with legislation alone\u2026 We're trying to focus on a product that gets people to engage more around music, and when that happens, people will buy music again. They will go to shows, and so on.\" Pittman said that personalisation is increasingly important for music apps and services, with Clear Channel's iHeartRadio having just relaunched with the ability for people to create their own themed radio stations based on artists and songs \u2013 much like Pandora. \"We're letting them share, letting them create a dialogue, fostering the tribe and the discussion,\" he said. Meanwhile, Ek stressed the importance of playlists to Spotify \u2013 \"it's how people express themselves through music\" he said, reminding the audience that there are now more than 400 million Spotify playlists. Carter was asked about how someone like Lady Gaga might make use of some of the new data-crunching features on Facebook. \"For us it's how do we laser-focus on that, how do we make it less passive, how do we focus on the super-fan as opposed to somebody who just liked one single?\" he said. \"The more layers on top of the community, the more sticky it is. For us it's not about Lady Gaga talking to the community, but it's about the community sharing with each other.\" Ek added that Spotify will be monitoring where people are sharing thoughts and content around music on Facebook's new timelines, and using that as a factor in deciding where to launch next in the world. Pittman also made an intriguing hint that Clear Channel is looking to put more features in its iHeartRadio app that it sees other services offering, citing Turntable.fm \u2013 which gets people to listen live together in avatar-based chat-rooms \u2013 as one example. Carter was also asked about how he sees mobile extending the experience of going to see an artist in concert. \"People watch concerts like this now,\" he said, holding up an imaginary mobile phone. \"For us, it's how do we extend that experience? Right now it's very simple: people are tweeting from the concert, they're uploading their YouTube video... how do we layer into that experience? In the next year or so, something we're working on internally is going to make it a much more interactive experience... not just how you share the experience on the outside of the concerts, when you go home, but how you share it on the inside of the concerts too.\" Meanwhile, Carter also said that the new breed of social music apps will create opportunities beyond the traditional label structure in the music industry. \"It's going to be about partnerships between my company and Daniel's company, or Bob and Clear Channel and those guys,\" he said: Carter runs management firm Atom Factory. \"Creating this healthy dialogue that creates financial models around it where everybody can win.\"",
