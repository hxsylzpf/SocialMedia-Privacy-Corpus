  "content": "From \"technology-baffled grannies\" to \"pale-skinned gaming addicts\", there are so many stereotypes pinging around the internet that sometimes it can feel like an amphetamine-fuelled game of Pong. But there's one cliche in particular that annoys Danah Boyd: the \"digital native\". \"There's nothing native about young people's engagement with technology,\" she says, adamantly. The Microsoft researcher, who has made a career from studying the way younger people use the web, doesn't think much of the widely held assumption that children are innately better at coping with the web or negotiating the hurdles of digital life. Instead, she suggests, they're pretty much like everyone else. \"Young people are learning, they're learning about the social world around them,\" she says. \"The social world around them today has mediated technologies, thus in order to learn about the social world they're learning about the mediated technologies. And they're leveraging that to work out the shit that kids have always worked out: peer sociality, status, their first crush.\" Digging down It's no surprise she takes exception, really: as one of the first digital anthropologists to dig into the way people use social networking sites, Boyd has a track record of exposing the truths that underpin many of our assumptions about the online world. She joined Microsoft Research's New England lab in 2008, after stints at a variety of institutions including MIT's famed Media Lab, the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society. Along the way she gained influence for her insights into the social web \u2013 not just by conducting studies of how many kids use Facebook, but by taking a closer look at what is going on. One of her breakthrough moments was talking about the class and race divides that exist between users of MySpace and Facebook \u2013 websites she characterised as \"new representations of the class divide in American youth\". This idea \u2013 that the social network you choose says a lot about your underlying social biases \u2014 initially met resistance, but the concepts were quickly assimilated and the observation now seems fairly mundane. \"The big joke with anthropologists is that we consistently make ourselves irrelevant by what we jokingly call the 'like, duh' factor,\" she says. \"If we're successful, we help you see something that's obvious once you see it. It's this constant move of helping people step back and see. \"When I look at some of the stuff I do with teenagers, at this point a lot of it has become obvious,\" she says. \"But not when I was making these arguments six years ago.\" Lately, her work has been about explaining new ways of interpreting the behaviour we see online, and understanding that the context of online activity is often more subtle \u2013 and more familiar \u2013 than we first imagine. Last week she outlined some examples at the Supernova conference in San Francisco, including the case of a young man from one of the poorest districts of Los Angeles who was applying to a prestigious American college. The applicant said he wanted to escape the influence of gangs and violence, but the admissions officer was appalled when he discovered that the boy's MySpace page was plastered with precisely the violent language and gang imagery he claimed to abhor. Why was he lying about his motivations, asked the university? He wasn't, says Boyd: in his world, showing the right images online was a key part of surviving daily life. Another example centred on a teenager who killed an abusive parent after signalling her mental state on her MySpace page. While newspapers chased the grim details of her diary, Boyd reached out to the group of friends who were left discussing their anger, confusion and sadness online (she calls it \"digital outreach\"). Understanding what's happening online is especially pertinent while discussions rage about how people's attitude to privacy is changing \u2013 particularly the idea that digital natives have a vastly different approach to privacy from their predecessors. Instead, Boyd says, activities that strike adults as radically new are often more easily understood from the perspective of teenagers. \"Kids have always cared about privacy, it's just that their notions of privacy look very different than adult notions,\" she says. \"Kids don't have the kind of privacy that we assume they do.\" \"As adults, by and large, we think of the home as a very private space \u2013 it's private because we have control over it. The thing is, for young people it's not a private space \u2013 they have no control. They have no control over who comes in and out of their room, or who comes in and out of their house. As a result the online world feels more private because it feels like it has more control.\" Debunking myths The concept of control \u2013 and who has it \u2013 is central to Boyd's work, and it applies not only to debunking myths about teenage behaviour, but also similar ideas that have emerged about the rest of the web. Unlike some prognosticators who preach unstoppable revolution \u2013 including the likes of Chris Anderson, the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and author of The Long Tail and Free \u2013 Boyd suggests that control remains, by and large, in the same places it always did. \"As a technologist, we all like 'techno-utopia', this is the great democratiser,\" she says. \"Sure, we've made creation and distribution more available to anyone, but at the same time we've made those things irrelevant. Now the commodity isn't distribution, it's attention \u2013 and guess what? Who gets attention is still sitting on a power law curve \u2026 we're not actually democratising the whole system \u2013 we're just shifting the way in which we discriminate.\" It's a call to arms that most academic researchers would tend to avoid, but then Boyd admits to treading a fine line between academic and activist. After all, she adds, part of her purpose is to look at the very questions that make us feel uncomfortable. \"Part of it is that as a researcher, everybody's obsessed with Twitter and Facebook, and we've got amateur research out the wazoo,\" she says. \"Plenty of scholars are jumping in and looking at very specific things. The questions I continue to want to ask are the things that are challenging to me: having to sit down and be forced to think about uncomfortable social stuff, it's really hard to get my head around it \u2013 which means it's exactly what I should dive in and deal with.\"",
