  "content": "With local newspapers under pressure during the recession, the final panel at Wednesday's media140 conference looked at how Twitter was affecting news and also new revenue streams and business models to support local journalism. Joanna Geary recently left the Birmingham Post to become web development editor at The Times. She has been actively working with blogs, Twitter and other social media tools in her work as a journalist, and her blog raised her personal profile helping her to make the increasingly difficult jump from regional media to a national newspaper. Some journalists continue to question what social media has to do with journalism, but Geary said that Twitter was one way to find out the priorities and interests of the community that they served. Journalism blogger and lecturer Paul Bradshaw said that five years ago journalists didn't need to worry about distribution, now it was the job of journalists and their community to help distribute journalism. Twitter and other web services opened up new opportunities for people to organise and mobilise. Think of it as flash mob journalism, he said. Entrepreneur Simon Grice saw another possibility for local news that he described similar to local information service Up My Street. He has set up a service on Twitter called BeLocal that will provide news and weather via Twitter based on postcode. People are interested to things happening locally, he said, and added: The media has been signalling the death of local newspapers. Local news can harness this new medium and connect people with things that are happening close to them. I asked the panel how local news could make money. Bradshaw said that Twitter users \"were royally pissed off when\" the service turned off SMS updates. News organisations could set up services to charge for SMS updates. Many technology companies quickly moved in to fill the void and set up premium services, which Bradshaw has covered on his blog, and news organisations could and should have moved to provide such services. However, he sees another bigger problem for news organisations. The biggest problem is the obsession in charging for content. But they never monetised content. They made money from audiences, showing ads to audiences. Twitter has recently said that it plans to make money by selling tools, and Bradshaw thinks that news organisations should also be thinking about selling information tools and services. Geary agreed with Bradshaw that even though it made her shudder as a traditional journalist that she too had realised that news organisations didn't make money selling content but rather selling advertising to the audiences that they served. She said: Audiences are following you because you have something interesting to say. We need to relook at what we're serving people especially in local journalism. We are serving what we can afford to give them rather than what they need. There was a question as to whether citizen journalism was undermining local journalism. Grice said yes it was, but he said that news organisation could find an opportunity if they moved into a new form of local aggregation helping people find information close to them or near a location they had an interest. Individual bloggers could also make money from selling their social media expertise. Panelist Christian Payne, who writes and video blogs at Documentally, said that news organisations are paying people like him to teach their staff how to use Twitter and social media tools. He also said, \"I don't want to have to rely on advertising for everything\" in terms of supporting content. Glocal The conference ended with a presentation by internet entrepreneur Jeff Pulver. He called on the audience to continue experimenting, saying that Google developed their search engine long before they developed their advertising model to support it. He said that the journalists in the audience needed to become reporters in a flat world, where there was no global and local. It meant that filtering became even more important. Earlier in the panel, video blogger and journalist Christian Payne encouraged to think of local in a different way and introduced Gerry Jackson, who is trying to provide independent reporting for Zimbabwe. They had been broadcasting via shortwave radio, but Zimbabwe now is blocking the station's signal. However, they were using SMS alerts to provide news alerts. Payne said that wanted journalists to think about what Twitter and microblogging could do for countries like Zimbabwe where there was no free press. Twitters doesn't work in Zimbabwe, but he said, \"If this changes, we will see something incredible.\"",
