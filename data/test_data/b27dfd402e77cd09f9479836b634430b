  "content": "Going up Marc Jacobs' voice Best vocal cords in fashion. Speaking, not singing. Raspberry rickey Raspberries, lime juice, sparkling water and vodka: a NYE cocktail that detoxifies* while you drink (*sort of). Track pants and pool sliders On trend and perfect with central heating for the in-between lull. Just don't attempt the look outside. Sarah McNamara's Miracle Skin Transformer You'll thank us on New Year's Day. The inevitable Zara dash Embrace it. It's the one-stop shop for that New Year's Eve tux/trousers/camisole/evening blazer. Give yourself 20 minutes and a price limit. Going down Mauve The colour of 2014 has been revealed by Pantone. They call it \"radiant orchid\", we call it mauve. Neither works for us. The word 'method' Because adding that word means something costs 10 times the price it should. To wit: Duchess Kate and her \u00a3600 \"method\" haircut. Standards Last coffee cream? Can't stand them usually\u2026 but go on then. Corporate Twitter accounts doing 'banter' A truly heinous trend. Stop trying to pretend corporations have souls. Tights Bare legs \u2013 ignoring the goosepimples \u2013 are the A-list way to wear skirts this party season. Spend the money you usually spend on hosiery on cab fares."
