  "content": "Salman Rushdie has revealed that he is \"locked in a Scrabble deathmatch series\" with Kylie Minogue on his new Twitter account. Rushdie joined Twitter late last week, forced to tweet under the handle @SalmanRushdie1 after another user snaffled SalmanRushdie. \"Who are you? why are you pretending to be me? Release this username. You are a phoney. All followers please note,\" Rushdie wrote. He quickly began to pick up followers, but the web was initially uncertain whether to believe that the Booker prize-winning author was really on the micro-blogging site. \"Testing to see if it's really you. Name the 2 musical performers who played @ the NYC launch party for LUKA,\" wrote @KimberlyBurnsPR. \"Angela McCluskey and the Little Death, so there!\" replied Rushdie. \"Where did Faiz hide from a mob in 1947?\" asked Time journalist @OmarWaraich. \"Under my aunt Begum Majeed Malik's carpet, in her cellar in Karachi. Now stop it everyone. It's becoming dull,\" replied the author, who this morning changed his status to \"Today we move on from ontological questions. As Popeye the Sailor Man said, I yam what I yam and that's all that I yam.\" Rushdie has taken to Twitter \u2013 which has now verified his account \u2013 with great aplomb. He has picked up more than 16,000 followers already, is following other tweeters from Lisa Appignanesi and Hari Kunzru to Carrie Fisher and Gwyneth Paltrow, and has entered into lively discussions with both fellow authors and fans. Minogue demanded a Scrabble rematch with the author after he said that \"she's good, but I should point out that I'm winning\". \"You are ON. Rematch anyplace, anytime. Bring it,\" said Rushdie. He told the novelist Kathy Lette \u2013 who welcomed him with \"hello Literary Love God\" \u2013 that \"I just handed in revised MS of my memoir, so I have time to waste here\u2026\" \"Brekky? Brunch? Whipped cream orgy? Xxx\" suggested Lette. \"You're too far away. Out of whipped cream range,\" responded Rushdie. After tweeting a new story, A Globe of Heaven \u2013 later posted on his blog \u2013 Rushdie tweeted Bret Easton Ellis, Mia Farrow, Stephen Fry and Margaret Atwood and made plans to meet up with Neil Gaiman. \"Dear world, please follow @SalmanRushdie1. And be nice to him. He writes good books and knows all,\" wrote Gaiman to his 1.6m followers. \"Fanks guvnor yer not so bad yersel,\" replied Rushdie."
