  "content": "Do you tweet to '@YourCity'? If you do, it's likely that you are actually tweeting to someone who had the foresight to register the name when Twitter launched, not the city at all. Take @London, for example. This isn't the UK capital; rather it's London Dailey who designs avatar fashion in Houston, Texas. London hasn't tweeted from her account since August 2014, but a Twitter search reveals that people still tweet to @London all day, every day. In fact, of the 69 cities in the UK, not one city owns its Twitter handle, with some of them being registered to users who live nowhere near their city, such as @Norwich, @Lancaster or @Inverness. @Chichester is registered to Jeremy Chichester, an IT director in Austin, Texas. He's never responded to any city related tweets, and has never been to Chichester, saying \"It's on my list to visit, that's for sure,\" explaining that he knows a bit about the city and people from reading all the tweets. @Gloucester is registered to Kevin Burge who owns County Clearance in Gloucester. Kevin will respond to someone if they tweet him for a restaurant or hotel recommendation, saying, \"I'm passionate about Gloucester, and want to tell people how good Gloucester is.\" He's only had second thoughts about using the Twitter handle once, and that was during the riots in 2011. \"People were tweeting, let's smash up @Gloucester, and I didn't want the police to think it was me tweeting,\" he said. @Hull, @Cambridge and @Winchester are registered to private companies that have nothing to do with their UK city. @Newcastle is registered to Newcastle Brown Ale, but despite their historic tie to the city, you will never see them tweet about it. @Brighton is a regular tweeter about silver jewellery, but it's not local to the city. If you're after a local flavour of Brighton, you'd be better off following @Brightongin, which has branded its bottle using the colour of the seafront's railings and regularly tweets about the city. So should cities be taking control of their Twitter handles, especially ones that have been suspended, such as @Birmingham, @Sheffield or @Westminster? Dan Brewster at creative consultancy Wolff Olins thinks they should. \"Not owning the obvious handle absolutely means the city is down a potentially valuable line of communication,\" he said. \"As with domain names, it's just good communications hygiene for cities to own their name on social platforms. If they don't, someone else will probably snap it up.\" This can happen due to inactivity. According to Twitter this occurs when an account hasn't been logged in or tweeted from in six months. Currently this is a third of all city handles, including @Bath and @Leeds. If you want to contact these cities, you'll needs to use @bathnes or @LeedsCC_Help. But more complicated yet, if you want to contact the UK government, there are a slew of Twitter handles. @UK, though, is registered to a Brit Wiley who has seemingly never used it."
