  "content": "New E4 drama Misfits is to be the first UK programme to have characters tweeting live on Twitter when it is aired next month. The drama, which follows a group of five teenagers who develop superhero powers after being caught in a storm, will post tweets from the characters of Simon, played by Iwan Rheon, who has the power to become invisible and Kelly (Lauren Socha), who can read thoughts. Misfits is being touted as the successor to E4's successful teen drama Skins. Tweets for episode one have been written in advance by a team headed by the drama's lead writer, Howard Overman, and will be posted throughout the hour-long airing of the programme, which starts on 12 November on E4. The Misfits writing team will meet throughout the six-episode run of the series to construct more tweets for Simon and Kelly's characters. \"This is the first time a UK channel has done this and I cannot think of examples where it has been done in other countries,\" said Louise Brown, the Channel 4 head of cross-platform commissioning. \"We know from past experiences that the audiences of the best dramas cannot get enough of them and this is a way of enhancing the experience by giving a new angle to the story. We hope to embrace the fact that more and more of us all sit in front of the the TV with our laptops.\" In addition to the Twitter feed, Simon will post content on Facebook and put mobile phone video footage on his own YouTube channel. The Misfits website, produced by Six to Start and launching tomorrow, will also include pictures from the show's Flickr account. E4 has commissioned an online game called Misfits do a Runner based on the show and created by Preloaded and the drama's producer Clerkenwell Films. \"The point of Misfits is that it is quite playful with the idea of superheroes and we want the games to have the kind of humour that you don't usually get with online games,\" said Brown. \"From the moment we saw the scripts we knew that this was something that would work brilliantly for online audiences.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
