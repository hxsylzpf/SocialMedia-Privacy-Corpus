  "content": "Two men who have been cleared of crimes began a European court case today in an attempt to have samples stored on Britain's DNA database destroyed. Lawyers for the men have asked the European court of human rights to order the removal of the samples. The case concerns a 19-year-old - identified only as S - who was charged with attempted robbery in 2001 but acquitted, and 45-year-old Michael Marper, who was charged with harassing his partner in the same year. The charges were later dropped. It began as Gordon Brown told the Commons that the conviction of Steve Wright, who killed five women in Ipswich, showed the importance of the national DNA database. The prime minister said the database meant people such as Wright, who \"otherwise may go free\", could be captured and convicted, adding that it had led to the prosecution of 452 killers. The database - which holds some 4.5m samples taken during criminal inquiries - is the world's largest. People's data remains on it for life even if they are not prosecuted. Fingerprints and DNA samples were taken from both men and remain stored, even though criminal proceedings against them have been closed. If the men's case is upheld, samples from people who are not convicted - around 13% of those on the register - may have to be destroyed. The two argue that they have been discriminated against and their right to privacy breached. Lawyers said there were concerns about the possible future uses of samples kept on record. They argued that retaining the information cast suspicion on people who had been acquitted of crimes or had their cases dropped. \"This is the most important case on the human rights implication of retaining biometric data,\" Peter Mahy, representing them, said. \"The court will now decide if the current system of retaining DNA from innocent people in the UK is lawful.\""
