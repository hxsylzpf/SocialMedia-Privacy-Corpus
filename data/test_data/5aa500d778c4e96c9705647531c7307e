  "content": "The media pack gathered on Tuesday to meet the new ringmaster of the country's infamous three-ring arena. Happily for Tony Hall, his first time inside the big top proved to be a PR achievement. In an age in which the success of a company is dictated by its capacity to engage in a meaningful dialogue with its customers, the election of Tony Hall as director general of the BBC could not have come at a better time. Tony Hall, aka Baron Hall of Birkenhead, indicates he has the skills to parlay the corporate narrative. When the cameras were on him, he projected the \"you can trust me\" face, despite the best efforts of the Daily Mail to focus on his Marcel Marceau impression. The ground rules for the new DG are simple: ideally, a leader should communicate a vision, establish the rules of engagement and then empower others. However, this is not easy to do. There is a sting. Many can lead when all is well, but real leadership is defined by how one responds when an unexpected crisis arises. The BBC learned this lesson to their detriment in recent months. The NOW economy \u2013 and the demands for total transparency that come with it \u2013 means that it is no longer possible, or acceptable, for companies to hide behind closed doors. In this age, CEOs must be fit for purpose: it is not enough to simply possess an aptitude for bureaucracy: the age of the corporate state is over. The media herd took a mischievous delight in the previous incumbents' PR uneasiness. The bureaucrat George Entwistle took the post of director general during a very troubled time, but it was ultimately what he didn't have, what we PR sages define as \"the stuff\" and his bruskness and laissez-faire attitude to the media that marked his undoing. Hall on the other hand is a warm character who understands the legacy of good media relations and places the reputation of the institution above his own career prospects. He has nothing to prove. Whether these qualities are core strengths or the product of good advice, we cannot know, but it is clear that the man has served a meaningful apprenticeship. Wisely, Hall has manoeuvred his career around some tricky roles at the Royal Opera House and Locog, surviving with an unblemished record and making powerful friends and supporters along the way. Hall is a man who understands the legacy of the BBC brand and has used his time outside the organisation well; he is the type of person who will be in the thick of the fight, and at this point of his career, he isn't looking to stay away from the action. Hall is the kind of character who leads his team into battle from the front and understands the complexities of the task at hand. The key issues Hall will face in the future is tabloid heat and Twitter abuse. Certain publications will never quench their hunger for a negative story, and the BBC has made mistakes in the past by trying to appease them. I didn't get a sense the man will wound easily. He already knows media hounds have a heightened sense of smell for blood, but must learn to ignore them. What Hall will need to do now is put PR at the front of his business without letting it dominate his priorities, understanding the vicissitudes of social media and remaining steadfast in the face of adversity. He will need to focus on the detail and be rigorous in his pre-interview briefings. As Sir David Brailsford recently pointed out on a Advertising Week Europe panel alongside Sir Martin Sorrell, a great leader is defined by their clarity and consistency. Fortunately for Hall, he has no act to follow and is equipped with the assurance to lead. There will be no room for back-peddling or shapeshifting in the face of difficulties. If he can get his internal communications together, Hall has an exciting challenge on his hands: the BBC is a great brand in desperate need of reinvention. Tony Hall faces a \"big challenge\" to take the corporation forward and restore public faith after the Jimmy Savile scandal. I sense he will enjoy this honeymoon period. Alas, it will be short and the big tests will examine his true PR capabilities. @markborkowski"
