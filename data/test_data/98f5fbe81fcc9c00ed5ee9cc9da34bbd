  "content": "When Damian Green was arrested, counterterrorism police lost no time in adding his DNA to the national database. But that routine \u2013 which, like so many measures in Labour's swoop on individual liberty and privacy, was never debated by Parliament \u2013 will be the subject of a ruling by the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights on Thursday. The case concerns two men from Sheffield, who claim that their privacy was breached when police retained their fingerprints, cellular samples and DNA. One, named Michael Marper, was accused of harassing his partner, and the other (known as S) was investigated for burglary. In both cases charges were never brought. The applicants are concerned about the current and future use of the DNA database, and they contend that the presence on the DNA database cast suspicion on them in the future \u2013 in other words, that they have joined a pool of police suspects and will not be treated fairly. The case dates back to August 2004 but only this year did the court decide to hear it. The principle is of vital interest to us all and if the British government is shown to be at fault, it will be an opportunity to focus renewed debate on the stealthy capture of DNA from the innocent. However, as the Register pointed out last year, the judgment is largely redundant because of the emergence of statistical techniques which match DNA on the database to relatives. According to Dr Chris Pounder, a privacy specialist at Pinsent Masons law firm, these techniques use the genetic fact that an individual's DNA sample is related to the DNA of close family members. \"A national DNA database of the future is likely to span 80 per cent to 100 per cent of the population,\" said Dr Pounder. \"The only question is when this will occur.\" Parliament apparently has no interest in alerting the public to invasive technology \u2013 in this matter or in the many other areas where MPs have failed to warn, legislate or regulate. And that speaks to the bigger question about its failure to protect rights in every area of life. Whatever the outcome on Thursday, Britain will continue to suffer from the effects of a spineless and, in matters of technology, ignorant assembly which has lost all sense of its duties and powers. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that without political renewal we are lost as a free society."
