  "content": "Tonight sees one of the biggest events on the London fetish scene's calendar: the Torture Garden[NSFW] birthday ball. It takes place at SEOne, one of London's largest venues. But this year there will be fewer[NSFW] PVC and rubber-clad revellers. That's partly because the recession is biting \u2013 rubber and corsets are expensive \u2013 but also partly because SEOne is one of a growing number of British clubs requiring punters to produce ID that is then scanned and retained. For SEOne, it's a condition of its licence imposed after a shooting at the venue. However the local authority, Southwark, plans to implement the scheme at clubs \u2013 including the venerable Ministry of Sound \u2013 across the borough. It's a deeply illiberal and repressive move, and one that is creeping across London's clubland: the Notting Hill Arts Club requires a scan; and bars in Croydon have been scanning customers since early this year. The rationale behind these schemes is that if there's a crime, the police will be able to see who was at the venue and \u2013 presumably \u2013 make an arrest. But that comes under the same heading as \"if you've nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear?\" It's nonsense. For the fetish crowd, the fear that club owners could misuse clubbers' personal details are particularly acute: fetish clubs aren't illegal, yet they are the kind of thing you might not want your boss to know you're into. And it's not likely to stop violent crime. As one clubber pointed out, \"Do you believe for one moment that someone taking a gun to a club is going to be carrying legitimate ID?\" On its website SEOne makes clear that it's no ID, no entry. And, worse, it says that it will hold the data for \"a minimum of three years\". Torture Garden has, to its credit, negotiated with the club and the local authority to reduce the time frame to just 31 days, but concerns remain. What this means is that a night out with your mates could be turned into an Orwellian nightmare. It's not just the fear that you might lose your driving licence or passport, which you've taken with you to get in to the club, it's also the concern that your identity could be stolen. All that personal data \u2013 dates of birth, places of birth \u2013 are ripe fruit for someone working at a club. And if you're a celeb or a politician with a penchant for spanking, your ID in the hands of an unscrupulous club employee could mean thousands from a tabloid. There are also broader fears. The campaign group NO2ID point out that the growing number of databases that you and I feature on, from shots of your car's licence plate recorded by the national vehicle tracking database to the scan of my passport collected by a little bar in Kensington recently, could one day become part of a much bigger[pdf], linked national identity register. The last thing this vibrant, friendly and \u2013 yes, responsible \u2013 crowd needs is a further clampdown on its freedom to get its legal, consensual kicks. And the last thing any of us need, regardless of our private kinks, is to have even closer surveillance of what we get up to."
