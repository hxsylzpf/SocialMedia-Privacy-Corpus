  "content": "The creators of a website called Is Thatcher Dead Yet? \u2013 set up in June 2010 \u2013 have been receiving threats on Twitter after the death of the former prime minister. Jared Earle, a computer adminstrator, and Antonio Lulic, a musician, created the site which until Monday carried the simple message \"Not yet\" in large black letters and a sentence saying, \"But when she is \u2026 do you want to pay for her funeral?\", linking to a Guardian comment piece from December 2011 in which the left-wing writer Sunny Hundal argued that \"privatising Margaret Thatcher's funeral would be a fitting tribute to her legacy\" . On Monday, after Margaret Thatcher's death was announced the site was changed to say \"Yes\", adding: \"Margaret Thatcher is dead. This lady's not returning.\" It also asked readers: \"How are you celebrating? Let us know using the #nowthatchersdead hashtag on Twitter, or get to one of the parties near you on Facebook.\" It also offered a Spotify playlist \"for the occasion\", adding \"Enjoy!\" But both Earle and Lulic were the target of angry tweets, including some saying they should \"watch their backs\" and \"fingers crossed you're next\". Asked whether he and Lulic hated Thatcher, Earle said: \"That's too simple a question. It's fair to say that we are not fans. While I hated Thatcher and her politics, the site [itself] isn't a 'hate site' and we never tried to profit from it.\" He pointed out that the site does not and never has carried adverts, and that there are no plans to, despite its viewers rocketing from almost nothing in the preceding days to almost 400,000 on Monday. \"We were most definitely not fans of Thatcher,\" he added. \"Not in any imaginable way.\" Another Twitter user, Iain Tatch, remarked ironically to Earle: \"I suspect 'no intention of making a profit' is more offensive to Thatcherism than the actual content of the page.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
