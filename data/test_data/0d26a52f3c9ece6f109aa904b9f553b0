  "content": "\"Be nice about me,\" says Mr Bingo as we shake hands after our interview. A surprising request. You'd have thought he'd have preferred me to be horrible. Mr Bingo is, after all, a virtuoso of unpleasantness, an illustrator who specialises in turning hatred into art. Sure enough, when I check my phone after cycling home, Mr Bingo is already trolling me. \"I see you don't have a profile picture,\" says one tweet. \"All you need to do is rotate that egg 180 degrees and it's pretty much your head.\" It's funny because it's true: I am bald. And it's hurtful, too. \"You're a fucking prick, mate,\" says another. Whatever, I've had worse from below-the-line Guardian-reading nutjobs (Sorry! I mean valued members of our online community). \"Fuck me,\" reads a final tweet, \"you've flourished on here since October 2013.\" Now he's being ironic: unlike Mr Bingo, I'm not into social media. Mr Bingo, by contrast, has 29,600 followers and has notched up 22,600 tweets. He is tweeting his way to fame and wealth. To be fair, I had asked for all this. I wanted be trolled by Mr Bingo to experience how it feels to be one of the 36-year-old's paying clients. Because people pay to be abused by Mr Bingo. \"It all started one night in my studio in 2011 when I'd had a few drinks ,\" he recalls. \"I went on Twitter and said I will send a postcard with an offensive message to the first person who replies to this.\" Two minutes later, he had 50 replies. The winner was Jonathan Hopkins from Forest Hill in London, to whom Mr Bingo sent a postcard that read: \"Fuck you, Jonathan, fuck you and fuck your shit legs.\" It was accompanied by a drawing of his legs. Mr Bingo had never seen Jonathan's legs, which he depicted as hideous sawn-off cylinders. It's quite possible that Jonathan has shapely legs like a young Shirley MacLaine. \"Or no legs at all,\" adds Mr Bingo. But that's how hatred works: it thrives on ignorance and injustice. Three days later, Mr Bingo decided to set up a hate mail service, sending anyone who tweeted their address and paid \u00a350 (plus postage) a customised abusive postcard. \"Essentially, what I was doing was enabling strangers to pay me to tell them to fuck off.\" Don't tell me you're not envious of him for having the idea of converting hate into cash. He's tapping into a culture of ubiquitous hatred, making money out of people's sadomasochistic desires, in the manner of a social-media savvy dominatrix. \"I'm living the dream,\" he laughs when I suggest this to him. \"Or at least a dream.\" Trolling is a competitive sport for Mr Bingo, who, in his day job, works as an illustrator. \"If I'm doing some illustration, I have to be the best. Same with tweeting, same with sending out hate mail.\" He denies, however, that his hate mail and trolling are sadistic. \"All this is comedy. It's clear that the hate mail is a joke and that I'm only sending it to people who want it.\" Once he started sending out hate mail, though, he couldn't cope with the demand. Couldn't you have hired abusive helpers? You know, like how Damien Hirst had minions to do his dots? \"I'm a control freak. I couldn't trust anybody else. And in any case, people love that it's from me. What you're buying is a piece of art.\" Mr Bingo's favourite, of the 958 hate mails he's sent, is a postcard depicting some twerp capsizing into the river with the message: \"Dear David, You are shit with boats, Mr Bingo.\" I prefer the one depicting a naked fat man riding down the pavement on a pig. He sent that to Robert in Rugby with the message: \"You have been caught being a weird cunt on Google Street View.\" What postal workers make of delivering this filth to middle England (and beyond) is a mystery. Mr Bingo's hope is that it gives them a laugh. I wonder what Sara of London thought when she got a drawing of a fat-faced, spotty woman on a postcard with the message: \"Your online dating profile picture is dishonest.\" Perhaps she cried. More likely she framed it and hung it on the wall. Sensibly, there's a disclaimer in the small print: \"Mr Bingo is not responsible or liable for anyone who suffers any mental damage or suicidal feelings as a result of receiving Hate Mail.\" Personally, I'm jealous of Benjamin King, to whom Mr Bingo sent a postcard featuring a mock-up of the Daily Mail front page with the headline: \"Is Benjamin King the UK's biggest wanker?\" There are, however, four kinds of abuse Mr Bingo doesn't do. \"I don't do homophobia, racism, religion or disability. I don't mind poking fun at people's religion, but I don't want to be Charlie Hebdo'd.\" Do you get abused in return? \"I get a lot of hate mail from strangers.\" Someone sent him a swiss roll with \"fucker\" iced on it. \"I didn't eat it.\" Another sent him some cross-stitching that read: \"You draw like a girl.\" \"I don't know if that's abuse or a compliment.\" And online? \"People tell me to fuck off all the time, but in a nice way. At least, I think they're being nice.\" As an illustrator, Mr Bingo's clients include publishers like Dorling Kindersley, the New York Times and Wired, not to mention the Byron burger chain and Runners Need. Does the hate-mail project make your straight clients queasy? \"Not really. I'm known for being edgy.\" I look at Mr Bingo as he sips his pint in this London pub. Why would a middle-class boy from a nice village in Kent (Farage territory, he tells me) raised by a Daily Mail-reading estate agent father and a non-Daily Mail-reading speech therapist mother, who studied illustration and graphic design at Bath University, with an on-trend haircut and high-end Paul Smith shirt, become an entrepreneur in the industry of hate? \"I don't think I'm a hateful person,\" he says. What does his family think of him making a living out of hate mail? \"My parents like it but think it's unnecessarily sweary. I think they're wrong. Swearing is funny.\" Mr Bingo got his name after winning \u00a3141.26 at a Gala bingo club in Maidstone in 1998. Later, at uni, he and some other students decided to call each other by nicknames and so he became Mr Bingo. \"I changed my name to Mr Bingo and then signed all my work that way.\" Didn't your teachers complain? \"I don't think they noticed.\" He won't tell me his original name, in order to conserve the aura of mystery. Are you cultivating a persona or brand image? \"I don't think so. It's not a persona. It's me. I'm very open about who I am. Even my mobile number is on my website.\" Mr Bingo has stopped sending hate mail for the time being. He's devoting his energies to a Kickstarter project. Just launched, it's aim is to fund a book of his 156 favourite hate-mail postcards entitled Hate Mail: The Definitive Collection. The book will look, says his blurb, \"like a pretentious art book but without the pretentious price tag\" and be \"the kind of thing that some cunt in west London would be proud to get out at a dinner party\". Pledge \u00a325 or more and you'll get a copy of the book with a personal abusive message. Pledge \u00a350 and you could get the troll package: book plus a commitment from Mr Bingo to \"troll you on all forms of social media for one week, in an attempt to ruin your life\". We're meeting in the Masque Haunt, a Wetherspoons pub on Old Street, so I can test out another of his Kickstarter pledges. For \u00a3150, you can go for a date with Mr Bingo in this very pub, with its splendid patterned carpet, chicken wing-based meal deal and Barbara Windsor memorabilia. He will pay for unlimited house wine and a bar snack of your choice. Mr Bingo, I'm pleased to report, is a thoughtful date, who keeps his hands to himself and pays for the drinks. Amazingly, so far no one has signed up for the option. \"Is the internet 'down' or something?\" he tweeted crossly. Mr Bingo currently has 2,267 backers and \u00a383,520 pledged \u2013 well in excess of his \u00a335,000 target. As of today, there are only 13 days left to make a pledge. \"If I hit \u00a390,000, I might give out a nice bookmark. If I hit \u00a3100,000, I might give \u00a31.50 for every backer to charity. I've got over 2,000 backers, so that would be more than \u00a33,000.\" Such generosity is perhaps a good retort to the only serious hate mail Mr Bingo has ever received himself. He shows me a message on Instagram complaining that he is using Kickstarter for something that has no justifiable social purpose. Better he raised money for wells in Africa or something. \"I disagree,\" says Mr Bingo. \"I think hate mail is spreading a lot of joy around.\" mr-bingo.org.uk",
