  "content": "How has technology changed the working life of a historian? It has transformed it in many ways. Digitisation of archives means we can search records and primary source material from the comfort of our own offices. Some old-school historians are furious about this, actually. A perk of the job used to be that you could travel abroad and work in an archive somewhere quite glamorous for weeks on end. Now we stay at home and do it online. For me, though, even more exciting is how it has allowed us to reach out to people. It's made history collaborative and accessible. I can tweet about what I'm working on, and people will suggest ideas or come up with documents. It has opened a pipeline between geeky history people like me and the rest of the world. We used to just publish in academic journals, now we can share our research with huge numbers of people. And I love showing off and telling people what I'm up to! Has it changed making history for TV? Massively. I've made programmes with dramatic reconstruction, CGI, stop-frame, everything. I've just finished making a BBC film about myths of the first world war and the whole thing is CGI animation. It doesn't involve me walking around a field, being a bore. There are visual representations of how many people died, action sequences, funny bits, cool music \u2026 It's profoundly exciting. But the beauty of it is, man or woman walking around a field hasn't died out either. That's still going on. So are radio lectures. A rising tide floats all boats. Technology just gives you more choice. It allows you to work out the best way to engage an audience and bring alive what you're trying to describe. What's the most impressive hi-tech artefact you've come across? If you're interested in innovation and technology, that applies to all eras. When you handle an 18th-century Brown Bess musket or a first world war Vickers machine gun \u2013 weapons spring to mind because they're often at the cutting edge of technological change \u2013 or John Harrison's marine chronometer, they take your breath away. It's unbelievably exciting to witness something that has changed our world. What's your favourite gadget? My BlackBerry. I'm one of the few who haven't converted to iPhone. Touchscreens are infuriatingly rubbish for writing and editing pieces of any length, but the BlackBerry keyboard is great for that when you're in a battlefield or not near your laptop. If I ever spot another middle-aged square with a BlackBerry, I always assume they're a journalist or writer of some kind. People try to tell me, \"Apple have run efficiency tests and an elephant can accurately type their name on the new touchscreen blah blah\". But that's a PR exercise in a lab in Stanford. In the real world where I live, I can type and edit much faster on a Blackberry. Are you into apps? Yes, what an extraordinary thing they are. I use tools such as Archaeology and Ordnance Survey MapFinder. There's an awesome app called Home Front Legacy where people can log on to first world war sites countrywide. I've produced a series of Timeline apps myself and caused a furore for saying that, in many respects, they're better than books. They're not just text but have video, maps and newsreel archive. It's basically a book with added information, usability and dynamism. But I still got lots of abuse for saying it, obviously! What's your most expensive gadget? Probably my iPad mini with 64GB memory. Camera-wise, I tend to use my trusty old BlackBerry one, embarrassingly enough. I'm not really a watch guy but I'm getting into wearable tech and might buy one of those Samsung smartwatches soon. Bought any gadgets you've never used? I had a Nokia Communicator in the late 1990s. I thought it was the answer, but it was too big for a phone and too small for a laptop. Do you use text-speak or emojis? Never. I see it as a challenge to stay grammatical in a confined space. But I can see why the odd smiley face is useful because sometimes people think I'm being rude or sarcastic. My mum is Canadian so I often find myself replying \"Thanks, buddy\" which can sound passive-aggressive. You're @thehistoryguy on Twitter \u2013 do you love or loathe it? Anyone who doesn't love Twitter is an idiot. They're being a ridiculous Luddite or taking a stance. Twitter is a way of filtering the news. You tailor your own timeline so who you follow reflects your interests. Mine is populated by politics and history. It's a phenomenal news service, far better for me than any conventional news outlet because I built it myself. I've made new friends on Twitter, interacted with some incredible people, had some of my most satisfying professional experiences and found out lots of fascinating things about the world. It's been a hugely enriching experience. How about other social networks? I'm a big fan of the streamlined, uncluttered nature of Instagram. It does the best bits of Facebook without any of the tiresome interruptions. I've also just got into Pheed, which is the last thing I need \u2013 another social network. What's your all-time favourite computer game? I've never really been a gamer because I know I'd get addicted, but I did go through a phase of playing Civilisation as a student. I got obsessed with empire-building and didn't leave the house or answer the phone for days. Games that allow you to think you're Napoleon are like crack for me. Had I been born a 1,000 years ago, I'd be carving out an empire somewhere. Have you tried 3D printing? No, I haven't. I subscribe to the theory that there are three different types of technology. Stuff from before you were born, which is brilliant and why even question it. Then there's technology invented between the ages of 10 and 30, which is exciting and you're going to harness it to make your fortune. Then there's technology invented after you're 35, which is completely pointless and stupid. I'm at that tipping point now, but I don't want to become that guy. My dad always embraced technology, so I'm going to try too. I find 3D printing scary and other-worldly but I'll force myself to get into it. The idea that communities can print solar panels is game-changingly brilliant but every time I read about 3D printing, I think I'm going to have a heart attack. Do you feel the same with Google Glass? I'm a huge believer in wearable and biometric tech. I look forward to the day when I can walk down the street totally naked, and all my passport, money, keys and communication tools are in my head, fingertips and eyeballs. I presume it'll become Google contact lenses before long, then count me in. If you could time travel, where would you go? I'd take a helicopter over the battle of Trafalgar to see all the big ships. The idea of these massive wooden floating fortresses blasting each other at point-bank range in the middle of the ocean is so bizarre, I'd love to see what that looked like. I'd also love to visit the 18th century when the industrial revolution kicked off. But my God, you'd love to get back home. We have no idea how lucky we are to be born into the modern world."
