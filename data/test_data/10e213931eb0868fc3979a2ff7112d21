  "content": "Put the confetti back in storage and tell the vicar his services won't be needed. Screen legend Elizabeth Taylor is not getting married for the ninth time. Taylor took to Twitter yesterday to deny a report in US Weekly suggesting that wedding bells were set to ring for her and manager Jason Winters. \"The rumours regarding my engagement simply aren't true,\" she wrote. \"Jason is my manager and dearest friend. I love him with all my heart.\" Taylor, 78, has had seven previous husbands \u2013 she married Richard Burton twice. A source had told US Weekly: \"It's no secret that they've been together forever and are in love, so it wouldn't be a surprise if they were engaged. Right now they are keeping it between them.\" Winters, 49, also represents Janet Jackson. There were similar rumours regarding his relationship with Taylor three years ago, which were also denied. Taylor has been single since her divorce from construction worker Larry Fortensky in 1996."
