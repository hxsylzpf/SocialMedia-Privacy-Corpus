  "content": "Once upon a time, new books seemed so significant they were given a kind of birthday. New titles were assigned an official publication date, typically a Thursday, a practice that survives only in the most notional sense. Nothing says more about the changed fortunes of the book than the contrast between then and now. When writers such as Iris Murdoch and Anthony Burgess were still alive, the publication date was sacrosanct. If a bookseller risked \"early selling\" of a hot new title, all hell broke loose. Some publishers, I remember, would even patrol the Charing Cross Road in search of miscreants. Bizarrely, it was held that new books should not be displayed for early sale. Before publication day, every new book \u2013 novel, biography, poems, history \u2013 was invisible. After the magic moment of its release into the world it could be praised or damned at will. Then, as now, its fate would be decided in a few days. The reviews that mattered would appear in the national dailies, the Sunday broadsheets, including the Observer, and magazines such as the Spectator, News Statesman, and the Listener. A handful of big-name reviewers, Stephen Spender and Roy Jenkins on the Observer, could make or break a book. One or two BBC radio programmes might join in. Otherwise, that was it. Thereafter, it was down to word of mouth. A generation ago, British literary culture was so homogenous that metropolitan coverage held the key to the reading public's response. Moreover, power was concentrated in the hands of a few literary gatekeepers. Even a belated re-evaluation of a new novel, for instance, Lord of the Flies, could only happen through the exercise of metropolitan taste. EM Forster's praise for William Golding's first novel in the Observer's books of the year in 1954 became the tipping point in its subsequent success. Today, such an elitist critical pas de deux seems as remote as the Regency. Word of mouth is everything.There are more new books than ever (close to 190,000 in 2010) and they tumble from the presses in a raucous profusion. Reviewing is random and decentralised. Publishers pay big money to get their books into the front of bookshops, never mind the day of the week. In the middle of this cacophony the bewildered author sits wondering about the fate of his or her book. How does the solitary writer attract attention in the age of mass culture? One answer is to mobilise the tools of mass culture and exploit social media. This is becoming a trend. Last week a new website, bibliotastic.com, was launched to help connect aspiring authors to a wider audience. In the words of its founder, James Crawshaw, bibliotastic.com aims \"to be to the book market what YouTube has become to the online video: a forum for writers to publish their work for free and for readers to decide what they like for themselves\". Further up the literary food chain, published writers in search of readers are increasingly experimenting with social media. At the commercial end of the business \u2013 and what writer does not want to sell books? \u2013 you find a new class of literary entrepreneur promoting themselves as a brand as much as actually sitting in lonely composition. Rosie Sayers, the director of Reform, a new digital promotion company, believes that every new book should have its own website, with excerpts from the book, interviews with the author and opportunities to buy the book. Writers should be blogging daily, as well as promoting themselves through Facebook and Twitter. \"Authors,\" she says, \"should engage with whatever their readers say about them. Younger authors recognise how important an online presence is.\" Sayers believes that there's a new generation of readers who crave an interactive experience with writers. Is it not enough to read and enjoy the book in private? Apparently not. In search of \"a new level of participation\",  some writers are now inviting their online followers to \"choose the title\" of their work in progress, and have begun to open Twitter accounts in the name of their new books' characters. \"If you don't engage with the social media,\" claims Sayers, \"you'll get left behind.\" Or, as EM Forster might have put it, only connect. Bath's Bible bashers have Bragg on their side As the Bath literature festival gears up for its landmark nonstop reading of the King James Bible at the church of St Michael's Without, festival director James Runcie is finalising his list of thespian readers. The roll call of British theatrical talent slated to participate in this 400th birthday celebration includes Jonathan Pryce, Harriet Walter and Timothy West, who will bring proceedings to a close with a reading of The Book of Revelations. Melvyn Bragg will not be reading, but he will be contributing to the celebrations with his latest publication, The Book of Books: The Radical Impact of the King James Bible, which, he says, has driven \"the making of the English-speaking world over the last 400 years\". The title page reveals that this is a family affair: it's dedicated to his daughter, the Rev Marie-Elsa Bragg. Genghis Khan leads the charge of oddest books The recession continues to wreak havoc with the book trade. Borders has gone bust, and several international bookselling chains are in deep trouble. The world's publishers, however, continue to bring out new titles as if the party hadn't stopped. I am indebted to the Bookseller for the \"oddest book title of the year\" shortlist, which includes 8th International Friction Stir Welding Symposium Proceedings; The Generosity of the Dead (a study of organ procurement); The Italian's One-Night Love-Child; What Colour is Your Dog?; Myth of The Social Volcano (perceptions of inequality in contemporary China); and (my favourite \u2013 surely the winner) Managing a Dental Practice the Genghis Khan Way by Michael Young. What's it about? Running a dentist like a warlord, of course."
