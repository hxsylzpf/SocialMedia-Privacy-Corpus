  "content": "Derek Wyatt MP suggests that the fact that the BBC is yet to create anything similar to Facebook or Joost is in some way a failure (Letters, December 22). I would argue that the failure is in Wyatt's understanding of the times we live in. The BBC is a world-class information provider, and one of the most respected journalistic sources; one of the reasons this continues to be the case is its internet offering. Instead of trying to pre-empt the next big thing, it has, very successfully, used the internet to provide a balanced view of world affairs that builds on the work of the World Service. While Wyatt may be right that the current generation don't want their content \"in half-hour or hourly bytes\" (a sweeping generalisation which the popularity of programmes such as Skins and Heroes might disprove), they also don't seem to want Joost or Facebook: the former has a tiny user base despite acres of hype, and the latter is more popular with the over-35s. The BBC's partnership with Bebo shows that it understands where the next generation of licence payers are \"living\" online much better than most MPs. Ciar\u00e1n Norris Altogether Digital Derek Wyatt confuses the carrier with the content. Napster, iPods, Google, MySpace, YouTube and Wikipedia don't make anything - they just give us different ways to access content. The BBC makes more content than all of them combined, and you'll find a lot of it on people's iPods, on YouTube and indexed on Google. Despite the massive overhyping of the significance of user-generated content, programmes made by professionals funded by broadcasters like the BBC are massively more popular in eyeballs per hour than, say, YouTube, and - unlike it - they generate revenues to pay for their production. Without them we would have nothing to watch but endless cats-falling-five-storeys and mash-ups of old TV shows. As for not being a leader, the BBC's websites, downloads and interactive TV are more advanced than any other broadcaster in Europe - a benefit of the licence fee that Wyatt overlooks.
