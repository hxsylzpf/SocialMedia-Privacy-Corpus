  "content": "Sue MacGregor, the former presenter of BBC Radio 4's Today programme, has emerged as a contender to become chairman of the press complaints commission. Ms MacGregor, 60, would be an ironic choice for the role, as the only time she fell asleep in 18 years on the Today programme was during an interview with the chairman of the PCC. The Times today reported that Ms MacGregor, who retired from Today last month, is to be approached about the \u00a3156,000 part-time post. One senior industry source said she would be an ideal choice to head the independent watchdog, which is constantly fighting the threat of statutory regulation of the press. \"Sue MacGregor is liked and respected within her profession,\" the insider tells the Times. \"She knows about all the games that celebrities and politicians get up to, and understands all the tricks of the journalistic trade. \"She is no pushover. Having survived at the highest level of the BBC for two decades, she is a survivor and can play office politics,\" the source adds. Lord Wakeham stepped down as chairman of the PCC at the end of January over his role as a director of Enron, the bankrupt and scandal-ridden US energy group. Although his departure was described as a temporary move at the time, the Tory peer is not expected to return to his post. Ms MacGregor was interviewing the late Lord McGregor of Durris, the first chairman of the PCC, in 1992, when she fell asleep at the microphone. Other contenders for the demanding role tipped by the Times include Elizabeth Filkin, the first woman parliamentary standards regulator, who was recently forced out of her post by an alleged whispering campaign by some MPs. The 61-year-old ruffled Westminster feathers when she went public over the affair, describing the moves to undermine her as a \"shouting campaign.\" \"Filkin is well-qualified for the post, but the fact she has made serious enemies at Westminster will be a serious handicap to her chances,\" the senior industry source said. Britain's most senior civil servant, Sir Richard Wilson, 59, the outgoing cabinet secretary, is another contender, along with high-profile QC David Pannick."
