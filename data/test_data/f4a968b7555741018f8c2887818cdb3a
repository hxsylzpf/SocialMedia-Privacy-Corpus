  "content": "We are keen to continue to investigate what it means to be open with our building, open with our technology and open to a wider audience of developers. As part of that we have arranged some more organised events during the next few developer drop-ins. First, on Tuesday 12 July, we have Benji Lanyado, one of our travel writers and the lead in developing TwiTrips, where he travels to a city and asks people on Twitter to recommend places to go. He'll be talking about the use of Twitter in his work life and how journalists can harness Twitter and present it to the online audience of a media company. Secondly, Adewale Oshineye, Google's European developer advocate for social, is coming in on Tuesday 19 July. Adewale has been working on DeveloperExperience.org and is part of the team at Google that is changing the way that APIs for systems such as Latitude, Buzz and Plus are built. He'll be showing us the next-generation of Google's client libraries and asking for feedback. You don't have to stop work in order to see the talks, but if you want to use our building as a base to work from, then we are still encouraging you to come down on Tuesdays and you are welcome to find yourself a nook in which to work. We'll be continuing the developer drop-ins throughout August, where we'll have an exciting lineup of talks that we'll confirm closer to the time. You can sign up for a session, no commitment necessary, in the form below and we hope together we can explore the future. Sign up here",
