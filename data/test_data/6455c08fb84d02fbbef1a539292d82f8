  "content": "A woman accused of creating a fictitious persona on MySpace to bully a 13-year-old neighbour who then took her own life, was acquitted yesterday on the most serious charge that she had accessed a computer without authorisation in order to inflict emotional distress. But Lori Drew, 49, was convicted on three lesser misdemeanour crimes of accessing a computer without authorisation. She faces up to one year in prison and a fine of $100,000 (\u00a365,233) for each charge. The trial, thought to be the first one for cyber-bullying in the US, stemmed from the 2006 suicide of Megan Meier, 13, at her home in the St Louis suburb of Dardenne Prairie, Missouri. Megan hanged herself after receiving a message on MySpace from a boy she had befriended named Josh Evans. But Evans was a fake, created by Drew, her daughter Sarah, 13, and Ashley Grills, 18, one of Drew's employees. Calling the outcome \"a compromise verdict\", Drew's lawyer Dean Steward said: \"The US attorney's office never should have brought this case, and I think that was the message from the jury.\" The message at the root of the case was sent by Megan to Grills. In it, she suggested that Drew's daughter was ugly and a lesbian. Angered that Megan had been \"spreading lies\" about her daughter, and eager to \"expose\" her, Lori Drew together with Grills and Drew's daughter concocted a plan to humiliate Megan and to find out what else she was saying online. They came up with 16-year-old \"Josh Evans\", who had recently moved to the area. They created a MySpace profile for the fictitious boy, and even included a picture of the tousle-haired \"Evans\" posing bare-chested. Megan, a young, impressionable girl prone to depression, was hooked. The two began to exchange messages. At one point, said Grills, Drew suggested arranging for the boy to meet Megan at a local shopping mall. Grills, Drew and her daughter Sarah would then \"pop out\" and tease Megan. But what may have started as a prank soon turned sinister. Possibly motivated by a desire to end the deception, Grills sent Megan a final message from Josh on October 16 2006. It told her that \"the world would be a better place without you\" and urged her to \"have a [lousy] rest of your life\". Megan's response was poignant in the extreme. \"You are the kind of boy a girl would kill herself over,\" she allegedly wrote. Shortly afterwards, she hanged herself. Prosecutors sought to portray Drew, whose daughter had been a classmate of Megan and who lived nearby, as the mastermind of the plot. \"The defendant knew that she was dealing with a troubled little girl who was extremely fragile, and yet she did it anyway,\" prosecutor Mark Krause told the court. \"It went beyond a simple prank to get her so hooked on this young man that she would be crushed when she found out he didn't exist.\" Megan's mother, Tina, testified that her daughter was taking medication for depression and had tried to take her life before. Krause argued that Drew bragged about the scheme, and continued to talk about her involvement after Megan's death. He cited the testimony of hairdresser Dawn Chu, who told the court that Drew had come into her salon on the day of Megan's wake. When Chu asked her why she was going to the wake given the allegations against her, Drew said: \"It's not like I pulled the trigger.\" Thomas O'Brien, the prosecutor in Los Angeles who brought the case after prosecutors in Missouri decided there was no law under which Drew could be charged in her home state, pursued the theme of Drew's disregard for Megan in presenting his closing argument before the jury. \"Folks, that's Josh Evans right there,\" O'Brien told the court. \"Lori Drew decided to humiliate a child. The only way she could harm this pretty little girl was with a computer.\" But the defence attempted to bring jurors' minds back to the legal basis for the prosecution. \"If you hadn't heard the indictment read to you, you'd think this was a homicide case,\" Steward said. \"And it's not a homicide case. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a computer case, and that's what you need to decide.\" Drew was charged under the computer use and fraud act with one count of conspiracy and three counts of accessing computers without authorisation. The act is typically used to prosecute hacking or trademark theft cases. But prosecutors decided to charge Drew on the basis that she had violated the terms of MySpace's user agreement, which prohibits the use of false names, the harassment of other users and the soliciting of personal information from minors. But some observers are concerned that application of the case to an instance of cyber-bullying could have broad ramifications, leaving whistle-blowers, for example, open to prosecution for violating online terms of service. The concern that the law could be applied too broadly and harm those it is intended to protect was voiced by Steward. \"Nobody reads these things, nobody,\" he said. \"How can you violate something when you haven't even read it? End of case. The case is over.\"",
