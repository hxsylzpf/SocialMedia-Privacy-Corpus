  "content": "The News of the World made a high court apology today to ex-footballer Lee Sharpe and a model over false claims that they had sex in front of a crowd of friends. The paper has agreed to pay damages to the pair as well as meeting the legal costs they have run up since they took action over story, which was published on September 11. Sharpe, who played for Manchester United and starred earlier this year on ITV reality show Celebrity Love Island, was taking part in a charity car rally last summer when he met Louise Redpath, a university student and model. The News of the World alleged the pair had sex in front of friends at a party in Los Angeles during the eight-day, 3,000-mile Bullrun rally. Their solicitor-advocate, David Price, told the high court today that the News of the World had admitted the claims were untrue. \"Mr Sharpe and Ms Redpath have never had sex, let alone in front of a crowd of onlookers,\" he said. \"They were both immensely hurt and distressed by the article. \"Ms Redpath and her family have received abusive comments from members of the public accusing her of sexual promiscuity. Moreover, following publication in the News of the World, the allegation was repeated widely in the media and on the internet.\" He said the defendants would have preferred that the article had not been published but now felt \"suitably vindicated\" by the News of the World's apology. Joanna Workman, the solicitor acting for the News of the World's owner, News Group, said the paper offered its \"sincere apologies\". \"The defendant accepts that these allegations are false,\" she said. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
