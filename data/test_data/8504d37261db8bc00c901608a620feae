  "content": "The editor of the Sunday People, Neil Wallis, claims he was misled by the photographer who supplied nude pictures of Radio 1 DJ Sara Cox on holiday. \"The truth is that I made a mistake, simple as that,\" says Wallis of the decision to publish the photographs, which has left him facing a privacy lawsuit from Cox. In a letter in today's Guardian, prompted by an article earlier this week by the broadsheet's editor, Alan Rusbridger, Wallis appears to shift responsibility for the decision to use the photographs to Jason Fraser, whose agency provided the images. \"It was a mistake based on information from a well-known and extremely experienced photojournalist about the circumstances in which the picture was taken, information which led me to believe there was no danger of breaching the PCC code of practice,\" he writes. \"After we published the pictures, Sara Cox's representatives complained to the PCC and asked for an apology, which we gave after discovering the facts were different from what we had been lead to believe.\" Publication of the photographs, showing the Radio 1 DJ and her husband, Jon Carter, nude on their honeymoon, enraged Cox, who initially complained to the press complaints commission. An apology printed in the paper failed to dampen her anger, and she has hired Keith Schilling, the lawyer who advised model Naomi Campbell in her lawsuit against the Mirror. Wallis claimed at the time that he believed the island where Cox was holidaying in the Seychelles to be public, although it later emerged it was only open to private paying guests. He also used the familiar justification that Cox had previously courted the attention of the newspapers. In the letter, Wallis admits he \"made a mistake\"."
