  "content": "The Ordnance Survey consulted mapping agencies in Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden and the US in compiling its study into possible financial models, it has revealed. However, OS considers that \"there are no wholly equivalent \u00adorganisations ... given [our] range of scales of mapping and other activities\", according to data that it released under a Freedom Of Information (FOI) request from the Guardian. Attention was immediately drawn to the identity of an unnamed \"internationally recognised expert in geographical information and national mapping\" who OS said had reviewed its study and \"agreed with the analysis and conclusions\". This led immediately on the Free Our Data blog to the question, posed by William Allbrook, \"I imagine like many experts he/she will have had well-informed opinions. It would have been very easy for OS to choose one that was onside rather than one who might rigorously question the current trading fund status ... Would anyone other than me be curious to reveal his or her true identity?\" OS responded that it is trying to establish whether the person mentioned was happy for their name to be released. The Guardian's FOI request was submitted on 25 May. Last Tuesday, 23 June, was the final day on which the data could be released by the FOI deadline. As this section went to press the second part of the FOI request \u2013 a copy of the analysis by OS of possible models \u2013 had not been released, although it was understood to be in preparation. OS said that the eight organisations studied \"included organisations with a wide range of data pricing policies: free, partial cost recovery (of data dissemination costs), total cost recovery (data \u00adcollection plus dissemination costs) and market price (cost recovery plus trading margin)\". OS, as a \"trading fund\" wholly owned by government but obliged to \u00adgenerate a return on capital, in effect \u00adoperates the last model \u2013 so its proposed model is unchanged. Further analysis of responses, and of the \"International Comparison of \u00adGeographical Information Trading Models Study\" will appear on the Free Our Data blog later this week.
