  "content": "Labour peer Lord Mandelson has waded into the row over the naked Prince Harry photos, saying it highlights the potential damaging effect of the internet on society. Mandelson said he believes Prince Harry's privacy was breached by the photos but the real issue is not about the Sun's defiant decision to print the photos but the lack of regulation of the internet. \"The bigger question is how the domestic media market can be made economic and subject to any form of regulation in an era when, a click away, there is access to information that respects no national boundaries and the laws of no single national parliament or the basic standards of conventional journalism,\" he wrote in a letter to today's Financial Times. He said it is difficult to see a future for newspapers when the internet has \"ransacked\" their business. \"It is hard to see how some of the best-known sources of quality English-language journalism \u2013 the Times, New York Times, the Guardian spring to mind \u2013 will ever make money again,\" he added. The Sun last week said it was \"absurd\" to continue the British black out and defended publishing two photos of the naked prince on the grounds that they were freely available across the internet, including on the websites of mainstream media organisations such as CNN. Mandelson said how \"we come to grips with the fact that the internet is giving public access to uncorroborated, undigested and unmediated news, all in the name of free speech, is becoming one of the defining issues of the 21st century\". His remarks come as the debate about the Sun's decision to publish the photos of a naked Prince Harry in a Las Vegas hotel room rumbles on. The Press Complaints Commission has now received more than 3,600 complaints, largely from members of the British public. However, the PCC has not received a complaint from Prince Harry's representatives, despite a warning last week from Prince Charles's personal solicitors that there was no justification in English law for publication. Royal aides are said to still be undecided as whether to press ahead with an official complaint. The PCC normally only acts on complaints from parties involved in an issue. The Times reports royal sources on Wednesday saying the issue has to be discussed further with Prince Charles' senior officials. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
