  "content": "An Ohio man was arrested on Thursday and accused of calling for violence against American military members in the name of the Islamic State, federal prosecutors announced. Terrence McNeil, 25, was charged in district court in Akron with one count of solicitation of crime of violence, related to his social media posts in support of the jihadi militant group, also known as Isis or Isil. According to the FBI agent who wrote an affidavit against him, McNeil frequently posted on Twitter and Tumblr accounts about his allegiance to Isis. McNeil reblogged posts from Isis propaganda and posted hundreds of his own images, gifs and messages, according to the affidavit. The Tumblr account cited by the FBI and attributed to \"Abu-Fil\" was still active as of Thursday afternoon, and includes hundreds of images, gifs and written posts. The posts include quotations of jihadi leaders, gifs and memes involving automatic weapons and condemning \"non-believers\". The account has no name attached, with its owner listing themselves as \"23. Muslim. Northeast US.\" Posts also include relatively inane fare, such as pictures of mosques, meals and elephants. The account user often posted about or sermons by Anwar al-Awlaki, an American who joined al-Qaida in the mid-2000s and was killed by a drone strike in 2011. One gif dated to 24 September shows members of the US military, a handgun, and the command \"kill them wherever you find them\". Text that appears in the gif reads: \"O Brothers in America, know that the jihad against the crusaders is not limited to the lands of the Khilafah,\" an allusion to the so-called caliphate under the rule of Isis in Syria and Iraq. The gif then shows the names and addresses of purported US military personnel, and has text that reads: \"Kill them in their own lands, behead them in their own homes, stab them to death as they walk their streets thinking that they are safe.\" \"While we aggressively defend first amendment rights, the individual arrested today went far beyond free speech by reposting names and addresses of 100 US service members, all with the intent to have them killed,\" FBI agent Stephen Anthony said in a statement. The FBI took a tortuous path to link McNeil to various social media accounts, the affidavit shows. Agent Shawn Hare testified that the agency was able to link eight suspended Twitter accounts to McNeil \u2013 most titled some variation of \"LoneWolfe\". Hare said the FBI was able to trace the accounts back to an IP address at McNeil's home through his cable and phone companies, Time Warner and Verizon respectively. On one such account, according to the affidavit, McNeil tweeted: \"Just thinking of getting martyred puts a smile on my face.\" The agents linked McNeil to the Tumblr account through less specific means. Hare testified that the agents used nearly identical messages on Tumblr and Twitter to tie McNeil to the two, as well as allusions to a birthday and a picture of the Tumblr user that Hare said matches McNeil wearing hospital scrubs. McNeil's Facebook page, attributed to \"Terrence Joseph Broadway\", includes similar posts to those on the related accounts, such as \"I'll be proud when I sled [sic] american blood\". According to the page, McNeil's incongruous tastes in culture range from Notorious BIG to Harper Lee, professional basketball and Iron Man. The user's \"inspirational people\" include Joseph Stalin and John Lennon. McNeil has no criminal history and will appear in court again next week, the Justice Department said in a statement."
