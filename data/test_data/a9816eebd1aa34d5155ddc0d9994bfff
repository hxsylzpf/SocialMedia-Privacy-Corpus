  "content": "Steve Coogan, the comedian whose phone was hacked, has warned against any attempt to \"kick the ball around\" and delay the recommendations of the Leveson inquiry. Coogan said he was worried that \"political obfuscation\" could delay reforms of press regulation following recommendations from Lord Leveson next year. He aired his concerns after a private meeting with Nick Clegg as part of a delegation of campaigners in favour of an independent system of regulation, with a statutory underpinning to protect the public without unduly limiting press freedom. Speaking at a Liberal Democrat party conference event, Coogan welcomed Clegg's comments on Sunday when he signalled he would work with Labour to implement the recommendations so long as they were \"proportionate\". Coogan said after the meeting that he feared people would pay \"tacit lip service\" to Leveson's recommendations followed by a \"tactic of obfuscation\" to delay acting on the recommendations. Evan Harris, the former Liberal Democrat MP and associate director of the Hacked Off campaign, said Clegg had warned during the meeting that there was a \"risk\" of delay. He added: \"He repeated again that if the Leveson recommendations were proportionate and workable then they should be supported, both parties in government having set up the inquiry with the support of the opposition.\" Coogan said: \"We are all in favour of press freedom. We want a healthier press. We don't want to curb their freedom \u2013 we just want them to behave in a more responsible and accountable way.\""
