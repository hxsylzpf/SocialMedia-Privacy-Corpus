  "content": "The News of the World has angrily hit out at claims that it published a doctored photograph of Kate Moss and the Primal Scream singer Bobby Gillespie. Moss's lawyer, Gerrard Tyrrell, wrote to the paper last week to object to an article headlined It Moss be Love, in which it claimed the supermodel was \"comforting\" Gillespie after he broke up with his girlfriend. Beside the article was a photograph of the pair, which Mr Tyrrell questioned because it did not show Gillespie's girlfriend Katie England, who was standing beside him and holding his hand at the time. Mr Tyrrell also denied the pair were a couple, or that Gillespie had split up with Ms England. But today the News of the World and the Matrix picture agency, which provided the photograph, insisted it had not been altered. \"The allegation that the News of the World faked this photo is untrue. The photo was obtained from a reputable picture agency and was not airbrushed or doctored in any way,\" said the paper. \"We are surprised by Gerrard Tyrrell's comments. Rav Singh put the quotes contained in the article to him on the day prior to publication. He made no objection and added: 'Bobby [Gillespie] is nothing to do with us. He is a big boy.'\" Matrix said Ms England's face could have been in shadows or obscured because she was bending it downwards. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
