The site has just gone up on eBay with a starting price of $425. The sales pitch says: I had a lot of fun making the site, but I'm moving on to other projects now so I want to sell Socialmeter to a person or company who can expand and develop it, possibly as a complimentary service to their existing website(s). (Yes, Brian, that should be \"complementary\".)"
