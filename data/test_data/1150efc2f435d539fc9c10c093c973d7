  "content": "Social networking site Facebook could be forced to remove the popular online game Scrabulous from its site after the owners of Scrabble took legal action. The world's second biggest toy manufacturer, Hasbro, which owns the game in North America, is suing the developers of Scrabulous, which is based on Scrabble, for intellectual property infringement. Hasbro has instructed Facebook to remove the application immediately, and a spokesman said the firm had decided to act following the launch of the official Scrabble Facebook games. \"Hasbro has an obligation to act appropriately against infringement of our intellectual properties,\" said Hasbro's general counsel, Barry Nagler. \"We view the Scrabulous application as clear and blatant infringement of our Scrabble intellectual property, and we are pursuing this legal action in accordance with the interests of our shareholders, and the integrity of the Scrabble brand.\" Hasbro, which owns the rights to Scrabble in the US and Canada, first threatened legal action against Scrabulous developers Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla in January, and filed a lawsuit against the brothers in New York late yesterday. The move follows the introduction of an official Scrabble Facebook game in the US and Canada earlier this month. Hasbro's online rights are owned by Electronic Arts in the US and Canada, and by Real Networks in the rest of the world. Scrabulous has built up a strong following on Facebook, with 512,961 daily users. The official online versions for the US and for the rest of the world have 8,862 and 9,617 daily users respectively. The move is likely to infuriate Scrabulous users on Facebook, who have set up campaign groups on the site to keep the game running. Even Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg his admitted playing Scrabulous on the site with his grandparents. Electronic Arts reportedly held discussions with Scrabulous about buying the game, but decided to focus on developing an official version. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
