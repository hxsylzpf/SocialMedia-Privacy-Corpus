  "content": "Juliano Belletti is almost certain to leave Chelsea this summer after admitting on Twitter that the FA Cup final looks likely to be his last game for the club. The versatile 33-year-old Brazilian is out of contract at the end of the season, and was linked with a move to Flamengo during the January transfer window. Last night he posted three messages on Twitter. The first read: \"FA Cup Final: Chelsea v Portsmouth, 15 May at Wembley. Maybe my last game for Chelsea.\" Then, shortly afterwards: \"My contract ends in June and I still have not decided where to go.\" Finally, a few minutes later: \"Still not thinking about retiring. I will try to reach my goal of 1,000 games. Stuck near 950.\" In January, after he was linked with Flamengo, Belletti had used Twitter to tell fans that \"Chelsea said that they are not going to release me before the end of my contract, which expires in June\". Belletti joined Chelsea from Barcelona for \u00a35.5m in 2007, and has not played since being sent off, 15 minutes after his introduction as a substitute, in the second half of Chelsea's 4-2 defeat to Manchester City in February."
