  "content": "Throughout the Leveson process newspaper publishers and editors have been extolling the virtues of freedom of the press while casting themselves as tribunes of that freedom. Critics, by contrast, have sought to show that the freedom exercised by press proprietors weighs heavily in their favour. In effect, the freedom they enjoy is denied to others. Now Hilary Mantel, the novelist, has accused newspapers of compromising freedom through a bullying mentality that stifles intelligent debate. In other words, despite their attachment to freedom in theory, the practice is very different. Mantel was referring to the coverage that followed a lecture she gave in February last year in which she mentioned the media's portrayal of the Duchess of Cambridge. She spoke of the former Kate Middleton's media image as \"a jointed doll on which certain rags are hung\". But her statement was reported as if it was her own opinion of the duchess rather than a description of the way in which she was treated in, and by, the media. The result was a swathe of personal criticism in newspapers and on TV and radio. Even the prime minister and leader of the opposition thought it necessary to comment at the time. An article in today's Times reports that Mantel took up these misrepresentations of her lecture during a Royal Shakespeare Company press conference on Wednesday about the transfer of its adaptations of her novels, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, to London. She said (and I'm assuming she has been reported properly this time around): \"It felt that there was an attempt to bully me... There's almost an attempt to intimidate. I feel that public life and freedom of speech is compromised at the moment by a conformist and trivialising culture, and I thought that this was an example of it. \"The people who misrepresented my words knew exactly what they were doing. There was no innocence there.\" She went on to talk about it being indicative of the way the media presented stories in bite-sized chunks so that readers could form instant opinions. Asked whether this was encouraged by social media, such as Twitter, she replied: \"Yes. Everyone feels they must have an instant reaction to everything, that they must speak for the sake of speaking, and that must be resisted, I think.\" Mantel points to a problem with a long history. The deliberate misreading of her lecture comments about the duchess are part of an agenda-setting process in which the story, rather than the truth, is regarded as the central journalistic mission. Here was a headline story with guaranteed readership appeal: an award-winning novelist criticises a glamorous member of the royal family. Result 1: a media storm in which the public can be guaranteed to take sides with the overwhelming majority undoubtedly siding with the duchess. Result 2: the demonisation of the novelist. Result 3: self-censorship, the narrowing of public debate because people will seek to avoid becoming victims of a media frenzy. (Incidentally, social media comments were a reaction to big media's inaccurate reporting, a factor often not taken into account). Mantel, clearly, is refusing to censor herself. The attempt to bully me, she said on Wednesday, \"won't work\". She also said: \"One just mustn't be perturbed. You can't be knocked off your perch by something like this. When the dust settles, I hope that people understand that I'm not a rent-a-quote \u2014 I'm not someone who is out to hit the headlines and I think before I speak.\" Good for her. But her substantive point, that others who fear a similar fate might well button up, should be taken seriously. People are intimidated by \"the power of the press.\" It reminds us, yet again, that press freedom has to be balanced by responsibility. But how is a story-getting, rather than a truth-telling, press to be made to act responsibly? Doubtless, the incoming Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) will sort that out..."
