  "content": "Gillian Anderson has enthusiastically touted herself for a role in the new Ghostbusters movie, which is expected to centre on a new generation of female stars. The X-Files actor was moved to announce her availability after learning about the reboot, which is being directed by Bridesmaids' Paul Feig, during a Reddit Ask me Anything session. \"OH MY GOD, I just looked it up online,\" she wrote. \"Paul Feig, cast me now! Start a Twitter petition! I'm free!!!!! I'm free I'm free and I'm funny, goddamnit!\" When a Reddit user offered to campaign on her behalf she added: \"MAKE IT HAPPEN!!\"  Bill Murray, the veteran star of the first two Ghostbusters movies, said recently that the new film should feature Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Linda Cardellini and Emma Stone. Speaking to MTV, Stone described the recommendation from her Zombieland co-star as \"pretty nice\" but refused to confirm or deny her involvement. Despite the best efforts of Dan Aykroyd, who came up with the idea for the original Ghostbusters and starred as Dr Raymond Stantz, the reboot had a troubled gestation period until Feig's announcement on Twitter earlier this month that he had agreed to direct and co-write the movie with \"hilarious women\" at its heart. His co-writer on The Heat, Katie Dippold, will take on co-writing duties."
