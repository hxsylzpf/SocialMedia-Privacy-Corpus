  "content": "Rovio is thinking big. It has already passed the 350m download mark with its various Angry Birds games, and is now talking about extending its merchandising operation to books, T-shirts, even a movie. An IPO is also on the radar. It has revealed it has held talks with Starbucks about a tie-up in its coffee stores and that it is launching a Facebook game to take on Zynga's Farmville. These guys are ambitious. But if you want to hear what Rovio is up to next, it might be worth a trip to Ireland for the Dublin Web Summit, where CEO Mikael Hed is joining a stellar line up including senior execs from Amazon, Facebook, Mashable, AOL, Yahoo, YouTube and Bebo. The summit, on 27 and 28 October, is a hot ticket \u2013 a two-day conference, workshop and all-round schmooze for developers, start-ups, angel investors and other webby types. Last year 600 people attended and more than 1,000 are expected this year. The summit runs in parallel with super-cool networking event, \"f.ounders\", dubbed the Davos of the tech world. Only 100 people are invited and only founders of substantial, innovative or break-out web businesses qualify. Last year's event started with a fireside chat with YouTube founder Chad Hurley at a central Dublin hotel, followed by an organised pub crawl and two days of top-notch talks from non-internet people, including executives from Goldman Sachs and the World Bank. Among those at the gig were Jack Dorsey from Twitter and Nicklas Zennstrom from Skype. Sean Parker from Facebook (played by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network) is rumoured to be the top guest this year. The two events overlap, with the top attendees at f.ounders also dropping in to answer questions at the Web Summit. Among those already confirmed for this year's summit include Werner Vogels, chief technical officer at Amazon, Jawed Karim from YouTube, Eric Ly from LinkedIn, Tristan Nitot from Mozilla and Mike O'Toole, head of technology operations at Morgan Stanley. Maz Nadjm, head of social media for Ogilvy Group is also attending, as is Chris 'Moot' Poole of 4chan, the internet site that spawned Anonymous, Rickrolling (the viral joke that got millions to open a link to Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up) and Rage Guy."
