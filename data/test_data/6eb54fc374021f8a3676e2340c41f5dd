  "content": "John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, has suggested that Britain should adopt digital voting, online or via text message, to increase electoral engagement. He said the UK is \"quite a long way behind the times\" in terms of digital democracy. Bercow also suggested geographical constituencies would become increasingly difficult to sustain in the digital age, and that parliament would need to look at new ways of delivering democracy. Bercow praised Estonia's example, which permits online voting, and predicts that more than half of their electorate will vote online by 2015. If, as Bercow says, \"technology is changing the electorate as well as elections\" what would be your rules for digital democracy? Would you be wary, or pleased about being able to vote via text message? How can MPs and the government get more involved using the internet, and social media? And do you use technology for civic engagement at the moment, whether by following your MP on Twitter or emailing ministers about issues? Let us know in the comments below."
