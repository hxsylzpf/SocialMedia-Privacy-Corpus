  "content": "\u2022 Facebook - which famously encourages people to use their real identities online - is taking a strange turn by by letting people sign up for vanity urls - facebook.com/bobbiejohnson, for example. The site's already become the main lens through which millions of people view the web, and it'll be interesting to see the fight when the landrush begins on Friday. What does it mean? Not sure, but Chris Messina worries that \"companies are racing to achieve namespace dominance over your online profile\". \u2022 Space fans should keep their eyes on the sky tonight - Japan's Kaguya orbiter is set to crash into the lunar surface at 18.30 GMT, says New Scientist. \u2022 Talking of crazy Japanese stuff, Bouncing Red Ball has the details of a 130 megapixel camera built out of a Canon lens and a flatbed scanner by Japanese camera enthusiast spyuge. Truly incredible. (via BoingBoing Gadgets) You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed."
