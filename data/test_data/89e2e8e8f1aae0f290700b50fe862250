  "content": "With their Do-you-think-he-sauruses and the mushroom who's a fun guy to be with, Christmas cracker jokes have been inducing groans over the gravy for decades. But now comedian Richard Woolford has dragged them into 2013 with a new addition to the canon: \"What does Miley Cyrus have at Christmas? Twerky.\" If you need to explain it to your elderly relatives, tumbleweeds blowing past as you do so, it's a reference to the pop star's infamous 'twerking' dance routine at the MTV VMA awards and elsewhere. Woolford's gag was judged the best entry in a Twitter contest run by TV comedy channel Gold, and he wins a \u00a35,000 prize. It's a cheering moment for the amateur comedian who has returned to the stand-up fray following a cancer battle. \"'This has been a phenomenal year and a great welcome back into comedy for me,\" he said. \"All I want to do is write comedy professionally, and hopefully this is another step closer to my dream.\" The top 10 picks from the competition are as follows. Brace yourself: 1. What does Miley Cyrus have at Christmas? Twerky. 2. Why did no-one bid for Rudolph and Blitzen on eBay? Because they were two deer. 3. Mary and Joseph \u2013 now they had a stable relationship. 4. What does the Queen call her Christmas Broadcast? The One Show. 5. What did Santa do when he went speed dating? He pulled a cracker. 6. Why don't you ever see Santa in hospital? Because he has private elf care. 7. How did Mary and Joseph know that Jesus was 7lb 6oz when he was born? They had a weigh in a manger. 8. Why is it getting harder to buy advent calendars? Because their days are numbered. 9. How do you know if Santa's been in your garden shed? You've got three extra hoes. 10. Why was the Brussels sprout sent to prison? Because it was a repeat offender."
