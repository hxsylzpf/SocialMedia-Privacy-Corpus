  "content": "It has been a year of weather extremes. New York City finally got a taste on Wednesday when, after sweltering 100-degree temperatures earlier in the day, a dramatic storm broke directly over Manhattan. The National Weather Service warned of flooding in Brooklyn and Manhattan, and city authorities used a mobile phone emergency warning system for the first time to warn residents of the potential flash floods. Of course, severe weather happens everywhere, and the wildfires in the western United States have been far more deadly than a bit of rain in New York. But we're east-coast liberal softies here, and we hold our hands up to localism. But you've got to admit that some of these pictures are quite remarkable, and worthy of sharing. In this collection the first picture, which went viral almost instantly, was taken by former NFL player Dhani Jones from his plane as it took off from LaGuardia. (He was one of the lucky ones who managed to get out before a slew of cancellations.) If you see any any others worth including, tweet us @GuardianUS."
