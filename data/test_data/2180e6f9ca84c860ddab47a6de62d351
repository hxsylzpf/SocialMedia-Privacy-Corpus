  "content": "It was just the usual sort of stuff that gets posted on Facebook: embarrassing family photographs, humdrum details of home life and a few congratulatory messages from relatives and friends on that promotion to the top job. Nothing to get excited about \u2013 unless the top job in question happens to be as the director of Britain's secret intelligence agency, MI6. And the man pictured in the questionable swimwear happens to be the next C himself. Sir John Sawers, who takes up the post in November, found himself at the centre of the embarrassing security row after it was revealed that his wife, Shelley, had posted the sort of information that MI6 operatives are supposed to keep under wraps on her Facebook page. As well as the photos, she had posted details about their children and the location of the flat the couple use in London. She had not taken advantage of Facebook's privacy settings, so all the information was available to any of the 200 million users in the open-access London network, as well as being searchable on Google. The foreign secretary, David Miliband, played down the seriousness of the affair. The Mail on Sunday had claimed its story \u2013 which also revealed that Shelley Sawers's half-brother is a researcher for the Holocaust-denying historian David Irving \u2013 showed that Sawers had left himself open to a potentially catastrophic security failure. Miliband, however, disagreed. Deploying some distinctly undiplomatic sarcasm, the foreign secretary told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: \"You [are] leading the news with \u2026 the fact that there's a picture that the head of the MI6 goes swimming. Wow, that really is exciting. It is not a state secret that he wears Speedo swimming trunks, for goodness' sake let's grow up.\" The offending page was swiftly removed and the Foreign Office refused to comment on the matter, saying it had nothing to add. However, Whitehall officials said it was a potentially serious security breach and official security procedures had either been ignored or not been properly passed on to the family. The D notice committee regularly asks journalists not to publish family details or addresses of officials in the security and intelligence agencies. Sawers is currently the UK ambassador to the UN in New York. Although he has been close to No 10 and the foreign policy establishment for a long time, it is still highly unusual for a diplomat to be chosen as the head \u2013 or C, for chief, as he is officially called \u2013 of MI6. Whitehall officials suggested that one of the problems was the difficult transition Sawers was making, from being a public figure to becoming the head of MI6. The Conservative MP Patrick Mercer, who chairs the counter-terrorism sub-committee, said the mistake had left the Sawers family \"extremely vulnerable\". Referring to Miliband's suggestion that the incident was not significant, Mercer said: \"If that is the case why has the site being taken down?\" He also pointed out that military chiefs had warned that the Taliban get 80% of their intelligence from Twitter and Facebook. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, called for an inquiry into whether Sawers should still be allowed to accept the job. \"Normally, I would welcome greater openness in government for officials or politicians but this type of exposure verges on the reckless,\" said the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, Edward Davy. \"The prime minister should immediately commission an internal inquiry as to whether this has breached the security of the incoming head of MI6 too seriously to allow him to take up the post.\" In the past year, Shelley Sawers has posted on topics from family parties and holidays to the health of their pets. On 16 June, the day Sawers's appointment was announced, she posted 19 pictures of the couple on holiday in the West Country. Her Facebook friends also used the account to send messages to her husband about his new job. One relative wrote: \"Congrats on the new job, already dubbed Sir Uncle 'C' by nephews in the know!\" Stripy trunks and thespian friends - what Lady Shelley Sawers' Facebook page revealed: \u2022 Sir John wears stripy blue swimming trunks and is apparently partial to a game of beach frisbee \u2022 Lady Sawers and her daughter, Corinne, are big fans of the Bob Fosse-directed 1972 film Cabaret. One of the pictures posted on the Facebook shows mother and daughter apparently imagining themselves in Weimar Germany and balancing on two golden chairs just like Liza Minnelli when she played Sally Bowles. It also reveals an intriguing and extremely colourful parrot ornament perched on a table. \u2022 The couple have thespian friends: one picture shows Moir Leslie, who played vicar Janet Fisher in the BBC Radio 4 farming drama The Archers, walking along a beach talking to Alister Cameron, a character actor who has appeared in ITV dramas The Bill and Footballers' Wives.",
