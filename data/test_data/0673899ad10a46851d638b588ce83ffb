  "content": "Today's extract from the updated edition of The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial* is by Chris Atkins, the man who made the Starsuckers documentary. His team fed fake celebrity stories to the tabloids, six of which ended up in print. This is somewhat longer than usual, but the devil really is in the detail of the exchanges at the Leveson inquiry when reporters were questioned about their actions. Atkins begins with the performance of Gordon Smart, who runs The Sun's showbusiness pages, entitled Bizarre... Two of our fake stories appeared without checks in Smart's column - one about film director Guy Ritchie injuring himself while juggling cutlery, and another claiming singer Sarah Harding [of Girls Aloud] was a secret fan of quantum physics. Smart started off bullishly at the inquiry by defending his column: \"I'd like to think that most of the time we get it right. Very occasionally we get it wrong.\" Robert Jay (the inquiry's counsel): \"If you don't know the identity of the source, how are you able to satisfy yourself that the source is reliable?\" Smart: \"I'll always ask where the story comes from\u2026 if it's a ring-in, which sometimes happens \u2013 people with phone tips \u2013 I'll be very rigorous about where they come from and how they have the information... our first obligation is to make sure the story is correct.\" Asked what proportion of his stories were substantiated, Smart said: \"The lead on Bizarre, and the second lead, we'll always make sure they're checked out.\" (The Sarah Harding story was a lead). Jay challenged Smart about the Starsuckers hoaxes: \"Both of these stories ended up in The Sun, although it happened neither was true.\" Smart's response was astonishing: \"Well, I would disagree that they weren't true.\" Watching live online I thought I couldn't be hearing this correctly \u2013 was he going to tell a judge that that the fictional stories I had invented were real? Yes, he was. Smart claimed, on oath, that the two stories were factually true, even though I had made both of them up. He said: \"My member of staff rang the PR and checked it out\u2026 I think I put a call in at the time.\" Dealing with the Guy Ritchie fiction, he argued that such stories about celebrities being silly are so unimportant they aren't worth verifying, despite this being the raison d'\u00eatre of his entire column. Smart said: \"I managed to corroborate the fact that he was drunk and misbehaving, so one or two paragraphs about the juggling cutlery part I thought was really trivial.\" Lord Justice Leveson intervened to ask what was on everyone's lips: \"It might be said that the whole thing is trivial and why publish any of it?\" Smart, completely missing Leveson's point, replied: \"I share your frustration, I find it incredible that we're discussing this.\" Leveson: \"Actually, what we're discussing is the suggestion someone deliberately made up a story and phoned you up and then it appeared in the newspaper. I don't think that's entirely trivial. Do you?\" Smart executed what's known in the trade as a reverse ferret: \"No, I don't, and we take it seriously. We called the PR, we checked it out, and he said he had no issue with the story. He said: \"It wouldn't surprise me at all if she had a book like that.\" A PR allowing a bit of free publicity is a long way from the high level of factual rigour that Smart insisted lay behind all his journalism moments earlier. Smart had also previously told the inquiry that he would always call the celebrity if it was a lead story (which the Harding physics tale was). Moving on to the Ritchie story, Smart claimed that he had checked with the restaurant that Ritchie was drunk and misbehaving, but again seemed reticent to check the bit that made it newsworthy \u2013 the juggling of cutlery. Here's the exchange between Smart and Jay: Smart: \"I didn't really want to hassle him [Guy Ritchie] at the time.\" Jay: \"We know the bit about the juggling cutlery was untrue don't we?\" Smart: \"You could argue that, yes.\" Jay: \"You're not saying it is true are you?\" Smart: \"We don't know.\" It's worth pointing out again that I made up the story about Ritchie. He was in that restaurant, but I invented the rest. It wasn't true. Yet Smart continued valiantly to argue on oath that it was. Smart: \"Maybe I'll give Mr Ritchie a ring afterwards and ask what precisely\u2026\" At this point, Lord Justice Leveson, exasperated with this nonsensical argument, cut him off. Leveson: \"It would be quite a remarkable coincidence if Mr Atkins invented a story that sounds bizarre and it happened to be true. That would be remarkable.\" Smart was unrepentant, clearly living in an alternate universe where, if a made-up story gets printed in his newspaper, it magically becomes true: \"It is bizarre. That's the name of the column.\" Despite having an oxymoronic name, it would be wrong to put Gordon Smart in the same bracket as the journalists who hacked phones and bribed policemen. I would suggest that the reason our fabricated stories flew into his column without checks is the sheer volume of material he has to put out. He revealed to the inquiry how much showbiz news he is expected to generate: \"On average, I'll write 10 stories a day, so over a week 60 stories, 3,000 stories a year.\" In his position, I doubt I would have the time to check facts either. The medical records investigation The more serious allegations in Starsuckers occurred in the medical records investigation, where reporters from the News of the World, The People and the Sunday Mirror met me to negotiate the purchase of medical records. The Sunday Mirror journalist, Nick Owens, was the reporter who crossed the line the furthest, and in the film can be seen offering me money to get his hands on the medical records of several celebrities. When he appeared at the inquiry, Owens started badly and got steadily worse. David Barr (counsel for the inquiry) was able to refer to the transcript of the secretly filmed meeting between myself and Owens. Barr began at the point where Owens explained to me how the Press Complaints Commission's public interest requirement for health stories could be overridden if the celebrity was famous enough. He told me: \"You take Fern Britton. She's on the front of the papers, she had a gastric band. That was a big story\u2026 because she had said in public many times that she had got a huge keep fit regime and all that shit. Turned out to be wrong. There's a public interest in reporting that story. \"What there probably isn't a public interest in doing is just reporting that someone had a gastric band operation\u2026 Unless they are a massively big name, then you might make a decision.\" Asked by Barr to explain, Owens replied: \"What was happening here was that this was an informal meeting between myself and Mr Atkins and we were discussing information which did not lead to any story being published... I was simply engaging with him and trying to get to the bottom of what it was he had to say.\" Barr: \"At at this stage you are telling Mr Atkins, aren't you, that the public interest doesn't matter if the name is big enough?\" Owens: \"That's not what I was saying to him, that's certainly not the impression I would want to give.\" Barr then questioned Owens on the general point of whether or not he should have even been listening to the confidential medical information, given that none of it had an inherent public interest. During our meeting I read out a list of (fake) operations that high profile celebrities had undertaken. The Data Protection Act is very clear \u2013 even verbally imparting private information constitutes a breach, unless there is an obvious public interest. Barr: \"You thought it was okay to be told what confidential information there might be?\" Owens: \"I thought it was okay to listen to what he had to say... I can't really help listening to what he had to say to me.\" In further testimony, Barr repeatedly quoted Owens's filmed statements to me in which he offered cash to obtain medical records. In response, Owens claimed he was merely conducting a general discussion. Owens then tried a new gambit that was even more ridiculous than his \"general discussions\" defence: \"When you meet people, you have to listen and go along to a certain extent about the things they're saying, just to keep their interest.\" In other words, he began to venture that it was he who was engaged in a fiendishly cunning plan to expose me as someone willing to sell medical records. He told the inquiry: \"As I've made clear in my statement, newspapers do often investigate and expose people that are involved in something we believe to be wrong. \"This was a guy... claiming he was going to get a young lady drunk so he could obtain information from her, and I felt at some point down the line, when I spoke to my news desk, as I've set out in my statement, we may want to expose what this guy was up to.\" The demolition of an idiotic argument I'm sure I saw Barr smile at this point, relishing the impending demolition of such an idiotic argument: \"Let's examine that a little bit. You've told us that, in fact, you set off to meet Mr Atkins without talking to your news desk?\" Owens: \"No, I said to them I was off to meet someone.\" Barr: \"And you didn't record this conversation?\" Owens: \"No.\" Barr: \"So you plainly didn't have a sting in mind when you embarked upon the inquiry.\" Digging further into absurdity, Owens produces what he clearly believes to be his trump card: \"Towards the end of the meeting, he refers again to the fact that he's going to go and get her [a nurse] a little bit drunk, I feel that it just underlines the very odd situation that I was in there with this chap. \"You know, he was claiming that he was going to get somebody drunk so he could get information. By the end of the meeting, he referred to it again and I went away thinking that we may need to expose he was doing.\" Lord Justice Leveson, his voice dark with warning, weighed in at this point: \"You think it's a proper construction of this conversation, do you?\" Some sense of self-preservation kicked in for Owens, who obviously did not want to face a perjury charge: \"I'm not able to recall whether it's a proper construction or not.\" Barr and Leveson greeted this preposterous argument with the derision it deserved. Leveson later sought a response from Owens' bosses, and sent a list of questions about the reporter's actions to Sunday Mirror editor Tina Weaver (who has since departed from the paper). She admitted: \"I don't think Mr Owens acted wisely and made some ill-judged comments. Given that Mr Owens did nothing with the information provided by Mr Atkins I do not believe his actions constituted a breach of the code. I emphasise that I would not have published the story.\" Tomorrow: Law lecturer Damian Carney proposes the setting up of a new regulatory body for the press providing strong remedies for complainants, with enough independence from government and industry to appease the public *The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, is published by Abramis.
