  "content": "\u2022 Will the eternal churn at MySpace ever end? Not yet, it seems, after Owen Van Natta, only installed as CEO a year ago, was suddenly replaced. Our chums at PaidContent say that the setup is \"being called a mutual decision, but Van Natta didn't really have a choice\", given the way the business had been set up. There's bound to be more coming to light on this, one way or the other. \u2022 Remember that Tory pledge to bring 100Mbps broadband to most British homes? It may not be all it seems. According to experts, opening up BT's fibre optic lines isn't necessarily a political victory, for a whole bunch of reasons that our own Richard Wray describes in his piece. That news comes, interestingly, just as Google announced plans to trial 100Mbps fibre optic lines in the US. \u2022 Meanwhile, further to the news we brought you earlier this week that Iran was clamping down on internet connections, it seems they're also blocking other services, including Gmail and text messaging. A Google spokeswoman told me that she could \"confirm a sharp drop in traffic\" and that while the company wanted people to be able to communicate with each other but that \"sadly, sometimes it is not within our control\".
