  "content": "Data retention laws passed nearly two years ago on the grounds of an urgent need to combat terrorism have still not been successfully implemented, highlighting fundamental flaws in the \"dysfunctional\" legislation, advocates say. By April internet service providers must have systems in place to retain customers' metadata for a two-year period, but the law is still not operational, and experts warn its coverage may never be comprehensive. Laurie Patton, the chief executive of the not-for-profit peak body Internet Australia, said not all of Australia's ISPs were known to the Attorney General's Department (AGD), and not all of them would necessarily be collecting and storing the metadata they were required to by the law. ISPs \u2013 defined as \"any person who supplies, or proposes to supply, an internet carriage service to the public\" \u2013 are not required to be licensed, even under the new legislation, so the government does not know how many there are. The Bureau of Statistics had recorded 66 ISPs with more than 1,000 subscribers as at June 2016. Internet Australia estimates there are at least 250, and perhaps more than 500. The AGD has received applications from 210 ISPs for funding to help them meet the costs of compliance, of which 180 were approved. If Internet Australia's estimate is accurate, that suggests there may be dozens of ISPs that are unknown to the department. \"But we don't know, that's the point,\" Patton said. \"We really don't know. It could be 40, it could 50, it could be 100. \"It's extraordinary that the government didn't ask the obvious question right upfront: how many are we talking about?\" One small-scale provider, who did not want to be identified, said there were \"plenty who couldn't be bothered applying for the money because of the hoops which need to be jumped through\". The list of 180 \"eligible providers\" granted funding by the department \u2013 15 withdrew their applications, and a further 15 were found to be ineligible \u2013 was made public in August. Patton suggested the list defeated the law's intended purpose of counter-terrorism. \"By a process of elimination, they've identified the ones that will be handing over their data. Anyone that's not on their list \u2013 there's your loophole.\" A senior figure within another ISP noted with frustration that the \"crappy law \u2026 is literally trivial for anyone to work around\" given that Google, as an overseas company, was not required to store metadata. \"If you were the dumbest terrorist in the world and signed up for a Gmail address, you're golden.\" He agreed with Patton's assessment that attempting to comply with the law had proved a \"nightmare\". Though service providers were required to begin retaining metadata from 13 October 2015, those with implementation plans approved by the AGD could take until 12 April 2017. Internet Australia had earlier warned that smaller, independent providers, particularly in regional areas, would struggle \u2013 and that costs would inevitably be passed onto the consumer. \"The legislation was so complex that even Telstra asked for extra time to work out what it all meant,\" Patton said. A spokesman for Telstra said it was confident of meeting the April deadline. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated the cost of compliance to the industry at $738m over the first 10 years of operation. But Patton questioned how that figure was reached when the total number of ISPs was not known. A pool of grant funding up to $128.4m had been made available to help ISPs comply with the act \u2013 $70m short of the $198.5m anticipated by the 180 providers. Patton said nearly 10 months after applications closed, many grant recipients had not yet been paid, leaving them \"scrambling\" to meet the April deadline. \"The funding is nowhere near enough. They're all out of pocket and they're unhappy.\" The full burden of the scheme on the taxpayer was not clear because of the unknown cost of government agencies requesting and accessing the data from service providers, he said. Questions remained as to how those requests would even be overseen. \"Our concern is that the legislation is fundamentally flawed, and drafted by lawyers who don't understand how the internet works. \"Consumers will ultimately pay for a flawed piece of legislation \u2026 that was apparently urgently required, and had to be rushed through the parliament without a great deal of public debate.\" Internet Australia has resisted the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act 2015 since its introduction in October 2014, and made a submission to a parliamentary inquiry. Academics and privacy advocates also questioned the basis on which it was founded, while the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner raised serious concerns about its implications for privacy laws. The AGD had said it had been necessary to combat terrorism, with incomplete metadata \"degrading the investigative capabilities of law enforcement and security agencies\". The bill passed on 26 March 2015. David Vaile, the co-convenor of the cyberspace law and policy community at the University of New South Wales, told Guardian Australia that the benefits of the law \"were not substantiated\", and claims about the data's usefulness to agencies were not subjected to any \"doubt or scepticism\". John Stanton, the chief executive of Communications Australia, said the government had not provided evidence of a widespread trend of ISPs retaining less data, for shorter periods. He said agencies and service providers had had a functioning relationship before the law change, and storing two years' data was \"disproportionate\" when most requests were for that from within the last six months. The AGD told Guardian Australia that the new legislation simply standardised the process and introduced safeguards to ensure its effectiveness. It said it continued to \"collaborate with service providers to help them fully comply\" by April. The law is enforceable by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, and service providers may face fines and infringement notices for non-compliance. Stanton had asked the AGD to \"show some regulatory forbearance\" towards ISPs that may not make the April deadline, given that it held some responsibility for the delays. \"They've not committed to that. I hope certainly that they will behave reasonably when the time comes.\" He said there was some confusion around the scope of the law, and was in favour of at least a \"tidy-up to get the definitions right and provide clarity\". The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security will review the data retention scheme \"within three years of [its] being fully implemented\". The AGD told Guardian Australia that the first annual report was currently being prepared. The Australian Communications and Media Authority confirmed in its annual report, published November, that no service providers had been referred for enforcement action on their data retention obligations. When that was put to the senior ISP figure, he laughed. \"Well, I'm not compliant. I haven't really even started on the work.\"",
