  "content": "With their conference over, the Tories have left Manchester, presumably to prepare for power. But just as they would be mistaken to assume an election victory is in the bag, they ought also to consider whether their conference the success it is being spun as. What they or indeed any of the parties achieved during these glorified rallies is questionable. We are not really much wiser about anything than we were three weeks ago. We know David Cameron has a lovely wife and that Gordon Brown's other half loves the prime minister dearly but aside from party conferences being rouse-the-faithful jamborees, they really serve very little political function. Following the near-collapse of the western banking system and the expenses scandal that sparked mass public revulsion it has become common to assert that \"the whole model needs changing\" and \"we need a new way of doing things\". Surely the same applies to the tired old format of the party conference, which seems something of an anachronism in the age of Twitter. For a start, four days is too long. As far as the delegates go, for anyone who has a proper job (and life) it's a substantial chunk of the few days a year most employees have to call their own. Commentators claimed that the Labour conference shrank after Brown's speech on Tuesday but that's probably because the delegates had to flee back to save jobs \u2013 their jobs. Second, the leader's speeches are way too long. Gordon Brown started off strongly by listing New Labour's achievements but before the end a sense of drift had crept in. Cameron managed an entirely policy-free if not content-free speech for nigh-on an hour. And therein lies the problem: an hour is a long time in 21st-century politics. We all know that people have ever-decreasing attention spans so why do we think it's so great for a leader to orate on their hind legs for an hour to be applauded by planted folk \u2013 often from a mix of carefully differing ethnic hues \u2013 who clap like seals? Surely to distil their argument into half as long (or less) would be twice the challenge. Old black-and-white footage of Labour conferences portrays literally smoke-filled rooms where there were knife-edge votes that party policy depended on. Even the Kinnock/Militant wars had dramatic tension to them but today's anodyne stage-managed conferences are pretty predictable. Labour has rightly banned smoke-filled rooms but as Seumas Milne says internal party democracy should not be a casualty too. The only vague punch-up occurred at the Lib Dems' conference, because there is still something of a function to their proceedings. Because they were the Lib Dems it was only vague \u2013 although at least they no longer need to use a telephone box for their venue, so that's progress I guess. Close up, things looks very different at conference from what you see on TV. It's at the parallel fringe events that any real debate/dissent takes place. Moreover, the space given over to corporate stalls is almost as vast as the auditorium itself. A few years ago Cherie Blair was unfairly criticised for taking too many squeezy toy trains from an exhibitor \u2013 it's often difficult to avoid people thrusting promotional tat at you in a setting akin to a freshers' fair. Everywhere I went for the brief time I was in Brighton for Labour, proceedings were being liveblogged and tweeted. Away from the televised set-piece speeches, many of the fringe events also formed Facebook groups in the conference run-up, which is no bad thing. The stuff around the conferences seems to have come into the 21st century; it's time now for the main event to play catch-up."
