  "content": "This morning, I was most pleased to learn that Martyn Poliakoff, professor of chemistry at the University of Nottingham, was awarded a bachelor knighthood by the Queen. So pleased was I that I struggled out of bed (badly wrecked back), my teeth gritted, so I could share this news with you. Those of you who have followed this blog will know Professor Poliakoff as the friendly fuzzy-haired chemist who hosts most episodes of the Periodic Table of Videos series (\"Periodic Videos\"), created and produced by independent filmmaker and video journalist Brady Haran. This series of short videos was designed to (re)introduce the public to the 118 elements of the periodic table, and it was featured here every Friday as the \"element of the week\" -- until we ran out of elements to talk about. (The series continues, mostly by talking about molecules, although sometimes, they update old elements videos or comment upon news events of the day.) Now Professor Poliakoff -- who now is more properly known as Professor SIR Martyn Poliakoff -- was awarded one of the highest civilian honours in the land, and his continued online presence has played a significant role in this. But what noble deeds did Sir Martyn do to be singled out by the Queen for this prestigious award? \"It is, I think, for a combination of reasons,\" replied Sir Martyn. \"It is partly through my role at the Royal Society as an ambassador for UK science, but also it is for my role in chemistry,\" Sir Martyn continued. \"Partly my research in green and sustainable chemistry.\" \"But [it also recognises] my efforts -- thanks to you, the YouTube watchers -- to promote chemistry through YouTube,\" added Sir Martyn. \"I think it may be the first time that YouTube has been mentioned when somebody has got a knighthood, and so I feel really quite proud about that. And I also really want to thank you YouTube viewers who have made this possible through your enthusiasm for chemistry.\" \"So in a way, this is an honour we can all share together.\" I have just one question for Sir Martyn: \"What name will you give to your white horse?\" You can read more about Sir Martyn, Brady Haran and their colleagues on the Periodic Videos blog and you can follow them on twitter @PeriodicVideos. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. GrrlScientist is very active on twitter @GrrlScientist and sometimes lurks on social media: facebook, G+, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.",
