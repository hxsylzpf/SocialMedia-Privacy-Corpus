  "content": "Going up 'Cuban fit' How Givenchy describes its slim polo shirts. Wear one while drinking a mojito. Tigers Aries' signature animal this season. The one from Cheetos is also acceptable. Latticewear The way to continue your mince pie love, now that Christmas is over. See Peaches' NSFW video, or the catwalk. 'Cleopatra by way of 140th Street' Eyeliner, Ronnie Spector-style. Excellent, whatever the decade. Turquoise gingham See Princess Charlotte's chair. Totally Miu Miu   Mariah as the face of Game Of War We won't be playing it, but picturing her slaying fire-breathing dragons in armour brings us much joy. Going down Snowflake sweaters Since Chanel's M\u00e9tier D'art Rome show, only double Cs has been acceptable as a pattern on your knitwear. Apple Music A good way accidentally to delete your whole music library. Emojis in adverts This is not making us want to sign up for a bank account. It's ruining the fun. #angryface Children's names inspired by Instagram filters A worrying trend. Baby Amaro won't thank you. Choupette Is Karl Lagerfeld's social-media-friendly cat even real? Or rather, does anyone care now we've seen Olive Beckham, the Beckhams' (very normal) cocker spaniel. Every Instagram account other than Donatella Versace's DV is here. Follow immediately, and obsessively."
