  "content": "She may have spent the last two years designing her Biophilia app for Apple, but Bj\u00f6rk is counting on hackers to set her work free from iOS devices. While Biophilia is not yet available for Android phones, Blackberries or, er, microwaves, Bj\u00f6rk is hoping fans will breach software security and convert it themselves. \"I'm not supposed to say this, probably,\" the singer told Drowned in Sound, \"but I'm trusting that the pirates out there won't tie their hands behind their back ... That's why we really made sure when we wrote all the programs that they will transfer to other systems.\" Biophilia, Bj\u00f6rk's eighth album, is a multimedia collection including a CD, a concert residency and educational apps, which teach users about music and the natural world. But the apps are only available on Apple's iOS operating system, and can't be explored on other devices. \"The only solution for me was to be some sort of a 'Kofi Annan' and try and make these two worlds speak to each other.\" We wonder what the former secretary-general of the United Nations would say about that."
