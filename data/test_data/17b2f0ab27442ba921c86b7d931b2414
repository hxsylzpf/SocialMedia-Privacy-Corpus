  "content": "Sony has hired private investigators to track down the computer hackers who stole the personal details of more than 100 million online gamers. Meanwhile the UK Information Commissioner's Office, which probes data breaches of this kind, said on Wednesday it has contacted Sony and is making inquiries into whether to investigate the attack, which affected a number of UK gamers. The Japanese electronics giant has recruited a former special agent with the US Naval Criminal Investigative Service to work alongside security experts from Guidance Software and Protiviti in the aftermath of the online attack. The FBI has launched a separate investigation into the huge breach. Although investigators are not thought to be close to identifying the culprits, at least some of the attacks came from a Malaysia-based server, according to the Wall Street Journal. It is not clear whether attacks were launched from the south-east Asian country or whether only the server was used. The crisis at Sony deepened on Tuesday after the company admitted the names, email addresses, phone numbers of 25 million Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) customers were stolen in the attack, which also hit 77 million PlayStation Network (PSN) gamers. Debit card records of 10,700 customers in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain were compromised in the attack, Sony said. Sony moved to placate growing fears over the security of its users after earlier declining a chance to testify in front of a US congressional hearing. A spokeswoman for the company admitted that an \"outdated database\" from 2007, featuring personal details belonging to 23,400 people outside the US, was broken into on 16 and 17 April \u2013 two days prior to the huge PSN attack. A Canadian law firm on Tuesday launched a $1bn (\u00a3600m) proposed class action lawsuit against Sony for breach of privacy. The company admitted it did not know when or where the next attack would come. \"They are hackers. We don't know where they're going to attack next,\" the spokeswoman said. Another Sony spokeswoman said that there was no evidence that the stolen personal details had yet been used for financial gain. However, some people have contacted the Guardian saying that they have seen unusual activity on their account: one said since the attack they had seen money regularly taken from their account via a cash machine in Florida. Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal wrote to Sony on Tuesday asking how many credit card accounts were compromised in the attack, which first came to light last week. Blumenthal said he would ask US attorney general Eric Holder to investigate whether the company's handling of the breach makes it civilly or criminally liable to prosecution. Sony further angered its critics on Wednesday as it admitted to waiting two days after discovering the private data was stolen before contacting the FBI, the company said in a letter to a US House of Representatives subcommittee. Sony did not meet with FBI officials until five days after the discovery, the letter said. The PlayStation Network remains offline after being shut down more than two weeks ago, when Sony first discovered the breach.",
