  "content": "\u2712 With a takeover imminent at Alton Towers, AKA the Independent's offices, staff there can be forgiven for occasionally taking their eye off the ball. Monkey's correction of last week was: \"Due to a production error we reported that the BBC has received 800,000 complaints over the proposed closure of digital radio station 6 Music. We are told, and accept, that the actual figure was just under 8,000 complaints.\" And the Indy was also a clear winner the week before, with the following (prepare to wince): \"On 7 March 2010, we published an article by [the Girl With a One Track Mind blogger] Zoe Margolis. In part of the first edition and online, this article carried the headline, 'I was a hooker who became an agony aunt'. This was written by the newspaper, not Ms Margolis. We accept that Ms Margolis is not and has never been a 'hooker' or otherwise involved in the sex industry \u2026 \" \u2712Ah, the perils of sponsored links. Searching last week for Daily Telegraph stories about mephedrone, the legal drug linked to the death of two teenagers, a MediaGuardian reader came upon a link to a supplier in the north-west offering the drug (also known as \"M Cat, Bubble, Meow\") at \"cheapest prices\" but of course \"for research purposes only\". And the other link provided looks at first glance like a straightforward plant food business, but its products turn out to include \"Miaow Plant Food \u2013 Mephedrone 4 \u2013 MMC\" as well as vibrators and pole-dancing kits. Typical Telegraph fare, then. \u2712Alexander Lebedev's irregular offerings on twitter.com/lebedevalex are full of interest \u2013 as when he reprinted his letter to the Sunday Times last weekend about its profile of him (wryly protesting about the picture used and calling himself \"Putin's Trojan horse\"), and back in January recorded he was \"reading Rod Liddle's book of stories Too Beautiful for You. Controversial? Yes. Talented? Yes.\" However, his feed displays an incomplete awareness of the local media scene (one tweet links to \"my diary column in Ken Livingstone's New Statesman\"), and reprinting the Sunday Times's subbed version of his letter would have been better than the original, which reads like a speech by his meerkat namesake. He needs an editor, in other words. Make that two editors. \u2712Has Donal Macintyre, the part-time undercover investigator and full-time hardman, got his priorities right in his role replacing the fruity-voiced veteran Alastair Stewart on ITV's 6.30pm bulletin London Tonight? Instead of canvassing opinions on the show's agenda, the born-again newsreader recently tweeted: \"Need an anchor man haircut \u2013 suggestions fast please \u2013 help\". \u2712\"This Christmas,\" burbles the expat It-girl and US Vogue contributing editor Plum Sykes in the Spectator's Guide to Luxury and Style supplement, \"I had two pairs of pyjamas made for my husband, one in a super-fine sky-blue Acorn shirting with tiny white dots, to be worn in London, the other in giant fuschia gingham cotton, for the country.\" Covers fashion and can't spell \"fuchsia\"? If Anna Wintour really is an implacable ice queen she'll have to go, even if it means no new town and country jimjams for hubby next Christmas. \u2712Campaign magazine's \"School Reports\" is an entertaining annual feature in which agencies are rated out of 10 according to their performance in the previous year, and also asked to rate themselves. With the two numbers side by side, this starkly shows which Mad Men are the most deluded, ie have the biggest gap between Campaign's score and their own estimation: several, including Lowe and Nitro, are three points more bullish than the magazine's score. Rather likable, in contrast, are those few depressive houses who undersold themselves, such as Mother, which awarded itself only an 8 but was rated a 9 \u2013 are they sure they're in the right profession? \u2022 Apologies to DraftFCB London, whom Monkey originally had as four points adrift \u2013 they are, in fact, only two."
