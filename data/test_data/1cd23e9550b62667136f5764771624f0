  "content": "Jack Straw is being challenged for the first time under the Data Protection Act to reveal whether MI5 holds a personal file on an individual it may have once considered subversive. Norman Baker, Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes, is taking a case before the national security appeals panel set up by last year's act. He said he had reason to believe MI5 held files on him as a result of his \"ecological activities\", including involvement in Greenpeace in the 1980s. Last year he received a letter from someone calling himself \"the Mechanic\" who claimed to be a serving MI5 officer. The letter said: \"There were reports [on you] forwarded to the security service by Special Branch officers in East Sussex in 1988. They were from a SB source within the South Downs Earth First group.\" Mr Straw has responded with a blanket ban on the disclosure of personal files.\"If the security service were to confirm it held records about an individual, he would be able to take measures to frustrate the security service investigation on him,\" said the home secretary. Mr Straw added that if the security service confirmed that it held no information about an individual and that individual's activities threatened national security or involved serious criminal offences, \"he would be able to pursue those activities freely knowing that he was not the subject of security service interest\". MI5 is concerned about opening the floodgates if it confirmed or denied it had a file on Mr Baker. The agency has 290,000 files on individuals. The first hearing on the case was on Friday when a ban was imposed on reporting anything that was discussed. Liberty, the civil rights group acting for Mr Baker, argues that the blanket ban is incompatible with the Human Rights Act. It says Mr Straw is acting unreasonably by claiming a \"disproportionate interference in the rights of privacy\" of an individual.",
