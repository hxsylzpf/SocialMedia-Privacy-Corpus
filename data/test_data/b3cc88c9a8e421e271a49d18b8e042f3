  "content": "In an era when Bruce Willis has an ongoing quest to become the rudest, most sullen interviewee in history, it's refreshing to note that a far more celebrated star in the Hollywood firmament is quite happy to kick back with the people and share a few inspired anecdotes. Reddit's AMA (ask me anything) sessions can be hit and miss, but George Clooney's jaunt in the spotlight this week saw the actor have a candid, engaged and cheerily facetious chat with users of the site. Clooney was promoting his new film, The Monuments Men, and Satellite Sentinel project, an organisation he co-founded which aims to use satellite imagery of Sudan to document evidence of crimes against humanity. During the Reddit live chat, he dropped nuggets of pure gold on everything from his infamous \"Batnipple\" hell while making Joel Schumacher's notorious Batman and Robin to his failed attempts to record his own version of the classic Man of Constant Sorrow bluegrass number from the soundtrack to Joel and Ethan Coen's film O Brother, Where Art Thou? Throw in Brad Pitt pranks on the set of Ocean's Twelve and repeated references to Sandra Bullock's (non-existent) drinking problem and you have one of the finest interviews ever conducted by thousands of web geeks and a Hollywood superstar. Here's what we learned. 1. He was the first Batman with Batnipples \"Well I wasn't thrilled with the nipples on the Batsuit. You know, that's not something you really think about when you're putting it on. You figure all Batsuits have nipples, and then you realise yours was really the first. Batman was just constantly cold I guess.\" 2. His \"troubled\" friendship with Gravity co-star Sandra Bullock \"It's tricky, cause Sandy drinks so much that oftentimes it's just hard to keep her upright. No, you know, Sandy and I have known each other for over 20 years, and we both were struggling actors when we first met. She was dating a friend of mine \u2026 who's still a good friend of ours. Every time we're together it's funny. She's somebody I adore, really, she's just fun to be in a room with. I'm sure people will assume [actors] aren't quite who they appear to be on screen \u2013 they're shorter or taller or meaner or dumber \u2013 but Sandy is exactly what she appears [to be] on screen, an incredibly charming woman who's really just fun to hang out with. Very smart and centered, even though she does drink a lot.\" 3. His greatest achievement was playing Stan's dog on South Park \"Sparky, the gay dog? It was sort of a surprise for me, I mean, here's something odd, I had never played a dog before. To finally play Sparky the dog was something that I think pretty much completed my career.\" 4. Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez rescued him from ER purgatory \"Quentin directed an episode of ER, and Rob and he were working on this project at the time and Quentin came over and said: 'You wanna come in and meet on this project [From Dusk Till Dawn]?' Yeah, are you kidding? I'd get to work with Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel and Rob and Salma [Hayek] and Quentin. I was playing a paediatrician on a hospital show and all of a sudden I get to murder people? I thought that was pretty great. I got to spend eight weeks or so in the Titty Twister, what was the downside?\" 5. We will never hear George Clooney sing Man of Constant Sorrow Reading on mobile? Click here to view Man of Constant Sorrow from O Brother, Where Art Thou? video \"I remember the Coen brothers assumed I could sing. I kind of assumed I could, too. I went into the studio with T-Bone Burnett and the Coen brothers and sang my version of Man of Constant Sorrow and they were all looking down at the ground and kind of shaking their heads and they play it back and it's just terrible, and I think: 'Great, they're going to have to tell me they're going to have to bring in another guy to sing'. \"The man who sang the track, Dan Tyminski, did an interview when this came out in my home town newspaper (the Roanoke Times, also his home town newspaper). He'd been summoned to the studio and didn't know what for. When he found out that he'd be voicing George Clooney's character singing in a movie, he called his wife and described the gig: 'Basically, honey, George Clooney is going to open his mouth and my voice is gonna come out.' There was a long pause. 'But Dan \u2026 that's my fantasy.' Some of the funniest newspaper reportage I've ever read.\" 6. How he discovered the right tone for the role of Ulysses Everett McGill in the same film \"The first day, I'm shooting a scene with John Goodman where he hits me in the head with a stick, and I was playing it like an idiot because these are the stupidest guys in America, and Joel and Ethan walked over and said: 'Listen, you're the smartest guy in the room in every single scene,' and I said 'Oh, OK'. And once I knew he was the smartest guy in the room the character really made sense.\" 7. The recipe for the perfect Clooney sandwich \"Oh, the perfect sandwich. Well, good question. The perfect sandwich would be \u2026 I want to come up with two gorgeous actresses, but I won't do that. Name your two. I don't know, you know, I'd have to think about it. I do like ham and avocado and a little tomato and a little mustard. Just a simple deli sandwich is great. You know, put some coleslaw in there.\" 8. The greatest prank he ever played \"I remember I got this insane-looking prop from this movie Solaris. It was the size of a lunchbox and it had all these intricate lights and tubes and I snuck it into Richard Kind's carry-on bag. They ran it through the machine and pulled it off and asked: 'What is this? Did you pack your own bag?' He had no idea what to say. Of course, this was pre-9/11. If you did that now it would be a very horrible thing, but it was very funny at the time. Anyway, don't do that at home.\" 9. Brad Pitt got one over on him on the set of Ocean's Twelve \"We were shooting Oceans Twelve in my home town in Lake Cuomo, and Brad had a flyer sent around saying George only wants to be called by his character's name Danny Ocean, don't look him in the eyes. It got into the local paper. As you know, jokes don't translate at all, and they called me Il Divo and said that I was treating the crew like shit. When it got into the paper, I came downstairs and Brad had the paper in his hand, and I said: 'You're mine from here on out.' Brad just said: 'Please don't harm my children.' Yeah, he's done some pretty rotten things.\" 10. He's a far better cobbler than Daniel Day-Lewis \"Let me just tell you this. When Daniel Day-Lewis was spending all his time playing Lincoln, I was just fixing shoes. He's spending all the time focused on the hat, and the pipe, and getting into character, and I remained focused \u2013 with the overalls and the hammer.\" \u2022 Video: Gravity star Sandra Bullock: 'What we do, it's all sci-fi'"
