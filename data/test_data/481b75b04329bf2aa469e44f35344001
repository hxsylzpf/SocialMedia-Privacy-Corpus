  "content": "A year after its (Rupert-visionary) launch, it's natural to look again at The Daily, Murdoch's non-newsprint newspaper on an iPad or Android tablet near you. How's it doing? 100,000 subscriptions at (mostly) $39.99 a year - a fifth of the original profitability target. Ad revenue kicks in: but at just $1,300 or so for a full page, you need to pile it very high. News Corp could ramp up the price, to be sure: the New York Times tablet version costs $20 a month (though you also get the full online service for that). But how much longer will it need to reach 500,000 subs if it does? \"It takes a new publication an average of five to seven years to break even, and we're well ahead of that curve,\" a buoyant Daily publisher tells the digital press. But seven years in cyberspace is an eternity. After all, it's only eight years since Mark Zuckerberg was a nerdy student eating popcorn at Harvard \u2026 and now, perhaps $100bn later? \u25a0 There could have been a Sun on Sunday last autumn, but somehow the continuing murk of the News of the World ruled that out. It may come this spring \u2013 all systems go \u2013 except that top solar people keep getting arrested (on evidence from News Corp governance committees) as the murk swills wider and deeper. Is there a shorter form for this stuttering project? Only SOS."
