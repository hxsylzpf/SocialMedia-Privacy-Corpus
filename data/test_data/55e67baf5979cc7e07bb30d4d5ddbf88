  "content": "Google defied the global economic slowdown last night by posting a 26% rise in net profits for the last quarter. The internet search engine company also claimed to be making strides in its battle with Facebook, announcing that more than 40 million users have joined Google+, its social network. Google beat Wall Street expectations by reporting net income of $2.73bn (\u00a31.73bn) for the three months to 30 September, from $2.17bn a year ago. Net revenue, excluding payments to partner websites, surged by 37% to $7.51bn. Shares in the company jumped by 6% in after-hours trading, with Needham analyst Kerry Rice calling the results \"nothing short of phenomenal\". Google continued to expand, hiring 2,585 employees in the quarter. That takes its total headcount to 31,353. Analysts had feared Google's results would be marred by a sharp rise in costs, as it strives to maintain its strong position in search and develop new services. Instead, expenses came in below forecast. \"A lot of people were expecting spending to be out of control, but they had good control,\" Herman Leung, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group, told Reuters. Larry Page, Google's chief executive, declared that \"we had a great quarter\", and highlighted the progress made with Google+. \"People are flocking into Google+ at an incredible rate and we are just getting started,\" Page said. The company only opened Google+ to the general public at the end of September. Three months ago, 10 million users were using it while it was still being trialled. It still has some way to go to catch Facebook's 800 million users. Google said that the number of \"paid clicks\" \u2013 when users click on adverts served by Google \u2013 rose by 28%. The \"cost per click\" was 5% higher than a year ago. Colin Gillis, analyst at BGC Partners, said the figures showed that the digital economy was still strong: \"Google is capturing all the economics from this and we are moving into the sweet spot when investors want to own Google,\" he added. Its shares had fallen by 13% since February, before its latest results were released. Mike Hickey, analyst at National Alliance Capital Markets, said that \"Overall, the tone of the release was positive and we're not seeing any indication of weakness in advertising in the next quarter.\""
