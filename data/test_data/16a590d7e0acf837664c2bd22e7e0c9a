  "content": "The Sun and the News of the World have offered potential apologies and damages to the Choice FM presenter who took legal action over claims that a \"well known DJ\" had gay sex with a Premiership footballer. Ian Thompson, aka DJ Masterstepz, joined footballer Ashley Cole in taking legal action against the newspapers' publisher, News International, over claims that two unnamed footballers were involved in a \"gay sex orgy\" with a DJ. Although neither Cole nor Masterstepz were named in the articles, Thompson's lawyers said the newspapers had accepted that he was identified as the \"DJ\" they claimed was involved. \"Now that News Group Newspapers appear to have accepted that these allegations are false, Masterstepz wants them to make prominent public apologies as quickly as possible,\" said Korieh Duodu, of David Price Solicitors and Advocates. \"In the meantime we will investigate whether they have any explanation for publishing this story which entitles them to rely on an offer of amends.\" Masterstepz brought the proceedings for defamation following a series of articles that appeared both in the Sun and the News of the World between February 12 and February 19 this year. He has always maintained that the allegations which had been published were utterly without foundation. The \"offer of amends\" was made by News International under section two of the Defamation Act 1996. If the two parties are unable to agree the level of compensation it will be decided by a high court judge. However, the defence is not available if the publisher is found to have, at the time of publication, known or had reason to believe that the allegations it made were false. News International declined to comment. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
