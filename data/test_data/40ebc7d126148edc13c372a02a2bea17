  "content": "'Just got up. Trying to decide whether to go for Coco Pops or cornflakes today \u2013 what do you guys think?\" \"Brushing my teeth \u2013 OMG isn't toothpaste minty these days.\" \"Gonna be late again today. Missed train while tweeting contents of sandwich box.\" If that's the sort of thing you expect from Twitter, then you're not entirely wrong \u2013 the social networking site does host its fair share of, shall we say, inanity. But it does also have a serious side and, used cleverly, it could help you find your next job. A 138-character tweet last May landed Annabel Brown an internship with Ogilvy Public Relations which has since turned into a permanent job. Brown, 25 (Twitter address: @whereisannabel), lives in Australia \u2013 just to prove the power of social networking sites, I used Twitter and Facebook to find her. She was in her final year at university when she sent out her message: \"I want an internship with a leading social media agency or leading online PR firm in Syd. Anybody have any suggestions or recommendations?\" The post prompted a reply from Lexy Klain (@LexyLexy), a senior PR account manager: \"@whereisannabel It's Lexy here from Ogilvy PR Australia. I'd love to have a chat with you re: an internship with us. Reach me on \u2026 \" Brown says that, as a PR student, she was encouraged to talk to people in the industry and seek advice from them. \"We were never directly advised or encouraged to use social networking sites to seek employment but I figured that if this was the space that the industry professionals were communicating in, then this was the space I needed to use to get a job.\" Her experience suggests that the old adage that \"it's not what you know but who you know\" when it comes to finding a job could probably be updated. Thanks to social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, in some industries that can be extended to who you \"virtually know\" \u2013 through websites workers can build contacts with people they may never have met, which means, when it comes to looking for a job, they can tell a lot more people. Bernadette Rizzi, a career coach at the government-backed Careers Advice Service (@Careers_Advice1), says she encourages job-hunters to make use of social networking sites. \"Using these sites underpins what they might already be doing with their career search,\" she says. \"People have always been networking, these sites are just an addition, but it used to just be word of mouth before.\" According to Dan Schawbel, the American author of Me 2.0: Build a Powerful Brand to Achieve Career Success, \"Networking remains the number one path to a new job.\" He adds: \"You're hired by a person not a machine and Twitter allows you to connect directly with recruiters without appearing desperate and intrusive.\" Like Rizzi, Schawbel advises that social networking should be an add-on to your job hunt, not a replacement for using more traditional channels, such as recruitment agencies or classified adverts. And it isn't just about posting speculative requests for work, or looking out for messages saying that someone is recruiting. \"I recommend that you review the different job postings that interest you, and use social networks to locate either the hiring manager, or someone else that works at that company, and build a relationship with them,\" he says. \"Job searching is evolving into 'people searching'. It's no longer about finding the latest job opening; now it's about finding the right people who can help you.\" One social networking site designed to make this as easy as possible is LinkedIn. It is dedicated specifically to business relationships, so that you can easily track down other people who work for a company you want to join. \"If someone is advertising a role on LinkedIn, anyone seeing the advert can see the company and they can see the individual who is doing the search,\" says LinkedIn's Richard George. \"There is a lot more clarity on who is recruiting [than with traditional job advertising].\" Each company profile page details the last three people who were hired by the firm. \"You can get in touch with those people and find out how they got the job,\" says George. LinkedIn has 55 million registered users, from graduates to CEOs, who have each set up an online profile detailing their work history and education. Via the site they can set up virtual networks, send messages to each other and recommend colleagues' work. For workers there are advantages to logging on, says George. \"A LinkedIn\u00ad profile is a more organic version of your CV \u2013 it's up-to-date with your current role and your experience,\" he says. \"The strength is that instead of you just saying 'this is what I'm good at', you can say 'this is what someone who has worked with me says about me'.\" He claims that just being on the site could boost your chances of getting a job, as it will boost your ranking if someone Googles your name. The site is also used by recruiters proactively searching for new employees. The advantage for companies is that they are able to get a clear picture of potential workers at an early stage in the recruitment process, says George. According to Rizzi, LinkedIn is a good place for job-hunters to start, but workers should also be aware of more specialist sites. She suggests looking for forums and discussion groups on sites connected with your industry \u2013 the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, for example, has a networking site that will probably prove more useful to those working in HR than more general sites such as Twitter or Facebook. \"People need to be aware of their potential audiences \u2013 who is going to be reading it,\" Rizzi says. \"If they are targeting work in a particular area, it's really important to target their search.\" Annabel Brown says she focused on using Twitter because she had built connections there with people in her chosen line of work. \"I did use Facebook a couple of times, by updating my status to let people know that I was looking for an internship, but I knew that I had limited reach as it was only my personal friends who could see my status update and that no one would stumble upon my post,\" she says. To use social networking in your job hunt, there are a few golden rules. First, don't spread yourself too thinly. \"You don't want to join every social network and create a profile, because that's unmanageable,\" says Schawbel. \"If you aren't active on a social network, it can hurt your personal brand, especially\u00ad because your profile has to be accurate at all times or you'll miss opportunities.\" Next, start now, even if you don't want a job \u2013 as in the real world, the best chance of success will be if you are actively building up contacts before you want to move on. \"Best results are often achieved well before you need a job, by consistently networking so that when you find yourself job-hunting you have a large network to work with,\" says Erik Qualman, author of Socialnomics: How Social Media Transforms the Way We Live and Do Business. Schwabel agrees. \"Most of the success stories I hear are from jobseekers who have established a large following who are tuned into their social updates,\" he says. \"If you're a hiring manager and you land on a profile page that isn't filled out, doesn't have a picture and has no social activity, you would click to another candidate.\" Remember, though, that anything you have posted in the past is hard to get rid of. This is another reason why you might want to keep your job hunting as far away from Facebook as possible (and to check your privacy settings to make sure anything you have posted is just between you and your friends). And remember that you are putting your network on display. People can see who you know and what they think of you \u2013 which could be a good thing but may occasionally be detrimental. For example, if an employer you would like to work for has had a bad encounter with someone who writes a rave review of you on your LinkedIn profile, that might not count in your favour. Worse still are maverick friends. Andy Barr, who uses social networking sites to recruit staff to his Gloucester-based PR company, 10 Yetis, once got into a row with someone on Twitter who was later revealed on Facebook to be the partner of a candidate for a job. Needless to say, she didn't get it. But don't be put off just because technology is involved. As George says: \"Big business has always been about people doing business with people\u00ad they know and trust.\" The only difference is that social networking sites are allowing them to find those people online. How to get started online Here's how to start networking on two of the sites mentioned. Twitter \u2022 Go to twitter.com. Click on \"Sign up now\" and fill in your details. \"When choosing a username, make yourself easy to find,\" says Erik Qualman. \u2022 Create an account. Search for people you know and start following them. Look at who they are following and see if you want to follow some of their followers too. Remember people can see who you are following, so don't follow any far-right political groups unless you don't mind potential employers seeing that you are. \u2022 Start tweeting. You can either use the Twitter site through your web browser, or download software like Twhirl on to your desktop. Each tweet is a maximum of 140-characters, including any links you want to include to things you have seen or posted elsewhere so you need to be pithy. \u2022 Visit a website like TwitJobSearch.com or download an application such as TweetDeck's JobDeck (from tweetdeck.com/jobdeck/) to monitor vacancies that are advertised using Twitter. LinkedIn Go to LinkedIn.com. Fill in box on homepage headed \"Join LinkedIn today\". \u2022 Fill in details of your current job. Allow the site to search your email contacts to find people you already know who have a profile \u2013 you may be surprised by how many of your friends and contacts are already signed up. The more details you can add to your profile, the more complete your virtual CV. \u2022 Be active. Make connections with people you know and, where appropriate, comment on their work. Join groups and take part in the \"answers\" forum, which allows you to answer fellow members' questions \u2013 this is a great opportunity to showcase your expertise.
