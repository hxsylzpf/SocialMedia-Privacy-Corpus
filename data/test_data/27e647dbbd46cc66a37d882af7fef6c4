  "content": "Police are investigating a series of emails threatening to kill the children of the Conservative MP Louise Mensch, which she claimed to be from the hacking groups Anonymous and LulzSec. The MP for Corby revealed the threats on Twitter from New York, where she is spending her summer holiday. On police advice, Mensch has not revealed the wording of the emails but she confirmed to the Guardian that they included a threat to kill her children, and bore the logo of LulzSec and the name Anonymous. She tweeted: \"Had some morons from Anonymous/LulzSec threaten my children via email. As I'm in the States, be good \u2026 to have somebody from the UK police advise me where I should forward the email.\" She said she was revealing the information on Twitter because the threat aimed to warn her off using the social media network. Mensch, who wrote popular fiction before entering the Commons last year, is an avid user of Twitter and has embarked on high-profile debates in recent days about social media blackouts during the recent riots and phone hacking. In a statement, Mensch said: \"Having discussed the matter with House of Commons police, and on their advice, I will not be releasing the email as they investigate; I do intend to release it once the police investigation has finally concluded. \"I am extremely grateful for the prompt action of police in parliament and in Northamptonshire in securing my family and in working hard to trace who sent these cowardly threats.\" LulzSec and Anonymous advocate civil disobedience on the internet. LulzSec was behind the hacking of News International websites at the height of the News of the World phone-hacking revelations, and a separate operation against Nintendo; Anonymous has targeted the Church of Scientology, Visa, Mastercard and various Middle Eastern governments in the pursuit of what it sees as transparency and individual liberty. However, LulzSec has done nothing since July. It fell completely silent last week after its leader, known as Sabu and believed to be a Puerto Rican living in New York, went offline. Anonymous is a loose collective without any leadership but Twitter accounts linked to it denied Mensch's claim. \"We didn't [do it],\" tweeted one. \"We don't care about her or her children.\""
