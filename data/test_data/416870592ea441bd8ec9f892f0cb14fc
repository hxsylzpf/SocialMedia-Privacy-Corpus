  "content": "At the Like Minds social media conference in Exeter, Jonathan Akwue of Digital Public told how social networking was helping deliver services to teens and mothers. In a social media conference with many people listening while tapping away on laptops or mobile phones, Akwue started with a slightly controversial point: Digital technology does not always make our lives better Showing a picture of an ATM, he asked: \"We used to queue inside of banks. Why do we now queue outside?\" For people who haven't embraced the internet or technology, they might be doing it for logical reasons. Akwue said: When people don't use digital technology, it might be because it wasn't designed for them. He talked about how his company designed a couple of schemes to connect with \"people completely disconnected from the mainstream\" including youth who needed emergency contraception after unprotected sex and at-risk parents. He cast the challenge as: \"How do you connect with people who don't want to know you?\" For the first project, they wanted to know if they could use social media to reduce the rate of teenage pregnancies. They believed they needed to create a service for teens that was delivered where they were. Many teens who needed emergency contraception wouldn't use phone counselling, but they were connecting online. Working with NHS Direct and Bebo, they used web chats to counsel teens who needed emergency contraception. The chats lasted an average of 12 minutes, he said, providing teens with needed information. In terms of developing ideas for such projects, he said: \"Don't create. Curate.\" Working with Netmums.com, they found that occasionally on the forums, a mum would say that she was going to kill herself. \"They would say things like, 'I'm such a useless mother, my kids will be better off,'\" he said, and the mums meant it. The other mums would provide support, but they knew it wasn't enough. Mums on the forums suggested they create a 'drop-in clinic' that provided counselling on the site. \"It was a group of mums that came up with that idea. We just facilitated it. Proud to say it wasn't my idea,\" Akwue said. Twitter is not just about what people had for breakfast, he said. \"You can use this to change people's lives, to save people's lives.\""
