  "content": "It wasn't love or money that inspired the recent reunion of Soundgarden \u2013 it was a poorly worded tweet. The grunge legends have revealed that they had no plans to re-form before a message about their fanclub was misinterpreted as an announcement about the band. \"The 12 year break is over amd school is back in session,\" said frontman Chris Cornell on New Year's Day 2010. \"Sign up now. Knights of the Soundtable ride again! soundgardenworld.com\" But while this may seem like a rally cry for the band, who split in 1997, the group now say they were just unveiling their new website. \"We had neglected our legacy and our fans, so we were just starting the fan club up again,\" guitarist Kim Thayil recently told Kerrang. Cornell said the same last year: \"[There was a] concern about protecting the band's legacy. There was no catalogue promotion, no Soundgarden website. So we got back together to have a discussion about serving the fanbase and it felt really great.\" But as soon as fans were reminded about the, er, Knights of the Soundtable, they were clamouring for the group to reunite. Even Rolling Stone misunderstood Cornell's tweet. \"I spent a lot of time trying to explain to my friends that we weren't back together,\" Thayil said. \"My mother called and said, 'We've heard the news, why didn't you tell us?'\" \"It generated a lot of interest and my phone was ringing off the hook with people offering us shows,\" Thayil continued. \"We turned most of them down, but thought it would be fun to play that show in Seattle [in April 2010] and eventually Lollapalooza. It was only around then that there was talk about doing some new material.\" A year later, Soundgarden are back in studio, trying to create something that feels new. \"The last thing we want to make is another grunge or metal record,\" Thayil said. While Soundgarden intend to do more touring, that will depend on Cornell's solo concerts and drummer Matt Cameron's work with Pearl Jam. \"Everything is contingent on the primary careers of the band,\" Thayil said. \"Everyone wants the album to come out as soon as possible, but at the moment, there's no reason to rush anything.\" Soundgarden's last studio album was 1996's Down On the Upside. It reached No 6 in the UK charts."
