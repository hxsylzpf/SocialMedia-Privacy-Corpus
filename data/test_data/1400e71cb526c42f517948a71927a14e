  "content": "More hot news from the Twitter-isn't-just-a-global-fluff-repository department. Over the last month, two super-geeks have raked through millions of tweets and produced fascinating ways of visualising the way we are travelling. The most recent unveiling is a map of destinations to which UK Twitterers are travelling to, made by East Midlands-based developer Ben Marsh with the backing of Vodafone, who have sponsored the map to plug their suspension of roaming charges to 35 countries this summer. Keir Clarke explains how the map is made over at Google Maps Mania, with Twitter users adding the #ukhols hashtag to a tweet, which plots their home location and destination on the map \u2026 for everyone (non-Twitterers included) to see. It comes almost a month after Vancouver-based digital artist blprnt created a video that visualises the flight journeys of thousands of Twitter users by scouring the social network for tweets including the words \"just landed in\" or \"just arrived in\" over a period of 36 hours. And while we're at it, here's another fascinating - if slightly concerning - video, showing 24 hours of worldwide air traffic across the globe."
