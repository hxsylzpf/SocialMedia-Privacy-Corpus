  "content": "I wrote a blog item yesterday about the former News of the World executive editor, Neil Wallis, in which I asked whether he was on the verge of making a PR comeback. I've now spoken to Neil, who is currently on police bail following his arrest in July last year, and it appears that \"clues\" pointing to his possible return to business are, sadly from his point of view, wide of the mark. I pointed out that he had reinstated his PR company, Chamy Media, after it had previously been dissolved. He did so, but for technical reasons. He needed to restore the company in order to extricate himself from something of a Catch 22 situation. When Chamy was struck off, its assets were seized. Yet he found himself being required to pay tax on the profits from those assets, which he couldn't touch. To get them back meant going through the complex process of fulfilling a set of obligations laid down by Companies House. Having done that, he then found himself in another trap. He must now post accounts for Chamy Media even though he isn't trading. This explains his delay in doing so. I understand that he has not been employed for 13 months in any meaningful way and is still awaiting a decision on his fate by the director of public prosecutions when he answers bail next month. That said, he appears remarkably chipper. Doubtless he's finding plenty of time for his old hobby, birdwatching, and a new one, tweeting as @neilwallis1."
