  "content": "The ramifications of the week's other disaster - the missing data on 25 million people - continue to unfold. The Telegraph reckons ministers were warned to review slack practices on the handling of confidential information. It also claims that the security breach of downloading the child benefit database was authorised by senior officials, and was not just the fault of a junior official. It says that official was probably earning as little as \u00a312,500. The Telegraph paints a grim picture of the child benefit offices in Tyne and Wear where the official worked. It says morale there is \"non-existent\", the place has been \"turned upside down\" by police looking for the missing discs, and staff are being instructed by loudspeaker to protect the identity of the official who lost the data. It also prints emails from disgruntled Revenue and Customs civil servants. \"The place has gone to hell in a handcart,\" one says. \"Rooms full of unopened post are not uncommon,\" says another. The Times says thousands of people have changed their bank account pin numbers, and banks are being flooded with calls from anxious customers. It also found that an 0845 helpline set up by Revenue and Customs is charging customers 10p per minute from a landline and up to 40p a minute from a mobile. The use of such numbers is in breach of Ofcom guidance, it says. Ofcom recommends 03 numbers for public services. This is an edited extract from the Wrap, our digest of the daily papers."
