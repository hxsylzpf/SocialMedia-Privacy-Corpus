  "content": "The mother of former MSP Tommy Sheridan has reportedly been told by police that her phone messages may have been hacked by the News of the World while she was suffering cancer. Alice Sheridan was told by police on Tuesday that they had discovered her confidential phone details in the notes of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, according to Friday's Daily Record. She described those involved in phone hacking as \"lower than the underbelly of humanity\" and said felt the intrusion was \"emotional rape\". Sheridan was involved in a high-profile defamation action against the News of the World in 2006 after it published a story claiming he was an adulterer who visited a swingers' club. He was jailed last year for perjuring himself in that trial, but was released in January after serving 12 months of his three-year sentence. His mother said she is now considering joining more than 50 others who are suing or planning to sue Rupert Murdoch's News International for invasion of privacy as a consequence of News of the World phone hacking. \"I would like to take them all the way through the courts but I've been told if I don't accept a settlement like the others, this process will be very expensive,\" she told the Daily Record. \"I would challenge Murdoch to come up and meet me, face to face, but I think he'd be too feart. \"At first when the police rang, I just thought, 'Oh God'. I was stunned. then I just got angrier and angrier. I felt disgusted. Who the bloody hell do the News of the World think they are? \"They were out to get Tommy at any cost, and I mean any cost, and if that meant accessing my phone line, then to them that was just part of the job. I've always been raging, I knew Tommy's phone was hacked. But me? Why me?\" On his release from Castle Huntly prison, Sheridan vowed to appeal against his conviction and pursue the News of the World. His lawyer, Aamer Anwar, said the new appeal is related to the outcome of the police investigation into alleged perjury during Sheridan's trial. Sheridan's mother told the Record that she felt the phone hacking was \"emotional rape\" and said she was \"shocked and disgusted\" over just how low people prepared to go. \"They are brutes who thought they were so untouchable they could go to any lengths to access people's private lives and personal business,\" she added. \"To think that they had access to information about me, my family and my friends is absolutely disgusting. \"These people are lower than the underbelly of humanity,\" she said. She added that she feared her mother, Rose, could also have been targeted before she died. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
