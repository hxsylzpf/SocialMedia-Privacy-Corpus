  "content": "It's been a while since we have seen a totally tone-deaf, grade-A internet blunder from a major brand. Luckily, Bud Light has ended the drought with its social media campaign to mark St Patrick's Day. The beer brand's Twitter account advised followers: \"On #StPatricksDay you can pinch people who don't wear green. You can also pinch people who aren't #UpForWhatever.\" The tweet was posted along with a photo of beaming young women dressed for the Irish holiday. It was posted at 11.53am ET, and by 1.45pm had been deleted. Nick Kelly, a spokesman for the company, sent Business Insider a statement apologizing for the tweet: \"We understand that some people misunderstood our St Patrick's Day post and we want to apologize to everyone who was offended. Our intention was only to be playful and celebrate the holiday.\" The negative response from Twitter users was swift."
