  "content": "Piers Morgan, the editor of the Daily Mirror, has said the paper decided to appeal against a judge's high court decision to award damages to Naomi Campbell because there were \"important matters at stake\". Although the model was awarded just \u00a33,500 in damages, Trinity Mirror ended up with a bill of more than \u00a3200,000 because the company was also ordered to pay the her costs after a high court judge found the Daily Mirror guilty of breach of confidence. \"We've given it proper thought - I think everyone has heard enough of Naomi Campbell,\" said Morgan. \"But we felt there were important matters at stake. We were very surprised a judge could say someone had lied on oath and still make us pay their costs, especially when everyone knew she had lied.\" When the judge delivered his verdict last month, Morgan appeared to be reluctant to drag the case out any further, saying he was \"bored of the whole thing\". But he said many in the newspaper industry had urged him to appeal against the decision, which was seen in some quarters as sounding a death-knell for the freedom of the press. Media lawyers warned at the time that the decision could kill off investigative journalism, and even Morgan's arch-rival, the Sun's editor, David Yelland, came out in support of the Mirror in a leader column the following day. The paper's owner, Trinity Mirror, said today it had lodged an application with the court of appeal for permission to appeal against \"all aspects of Mr Justice Morland's decision\". The company said it would appeal against the decision to award costs as well as the damages award."
