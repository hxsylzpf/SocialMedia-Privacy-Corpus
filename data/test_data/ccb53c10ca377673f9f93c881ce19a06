  "content": "The death of Aaron Swartz, the Reddit co-founder and internet freedom activist who is reported to have killed himself in New York on Friday, prompted a flood of tributes on Twitter. Given Swartz's status as a committed and prominent advocate for online freedom, it was fitting that Tim Berners-Lee was among those to honour him. The inventor of the world wide web was one of many friends, colleagues and supporters who took to social media to pay their respects. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web Cory Doctorow, author and blogger Larry Lessig, professor and founder of Creative Commons Glenn Greenwald, Guardian blogger and columnist Birgitta Jonsdottir, Icelandic politician and free speech campaigner Trevor Timm, activist at Electronic Frontier Foundation W3C Team, a web-based community dedicated to internet growth"
