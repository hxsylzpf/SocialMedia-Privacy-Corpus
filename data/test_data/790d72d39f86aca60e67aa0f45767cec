  "content": "Campaigners for children's rights have severely criticised the Sun's \"Shop a Yob\" campaign to name and shame youngsters who are subject to anti-social behaviour orders. The policy adviser to the Children's Rights Alliance for England, which represents more than 180 organisations, expressed her concerns about the initiative. \"We're very worried about it. It smacks a little of lynch mob behaviour,\" said Terri Dowty. As part of Shop a Yob the Sun has published the photographs, names and ages of youngsters who have anti-social behaviour orders against them. The newspaper has also set up a telephone hotline enabling readers to name troublemakers in their area. While the youths featured most prominently so far are aged 18 and over, some of those named are as young as 13. CRAE suggested the campaign could be breach the European Convention on Human Rights, which is incorporated in English law. Article 40 of the convention states the privacy of children who come into conflict with the law should be protected. \"The most important thing with young people who are getting themselves into trouble is that we do something effective to provide activities that will put them on the right track and this is not the right way to go about it,\" Ms Dowty said. \"This is a punitive measure. It's labelling them rather than actually dealing with them in a way that will guarantee they won't offend in the future. \"It's blatantly called 'name and shame'. The purpose of it isn't to help the young people in any way, it's to get vengeance and it's a very dangerous strategy.\" The Sun said it had no comment to make on CRAE's criticisms. However, in its leader column on the second day of the campaign the tabloid declared it was \"proud to lead the fight back against the yobs\". \"For too many years law-abiding parents trying to raise decent families have watched tearaways pulling society apart. \"Our Shop a Yob initiative, launched only yesterday, produced immediate results. Our hotline was flooded with calls,\" the newspaper said. Police officers have given their backing to the Sun's campaign. Some of the youngsters featured are also the subjects of a poster campaign by Surrey police to alert communities to the identities of people with anti-social behaviour orders against them so they can report them if they breach those orders. Earlier this year the high court blocked a poster campaign by Essex police featuring mug shots of convicted criminals after burglar Gary Ellis claimed his human rights and those of his family were infringed. Mr Justice Goldring did not ban the poster campaign outright but ruled the police had to provide more proof it would work before going ahead. Mr Ellis has a young daughter, leading the judge to rule that the posters could \"produce unfortunate reactions in the playground of the child's school\". The judge also said that there would come a point when Mr Ellis would \"decide to try to put his criminal conduct behind him\". However, he recognised the police campaign was a \"genuine initiative... and that their objective is in the public's interest since it is to reduce crime and increase the confidence of the public in the effectiveness of the police and the criminal justice system generally\". The Press Complaints Commission's code of conduct states: \"Young people should be free to complete their time at school without unnecessary intrusion.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"
