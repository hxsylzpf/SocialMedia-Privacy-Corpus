  "content": "The Hollywood actors Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas forfeited their right to privacy by turning their wedding into an \"international media event\", the high court in London was told yesterday. Hello! magazine, in its defence against the actors' claim that it invaded their privacy by covertly taking pictures of their lavish wedding ceremony, insists the pair exploited the event for financial gain and to further their careers as film stars. They publicised the starry guest list in advance and encouraged the media to write about the wedding after it had taken place. Guests were not banned from taking pictures at the event, held in the New York Plaza hotel in November 2000, but were only requested not to use cameras. OK! magazine had signed a \u00a31m deal for exclusive pictures, but was beaten to the streets by its rival carrying unauthorised pictures taken by a paparazzo - Rupert Thorpe, son of the disgraced former Liberal party leader Jeremy Thorpe - who \"gatecrashed\" the wedding. The stars are claiming \u00a3500,000 damages from Hello!; the publishers of OK! are seeking \u00a31.75m. Hello!'s defence is outlined in a document submitted to the court and highlighted yesterday by the Douglases' counsel, Michael Tugendhat QC. It says Hello! intends to cite the weddings of Michelle Pfeiffer and David Kelly, Madonna and Guy Ritchie, and Kate Winslet and Jim Threapleton as evidence of how celebrities can more successfully keep their marriage ceremonies private. The Douglases' \u00a31m contract to allow approved pictures to be published in OK! \"turned the Douglases' wedding into a commercial venture\", Hello! claims. But James Price QC, counsel for Hello!, told the court he would not argue that the couple had deliberately invited prominent guests in order to gain maximum press coverage. Mr Tugendhat replied: \"That's not the way I read it.\" He insisted the couple had gone to great lengths to keep the event private. He did not deny there was a great deal of advance press coverage but said: \"The question is whether it is they who stirred it up.\" He added that they did not. Mr Tugendhat dismissed the claim that, simply because the guest list contained 350 people, the wedding could not be regarded as private. Offices and schools often held private events with hundreds in attendance. \"The notion that you can't have a private event because 350 people are present is so bizarre that I have difficulty in addressing it,\" he told the court. Mr Tugendhat said elaborate security measures had been employed to prevent guests from taking photos. With their invitations, they received a note asking them not to take pictures; on arrival, they were given a gold pin to identify them as guests and searched; if anyone was still found to be carrying a camera, they were asked to hand it over. \"By a very large fellow,\" commented the judge, Mr Justice Lindsay. \"By somebody whose request was unlikely to be refused,\" Mr Tugendhat replied. The judge said he had seen reference to the \"frisking\" of guests. Mr Price said: \"There were a number of cameras that were seen; and once a camera had been seen, somebody stepped in, and said 'Oi!'\" Mr Tugendhat told the court: \"The Douglases are in the position where they can pay for the most elaborate security that New York can offer, but it's not watertight.\" He dismissed the suggestion that the law should not plug the gap - otherwise people who could not afford security would not be protected. \"That's effectively advocating one law for the rich and another for the poor,\" he said. The case continues.",
