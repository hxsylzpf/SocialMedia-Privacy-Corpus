  "content": "The tube is an awkward experience at the best of times. Gritted teeth are the norm when you're faced with shoulders squashed up underneath armpits and people reading over your shoulder. So spare a thought for weary commuters worldwide, who were on Sunday confronted by a flashmob (fleshmob?) of trouserless passengers, going about their daily journey while proudly showing off some of their white bits to the world. The daring passengers weren't merely your normal tube eccentrics however, but a group assembled by a performance art group \u2013 Improv Everywhere \u2013 who join together annually to celebrate \"No pants subway rides\". People from 59 different cities took part in Sunday's event, backing up the organisers' mission statement that it's intended \"to cause scenes of chaos and joy\", at least in part. These kind of stories reinforce the notion that the internet has become a powerful community tool. From Facebook to Comment is free, groups of likeminded people come together to have fun in a way that life didn't offer before the world wide web. As much as I slightly despise the cynically sponsored flashmob events (such as the famous T-Mobile dance at Liverpool Street Station), the idea of people who would not ordinarily know each other joining together in something so conventionally pointless is joyful. Our daily lives are mostly controlled by our schedule and finances, but initiatives like this give us a chance to spend some time experiencing something for nothing. The photos from the event show a surreal camaraderie that is unusual in big cities where you normally go out of your way to avoid having to look people in the eye. Why do events like this, with no clear outcome, prove so popular? Social media obviously plays a huge part in spreading the word. The organisers of these events have almost a million subscribers on their YouTube channel, and run a popular Facebook page to alert participants to their new plans. Creating this kind of online influence is now an extremely effective way to organise any community activity from sponsored flashmobs to the Twitter users who helped clean up after the 2011 English riots. Of course, the popularity of such plans can sometimes be misjudged, like the ill-advised water fight in Hyde park last year, but on the whole it seems that social media encourages a more childish sense of enjoyment in us. Why else would grown adults use a megaphone to shout out nice things to random passersby? To brave a cold and dirty tube station in just a threadbare pair of Y-fronts, purely with the intention of making people smile at your sheer gumption, is something we should all applaud. Of course, for most of us that will be from some distance, with our jeans firmly zipped up and our teeth gritted at the ready. \u2022 This article was commissioned after a suggestion by Pairubu."
