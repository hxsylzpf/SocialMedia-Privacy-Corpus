  "content": "Yesterday's article on this site by Hugh Tomlinson QC, How to create a privacy law, was excellent. I could rudely suggest that he took much longer to say what I've been saying and writing for weeks, only in a much shorter form. Then again, I'm a journalist and he's a lawyer. And the benefit of his legalistic piece was that it covered all the bases. What emerged clearly from studying his four options was that, aside from a total withdrawal from every single European institution, the current development of the law of privacy by judges is inevitable. Tabloid editors can scream. Politicians can huff and puff. It isn't going to change the situation one iota. We are where we are. Kiss'n'tells will be harder to publish. Sexual dalliances will be more difficult to reveal. Gagging orders will be common. Judges will be asked to make decisions based on the public interest. That is, of course, also the central criterion of the editors' code of practice, but it has been conveniently ignored too often by pop paper editors since the code was drawn up in 1990. Will Britain suffer by allowing people to protect their privacy? Will genuinely foul deeds by covered up? Will criminals prosper? Will hypocrites escape exposure? I think not."
