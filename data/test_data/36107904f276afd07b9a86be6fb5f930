  "content": "The voters of Iowa and New Hampshire have a right to feel a little peeved. They take great pride in turning the ignition key for presidential bandwagons every four years, as the first stages in the primary process that selects America's candidates. But now the ubiquitous social networking website MySpace is threatening to steal their thunder, announcing that it will \"give America its first presidential primary winner\" with a vote on January 1-2 2008. Given that almost 65 million Americans visit MySpace every month, of which 85% are of voting age, this will be the mother of all straw polls, setting the tone for the entire selection campaign. Concerns about its veracity are surfacing already, though: there are plenty of multimedia equivalents of hanging chads. \"With a web community such as MySpace, that isn't tied to a country's borders or a viable 'voting age' limit, you simply CANNOT hold an open 'primary' and expect anyone to take those results as viable polling data,\" wrote James at www.rightonblog.net. The candidates' campaign teams have already set up profile pages (try www.myspace.com/barackobama), promoting policy statements, selling merchandise, and encouraging networking among supporters. Barack Obama is streets ahead of the pack, seemingly pulling in the same kind of young, web-savvy supporters as Howard Dean did in 2004. With more than 99,000 \"friends\", he leads John Edwards (18,000) and Hillary Clinton (10,000), while Republicans Mitt Romney and John McCain languish with fewer than 6,000; Rudy Giuliani's figures are kept private. The candidates' home pages are revealing in themselves. What member of the MySpace generation could fail to warm to the 70-year-old McCain knowing that his favourite TV show is the absurdly over-wrought 24? Edwards' listing of \"the American people\" in the Heroes section of his page is probably carefully calculated too, but it captures the homely brand of patriotism of the candidate from North Carolina. MySpace CEO Chris DeWolfe insists excitably that its entry into the political arena will \"ignite [users'] involvement in the political process\", and there's a certain amount of truth to that. How else do you explain the thrill I felt when my inbox announced dramatically, \"You've got a new message from Hillary Clinton on MySpace!\"",
