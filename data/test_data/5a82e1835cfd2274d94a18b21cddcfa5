  "content": "Newspaper lawyers have expressed concern at a high court injunction they say could spell the end of 'kiss and tell' expos\u00e9s. They claim the ruling is a worrying development and could be used as an instrument of censorship. News International's head of legal affairs, Tom Crone, said the high court judgment - which effectively says a person who enters into sexual relations with another is obliged to keep the details of the encounter confidential - is \"a dangerous precedent\". The injunction was granted after an unnamed, married, professional footballer went to court to stop a newspaper publishing the accounts of two women with whom he had had affairs. Mr Crone said: \"As I understand it, this footballer - who is married - is a relatively public figure in his area and it's fair to say around 50% of people in the area would know exactly what this was all about. \"I think it's a very dangerous precedent for something that is clearly not confidential to be covered by a legal injunction.\" Mr Crone said lawyers were alarmed that 'kiss and tell' expos\u00e9s with a public interest value - such as the Sun's revelation of the extra-marital activities of the Tory MP, Piers Merchant - could be under threat. His views were echoed by the Express's legal chief, Justin Walford, who said there was growing concern the judgment \"could be used to gag newspapers\". \"I'm not convinced it's the end of the kiss and tell but it certainly raises that possibility,\" Mr Walford said. And Associated Newspapers lawyer Harvey Kass described the development as a \"very worrying and surprising decision, which has worrying implications for freedom of expression and democracy.\" The expos\u00e9 that prompted the judgment was to have been published in April. A preliminary injunction, which is subject to appeal, ruled the publication of the material amounted to a \"breach of a duty of confidence\" between the footballer and the two women. \"To most people, the details of their sexual lives are high on their list of those matters they regard as confidential,\" said the judge, the Honorable Mr Justice Jack, in his ruling. \"When people enter into a personal agreement of this nature, they do not do so for the purpose of it being published subsequently in the Sun or any other newspaper. \"The information about the relationship is for the relationship and not a wider purpose. \"The fact is, when people kiss and, later, one of them tells, that second person is almost certainly breaking a confidentiality agreement.\" Mr Justice Jack also observed: \"Much of [the injuncted material] is concerned with salacious description of the sexual activity between the claimant and C or D [the women]. It is intended for the prurient.\" In the judgment, it was noted that nobody \"knew that they [the women] were having an affair in the sense of sexual relations, including sexual intercourse\". Mr Justice Jack said there was \"no public interest in the publication of the articles\". He added: \"The claimant's conduct is to be condemned by any moral standard; but that does not provide a public interest in the publication of the information about these two extra-marital affairs.\" The newspaper is appealing against the decision."
