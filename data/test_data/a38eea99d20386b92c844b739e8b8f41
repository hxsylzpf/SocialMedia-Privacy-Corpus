  "content": "Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have laid out plans to invest $3bn over the next 10 years with the not insignificant goal of tackling all diseases. \"Can we cure, prevent or manage all disease by the end of this century?\" asked Zuckerberg, speaking in front of a packed lecture theater at the University of California, San Francisco's (UCSF) William J Rutter Center. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will focus on some of the world's biggest killers, including heart disease, cancer, infectious diseases and neurological diseases. One of its biggest investments is to be a $600m \"Biohub\" at UCSF, which will bring together scientists and engineers from Stanford, Berkeley and UCSF \u2013 who haven't collaborated in this way before \u2013 to develop tools to treat diseases. The second focus will be transformative technology, all of which will be made available to all scientists everywhere. \"Throughout the history of science, most of the major scientific breakthroughs have been preceded by some new tool and technology that allows you to see in new ways,\" explained Zuckerberg. \"The telescope helped us understand astronomy and the universe, the microscope helped us understand cells and bacteria to help us develop treatments for infectious diseases, while DNA sequencing and editing helps us fight cancer and genetic disorders.\" Zuckerberg suggested that artificial intelligence could help with brain imaging to treat neurological diseases, machine learning could be used to analyse cancer genomes, and chips and blood monitors could identify diseases quickly. \"These are the kinds of tools we want to focus on building at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,\" he said. The acclaimed American neurobiologist Cornelia Bargmann, who will lead the initiative, gave the example of a \"cell atlas\", a comprehensive resource that maps the locations, types and molecular properties of all of the cells in the human body. \"We need this to develop new understanding and cures for diseases in all areas of medicine,\" she said. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is a limited liability company that the couple uses to make donations and investments to advance their philanthropic causes. It was launched at the birth of the couple's first daughter, Max, in December 2015. The couple has committed 99% of their Facebook stock, valued at $45bn, to the initiative, which makes charitable donations and for-profit investments. The organisation initially focused on education, funding the Indian company BYJU's, which helps students learn maths and science, and the Nigerian company Andela, which trains African software developers. It has now turned its attention to science. The organisation will achieve its objective by focusing on building tools and technology, bringing scientists from across the world together and growing a movement to fund more scientific research. Wiping back tears in an emotional opening talk, Chan described her work as a paediatrician. \"I have worked with families at their most difficult moments in their lives, from making the devastation diagnosis of leukaemia to sharing with them that we were unable to resuscitate their child,\" she said. \"By investing in science today, we hope to build a future in which all of our children can live long and rewarding lives.\" Zuckerberg and Chan acknowledged it was an ambitious undertaking. \"It's a big goal,\" said Zuckerberg. However, he said that he and Chan had spent two years talking to Nobel Prize-winning scientists and researchers and believed it was not unrealistic. \"Can we all together work to cure, prevent or manage all disease within our children's lifetime? We think it's possible and so do scientists,\" Chan added. \"It's not that we won't ever get sick, but that our children and their children will get sick a lot less.\" The plan won the approval of one surprise guest \u2013 Microsoft founder-turned-philanthropist Bill Gates. He was welcomed to the stage by Zuckerberg, who described him as a \"role model and mentor\". \"The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is already doing some very promising work in improving the education of all students. It's amazing they are taking on another bold challenge,\" said Gates, who has flexed his philanthropic muscles by funding projects to tackle malaria and HIV through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the last 15 years. \"We cannot end these diseases with the tools we have today. Only through science can we get an HIV vaccine, a malaria vaccine,\" he said. \"I am so impressed with the team that's been pulled together here. I have no doubt that we'll make great progress on these diseases and literally save millions of lives and make the world a better place.\"",
