  "content": "London-based social networking service Flirtomatic has secured \u00a32m funding from Seraphim Capital to finance its expansion into international mobile markets. The one-year-old company claims to have created such a compelling service that it has cracked the elusive mobile social networking market. Flirtomatic allows users to create a personal profile and flirt with other users both online and using their mobile. Three-quarters of Flirtomatic's traffic comes via mobile. Many web content providers have struggled to build an audience among mobile users, with common complaints by consumers being that services are hard to use and data charges are too high. Mark Curtis, the company's chief executive, said that the \"brand promise\" of dating services might be lifetime romance, but the promise of Flirtomatic is flirting. He added that the \u00a32m funding will push the company into profit. Web dating services are often based on lengthy personal profiles, but Flirtomatic is more lighthearted, according to Mr Curtis. \"One problem with digital services is that they tend to be rather po-faced, whereas we tried to use a tone and language that is more vernacular because that works well on the phone,\" Mr Curtis said. Flirtomatic claims a combined web and mobile audience of 380,000 users in the UK, recording around 103 million page views every month. The average user visits Flirtomatic eight times a day and 55% of users are aged between 18 and 25. The company will focus on launching local-language services in different countries in the next 12 months. Flirtomatic operates on a \"freemium\" business model, where basic usage is free and users pay for premium services, such as gifts for other members or extra information on who has rated them as a hot user. The majority of its revenue is currently derived from these value-added services, but Mr Curtis said he expected this to change as the mobile advertising market grows. The site has already experimented with gender-based ad targeting. Market-leading social networking sites MySpace and Facebook both introduced mobile-accessible services early last year for US customers. \"The typical thing is that when you try to move medium, the initial thing isn't right - look what happened to newspapers and magazines on the web in the mid-90s,\" Mr Curtis said. He added that though Flirtomatic operates in a niche market, all digital services are competing for users' attention. Flirtomatic initially received seed funding from its executive chairman, Avi Azulai, co-founder of mobile content firm iTouch, and later first-round funding from Doughty Hanson. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
