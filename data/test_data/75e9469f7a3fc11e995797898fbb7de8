  "content": "District 9 director Neill Blomkamp has confirmed that an Alien movie will be his next big-screen project. Blomkamp, who has been feeding concept art for the proposed film to excited fans since the beginning of January, took to Instagram with a new image of the celebrated xenomorph. The South African film-maker's caption read: \"Um \u2026 So I think it's officially my next film. #alien.\" Hollywood trade magazine Variety said its sources at studio 20th Century Fox had confirmed that a new Alien movie would be moving ahead with Blomkamp writing and directing. The project will be distinct from Ridley Scott's planned Prometheus sequel, the British director's follow-up to his own 2012 return to the Alien universe after more than three decades. Blomkamp initially took to Instagram on New Year's Day to post artwork for an Alien project he said he was no longer working on. The mocked-up concept art featured Sigourney Weaver, who played Ellen Ripley in four Alien movies between 1979 and 1997, and Michael Biehn, who played Hicks in 1986's Aliens. Blomkamp later revealed he worked with Weaver on the project during downtime from his forthcoming sci-fi movie Chappie, which features the former Ghostbusters star in a supporting role. \"Speaking to Sigourney Weaver, when we were doing Chappie, she set off a bunch of thoughts in my head \u2014 I had come up with an idea that didn't have Sigourney, it was a different idea,\" said the film-maker. \"But I spent all of the shooting time with her, it was like, holy shit, that could actually be really interesting. When I came back to Vancouver, I had an entire year to work on Chappie. And when I wasn't needed in the edit, I could think about Alien. So, I basically developed an entire movie and I did all of this artwork as well.\" Earlier this month Weaver admitted being intrigued by the prospect of a return to her best known role. \"If something happens from this, it would be very organic and very original, and because of that it would make me want to do it,\" she said. \"If it was [directed by] someone as talented as Neill, I'd certainly listen.\" It is not clear if Weaver is now attached to the project, a move which would create a number of issues for the film-makers. Ripley was last seen as a human-xenomorph clone in the 1997 film Alien: Resurrection, after the original extraterrestrial-exterminating warrant officer died at the end of 1992's Alien 3."
