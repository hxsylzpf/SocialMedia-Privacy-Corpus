  "content": "Social media isn't just for photos and status updates \u2013 it can also be used to help sixth-formers make an informed decision about where to go to university. Many universities now have a greater focus on marketing, due to increased competition in the higher education sector. So prospective students are cutting through the publicity by using social media alongside official guides. Social media can also be particularly helpful for international students, who made up 18% of the UK student population in 2012-13, and those who are unable to visit a university. If you contact people through sites like Facebook and Twitter you can get unfiltered views on a university or course, says Maria Suessmilch, who has just started a masters in neuroscience at King's College London. \"It's a great way of researching courses and getting an honest opinion about them so I'd definitely recommend it,\" she says. What sites are best and how should sixth-formers use them? Facebook is one of the most popular sites, with 13% of students surveyed by the National Centre for Universities and Business this year saying they used it to choose a course. Facebook is a useful way of getting honest opinions, says Loretta Colees, a third year student studying zoology at Bangor University. \"I joined the Facebook groups of courses I was hoping to apply for and could see what the course content might be like and what people really thought of the lectures.\" Twitter is another good source of information and a way to ask questions not answered elsewhere. \"Twitter is great for getting answers to any niggling questions you have, for clearing up any confusion with the application process and for getting quick snapshots of university life,\" says Sabrina Francis, social media officer at City University London. University websites often provide information on the hashtags their students use, says Emily Dring, a fourth year student studying French at Oxford University. \"At my university we have the hashtag #oxtweets, where students tweet about their lives at Oxford.\" Other social media channels prospective students can use include Instagram, Pinterest and YouTube. \"Instagram was a hit,\" says Suessmilch. \"I found a girl who posted a picture of her fresher's goodie bag, saying she had just started the course I was interested in. \"I left her a comment saying I would love to hear what she thought of the course. We wrote a few emails and what she said helped me to make a choice about whether to apply there.\" Other useful websites include the Ucas website, WhatUni, UniStats and the Student Room. The Guardian University Guide ranks every course at UK universities, so you can see which institutions excel in which subject areas. Forums and student blogs give sixth-formers the chance to find out what current students think. \"Peer-to-peer forums like the Student Room are good for speaking to current students and getting their view on an institution,\" says Francis. They also enable you to get answers to questions you don't feel like you can ask universities. \"Students can ask questions that they wouldn't always feel comfortable asking the university directly,\" says David Roylance, head of undergraduate recruitment at Cardiff University. And what should prospective students avoid doing? \"Avoid unofficial looking pages that are trying to sell you something, usually tickets to club nights, and don't give your details out publicly,\" says Francis. Students should remember that not all sites or social media platforms are verified or moderated, says Roylance. \"Peer-led sites use anecdotal evidence and offer comparisons based on personal experiences \u2013 so remember opinions are subjective,\" he says. \"Students should always look for verified accounts on Twitter and Facebook and use the institution's website for the most accurate, up-to-date information relating to courses and fees.\" How I found my course Emily Dring, 23, is going into her fourth year studying French at Oxford University \"I used social media because I wanted a more personal take on the university experience and I wanted to hear individual accounts. \"I spent a lot of time researching online \u2013 there's so much information. I started with YouTube and would type things into search that were related to what I wanted to find out about. I also used the Student Room, which has threads related to different colleges, campuses, and to accommodation. \"Watch out because in chat forums people can be anonymous and aren't always who they say they are. Often the people who go on those platforms either really loved their experience or really hated it, so take things they say with a pinch of salt. \"It's useful to talk to people who are already at university and you can use social media to get in touch. I'd say you should take on board family and friends' opinions, but the people who are already there are the people who know the most.\" \u2022 Did you use social media to find out more about a university?
