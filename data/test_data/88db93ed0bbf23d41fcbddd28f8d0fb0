  "content": "Job: chief operating officer, Facebook Age: 44 Industry: digital media New entry Three years ago, as Sheryl Sandberg prepared to deliver a bold TED talk on women in the workplace, she feared that \"it would be the official end of my career,\" she told the Guardian in March. Today, Sandberg is the second in command at Facebook and one of the most influential executives in the world \u2013 and her brand of workplace feminism has gone global, making her a more prominent figure in the past year than the social network's co-founder, chairman and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. The 43-year-old toured the world in 2013 promoting her book, Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead, a manifesto to address the gender imbalance in corporate boardrooms across America. The book sold nearly 150,000 copies in its first week on the shelves in March and sales have held strong ever since. At Facebook, Sandberg has played no small part in winning over Wall Street, which likes the social network again 15 months after its disastrous stock market debut in May 2012. Shares in Facebook have bounced back above the $38 price of the initial public offering, buoyed by a surge in the site's mobile advertising revenue. Questions about Facebook's ability to reshape its business for the smartphone and tablet age are now rarer, and early scepticism from investors and analysts has been replaced by growing optimism on the back of strong financial results. In the second quarter of 2013, Facebook reported a 53% jump in revenues to $1.81bn. More significantly, 41% of all its advertising revenue came from mobile. So much for the naysayers. With success both inside and outside Facebook, Sandberg has had to field nagging questions about her own career ambitions. In an interview with CBS News in March, the executive was asked whether she wanted to be the first female president of the US. \"I mean, for me, I feel like I'm doing all the leaning in that I can do right now,\" she replied."
