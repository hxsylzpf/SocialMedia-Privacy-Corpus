  "content": "Last month, the anti-tax-dodging campaign UK Uncut tweeted: \"Could the organisers of the Taunton action this Sat please get in touch? Many thanks.\" Theorists talk of how new technology has facilitated decentralised, non-hierarchical, horizontal networks. Well this, in less than 140 characters, is what such a network looks like. UK Uncut's successful high-street protests put paid to the notion that online campaigning was essentially \"clicktivism\" \u2013 online petitions and other mostly effortless activities. In fact, it didn't just disprove such assumptions, it turned them upside down. As a UK Uncut spokesperson says: \"So many campaigns rely on the premise that the less you ask someone to do, the more likely they are to do it. This campaign has proved the opposite. People who have never even been on a protest before have taken on organising them.\" The other development in recent months was the student protests. Here, social media helped foster a new, radical movement outside of both established NUS structures and traditional leftwing groupings. Each occupation seemed to follow a two-step process: 1) Take over the building; 2) Open a Twitter account. And through Twitter the protesters co-ordinated with each other, and broadcast their story to everyone else. The student protests led to some innovative uses of open-source technology too, such as the Google maps mash-up offering a live view of police kettling. And then there's the site I'm involved in, False Economy, an online attempt to map cuts and campaigns around the UK, while communicating the economic case against cuts to a wider public. Political campaigners have often been guilty of talking mainly to each other. But some are starting to find more imaginative ways to get their message across. UK Uncut linked Philip Green's legal tax avoidance to cuts in school sports by organising indoor sports days at Topshop. And when it comes to communicating to a wider audience, we now have a powerful tool: social media. One newspaper that knows the power of social media is the Daily Mail. The Mail's website readership is huge \u2013 it is the second-largest English language news site to the New York Times worldwide \u2013 and 10% of its traffic is generated by Facebook. Mail Online's publisher, Martin Clarke, said recently: \"Facebook isn't a threat \u2026 but a gigantic free marketing engine.\" But in truth it is both. Consider the influence of social media following the student protests. Mobile footage, such as that of Jody McIntyre being dragged out of his wheelchair, spread around the web, undermining the mainstream media narrative that the thuggery was all on the students' side. A viral story like this can also impact on the mainstream media itself. The Mail reported the McIntyre affair on its news pages with the headline, \"Shocking video of police tipping disabled man out of wheelchair during student protest causes outrage\". And when police discussed using water cannons on protestors, the Mail published a particularly horrific image, with the headline, \"Pictured: How water cannons can BLIND protestors \u2026\". Where did they discover that image? Probably from a small leftwing blog, The Third Estate, that had run the story a few days earlier and received 30,000 hits. Mail executives may view Facebook as a free marketing engine, but for campaigners, social media offers much more interesting opportunities. \u2022 Clifford Singer is speaking at today's Netroots UK conference (www.netrootsuk.org) for grassroots activists. A number of other participants have written for Comment is Free.",
