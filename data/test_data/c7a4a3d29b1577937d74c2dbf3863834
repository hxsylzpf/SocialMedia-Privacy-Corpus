  "content": "Channel 4 is to set up weddings between three pairs of complete strangers in a reality TV experiment to discover if big data can find true love. Married at First Sight is described as a \"groundbreaking social experiment\", attempting to match three couples from an initial pool of more than 200 applicants using scientific and sociological criteria. Six people will be chosen for a legally binding marriage with a complete stranger, with the television cameras following every step of the first six weeks of their relationship. They will then decide if they want to stay together, or divorce. Inspired by a Danish TV format the series, unveiled at Channel 4's annual report on Thursday, has echoes of the radio format Two Strangers and a Wedding, which ran on Birmingham station BRMB, presided over by Jeremy Kyle. The first couple featured on the station married live on air in 1999 but split soon after, with Kyle later marrying the bride. Channel 4 said its peaktime share of the audience was marginally up year on year, boosted by the controversy around its documentary series Benefits Street, with a 6.44% share between 7pm and 11pm in the year to date, compared with 6.33% in the same period in 2013. But its all-day share is down, to 6.1% from 6.35% last year. While E4's share has grown, Channel 4's total share of the all-day audience, including all of its channels such as More4 and Film4, is down, to 11% from 11.26% last year. Other new Channel 4 shows announced on Thursday include Dementiaville, a three-part exploration of a progressive approach to treatment of people with dementia, allowing them to retreat to memories of the past. Cutting Edge documentary Living with the Roma will look at what life is like for the minority community in Britain, following the success of the channel's Big Fat Gypsy Wedding series. Another Cutting Edge, The Police Commissioner, will follow Kent's first elected police and crime commissioner Ann Barnes, who caused controversy with her appointment of 17-year-old Paris Brown to represent the views of young people in the county. Brown later had to resign after a storm over comments she posted on Twitter. Channel 4 said Married at First Sight was a response to the 15.7 million single adults now living in the UK, with marriage at an all-time low. Each of the participants \"seeking long-term love\" will be \"carefully matched\" by a panel of experts in psychology, psychotherapy, social and evolutionary anthropology, it said, in the hope \"their combined professional experience can create a 'perfect' match\". \"For over 20 years leading psychologists have been researching the theory that human behaviour \u2013 such as acting lovingly towards another person \u2013 can actually spark the genuine emotional response in both parties?\" said the broadcaster. \"Is it really possibly to 'choose' to fall in love?\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
