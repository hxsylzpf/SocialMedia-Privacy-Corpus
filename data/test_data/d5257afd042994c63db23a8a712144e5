  "content": "Quite a lot of times over the past eight years, I've enjoyed meeting for the first time, face to face, old friends from many countries such as the UK, Australia, Germany, or the USA. Owing to having known each other online for years, we immediately connect in person. Internet friendships are far from being less worthwhile or real than friendships formed in daily life: in fact, they force you to face up to issues you would often avoid otherwise. They encourage you to not only learn much about life and people in general, but also about yourself. Internet friendships have played a very large part in my life for the last decade. In the past five years, I have owned and administered a bulletin board, the Heathen Hangout, which is based on the idea of a community of friends with a common ethic. In this particular case the board's ethics are atheism and secular humanism, but for the principles I'll outline here, it could just as easily be a Jewish, Muslim, or Christian board, or even one devoted to arcane linguistics, for what they often have in common. My board started because of a long chain of events after the suicide of a person known to many of us online and is meant to fulfil a need for online support of those who feel socially isolated (because of their atheism, in this case, though of course many other groups could easily relate to this). I also run another, smaller board which is for everyone, the Heathen Hub. Internet friendships are no easy matter and neither is providing a safe place for them. They differ in very significant ways from how we make friendships \"face to face\", but underlying that is still the fact that you are dealing with real people. This is something that some try to deny, which is one of the risks of online life. And just as in \"real\" life, there are narcissists, manipulators and liars online as well, who are a danger to any community. Malicious gossip and bullying are of course real threats, and need to be dealt with. As a board administrator, I am the person who has to deal with them. There are the issues of those with mental health problems, who are often stigmatised and ostracised in daily life. When looking after an internet community, you are often confronted with the need to have some kind of rough understanding about why someone is behaving in the problematic way they are, and what to do about it. Are they behaving like that because of mental health problems or genuine suicidal ideation \u2013 or are they just being narcissistic or malicious? Or even some combination of all that? Many people find a solace and acceptance online that they cannot find in person, whether because of reasons of bad family background, or because of social isolation, or so on. This is where online communities can really shine in value. However, online relationships cannot simply be based on friendship alone, but need to be based on some sort of principle \u2013 it is worthless to extol the virtues of friendship if you are only friends with a group of thugs, for example. That is where my position as a board administrator comes into play \u2013 keeping principles and acting on them. Just as Mark Vernon has previously pointed out in the Guardian, it's no good just chasing happiness for its own sake in a thoughtless way; similarly, it's no good chasing friendship (or worse, popularity) just for its own sake. In order to provide a safe place for internet friendships to flourish, admins need to be able to handle losing some friendships. You need to be able to live without popularity, and you may well need to ignore a huge amount of abuse and lies put about by those who need to be barred from your community. You need to be able to cope with strong disagreements, and you must also be able to protect confidentiality. The protection of the private sphere of your online community will be the toughest part of your administration. It is precisely on this aspect that many fail, ending up closing down private sections of their bulletin boards, or even their entire forum when they cannot cope with the demands that the protection of confidentiality entails. Boards without such protection abound on the net, but are often marked by either aggressive cliques effectively in control, or by artificial and hard limits being placed on what may be discussed. After all that, making sure there is not too much abuse will also be very important. Equalising power relationships between members on a board is, or should be, a vital part of your custodianship of a board. Failure means a worthless board, or no board at all (see, for example, the story of how the Richard Dawkins forum was suddenly closed down). Does it all have value in the end? Yes, most certainly. Some find a social niche that did not exist for them in daily life, and others will find expanded depth and value to their social interactions. Births, deaths, partnerships, joys and sorrows will be just as much a shared part of life inside the online community as in person. On my board, members have successfully saved the life of one person who was greatly endangered by health and locality problems. Perhaps at least one other life has been saved too, from suicidal depression. Often, people will share much more of their inner thinking online than they would do in person. GK Chesterton once wrote in one of his articles that if you really want to experience new people, hopping over your neighbour's fence may bring you much more than travelling to a foreign country. In just that way, an online community may be a much more novel experience than a two week insulated trip to a tourist destination. A good community overcomes ethnicity, gender, geography and all sorts of other barriers \u2013 and can be for life for its members.",
