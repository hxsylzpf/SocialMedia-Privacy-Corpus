  "content": "Video-sharing apps are all the rage in Silicon Valley in 2012. Well, two are. Viddy raised $30m in mid-May as it passed 27m users, then signed up Justin Bieber, while rival Socialcam has 51.5m monthly active users. Facebook's desire to pay $1bn to buy photo-sharing app Instagram has focused attention on Viddy and Socialcam, with both having been labelled 'the Instagram of video' and tipped for similar big-money exits. Yet a new app called Vyclone might just trump them both. The iPhone app was released on Thursday 17 May in the UK alone, in advance of a wider launch later in the year. It's not just about shooting videos and sharing them on Facebook and Twitter. Vyclone's social features begin when you're actually filming. Or as its in-app intro describes it: \"Co-create, sync and share movies with the people around you. Film together and make a movie with all of your perspectives.\" Vyclone itself is a startup, with its head office in Los Angeles, and a team of developers in London. I met chief executive David King Lassman and vice president of marketing Marni Borek just after the app went live to find out more. It started off as a music-focused thing, with Lassman's co-founder Joe Sumner \u2013 musician and son of Sting \u2013 coming up with an idea in 2010 for a technology that would take all the videos shot by fans at gigs, synchronise them together, then replace the audio with a proper feed from the soundboard. And then let fans remix all this. 'Bigger than music' The company set to work in late 2010, building the technology while talking to labels, publishers, artists and live music firms about possible partnerships, and raising seed funding from angel and institutional investors and entertainment companies. \"We realised as we were building it that this was something way bigger than music,\" says Lassman. \"What we had built was a tool that gave people at any event, from a child's birthday party to a fashion show, sports event or stadium concert, the ability to hold up their phones, and connect to everybody else who was shooting video at that event.\" I've been testing Vyclone, and it's very impressive. Start filming, and a little box pops up in the bottom corner of the screen showing how many other people are filming too \u2013 this is based on location data. You can film up to 60 seconds of footage, and then upload it to Vyclone's server, where it's combined with those other people's videos, stitched together into a mini-movie that can then be watched within the app, shared to YouTube, saved to the camera roll and so on. Meanwhile, a remix feature lets you switch between the different viewpoints to create your own edit, simply by tapping on the video thumbnails in real-time as they all play on-screen. It's a very elegant, intuitive app to use. \"Our big regret is that we didn't have Vyclone ready in time for the Arab unrest or Occupy Wall Street protests, as it would have been a very powerful tool to record what was truly happening,\" says Lassman. \"We're convinced that citizen journalism will be a key application for the product. But the reason we're putting this out into the public domain is that people will find uses for this that we couldn't possibly begin to imagine.\" Money-making plans Music remains a key strand in Vyclone's thinking: it's working with Live Nation in the US, for example. Originally, the company's business model was based around \"this being a piece of merchandise: you'd download the app for free, then buy a licence to legally record the gig\". The more general focus now means Vyclone is focusing on signing up lots of users in the short term, then making money. Lassman says ideas include using in-app purchases to record longer or higher-resolution videos. However, he stresses that the company is flexible, and has already made changes during the app's development, such as removing an initial requirement that multiple people be filming nearby to use the app. A sensible change, given the famous flop of photo-sharing app Color, which launched with a similar requirement. Vyclone is iPhone-only for now, but Lassman says Android is firmly in the company's plans, albeit after \"three, four, five or maybe six\" iterations of the iPhone version to hone the product. There will also be a tablet version of the app, and at some point an API so that Vyclone's technology can be incorporated into other apps \u2013 examples might be those for music artists or news broadcasters. Vyclone is one of the most potentially disruptive social apps that I've seen, but it does throw up some chewy questions concerning rights. For example, over ownership of a video created from footage shot by several people, especially if it then gets published to YouTube or even used by a broadcaster if it's news-related. Users can choose whether their videos are publicly shared, viewable and editable. If public, the company's terms and conditions say this: \"By choosing to post the content to the Vyclone website through the app, you are granting pretty much everyone else the right to use, edit and view your content. It's 21st Century sharing, and we hope you like that. If you don't, then don't hit POST to submit your content to the Vyclone website through the app.\" Rights disruption But there are other kinds of rights. Think about Vyclone users in London's Olympic stadium shooting the 100m final, or in Berlin for the Champions League football final \u2013 events where the mobile video rights are a.) assigned and b.) lucrative. There are issues around uploading video from these kinds of events to Facebook, YouTube and other sites \u2013 and even more so if livestreaming to something like Ustream. But the slicker the videos crowdshot on Vyclone are, the more kittens it may give sporting bodies and broadcasters. Lassman says that Vyclone is following the same policy as the likes of YouTube: users are expected to have the rights for the video they shoot \u2013 including the consent of everyone they film, which is tricky at a football match or large gig \u2013 with a robust takedown policy for copyright infringements. Of course, it could be a partner in these cases too, especially when its API launches. A football club could put Vyclone in its own app and encourage fans to film on matchdays. A musician could do the same thing for gigs. A broadcaster could even integrate Vyclone videos from an event into its coverage. As I said, potentially disruptive. But only if enough people use it. Word-of-mouth will help Vyclone to a certain extent, but the company's challenge now is to ensure that its app reaches critical mass as quickly as possible. That's if it isn't snapped up by a bigger fish in the meantime, of course. The company has filed several patents for its technology, and could well be a tempting acquisition for a Facebook, a Google or an Apple in the months to come."
