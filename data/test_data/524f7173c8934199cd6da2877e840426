  "content": "Police investigating allegations of harassment on Twitter have arrested a 25-year-old man in north-east England. The online abuse was aimed at Labour MP Stella Creasy and Caroline Criado-Perez, a feminist campaigner. The arrest by Northumbria police on Tuesday was carried out on behalf of the Metropolitan police and came two days after a 21-year-old was detained in the Manchester area on suspicion of committing harassment offences. The police operation began after Criado-Perez was deluged on Twitter with abuse and threats of rape. A Met spokesman said on Tuesday: \"This arrest will form part of two ongoing MPS [Metropolitan police service] investigations relating to allegations made to police by two separate victims, who made reports of malicious communication to police on 25 and 29 July.\" Criado-Perez, a journalist, suffered abuse on Twitter after successfully campaigning for a woman to appear on UK banknotes. She has said Twitter needs to \"get a grip\" on security, claiming the social network was ill-equipped to handle episodes of sustained abuse and needed to work more closely with police to deal with internet trolls. Criado-Perez met Twitter directors on Monday along with Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, who received similarly abusive messages after offering support to Criado-Perez. Twitter has been in contact with the police over the abuse. A spokesman said: \"We value the feedback from our users and are testing ways of simplifying the reporting process, including a broad rollout of in-Tweet reporting beyond the current availability on the iPhone app and mobile web.\""
