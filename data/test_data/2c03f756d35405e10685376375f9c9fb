  "content": "From: Tom Crone [chief lawyer, News of the World] Sent: 15 September 2006 10:34 To: Andy Coulson [then editor, News of the World] Subject: Strictly private and confidential Andy, Here's Rebekah told me about info relayed to her by cops: 1. they are confident they have Clive [Goodman, former royal editor] and GM [Mulcaire] bang to rights on the Palace intercepts; 2. [on Mulcaire's] ... accesses to voicemails. From these they have a list of 100-110 \"victims\"; 3. the only payment records they found were from News Int, ie the NoW retainer and other invoices; they said that over the period they looked at (going way back) there seemed to be over \u00a31m of payments. 4. the recordings and notes demonstrate a pattern of \"victims\" ... replaced by the next one who becomes flavour of the week/month; 5. they are visiting the bigger victims, ie where there are lots of intercepts; 6. their purpose is to insure that when GM [Mulcaire] comes up in court the full case against him is there for the court to see (rather than just the present palace charges); 7. all they are asking victims is \"did you give anyone permission to access your voicemail?\" and if not \"do you wish to make a formal complaint?\"; 8. They are confident that ... they can then charge Glenn Mulcaire in relation to those victims...they are keen that the charges should demonstrate the scale of GM [Mulcaire]'s activities ... so they would feature victims from different areas of public life, politics, showbiz, etc \"In terms of NoW [News of the World] (a) [This section is unclear] they suggested ... News of the World journalists directly accessing the voicemails (this is what did for Clive). (b) but they have got hold of NoW back numbers to 2004 and are trying to marry CG [Goodman] accesses to specific stories, (c) in one case [redacted] they seem to have a phrase from an NoW story which is identical to the tape or note of GM's access, (d) they have no recordings of NoW people speaking to GM or accessing voicemails, (e) they do have GM's phone records which show sequences of contacts with News of the World before and after accesses ... obviously they don't have the content of the calls ... so this is at best circumstantial. 10: they are going to contact RW [presumed to be a reference to Rebekah Wade] today to see if she wishes to take it further."
