  "content": "2001-02 Between 1 February 2001 and 19 March 2002, Gary McKinnon allegedly hacks into 97 US military and Nasa computers from his home in north London. 19 March 2002 McKinnon is arrested by British police. At the request of the US government, he is interviewed by the National High Tech Crime Unit who question him again on 8 August. 31 October The district court of New Jersey issues a warrant for his arrest on 12 November. A federal grand jury in Virginia indicts the computer expert on seven counts of computer-related crimes in 14 US states. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail. 2004 The US government files a request to have McKinnon extradited on 7 June 2005. McKinnon is arrested at his home by officers from Scotland Yard's extradition unit, and is granted bail after appearing at Bow Street Magistrates Court the following day. 10 May 2006 District judge Nicholas Evans recommends McKinnon should be extradited, but leaves the final decision to the then home secretary John Reid. 4 July Reid signs an order to extradite him to the US. 3 April 2007 McKinnon loses a high court appeal against his extradition. 30 July 2008 McKinnon loses House of Lords appeal against his extradition. 25 August The computer expert is diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism. 28 August The European Court of Human Rights rules it will not prevent McKinnon's extradition. 13 September The then home secretary, Jacqui Smith, refuses to stop the extradition on the grounds of his Asperger's diagnosis. 23 January 2009 McKinnon wins permission in the High Court to apply for a judicial review of his extradition. 23 February Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer of anti-terror laws, asks the home secretary to enable McKinnon to be prosecuted in the UK rather than face extradition. 26 February The Crown Prosecution Service refuses to bring charges against McKinnon in the UK as an alternative to US prosecution. 1 August McKinnon loses a further high court appeal to avoid his extradition. 2 August Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman says the government will push for McKinnon to serve his sentence in a British prison if he is found guilty. 26 October The home secretary, Alan Johnson, pledges to examine new medical evidence about McKinnon \"very carefully\" before approving his extradition. 26 November Alan Johnson quashes final attempt to halt McKinnon's extradition to the US"
