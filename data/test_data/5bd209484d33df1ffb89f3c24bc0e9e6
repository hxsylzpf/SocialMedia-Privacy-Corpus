  "content": "A strange legal case from Texas, where Affiliated Computer Services - a $4.4bn IT services giant with links to many large public and private bodies in the US - is suing a rival company over allegations that it stole trade secrets online. How? According to the case brought before federal court in Dallas, Duncan Solutions used Outlook to fake the email addresses of 25 ACS employees, redirecting all incoming messages to their own systems - thereby gaining access to all sorts of private business information. \"The stolen emails reveal not only information about specific prospective and existing clients, but also confidential and proprietary information regarding ACS' general business strategies and plans,\" said the complaint. Compared to the complexity of most computer crimes, this seems almost dangerously simple. Duncan is contesting the charges."
