  "content": "A magazine subscriptions database which held personal information of members of the US armed forces has been hacked into, according to an American media company. The Gannett Government Media Corporation holds information about subscribers to Defense News, one of the world's most widely read publications on the military, and other publications aimed at serving US army, navy, air force and marines personnel. The company discovered the breach on 7 June and notified subscribers via email. It said that names, passwords and email addresses had been hacked, and that other details, such as duty status, pay grades and type of service, were also obtained by the hackers. Emails can be used by cyber criminals for so-called phishing scams, where recipients receive an email purportedly from a trusted sender that is then used to gain control of their computer. One fear is that hackers could go on to take control of a government computer system. Other targets for hackers in recent weeks have included the US banking group Citigroup. IBGE, the Brazilian statistics agency which saw its site hacked on 24 June, found the front page of its website replaced with a human eye in the colours of the Brazilian flag. A note left on IBGE's website read \"there's no room for groups without an ideology such as LulzSec or Anonymous in Brazil\", in ab attempt to distance the group from other prominent hackers. LulzSec first appeared after highly publicised assaults on Sony, the CIA and the US Senate, but recently announced it would disband as its members were \"getting bored\". On Saturday an anonymous post appeared to name the group's leader and core members. One alleged member, 19-year-old Ryan Cleary, was arrested in the UK after an international investigation into LulzSec's activities. The Anonymous group rose to prominence during an Operation Payback campaign in support of the website Wikileaks. The group used distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks to target companies such as Visa, Mastercard and Paypal in an attempt to disrupt their websites."
