  "content": "In a small darkened room, up a narrow flight of stairs somewhere in Liverpool's main shopping area, a uniformed security guard is sitting on a low swivel chair in front of a wall of video screens. An old-fashioned red phone on a desk buzzes, and he has a low, brief chat into the receiver. It is another security guard in one of the high street stores, alerting him that there is a man leaving the shop he thinks he should keep an eye on. The guard presses a couple of buttons, and slowly swivels a joystick on the desk in front of him. Several streets away and 4m above street level, a security camera mounted on a tall, thin pole rotates inaudibly above the crowd of lunchtime passers-by. The guard zooms in on a bustle of shoppers and presses another button to record the picture in real time. Not much going on here, he says, but the footage will be saved for four months, filed along with the 1,000-plus videocassettes already piled on the shelves and snaking along the carpet in the small control centre. The innocent shopper, meanwhile, continues along the street, almost certainly unaware that he has just been filmed, recorded and logged. CCTV has a special resonance in Liverpool, the city where, in 1993, a camera in the Strand shopping centre in Bootle picked out the grainy image of two young boys leading a toddler away from his mother. Nine years after James Bulger's killers were caught with the assistance of the technology, Liverpool has embraced it wholeheartedly. There are 28 cameras in the city centre at present, dotted across the main shopping and clubbing areas. It is a decent system, and one that has served the city well since its installation in December 1994. But times have moved on, says the council's city centre manager, Paul Rice, and Liverpool needs to be a bit smarter about its surveillance. So, over the next few months, an alliance of the council, Mersey Travel and Merseyside police will install a total of 240 new digital cameras across the city centre and its main arterial routes, and build a state-of-the-art control room from which to monitor them. With 70 miles of fibreoptic cable already laid below ground, the plan is to roll the system out over time to incorporate other business, private and civic security systems. The startling expansion in surveillance capability in Liverpool mirrors an exponential boom across the country since primitive monitoring systems began to be introduced in the early 1990s. In 1994, according to a report in May by the crime prevention charity Nacro, 16 town centres operated CCTV schemes, with a total of around 400 cameras. By the end of this year, the charity estimates there will be 500 schemes in operation, recording, scanning and saving data from some 40,000 CCTV cameras, According to a House of Lords report, when private systems are taken into account, there are more than 1.5m lenses covering public spaces in the UK. Across the country, a CCTV arms race is developing as councillors, traders and police rush to introduce ever-more sophisticated monitoring regimes. New castle already has one of the most extensive systems in the country. In the city centre, there are 25 cameras directly linked to a police control room. But across the city, a mixture of public and private CCTV systems covering shopping centres, industrial areas and housing estates takes the total above 300. Manchester has gone even further. In June, it unveiled its \u00a310.3m digital surveillance system, based on 400 cameras - with plans to expand to 1,000. However persuasive the well-trod arguments of libertarians against blanket surveillance in Britain's city centres, the debate over the usefulness and desirability of CCTV has been comprehensively won by those in favour of increased monitoring. Between 1999 and 2003, Home Office spending on CCTV will amount to \u00a3170m. That is matched pound for pound by local authorities - none of which takes account of the massive extra investment by private companies, for which figures are elusive. A single high-definition camera, will full colour imaging and capable of reading a car number plate half a mile away, costs about \u00a325,000. Surveillance has become one of Britain's most startling boom industries - and fittingly, it has happened almost without our noticing. One might be entitled to assume, then, that the technology at least works. In fact the available data on CCTV's crime-busting record is far from unequivocal. Of 24 systems reviewed in the Nacro report, only 13 were found to have coincided with a significant reduction in crime. In seven cases, there was no detectable change, while in four instances crime had actually gone up since the introduction of surveillance monitoring. In several cases the deterrent effect of CCTV was observed to wear off after a period, when crime rates began to creep upward again. Most damningly perhaps, the Home Office's own surveys into the usefulness of the technology have suggested that something so simple as improving street lighting may be four times more effective in reducing crime So why is CCTV embraced so wholeheartedly by local authorities and police forces? Perhaps because, superficially at least, it is undeniably popular. In Liverpool, it enjoys near-universal support. \"It's great. I've no problem at all if it helps the police,\" says Chris Murphy, 66, minding her brother's T-shirt stall on Church St, just below a prominently-mounted camera. \"I worry about crime here, we get a lot of robbing on the stall. I don't mind being watched at all.\" Maureen Rockliffe, 56, popping into a coffee shop after buying some groceries, agrees. \"I'm not going to do anything wrong, so why should I be worried?\" \"My inbox and my intray is just full of questions about when the CCTV is coming, can we have it in our area,\" says Ian Shannon, a Merseyside police superintendent and the assistant executive director with the council in charge of community safety. \"In fact we're having to say to people, hold on, the money is [for this round of investment], when we have more money we'll come to you.\" \"It's about feelings of safety, public reassurance, public confidence,\" adds Chief Inspector Mike Creer, whose report on Liverpool's CCTV provision underscored the city's investment. \"The whole reason for putting this in, at the end of the day, is to make people feel safer, to make people want to invest in the place, to make people want to come into the city, not only in their leisure time but in tourism as well.\" That, according to Roy Coleman, a lecturer in criminology at Liverpool John Moores university who is researching the role of security systems in the regeneration of cities, may be another important factor in CCTV's appeal. He believes the key driver in the massive boom in surveillance is commercial. \"It gives the veneer of a sanitised, clean, healthy public space, and this, says the council, is what investors want. We are turning our cities into glorified consumption zones.\" Consider the crimes that CCTV in city centres can target, he says: shoplifting, property damage, graffiti, perhaps speeding and other generally antisocial behaviour. These are issues that concern people, but are not the top priority of ordinary people, nor are they crimes which feature in national performance indicators for police forces. Crucially, however, they are extremely important to businesses and potential investors. \"The problem with CCTV is this: what is the system really being used for?\" he asks. \"That is never really clear. What do we mean by a safer city, and who is defining safety? But Ian Shannon insists that many of the problems identified in the previous schemes related to old technology, which will not be relevant to Liverpool's shiny new network. Similarly, he says, focusing on CCTV alone ignores the other policing options which back it up. \"The fact is, we haven't assumed that a CCTV system on its own cracks anything. All along we have thought about it only in terms of integrating it with other services. The question is, what is the principal concern for people in Liverpool, and nationally. What do they want dealt with? They want crime and anti- social behaviour dealt with. This will help. Libertarians have nothing to fear from the system at all.\" Libertarians, in any case, have lost the battle. By March 2003, high above the shoppers, clubbers and passers-by of central Liverpool, the cameras will be silently rolling - and a million square metres of the city centre will be watched, recorded and logged around the clock. \u00b7 Esther Addley is a Guardian features writer."
