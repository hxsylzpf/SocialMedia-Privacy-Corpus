  "content": "A week ago, the US government body on which I sit, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), issued its latest report. President Obama appointed us, subject to Senate confirmation, but we are a completely independent body. As someone who has spent the past 19 years advocating for civil liberties, I accepted a part-time seat on the board, hoping to meld my outsider perspective with the insights afforded by access to classified details about the intelligence community's actions. In an earlier report, we had looked at the National Security Agency's collection of metadata on telephone calls to, from and within the US. That \"bulk\" program, a majority of the board including myself concluded, had not been not authorized by Congress, was not effective and should be ended. (The president agreed with that last point, but so far, the program continues, as Congress considers legislation to ban it and other bulk collection of data inside the US.) This time we were looking at a very different program, one that compels online service providers and other telecommunications companies in the US to disclose the contents of communications to and from individuals of interest to our government. Over many months, we heard from diverse voices, inside and out of the government \u2013 senior intelligence officials and analysts, academics and privacy advocates, telecommunications company executives and technical experts. In the end, the board found that the program, at its core, was authorized by Congress, under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa). And we found that the program is effective. Just days after our report, in a story castigating the surveillance as \"voyeuristic\", the Washington Post similarly concluded that the program has generated valuable information on terrorist plots, cyberattacks and weapons of mass destruction. Our report on the so-called \"702 program\" provides probably the most complete accounting of any national security surveillance program published by any country in the world. In my personal view, many details about the program could have been made public before Edward Snowden's leaks without hindering the intelligence agencies in doing their job. Indeed, they should have been. There are huge benefits, in terms of democratic legitimacy, to the public knowing what its government is doing. We found that the 702 program does not scan internet communications for keywords. It targets specific individuals using specific identifiers such as email addresses and phone numbers. We saw a demonstration of the government's targeting process. We reviewed sample targeting decisions. We considered how data is filtered before it enters the government's coffers. In sum, what we found is not a bulk collection program. That said, the program does collect a very large number of communications to and from a large number of individuals. Moreover, we found that the program, like any electronic surveillance activity, collects communications of some innocent individuals interacting with the government's targets \u2013 and some of those individuals are within the United States. While our report was lawyerly, that same Washington Post story over the weekend put into sharp focus just how sensitive \u2013 and even embarrassing \u2013 some kinds of information about innocent people obtained through electronic surveillance can be, even when the target is properly suspected of involvement with terrorism. The Post story did not surprise us. Our board's review had focused on precisely this problem: the disturbing but inevitable collection of information about innocent people. The first step in limiting overbroad collection is to ensure that targeting decisions are narrowly focused, in an accountable fashion. We urged the government to adopt new rules requiring a more detailed justification of each targeting decision. And we urged the Fisa court to look at a sampling of actual targeting decisions. We also addressed the retention of irrelevant data. On their face, NSA procedures already require deletion of any communications involving Americans that are found to have no intelligence value. But the PCLOB concluded that, in practice, irrelevant information is rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 purged before it is automatically flushed from the system after a period of years. Clearly this needs to be rectified. In my view, given the US's stated commitment to privacy as an international human right, data of citizens and non-citizens alike should be deleted as soon as it is recognized to be irrelevant. In our review, we spent a lot of time on the practice \u2013 at the NSA, the CIA and the FBI \u2013 of searching databases of 702 communications using the names of US citizens. Some call this practice a \"backdoor wiretap\", because it assembles some subset of the communications of persons who could not have been targeted in the first place. The PCLOB unanimously agreed that, whatever you call it, the practice should be limited. We were not unanimous on the solution. Two board members proposed requiring court approval of database queries involving US citizens. Two others thought that supervisory approval was sufficient. I concluded that a more direct approach is to limit use of the data \u2013 for citizens and non-citizens alike \u2013 to national security purposes. Faced with a tip about a possible terrorist attack, the government should be able to discover quickly whether it has in its Fisa databases any information useful in preventing the attack \u2013 even information about an American. However, the government should be strictly limited in using that information only to protect the national security. President Obama has already said that communications the US collects overseas in bulk will be used only for national security purposes. In my view, the same limits should be applied to data collected in the US under Section 702. Overbroad collection, retention and use, the board unanimously found, can push an otherwise constitutional program outside the bounds of reasonableness. Our recommendations would keep the NSA's 702 program more firmly on the right side of the line. Now it is up to Congress and the administration to ensure that there are adequate limits on the powerful capabilities available to our government in this digital age."
