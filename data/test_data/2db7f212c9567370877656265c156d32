  "content": "Press campaigners called for reform of newspaper regulation yesterday, saying the current arrangements fail to serve victims of media inaccuracy. Mediawise, which campaigns for those who feel unfairly treated by the press, called for a fourth royal commission to examine the industry. The Mediawise chairman, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, went further, arguing for statutory regulation. \"My personal view is that the days of self-regulation have gone,\" said Sir Louis, a former head of the press council, the predecessor of the Press Complaints Commission. Mediawise published the results of a survey which it used to claim the PCC over-states satisfaction among complainants. Of 52 respondents - Mediawise acknowledged the sample was small - 88% said they were \"very dissatisfied\" or \"not very satisfied\" with the PCC's handling of their complaints. The PCC, in its last satisfaction poll of 414 people, it claimed a 62% satisfaction rate. Julian Petley, professor of media and communications at Brunel University, who contributed to the Mediawise report, said the PCC was an \"incredibly opaque\" organisation, and called for it to be classed as a public body for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act, which would require it to open itself to public scrutiny. Mediawise also called for every newspaper to adopt a Guardian-style corrections system. Tim Toulmin, the director of the PCC, said yesterday the Mediawise survey had only found 32 people who had been dissatisfied with the commission in its 13-year history, whereas its own survey covered more than 400 people last year alone."
