  "content": "Tor, the secure networking service, may have to close down an eighth of its capacity as a result of the Heartbleed flaw. The service, which allows users to access the internet untraceably and securely, runs on a network of donated servers. Those servers bounce encrypted data between themselves, before returning back on to the open web from an \"exit node\" \u2013 the server that ultimately connects back to the internet. With enough internal relays, it is impossible for an observer to determine which traffic is coming from which computers. But some Tor nodes are running on servers which have OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 to 1.0.1f installed, the software that is vulnerable to the Heartbleed flaw. That means that an attacker could theoretically exploit the Heartbleed flaw on those nodes, and find internal information relating to Tor, compromising the security of the whole network. As a result, Roger Dingledine, one of the initial developers of Tor, has suggested on a mailing list for the open-source project that nodes running the vulnerable versions of OpenSSL should be kicked off the network. \"If the other directory authority operators follow suit, we'll lose about 12% of the exit capacity and 12% of the guard capacity,\" he writes on the software's mailing list. The project could allow the servers back on once they've upgraded their OpenSSL, but, Dingledine writes, \"if they were still vulnerable as of [Tuesday], I really don't want this identity key on the Tor network even after they've upgraded their OpenSSL.\" \u2022 What is Tor?
