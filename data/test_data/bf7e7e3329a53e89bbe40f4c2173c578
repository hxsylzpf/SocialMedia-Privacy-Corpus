  "content": "On Friday Ashton Kutcher (@aplusk) became the first person to attract one million followers on the micro-blogging website Twitter. His main rival, CNN's breaking news feed, broke the million barrier half an hour later. Kutcher had promised to donate 10,000 mosquito nets to charity if he won, but not all his online comments have been so high-minded; in March, he posted a picture of his wife Demi Moore's bottom on the site. But, what has he been sharing with his readers over the last seven days? My dad always said \"I'll believe when I hear it from the horses mouth.\" twitter is the horses mouth. no more \"well the news said ...\" 7:11 PM Apr 13th from TweetDeck had nightmares about ted turner last night.
