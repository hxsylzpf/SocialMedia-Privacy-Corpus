  "content": "The decision to turn one of America's most famous daily newspapers, the New Orleans Times-Picayune, into a three-times-a-week publication has stimulated a fascinating debate: Does a paper sacrifice its watchdog role and/or its political clout if it moves online? Plenty of critics believe it does. They include Warren Buffett, the billionaire who has been buying up newsprint papers. \"This three-day-a-week stuff really kills you,\" he says. \"Once people get used to online, I don't think they come back.\" David Simon, the former journalist who wrote the iconic TV series, The Wire, thinks a city \"absent an aggressive watchdog in the form of a daily paper\" faces problems. And David Carr, the New York Times's media commentator, appears to agree: \"The constancy of a daily paper... is a reminder to a city that someone is out there watching... \"You have to wonder whether it will still have the same impact when it doesn't land day after day on doorsteps all over the city.\" But are they right to be so down on the loss of print? Why shouldn't a digital newspaper have just as much impact as in print, asks GigaOM's Mathew Ingram, a former writer with Canada's Globe &amp; Mail. He writes: \"There is no reason (theoretically at least) why a digital-only organisation couldn't be just as much of a watchdog, and serve the community as well or better than a printed newspaper... It raises the question: what is the purpose of a newspaper, to make money or to serve a public purpose in society? And can a digital paper do both?\" Ingram believes there is \"magic\" in print... \"the same magic that makes you far more appealing to advertisers than the amount of time spent with your medium would seem to indicate.\" Once online, he argues, \"you become just another digital voice among thousands or even millions of other voices. Then you are no different from the Huffington Post, or Buzzfeed, or a Twitter-driven news source such as News.me or Prismatic. \"In fact, you could actually be seen as worse in some ways, because you are a single voice.\" I can't agree with that. If your online outlet is authoritative, credible and publishes public interest journalism - thereby attracting an audience - it will continue to exercise a watchdog role. The reluctance to give up print - and the belief that it is magical - is anchored in the notion of a print-based world. If the future is digital, as it surely will be, then digital journalism makes sense. Naturally, in this period of transition, doing both is far from easy. But Ingram also puts his finger on a much more serious problem. Too often, publishers move reluctantly online. And, in so doing, they accompany announcements of digital initiatives with staff cutbacks. That's the real drama. Apart from sending all the wrong messages to audiences in the short term, it is surely counter-productive in the long term. Publishers are seeing digital as a cost-cutting measure rather than as the entrance to a brave new world of screen-based journalism. What is required instead is investment, enthusiasm and commitment.
