  "content": "A Nigerian police sergeant who was covertly filmed trying to extract a bribe from a motorist in Lagos has been sacked after the video went viral. In the driver's shaky cameraphone footage, Sergeant Chris Omoleze is seen sitting in the passenger seat of a car demanding a payment of 25,000 naira (\u00a3100), well over the minimum monthly wage of 18,000 naira (\u00a372.30). Following 120,000 views on YouTube, tens of thousands of tweets, and airings on every national TV channel, authorities were goaded into taking rare action. \"Less than 24 hours after we got wind of that story, the police officer was identified, arrested [and] dismissed from the police force,\" police spokesman Frank Mba said on Channels Television, one of many stations carrying the footage. Bribe-taking from motorists is so endemic in Africa's largest metropolis that often it barely raises eyebrows. The motorist in the video, who was apparently returning from the airport \u2013 seen as a lucrative route for police \u2013 is heard trying to placate the officer. \"I don't have more than 2,000 naira [\u00a38],\" he protests. \"Add something \u2026 make you dey go your way [then be on your way],\" the officer says. Then, clearly suggesting it is a top-down racket, he adds: \"I am not working alone. Look, if you enter this compound [the police station], you will pay bigger money.\" A growing youth population across the continent has turned to social media to voice dissatisfaction at corruption and poor services []. The sacking was seen as a small victory in a nation where the long shadow of police corruption extends from everyday life into politics, particularly along the southern coast, where oil wells make the country the world's eight biggest exporter. Elections and public holidays \u2013 Christmas in particular \u2013 bring out officers looking to boost their earnings of roughly \u00a3200 a month. In April a minimum wage of about \u00a3400 was proposed, partly to help deter corruption. \"This is just the tip of the iceberg of rampant institutional corruption,\" said Emeka Umeagbalasi, of the International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law. \"They are using the dismissal of one lowly ranking officer as a smokescreen for institutional corruption.\" The group estimates that bribe-seeking police collected more than \u00a32.9m from hundreds of illegal checkpoints last year. Officers within the 370,000-strong police force told the Guardian they had little choice. \"At the end of each week you're expected to pay a certain amount to your superior, and he then passes it on, and so on, all the way to the top,\" said a Lagos-based policeman who gave only his first name, Ramjul. \"If you don't join them, you become a risk to the force and you can pay the consequences with your life.\" Such tactics are widespread across the region. In Ivory Coast, a report this year found that out of 160 roadblocks set up in the west of the country, just three were properly authorised."
