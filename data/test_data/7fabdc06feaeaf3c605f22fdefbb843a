  "content": "The first footage of Tom Hiddleston as country legend Hank Williams in the biopic I Saw the Light has been released on Twitter by the British actor. The one-minute clip features the Avengers star as Williams recording his 1947 single Move It on Over, the Alabama-born singer's first ever major country hit, at the Castle Studio in Nashville. Later on, he is seen at home with wife and manager Audrey Sheppard Williams, played in the film by Elizabeth Olsen. I Saw the Light, from director Marc Abraham, will see a world premiere at the Toronto film festival today. The biopic is based on Colin Escott, George Merritt and William MacEwen's 1994 book, Hank Williams: The Biography, and reportedly also features the singer's songs Your Cheatin' Heart, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry, and Hey Good Lookin'. Westminster-born Hiddleston, who did all the singing himself, performed Move It on Over and another Williams hit, Jambalaya (On the Bayou), at the Wheatland music festival in September last year. However, he received criticism from the musician's grandson Hank Williams III, who claimed only an American southerner could nail the country icon's \"moan\" and \"soul\" and suggested Matthew McConaughey instead. Nevertheless, Hiddleston could be a contender in this year's awards season if I Saw the Light is well-reviewed at Toronto. Williams was 29 when he died of heart failure linked to alcoholism and drug abuse in 1953. During his 16-year career, he recorded eight No 1 country singles and countless more classics of the genre. Williams received a posthumous Pulitzer prize in 2010 in recognition of his \"pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force\"."
