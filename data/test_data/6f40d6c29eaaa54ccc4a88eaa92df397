  "content": "In what looks like a throwback to 1970s-80s Britain a fence has been erected around the offices of a Canadian newspaper ahead of expected industrial action. It is thought that the management of the Globe &amp; Mail in Toronto, in anticipation of a strike vote by staff, including journalists, is preparing for a lockout. Two weeks ago, 92.3% of the members of Unifor, the union that represents editorial, advertising sales and circulation employees, rejected a contract offer. Talks between the two sides are said to be planned for next week. Aside from pay, the rejected contract reportedly included a requirement that editorial staff should produce \"branded content\" (aka advertorial). Some Globe reporters have said they would be prepared to produce an alternative publication if they are locked out. Others believe it more likely they would write articles for their own website. The fence now has its own Twitter handle, @globefence, with - please excuse the pun - plenty of barbed comments. Sources: HuffPo/CBC/Toronto Star Hat tip: Poynter"
