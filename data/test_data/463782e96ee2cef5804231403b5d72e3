  "content": "Sky Ferreira has spoken out against online misogyny, referencing her \"exhaustion\" at receiving \"abusive\" messages and urging her followers to instead \"use the internet as a way to connect with others\". Posting the message to Facebook, the pop singer explained her frustrations regarding the constant messages of criticism she receives through social media. \"I'm not a mess, I'm not a drug addict, I'm not a slut or a bitch,\" she wrote. \"I'm exhausted of (more than some) people telling me how I should look or be if I want to be a 'pop star' &amp; how they think it's okay to say vile &amp; (sexually) abusive shit to me on a daily basis over the internet. I'm not only writing about myself ... because almost every person has to deal with this. It's a shame because I now feel like I can't connect or directly speak with true fans.\" Ferreira went on to explain that she was accused of being homophobic after a friend confronted one of her alleged trolls at a show. \"I recently blocked someone because they were constantly harassing me &amp; making fun of sexual abuse that happened in my past ... Which I've publicly spoken about to hopefully help others. They came to one of my shows &amp; my friend confronted the person. We were accused of being homophobic after. Which is absolutely insane because my friends, my family &amp; a majority of my fans are homosexual. Sexuality, gender, race &amp; age are irrelevant to me. As it should be for everyone by now. Treating people like shit because you feel like shit doesn't help anyone. If you see hateful/disgusting/abusive comments, please start reporting it or deleting it. I think that's the only way we can start to lower that sort of thing from happening.\" Last September, Ferreira was arrested in upstate New York with her boyfriend, Zachary Cole Smith of the band Diiv. She explained in an interview with the Guardian in January that she had subsequently felt betrayed by her friends. \"They were posting my mugshot on Facebook and making fun of me as if I wasn't going to see,\" she told Tim Jonze. \"Then once my album got an 8.3, 8.2 or whatever [8.1, in fact] on Pitchfork they're suddenly all calling me: 'Can you sing on this for me?' I was like: 'Fuck you, pretending you think drugs are all bad when I know you get way more fucked up on drugs than I do.'\" Sky Ferreira's debut album, Night Time, My Time, will be released in the UK on 17 March."
