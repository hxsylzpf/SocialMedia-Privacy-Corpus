  "content": "If you think we have it bad, spare a thought for the French and the Americans. Imagine if the two people vying for the helm of a political party were a couple. Imagine they couldn't stand the sight of each other. Imagine if the man had run off with a political journalist. The level of animus was the Miliband brothers on speed. Imagine everyone knew about it, but none of the mainstream media reported it. That was France; that was S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and her partner Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2007. That was French law, codified. Imagine if a man putting himself forward as the leader of the country was having an affair while his wife was suffering from cancer. The man presented himself as a respectable middle-of-the-road figure. His story eventually came out, courtesy of an entertainment magazine. News media chose not to follow it up until made to look ludicrous. That was Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards in 2004-9; that was what they call in the US \"responsibility\" or \"restraint\", or what we might call self-censorship or cronyism. The British media may be attacked for the weakness of its investigative reporting and the salaciousness and dodgy practices of the tabloids, but I would rather err on the side of a profession that is hard to control than one that is pliant. Sex allegations There must, for sure, be a happy medium in which the competing and essential needs of free expression and privacy are catered for, in which truth can be disentangled from fiction, in which the public interest can be convincingly determined. We haven't found one yet \u2013 not the judges, not the journalists, not the general public \u2013 anywhere in the world. That shouldn't stop us trying. Recent events have brought these issues to the top of the political agenda \u2013 the defeat of Max Mosley's bid in Strasbourg to force newspapers to notify the subjects of news stories in advance, the wrangle over superinjunctions and injunctions, the dumping of unverified sex allegations on Twitter and the rebuke to the Daily Telegraph over journalists impersonating constituents in order to entrap Liberal Democrat MPs. Throw in the News of the World phone-hacking scandal and cover-up, plus issues around confidentiality and the provenance of information \u2013 the WikiLeaks revelations, and the Telegraph's use of stolen material to reveal the parliamentary expenses scandal \u2013 and we have an ethical minefield and a licence for lawyers to argue and make money. Politicians are entering the fray, albeit with caution. There is little to be gained, and much to be lost, by seeking to intervene. Leave it to the judges is the constitutionalist's cry. Yet the experience of the past two decades shows that free expression is not safe in our judges' hands. The campaign Index on Censorship fought, together with partners, to change the libel law was resisted by many lawyers. They saw no problem with oligarchs and sheikhs using London as their their libel forum of choice to cow authors, bloggers and scientists. The default position of many in the legal establishment is to see journalists as \"feral beasts\" (copyright T Blair). The only solution is to silence them, securing gagging orders on demand: the superinjunction, the anonymised injunction and various other devices. Back in 1994, Lord Hoffman argued that free speech was \"a trump card which always wins\", adding: \"publication may cause needless pain, distress and damage to individuals or harm to other aspects of the public interest. But a freedom which is restricted to what judges think to be responsible or in the public interest is no freedom.\" We have come a long way since. The most important shift came in 1998 when the Labour government incorporated the European Convention into UK law under the Human Rights Act. This was hailed by pro-European modernisers, myself included, as a great act in pursuit of civil liberties. Article 8 of the act says that \"everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence\". Article 10 asserts the right to free expression including the \"freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers\". They exist as independent and equal rights. As the lawyer Hugh Tomlinson points out: \"There can be no doubt that parliament and indeed the press was fully aware that the Human Rights Act was likely to accelerate the development of a law of privacy.\" Yes, but what kind of law and what kind of privacy? In the early years the judgments flip-flopped. One minute the judges concluded that the rights of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones had been violated because photographs of their wedding were published in one magazine after they had signed an exclusive deal with another. The next moment they concluded that Jamie Theakston was not entitled to a gagging order on a story because a brothel was a public place. Footballer Garry Flitcroft lost his case over a kiss and tell involving two women when the judge declared that \"if you have courted public attention then you have less ground to object to the intrusion that follows\". These decisions could be variously described as bizarre and arbitrary. All this was before Princess Caroline of Monaco. When the European Court of Human Rights judged that she had her privacy invaded when pictures were published of her shopping, horse riding and playing tennis, everything changed. There is, the court argued, \"a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of private life\". In other words, everything is private unless a case can be made that it is public. This opened the floodgates for litigious celebrities. They haven't stopped. Only occasionally do they fail, such as when John Terry failed to keep his superinjunction over his alleged extra-marital dalliance. His lawyers' argument, that publication would damage his commercial interests, was too much even for the indulgent judges. The argument made by media lawyers is that the tabloids are more out of control than they were before, requiring tougher application of the law. The evidence on this is mixed. In a forthcoming special issue on privacy of Index on Censorship magazine, the journalism professor Brian Cathcart delves in detail into the News of the World phone-hacking scandal and the Madeleine McCann case. He also describes how the escorts who serviced Mosley were bullied into telling their \"stories\". For a brief moment I felt sympathy for them and for the Formula One boss. Cathcart makes a number of broader points, calling on the mainstream media to do more to distance themselves from the \"privacy invaders\". He concludes: \"If journalists, for reasons of nostalgia, inertia, confusion or misplaced loyalty, choose to keep swimming with the privacy intruders, they may well drown with them.\" On these, and many other, cases of egregious, immoral and often illegal behaviour, Cathcart is surely right. But on the more day-to-day invasions, the long lens and the prying eye, are we any worse than before? Writing in MediaGuardian two weeks ago, Roy Greenslade claimed that the balance had shifted. \"There is now a disproportionate amount of meretricious material aimed at appealing to public prurience, most of which revolves around the philandering of celebrities,\" he argues. Yet remember the 'Allo 'Allo! actor Gorden Kaye and the despicable pictures of him lying in a hospital bed with life-threatening injuries after a car crash in 1990. Greenslade portrays celebrities as victims. There are many examples to support his assertion, yet for the most part, it is celebrities who dictate what images can be published and what stories should be told. The relationship with the papers is symbiotic. Many stars rely on publicity to boost their profile and earning power. Just as in political journalism, when most \"exclusives\" are plants by politicians, so photos of stars \"caught off guard leaving a nightclub\" are often choreographed. Improving press standards is vital. That's why I endorsed Ed Miliband's call for an independent review. But we will only begin to deal with the vexed issue of privacy if we can agree on who is entitled to it, and when. Hypocrisy is a clear disqualifier, as is surely anything that might impact on the public job. This might include a politician, religious figure or judge. What about other leadership roles? Would Terry automatically be included in this list, because he was captain, rather than an ordinary player? The objective and the subjective sit uneasily with each other. And what of public interest? The definition by the Press Complaints Commission incorporates exposing crime or impropriety, protecting public health and safety, and \"preventing the public from being misled\". Not enormously helpful. Is it simply what the public is interested in? If that is the case, then we are really in for trouble. The Twitter gossip exposures of a week ago led to its heaviest single day of traffic. The public says it is not interested, but, sad to say, it is. In any newsroom conversation turns to knowing remarks about which superinjunction applies to whom. We know, but you don't. It is gratifying to feel you are on the inside track. It is also thoroughly invidious. Politicians should avoid offering solutions, but they and others should ask some searching questions. It is time for an inquiry into privacy and its role in public life. How can free expression and the yearning for a private life be protected in this murky arena of a gossip free-for-all? Last week Index was party to the legal challenge that saw off Mosley's misguided bid to secure prior notification. We are moving forward on changing our hideous libel laws. It would be a tragedy if journalists, through our own poor standards, open the door further for the rich and powerful to conceal themselves from legitimate scrutiny.
