  "content": "Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of search Google, has predicted that web users will one day be able to change their identity in order to escape the traces of their misspent youth available on social networking sites such as Facebook. Schmidt told the Wall Street Journal that he expects that young people will one day be able to change their name on reaching adulthood to distance themselves from online records of youthful indiscretions. \"I don't believe society understands what happens when everything is available, knowable and recorded by everyone all the time,\" he said. \"I mean we really have to think about these things as a society. I'm not even talking about the really terrible stuff, terrorism and access to evil things.\" Schmidt also praised Facebook, the world's biggest social networking service, describing it as a \"company of consequence\". He also reiterated Google's \"mobile first\" strategy, predicting that the development of more powerful handheld devices would open up new possibilities for communication and distributing news and information. \"The thing that makes newspapers so fundamentally fascinating \u2013 that serendipity\u2013can be calculated now. We can actually produce it electronically,\" Schmidt said. \"As you go from the search box [to the next phase of Google], you really want to go from syntax to semantics, from what you typed to what you meant. And that's basically the role of [artificial intelligence]. I think we will be the world leader in that for a long time,\" he added. The development of the mobile web will also open up new opportunities for targeted advertising, he said. \"The power of individual targeting \u2013 the technology will be so good it will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them,\" according to Schmidt. \"we know roughly who you are, roughly what you care about, roughly who your friends are.\""
