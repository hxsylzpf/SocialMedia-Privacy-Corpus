  "content": "The editor of the Times has admitted in a letter to the Leveson inquiry that a reporter on the paper had told his bosses he had sought to hack into an email account before it went to the high court to defend the story on which he was working. In June 2009, the paper named anonymous police blogger NightJack after the author, detective Richard Horton, lost a high court bid to get an injunction preventing the Times \"outing\" him. In a letter to the Leveson inquiry published on Wednesday, the Times editor, James Harding, said in June 2009 a reporter told his managers that he had \"sought unauthorised access to an email account\" during the course of his investigation. They had told him that \"if he wanted to pursue the story, he had to use legitimate means to do so\", the letter stated. In evidence to Mr Justice Eady in 2009 in relation to Horton's injunction application, the Times reporter, Patrick Foster, said he had deduced the blogger's identity mainly using information available on the internet. Harding's letter stated that the Times said it addressed the issue of the reporter using \"a highly intrusive method to seek information without prior approval\" after the high court case, but it does not say precisely when. The letter, as read to the Leveson inquiry, said: \"In June 2009, we published a story in what we strongly believed was a public interest. \"When the reporter informed his managers that in the course of his investigation he had, on his own initiative, sought unauthorised access to an email account, he was told that if he wanted to pursue the story, he had to use legitimate means to do so. \"He did, identifying the person at the heart of the story, using his own sources and information publicly available on the internet. \"On that basis, we made the case in the high court that the newspaper should be allowed to publish in the public interest. \"After the judge ruled that will we could publish in the public interest, we did. We also addressed the concern that had emerged about the reporter's conduct, namely that he had used a highly intrusive method to seek information without prior approval. He was formally disciplined.\" Tom Watson, the Labour MP, speaking at the Oxford Media Convention on Wednesday, said that Harding should be asked if he had been aware at the time that the journalist had hacked an email account and if so, why Eady was not told during the injunction application hearing. Harding's letter was read out to the Leveson inquiry as another blogger, David Allen Green, otherwise known as Jack of Kent, was giving testimony. He has written recently about Foster and the NightJack outing and was asked by Lord Justice Leveson whether he had any comments on the \"veracity of this account\". Allen Green said he had no separate information on the incident, but added that he found it \"odd that that information wasn't given at the time of witness statements given the question that was posed to the Times editor\". He added: \"That information in that letter should have been given to the court before Mr Justice Eady [in 2009].\" Counsel to the inquiry David Barr said it remained an \"unanswered question\" over whether \"anything that was gained from the email hacking was used to assist the identification\" of NightJack. Leveson said this was an issue he would have to think about. Addressing Allen Green, who is legal affairs correspondent for the New Statesman, the judge said: \"But your blog, which discusses this at some length and comes back to it speaks of a concern \u2013 and was this your concern or somebody else's \u2013 that the research had been done backwards. I think you used the analogy of a maze, working from the inside out rather than the outside in.\" In written evidence submitted to the inquiry last week, Harding said that one of his reporters had hacked into a \"third party's\" email account in 2009. He added that the reporter in question believed he was acting in the public interest but was given a formal written warning for professional misconduct and was later dismissed following an unrelated incident. Harding did not name the reporter or specify which story he had been working on, but the individual was named by the Guardian later the same day as Foster. He has written freelance articles for the Guardian and Daily Telegraph since leaving the Times last year. In his letter read out to the inquiry on Wednesday, Harding said: \"The incident has also informed our thinking in putting in place an effective audit trail to ensure that in the future we have an adequate system to keep account of how we make sensitive decisions in the news-gathering process. This was an isolated incident and I have no knowledge of any else like it. If the inquiry has any further questions about it I would, of course, be happy to answer them.\" The Times did not state in its original story that the blogger's identity had been obtained by penetrating Horton's Hotmail account. It said Foster had \"deduced\" Nightjack's identity. Earlier witness statements, by News International's chief executive Tom Mockridge and the Times's lawyer Simon Toms, did not disclose that unauthorised email access had resulted in a published article. They referred only to \"attempted\" access allegedly denied by the reporter. Mockridge later corrected his statement. The \"outing\" of Nightjack was controversial at the time, with critics of the Times saying the paper was wrong to unmask him because he was giving valuable insight into the work of the police. Foster maintained at the time that his action was justified in the public interest because Horton had given details of sex attacks in his blog which could be traced to individual incidents, and had therefore revealed details which should have been kept confidential. In his amended statement, Mockridge said Foster had subsequently been \"dismissed following an unrelated incident\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
