  "content": "The latest report by the Project for Excellence in Journalism identified two completely news agendas: those created by mainstream news sites, and those created by audiences following aggregators and recommendation tools like Digg, Reddit and Del.icio.us. Pew compared the agendas of mainstream and aggregator sites for one week, and found that users of Digg, et al, were more likely to use controversial sources, pick a more diverse news agenda and be more transitory, the report found. Most stories highlighted in the aggregators were not picked up on mainstream sites at all, and seventy percent of stories came from alternative sources like YouTube or personal blogs. Reddit's users were politically focused, the report found, Digg on technology and Del.icio.us was more diverse. While the Iraq War accounted for 10% of the mainstream news coverage, it only made around 1% of the stories on the aggregators. The popularity of these kind of tools is spreading, it noted, with mainstream sites offering personalisation tools and social networking sites adding news areas, like MySpace. Quoting Dan Gillmor, the report concludes by asking where the expensive, investigative journalism will come from if audiences continue to neglect mainstream news? \"Who would have exposed the Watergate crimes in the absence of powerful publishers, especially The Washington Post's Katherine Graham, who had the financial and moral fortitude to stand up to Richard Nixon and his henchmen. At a more prosaic level, who will serve, for better or worse, as a principal voice of a community or region? Flawed as we may be in the business of journalism, anarchy in news is not my idea of a solution.\" (Pew)"
