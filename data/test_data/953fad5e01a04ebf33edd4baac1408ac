  "content": "Your relationship with the public has never been an easy one, Yoko Ono (@yokoono). The art's a bit weird, the music's not much cop and then there was that whole \"splitting up the Beatles\" thing. Joining Twitter was the perfect opportunity to reveal the real you. Unfortunately things have not worked out like that. Most of the time I don't have a clue what you are on about (\"Imagine the largest rainbow going from north to south. Visit the two ends of the rainbow.\") Enough is enough! Time to show the world that, despite appearances, you're still Yoko from the block. Here's how. Fun with direct messages I was touched when I first started following you and found this friendly message nestling in my direct message inbox: \"Thanks for following! love, yoko IMAGINE PEACE: Think PEACE, Act PEACE, Spread PEACE.\" However, I think you could be having more fun with this function. Direct messaging is where all the juicy stuff happens. Think Vernon Kay's (@officialvernonkay) page 3 girl sexytimes. Spice things up, dude. Don't drink and tweet I am here to say \"STOP! Step away from Twitter, drink a pint of water and get to bed.\" The alternative is that you are going to wake up to find you have tweeted something like: \"I love you, I love you, I love you, Earth. I love you, I love you, I love you, now.\" Hang on \u2013 what do you mean you were sober when you tweeted that? Ah . . . OK . . . well, this is embarrassing. Bring back Hev I'm worried about Heather Mills (@heatherofficial), Yoko. The last we heard from her was back in February when she tweeted \"Sorry I have been offline, Ive been working with the police to trace all of the crazy nutters who spend their energy tweeting abuse.\" This is a job that could take decades. Please tell her to quit this foolishness and get back on Twitter. I need to know how her plans to get on the paralympic ski team and sort out all the problems in Haiti are going. Lots of love, @scouserachel"
