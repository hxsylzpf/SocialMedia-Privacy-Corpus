  "content": "Perhaps fittingly for a pop-artist whose debut album was called The Fame, Lady Gaga has increased her dominance of social media by overhauling Britney Spears to become the most followed person on Twitter. After last month becoming the first living person to have 10 million fans on Facebook, Gaga surged past Spears to take her followers beyond 5,667,000. Gaga did not immediately acknowledge the achievement, which has been anticipated by avid Twitter followers who have watched the singer add over 600,000 new followers in the past month. It meant Spears's reign as most popular tweeter came to an abrupt end a mere three months after she overtook Ashton Kutcher \u2013 who remains the third most followed Twitter user \u2013 in May. Those choosing to keep abreast of Gaga's affairs on Twitter are treated to insights into her touring habits and occasional pictures. \"Love is the new denim, pulling all nighters like a Hooker on a Church Corner,\" she posted last month, with an accompanying photo which indeed showed her sporting denim shorts. Not all tweets have been work ethic and fashion-related, however, with the singer also using the service to reveal that there was a group protesting outside her Monster Ball tour last month. \"At the risk of drawing attention to a hateful organization, I would like to make my little monster fan aware of a protest being held outside,\" she tweeted in July, adding: \"Their message is of hatred and divisiveness, but inside at the Monsterball we preach love and unity.\" Gaga is also the most popular living person on Facebook, according to Famecount, which tracks social media users' performances across the web. She lingers behind only Michael Jackson in terms of popularity, comfortably beating the actor Vin Diesel and Barack Obama into 6th and 9th places respectively. Gaga also tops Famecount's aggregator of performance across Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, making her the most popular person \u2013 living or dead \u2013 across the main social media sites. There are some signs, however, that Gaga should make the most of her status while it lasts, according to Daniel Dearlove, founder of Famecount. \"While she may be the most popular star, she is not the fastest growing,\" he said. \"Canadian teen sensation, Justin Bieber, is currently racking up almost 800,000 new followers a month, and on present trends he may challenge for the Twitter throne within 6 months.\""
