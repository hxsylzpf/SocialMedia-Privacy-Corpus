  "content": "Internet power couple Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer spent their Tuesday afternoon hosting an open session on Reddit's Ask Me Anything section, answering questions from fans. The two have just released An Evening With Neil Gaiman &amp; Amanda Palmer triple CD, and will be performing together at Town Hall in New York City on Friday and Saturday night.  Read the full transcript here. On tea: What kind of tea do you both like?  Gaiman: \"We both like green tea, and we both like fruity teas. Only one of us likes proper British Tea with milk. I am not going to tell you which one.\" Palmer: \"YOU'RE SO TRICKY\"  On the American Gods adaptation Gaiman: \"There is an American Gods TV series in the works. It's no longer with HBO. The moment that things are ready to be announced I am sure they will be, either legitimately or via a leak in a big Hollywood Agency mailroom.\" On dealing with the haters Palmer: \"[First] off: neither neil nor [I] were strangers to haters when we met each other. from the first outing of the dresden dolls in 2000 (my first band, which was just me and one other guy) in boston, i was confronted with the amazing phenomenon that is People Who Love To Spend Their Time Hating &amp; Criticizing Artists. \"[And] honestly \u2026 the more i do it and learn about this part of the universe, the more i approach the haters and yellers with compassion. the more i look, the more hurt i see, and the less i feel like yelling back. from where i'm standing, the ones screaming the loudest probably need the biggest hugs.\" Gaiman: \"I had run into nasty people on the web before I married Amanda, but marrying her opened the door on a whole new level of unpleasantness. It was like lifting up a rock and seeing what squirms underneath. And then slowly I started to realise that an awful lot of the nastiest haters appeared to be one person cutting and pasting away, and industriously spending every evening googling my name and Amanda's and posting strangely unpleasant dispatches from an alternate universe. And then I felt very sorry for that person, because it doesn't seem like much of a life.\" On love at first sight (or the lack thereof) Gaiman: \"We met in the green room of the NYC Comic Con, and we didn't fancy each other at all. There are photographs of us and Stan Lee together there. Amanda did not know who he was. I found this refreshing.\" Palmer: \"[It's] true. i was also in a relationship at the time with no interest in falling in love with neil gaiman \u2026 and i barely knew his work. we've looked back at the photos from that day and had a good laugh. neil looks like hell and has a black eye (his dog gave it to him \u2026 long story) and i looked (according to neil) pudgy and mannish and absolutely 'not his type'. nor was he mine. \"the reason we're convinced this relationship has legs is that we fell in love with each other's personalities and brains and then, later, with each others bodies and faces \u2026 from a deeper place.\" On Gaiman's fashion sense: how many of those black t-shirts does he own? Palmer: \"Honestly? Like 100.  \"No lie: he keeps them in plastic tubs and actually does differentiate between which ones are spanky new and which have been washed A LOT and are now off-black. bless him.\""
