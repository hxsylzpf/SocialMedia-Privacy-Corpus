  "content": "We're true believers, but we're also troublemakers, and if you look at the work we do, a lot of it has a sense of humor. So says Michael Goldfarb, founder of the Washington Free Beacon, basking in the predictable reaction to an article by Free Beacon staff that accused the New Republic's owner of purging Jewish writers. That's the whole MO: be outrageous, scurrilous and completely unfair. And then, when you get a rise, just shrug and say: \"What's your problem: can't take a joke?\" But for something to be humor, it has to be funny. And as comedy goes, the Free Beacon's jokes have all the subtlety of Jackass. The only difference is that instead of creating dubious hilarity at the spectacle of their self-inflicted pain, they're using equally ridiculous stunts to laugh at yours. Clinically speaking, we call people with that attitude \"sociopaths\", but in the political realm, Goldfarb's punchlines \u2013 emphasis on punch! \u2013 are just the latest iteration of a burgeoning style of discourse whose practitioners have become influential enough to deserve their own designation. They belong to an emerging group of conservatives with technological and PR savvy who specialize in passing off mean-spirited pranks as a form of partisan journalism, and whose passionate plaints against a perceived liberal agenda are rooted in name-calling rather than philosophy. Call them Limbaugh Mini-Mes, or Nixon's New Media 'Plumbers', or maybe Breitbart's Brat Pack (Breitbrats, Bratbarts?). Here's a sample of the Free Beacon's headlines: \"The Booty Bundler\", about a minor Obama fundraiser with a striptease video on her resume. \"Coal Runnings\", a largely hypothetical piece about how much new national standards for power plants could cost Missouri voters. And the typically subtle \"Obama Lie Machine\", about the Obama campaign's tax calculator in which the paper's staff appears to completely misunderstand the concept of marginal tax rates. Goldfarb is connected to the legacy of professional provocateur Andrew Breitbart mainly via shared tactics, but also through shared information: the Free Beacon and Breitbart.com trade links like two besties on Livejournal. Other members of the crew operate under his official banner. Ben Shapiro is a Brietbart.com editor-at-large, most recently in the news for his role in perpetuating the allegation that Chuck Hagel once accepted money from the \"Friends of Hamas\". Shapiro was unsurprisingly resistant to admitting fault, if uncharacteristically sober in doing so. Perhaps he was chastened by the actual satire embedded in the \"Friends of Hamas backstory\" (the group was invented in a reporter's whimsical inquiry of a Senate aide). Shapiro's typical rhetorical strategy is a stream of amused, yet angry non-sequiturs: before the Hagel flap, in January, he became a folk hero of the right for waving the US constitution at Piers Morgan and warning of America, as a democracy, \"going usurpatious\". James O'Keefe also works for the Breitbart enterprise. Best known as the man who felled Acorn (via a hidden camera and some of the most stagey \"pimp-ho\" role-play outside suburban bedrooms), O'Keefe's body of work is a genius mixture of soft targets and careful editing. Not one of his video expos\u00e9s has vaulted into mainstream media consciousness without highly selective cuts. That he has succeeded in wresting resignations (at NPR, over supposed pandering to a faux Muslim group) and otherwise ending careers (one overly sympathetic Planned Parenthood employee) doesn't mean that O'Keefe is a good journalist. It just that he has good aim for slow-moving prey. Ambush specialist Jason Mattera is another beneficiary of Breitbartian synergism (writing for BigGovernment.com, the sites dutifully report on his latest exploits). But as with Goldfarb, Mattera's sensibility is infused by Breitbart's rough-and-tumble way with people and his sense of drama. He is less brazenly flippant with facts than his brethren, mostly because he focuses on setting up liberal politicians for admittedly uncomfortable, but also unanswerable and aggressively beside-the-point questions \u2013 such as asking Mayor Mike Bloomberg last month if he would disarm his security detail as part of a ban on guns. Propagandists on either side of the political spectrum shade their facts; that's what makes them propagandists. What sets the Bratbarts apart from partisan pugilists like Sean Hannity and Michael Moore is the panache with which they do it, and their reflexive use of a specifically churlish sense of humor as both an excuse and motivation. Jonah Goldberg, the National Review columnist, is a philosophical forebear here, with his constant Simpsons references and defensive sarcasm. However, these guys don't flaunt a knowledge of pop culture, as Goldberg does, as a way of distinguishing themselves from the squares of mainstream conservatism. Instead, it is simply a part of their language, an assumed body of knowledge. They don't make the argument that South Park, or the Simpsons, or the Star Wars movies are \"conservative\" in some way \u2013 they are that argument. When Ben Shapiro writes a column entitled \"Jedi Mind Trick Nation\", the pop culture reference is just a tool appropriated for use against the ideological enemy \u2013 to be precise, a Bratbart brickbat. Bullies have been laughing at others' vulnerabilities since there was sand to kick in people's faces. But the perversity of this post-Ann Coulter generation is that they believe the world is run by nerdy liberal elitists , that their antics are a righteous rebellion instead of an attempt to assert the law of jungle. Perhaps it is true that liberal nerds have made great strides in governing \u2013 certainly, our president is one \u2013 but the reactionary insurgents' anti-establishment pose, which goes along with shoving a camera in someone's face, breaks down when you consider the actual policies advocated by the guy behind the viewfinder. Policies that, say, continue to suppress voting rights of minorities won't make them punk rock heroes. The only thing remotely disruptive about the material generated by the Bratbarts is its incivility. In itself, that is simply a style, not an argument or a critique. Incivility can be OK: I am a big believer in disrespecting those in power, and there's nothing inherently wrong with being flippant \u2013 there are times when it is the only proper response to authority. As journalist and defender of the lowbrow Gilbert Seldes put it: \"Comedy is last refuge of the nonconformist mind.\" But confusing satire and hazing? Mixing up muckraking with misinformation? Revelation with subterfuge? Laughter with cruelty? Those are the tactics of would-be authoritarians, not outlaw liberators."
