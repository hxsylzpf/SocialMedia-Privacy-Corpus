  "content": "The House of Lords has refused Niema Ash's request to appeal a decision that halted the publication of a \"kiss and tell\" book on Canadian singer-songwriter Loreena McKennitt, MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal. The judgment in the landmark privacy case, which has implications on the \"kiss and tell\" stories commonplace in gossip and tabloid magazines, upheld McKennitt's right to \"the human dignity of privacy\". The ruling upholds a major shift in media law protecting the privacy of famous people, with the case described as one of the most significant ever relating to the British press. The House of Lords said that the petition for appeal \"did not raise an arguable point of law of general public importance\". Ms Ash had been trying to get permission to appeal a landmark decision passed in December by the court of appeal that dismissed her efforts to get an injunction against her unauthorised book about the Canadian singer overturned. Ms Ash, a UK resident and former friend and business associate of Ms McKennitt, self-published a book two years ago called Travels with Loreena McKennitt: My Life As A Friend. \"I am very grateful to the courts, including the House of Lords, the court of appeal and Mr Justice Eady who have recognised that every person has an equal right to a private life,\" Ms McKennitt said in a statement. \"If an aspect of career places one directly in the public eye or if extraordinary events make an ordinary person newsworthy for a time, we all still should have the basic human dignity of privacy for our home and family life.\" Rosemary Jay, partner and head of information at law firm Pinsent Masons, said that the decision had obvious ramifications for the likes of Kate Middleton. \"What the court is saying is that in no case is it completely black and white, just because someone puts some parts of their life in public doesn't undermine their right to privacy,\" she said. \"Even if you are Paris Hilton and have led a very public media life there may be some things that are still deemed to be private. This decision makes it quite clear that someone like Kate Midddleton is entitled to a private space.\" Ms Ash and her solicitors had argued that she wanted to tell her story and that the article 10 right to freedom of expression allowed her to override Ms McKennitt's right to privacy. \"The judgement has helped define the breadth of privacy rights, the relevance of accuracy in the material disclosed and the extent to which the public interest is truly served by mere curiosity,\" said Mark Thomson, Ms McKennitt's solicitor from law firm Carter-Ruck. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
