  "content": "Jan Moir. Oh come on. I'm not sure what happiness or insight you brought into world by being so beastly to Katherine Jenkins, but do I hope you've read her dignified response. So she ran the marathon looking flawless. So what? When I crossed the finish line (much later than Jenkins) I was close to being hospitalised \u2013 and looked like a broken old man. Two days later, I am still in the market for a stairlift. Had anyone been remotely interested in my appearance they could have taken a photograph of me that my own mother would disown. Celebrities are often criticised for courting the media, wanting positive press in the good times and then crying foul when they have done something amiss. But the press\u2013 especially at the lower end of the market \u2013 often have a similar double-think. They also want their celebrities to look glamorous \u2013 all the better to sell papers \u2013 and then they have a go at them for exactly the same thing. The fact that an attack on Katherine Jenkins for making too much effort to look good was accompanied by various photos of her looking good \u2013 all served up for public appreciation \u2013 is sheer hypocrisy. And you can be sure that had she looked remotely exhausted at the end of the race, some parts of the press would have been delighted to revel in the schadenfreude of the beautiful-person-looks-less-than-beautiful photograph. Give the woman a break. Yes, the celebrity tent was a curious affair. A random collection of people off the telly. Ed Balls, Michel Roux, some pop band (I presumed) and people like me who are so Z-list they had to answer the humiliating question \"Sorry, who are you?\" as the official on the gate struggled to find their name. I speak from personal experience. And while some people in that apparently select enclosure were checking their make up, most were simply there to use the loo. Part of the reason for our ambivalence with celebrity is that we resent the fact they hold our attention. Thus we take pleasure in punishing them for our own foolish obsessions. Inflating and then deflating them is all part of the same curious weakness. Most people don't deserve either. Katherine Jenkins certainly doesn't."
