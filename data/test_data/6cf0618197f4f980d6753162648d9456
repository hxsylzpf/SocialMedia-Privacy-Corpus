  "content": "\"How paranoid were you before you made this movie and how paranoid are you now?\" That question was perhaps the only moment of levity during a conversation with documentarian Alex Gibney after the credits rolled on Zero Days, a terrifying account of the cyberwar that is already raging on thumb drives and mainframes from Washington to Tel Aviv to Isfahan Province in Iran and anywhere else that can connect to the internet. Zero Days is a thorough look at the Stuxnet worm, a computer virus created by branches of the CIA and Mossad to cripple an Iranian nuclear plant that was (probably) doing more than creating civilian energy resources. There's a lot that's fascinating about this story: from how the virus got into the relevant networks, to what it actually did when it got there, to how it was discovered (and whose fault that was) and the fact that no one in the United States or Israel has ever acknowledged its existence. At its debut at the Berlin film festival the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw called Gibney's latest film \"intriguing and disturbing\" in his four-star review. Gibney has concluded that the sovereign nations of this pale blue dot had better work hard on some sort of cyber-nonproliferation treaty if we want to make it much further into this new century. \"The danger is that it seems innocent,\" Gibney said after a recent screening in New York. \"Command and control machinery were never intended to be integrated with the internet in such a way,\" he said, referring to the fact that the Stuxnet worm didn't just clog up a bunch of email accounts, it caused actual machinery to spin out of control until they were destroyed. Part of his research involved talking to agency moles (whose identity the film weaves into one composite character) and Zero Days explains how the US has another cyberweapon ready to launch at Iran called Nitro Zeus that would essentially knock out all civic infrastructure. That isn't just cable television, it's hospitals and transport. \"'We've got a power plant, let's hook it up to the internet to make it more convenient, but without thinking about problems 10 or 20 years hence,'\" Gibney mused, consider the way all industrialised nations are threatened by the new age of cyberwarfare. Gibney, a classic iconoclast, is eager to show how the US and Israel are mostly to blame for this. \"Stuxnet was the first cyberweapon to cross the boundary from the cyber realm to physical realm. Iran hadn't even contemplated the possibility. At first, their engineers thought they had screwed up.\" As the film goes on, it shows how Washington and Tel Aviv didn't exactly see eye to eye, and the Israeli agency's desire to push for increased destruction was what eventually gave the game away. According to Zero Days, the Bush administration agreed to create Stuxnet as a form of Israeli appeasement. Without some sort of programme, the Netanyahu administration was likely to bomb the nuclear facility at Natanz. \"Obama inherited the programme and, as with drones, cranked it up,\" Gibney said. As most of Gibney's sources are on the US side, the film doesn't paint a rosy picture of Israel's espionage tactics. \"Any criticism of Israel gets blowback,\" Gibney said, \"but this is an important object lesson in how that alliance can be problematic, especially when sharing military technology.\" After all his research, Gibney is concerned about the future. He cited the recent Iran deal as a ray of hope (as does the composited character of American informants) but is cautiously eyeing Russia's use of cyberweapons in Ukraine and the US's current engagements with Isis: \"This is the first time the US has admitted to using cyber. They are talking about changing text, so when you send an email instead of saying, 'I love you,' it says, 'I hate you and I will kill you.'\" It may somewhat harmless at first (especially if it is deployed against Isis) but an attack that could lead to critical physical damage might be considered an act of war. Then there's also the issue of attribution. \"How long were we arguing if the Sony hack was from North Korea?\" he asked. \"We need to get to where we're at with nuclear or chemical weapons with cyber. There are no agreements on their use.\" Zero Days is a cold, two-hour, sky-is-falling case designed to make everyone agree. Zero Days is in cinemas and on VOD in the US."
