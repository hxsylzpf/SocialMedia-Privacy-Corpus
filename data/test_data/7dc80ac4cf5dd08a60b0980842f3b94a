  "content": "Everything has changed. Taylor Swift has spoken out against Apple and seemingly achieved the impossible \u2013 she's persuaded the tech giant to actually change something. After Swift's intervention, Apple will now pay artists as it gives their music away for free as part of its Apple Music streaming service trial. Some might say Apple were always looking for a way to shake off its previous stance, but that shouldn't lead us to underestimate the sway Swift holds. There's no bad blood between the parties that we know of, so what's to stop Swift asking Apple for more? What else could she change for us? What in our wildest dreams \u2026 Well first there's the undeletable apps \u2026 The more mundane niggles with search \u2026 And stopping the monstrosity that was the finger touch and the injection of U2 into everyone's iTunes library, whether they liked it or not. Then there's longer charging cables, because Apple's standard 1-metre lightning cables just don't stretch far enough. Perhaps the reason the cables are such an issue is because the battery lasts less than a day? And while you're at it \u2026 But let's not stop there! Taylor Swift, I wish you would ask Apple to fix notifications \u2026 sort out the Notification Center and make it so push notifications actually deliver the message, not just a ping to tell you there is one leading to the spinning wheel of forever loading, and [That's enough Sam - Ed] ... And I'm sure our commenters will have even more requests \u2013 there's a blank space below waiting to be filled \u2026 \u2022 Apple Music to pay royalties during free trial: 'We hear you Taylor Swift'"
