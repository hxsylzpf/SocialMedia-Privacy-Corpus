  "content": "'For us, products really don't get that interesting to turn into businesses until they have about one billion people using them,\" Mark Zuckerberg told investors last week. Facebook hit that dizzy one-billion mark two years ago. Now 1.35 billion people \u2013 roughly equal to the population of China \u2013 log on to the social network site every month. Ten years old this year, Facebook reached a peak market capitalisation of $200bn (\u00a3125bn) in 2014. But it faces a problem: how to keep on growing? And its solution has Wall Street worried. Zuckerberg, its co-founder, has big plans \u2013 and those plans are expensive. Its Internet.org initiative would bring the internet (by drone, potentially) to the billions of people who are not online, and even create a virtual reality universe that could one day rival the world wide web as the premier platform for learning, commerce and play. And Facebook will deliver this via its $2bn virtual reality acquisition, Oculus Rift. No one could accuse Zuckerberg of playing safe. He said last week: \"For the next 10 years, our focus is on driving the fundamental changes in the world that we need to achieve our mission: connecting the whole world, understanding a world with big leaps in AIs [artificial intelligence], and developing the next generation of platforms.\" To realise those ambitions, Facebook said its expenses could rise by between 55% and 75% next year. The shares, which had hit an all-time high earlier in the week, promptly plummeted 10%. Not that that will shake Zuckerberg's resolve: with control of 55% of the voting stock, he can afford to disregard those who don't share his vision, for now. David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect and founder of Techonomy Media, a technology-focused conference company, says he is continually surprised that people are surprised by Zuckerberg's long-term focus. \"From the very first time I met him, in September 2006,\" says Kirkpatrick, \"my most profound impression was that here was someone looking at the long term. It's not typical. Larry Page [Google's co-founder] has it, in his way, but very few people have that focus.\" He added that people had only to listen to the \"fervour\" with which Zuckerberg speaks about his projects to see how seriously he takes his approach. Brian Wieser, senior research analyst at investment consultancy Pivotal Research, believes Facebook has earned the right to make those long-term bets: \"If you go back to the initial public offering, I had a sell rating on them then. I just felt like they hadn't made many efforts towards meaningful monetisation. Then, very suddenly, you started to see new products that made money. They very quickly developed a lot of things that drove revenue growth above and beyond expectations.\" He says analysts are quite right to factor in the amount of money Facebook is spending in their calculations \u2013 and punish its share price accordingly \u2013 but that Zuckerberg himself is best placed to see where the industry he has defined is heading. \"So would I give them a pass?\" he asks. \"On balance, yes.\" Facebook is not alone in playing the long game. Google has recently moved into driverless cars, robotics and nanotechnology \u2013 areas unlikely to see profits for decades. Amazon, too, regularly irritates its investors by focusing on growth tomorrow rather than profits today. But Facebook, with Zuckerberg controlling the company and profits and revenue growing, is unlikely to face a real backlash in the near future. As it announced its spending plans, it also revealed that its third-quarter revenue was up 59% from the same period last year, hitting $3.2bn. Most of those dollars come from advertising and, according to Facebook, about two-thirds of it now comes from ads on mobile devices, up from just half a year ago. Mobile was once an area where the company struggled. Facebook is expected to take an 8% share of the $140.7bn global advertising market in 2014, according to eMarketer, up from 5.8% in 2013. Its share of the mobile ad market is expected to reach 20.4% this year, up from 16.5% in 2013. By comparison, Google is expected to lose mobile ad market share this year, falling from 46.4% in 2013 to 44.6%. In the near future, Facebook could further bolster its position in mobile thanks to two recent purchases: message service WhatsApp and photo sharing app Instagram. Instagram cost Facebook $1bn in 2012, a price that looks like a bargain compared with the sky-high prices now being paid for social media companies. Instagram, with about 200 million users, was teenage favourite in a survey called \"Taking Stock With Teens\" by investment bank Piper Jaffray this year. \"Instagram would probably be worth $15bn if it was for sale today,\" says Kirkpatrick. \"You can't question Zuckerberg's judgment on that one.\" WhatsApp was a buy of a different order: Facebook paid $21.8bn for it last February. It reported just over $10m in revenue in 2013, and a total net loss of $138m for the year. Wiser points out that a big part of that loss, about $98.8m, was stock-based compensation. The actual cost of building WhatsApp's huge audience was in the single-digit millions. \"The risk for them is: what's to stop someone else spending that sort of money to develop a rival that replaces WhatsApp? It was expensive, but I can only say that I defer to them as to whether it's the future of communications platforms,\" he says. Not everyone is happy with what Facebook offers. Earlier this year, a poll of marketers by Forrester Research found widespread discontent with the company. Despite the fact that it offers the largest audience in history, companies believed that Facebook ads offered less value than any other digital platform, the survey found. Marketers' posts were allegedly failing to reach more than a small slice of fans, and some worried that in any case many of the claimed legions of fans are fake. Forrester principal analyst Nate Elliott says the company has made some improvements since the survey but that marketers \u2013 who are Facebook's bread and butter \u2013 remain unhappy. Keeping the marketers happy \"is just not interesting to Facebook,\" he says. \"Their head and their heart is in building tools to connect people.\" And as long as it has such a huge audience, advertisers just have to accept it. \"I'd like to think it is a big risk,\" Elliott says. \"But it's not like they are being punished for it.\" Since Zuckerberg's announcement about Facebook's next 10 years, Rupert Murdoch has given more details about what went wrong at formerly high-flying MySpace. It is a cautionary tale. When the media mogul bought the site for $350m in 2005, it had 300m users and was Facebook's clearest rival. It was also working on a video service which it believed could have rivalled YouTube. The story ended badly, of course: News Corp sold MySpace for $35m in 2011. His company \"messed up\" MySpace, Murdoch said last week. Its founders have blamed a desire to make money rather than build the business. Facebook, on the other hand, is making money \u2013 lots of it \u2013 and so far its focus on its product has not cost Zuckerberg many sleepless nights. In the past 10 years, Facebook has gone from college dorm to world domination. \"We're a long-term company, run by a founder with a very long-run vision,\" Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer said last week. The question for investors is whether that vision will continue to pay off, but for now few are prepared to stand in the founder's way. GOOGLE'S SEARCH A lot has changed in a couple of years for Google. In 2011 the company made 96% of its $37.9bn (\u00a323.7bn) annual revenue from advertising. That had barely changed in two years and it warned in its accounts that \"reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our business\". But in the latest full-year accounts available, for 2013, the share of Google's $59.8bn revenue coming from website advertising had dropped to 62%. That figure rises to 83% \u2013 or $50.6bn \u2013 if Google Network members (that is to say, ads that Google places on other publishers' websites) are included. Of the remainder, 8% of the revenue came from Motorola, the mobile phone company that Google bought for $12.5bn in 2011 and sold to Lenovo earlier this year for $2.9bn. But the final 9% of income is classed as \"other revenues\". That covers Google Play [its version of Apple's iTunes music service and App Store] and numerous other ventures, from self-driving cars to smart smoke detectors, robots, alternative energy, space exploration and its Google X lab. In total, \"other revenues\" were up 111% on the previous year to $4.9bn. Mostly accounted for by Google Play, those other revenues have continued to rise ever since. In the most recent quarter, to the end of September, they came in at $1.84bn, up 50% on the same period in 2013. Google, which is famous for allowing employees to spend 20% of their time on projects not directly related to their day-to-day job \u2013 does not provide many details about what such projects contribute financially. Many of them \u2013 including driverless cars and nanoparticles that could travel through the bloodstream to detect early-stage cancer and other diseases \u2013 have yet to generate any income (and are very cash-hungry) but could prove massive moneyspinners in the future. Victor Anthony of Topeka Capital Markets, who has been covering Google since its flotation in 2004, told CNBC: \"Investors always worry when CEOs spend their capital \u2014 they wonder about the long-term return on the use of that capital. These [new ventures] are long-term initiatives, and the returns aren't immediately clear.\" Google's chief financial officer, Patrick Pichette, says: \"As you know from the Nest acquisition [internet-connected thermostats and smart smoke detectors] and Google Glass and wearables, we continue to innovate and we continue to be committed to the hardware in areas that are kind of enterprising, promising; it's on new frontiers that we're actually focusing.\" Rupert Neate",
