  "content": "A man whose daughter was murdered by her violent boyfriend has handed in a petition at Downing Street calling for a change in the law to protect women from domestic abuse. Michael Brown, from Batley, West Yorkshire, travelled to London as part of a campaign to introduce \"Clare's Law\" named after his daughter, Clare Wood, who was killed by her boyfriend in February 2009. The law would allow women to find out if their boyfriends or husbands had a previous history of domestic violence. Clare Wood met her boyfriend, George Appleton, on Facebook, unaware of his long history of violence against women, including repeated harrassment, threats and kidnapping one of his former girlfriends at knifepoint. He strangled Clare Wood and set her on fire before going on the run, before taking his own life. At an inquest into her death, which was held last year, coroner Jennifer Leeming said women in abusive relationships has a right to know about the violent past of the men they were with. A verdict of unlawfull killing by strangulation was recorded as the cause of her death. The coroner said she would report back to the government recommending that people at risk of harm should be given information about their partners' past so they can make an informed choice. Clare Wood had complained to Greater Manchester Police on a number of occasions about the campaign of harassment from her former partner. The Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled she had been badly let down by Greater Manchester Police. The force says it has now introduced a number of changes to policy and procedures in the handling of domestic violence cases. Brown, who is supported by the Salford MP Hazel Blears and Manchester radio station Key 103, is calling on the government to introduce Clare's Law to help women. The former prison officer handed over the petition on Monday that has around 1,000 signatures calling for a change in the law. He said: \"I have been campaigning for the last six months and have been pleasantly surprised at the public reaction to the proposed change in the law. \"The interest world-wide is also unbelievable, from America to Australia, to an article in a newspaper in Pravda. The world is watching for a lead from the UK's government, the cradle of democracy, and I pray that they make the right decision.\" In 2011, the home secretary, Theresa May, agreed to open a 'Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme' to public consultation and is now considering the response."
