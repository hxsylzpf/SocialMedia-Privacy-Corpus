So, in a blatant demonstration of submitting to peer pressure, here are some more examples of what it would be like if great scientists were on Twitter. As per last time, explanatory links in the subheadings. Neil Armstrong Jane Goodall Eratosthenes Leonardo Da Vinci Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla Mary Anning Thomas J Watson Isaac Newton Robert Stephenson Galileo Galilei Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger It probably doesn't need saying, but Dean Burnett is on Twitter, @garwboy",
