  "content": "The news that Facebook had banned the Royal National Institute of Blind People's (RNIB) latest campaign advert about sight loss raises questions about the future of charity adverts on the social media platform. Facebook claimed the ad was \"degrading\" and broke its guidelines on language. The RNIB campaign, #seetheneed, aims to highlight the need for sight loss advisers in every UK hospital. The advert shows the moment a woman is told by a doctor that she is losing her eyesight, with a voiceover relaying her fears such as losing her job and even her home. It's hard hitting stuff - which, is exactly why it needs to be shared on social. Facebook's decision, on Tuesday, was overturned the following day. For me, it would be dishonest to only show positive stories and not the hard hitting ones. Take the refugee crisis \u2013 should charities only show the positive stories of people receiving hygiene kits and food parcels with smiles on their faces? How would the public know these people need help if they're are not shown the conditions they are living in or the extreme measures they have taken to seek safety? And what about domestic violence? Again, it's not a positive story but it happens every day to women around the world. Two women are killed a week in the UK by abusive partners. Should domestic violence charities not be allowed to pay for adverts to campaign against this? Advertising on Facebook is a highly cost effective way for charities of all sizes to get their campaigns and messages to a wide audience, and banning them would have major implications for charities and the people they support. Facebook has 1.49 billion monthly active users. It is a powerful platform for charities to get their message across and it has worked in the past. Take the Dying Matters campaign. Back in 2013 the organisation launched a campaign to change the law around assisted dying. Social media was an obvious choice to raise awareness of the campaign and on Facebook, one of their posts reached more than 32,000 people from a page that had only 5,604 likes at the time. Another post, which asked people to share it if they supported the assisted dying bill, reached 260,248 people and was shared more than 7,400 times. MPs may have recently voted against the bill but there is no doubt that social media, and Facebook in particular, played a huge role in the charity being able to get its message across to so many. In fact, its Facebook page grew from 5,604 likes in September 2013 to 139,000 likes to date. Paid-for content on Facebook also formed a major part of the RNLI's national drowning prevention campaign, Respect the Water. The charity delivered a powerful mix of facts, statistics and real-life rescue stories, backed up by two hard-hitting campaign films warning people about the debilitating effects of cold water shock, and the sheer power of the sea. The adverts reached more than 19 million people, resulting in nearly 84,000 engagements (likes, comments and shares), and exceeding all targets set at the start of the campaign. The film about cold water shock was one of thecharity's most shared pieces of content. Many charities deal with hard hitting events every day and it's their job to raise awareness (and funds) and sometimes this means having to pay to get their campaign to reach as many people as possible. The RNIB advert was initially rejected for fear Facebook users wouldn't like it, not because users had complained. This kind of decision making has huge implications for charities. Not all our work is happy, not all our stories are positive. The hard hitting messages need to be told too.
