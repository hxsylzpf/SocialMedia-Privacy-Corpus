  "content": "If you've done any research on universities, you'll be well aware that they invest heavily in their marketing \u2013 from YouTube channels featuring their swankiest digs to Instagram accounts full of arty-looking photos of their towns and cities. So how can you see past the glossy prospectuses and get the real story on the places you want to apply to? Social media can help enormously, says Jack Wallington, community director at the Student Room website. \"You can find people, online, who are at the university you want to go to and doing the course you're thinking of taking \u2013 and then you can ask them what it's really like. That's so powerful.\" And there are many ways of finding people to talk to. Search Twitter or YouTube and you should be able to find students doing the course you're interested in \u2013 then you can contact them directly with questions. Joining private Facebook groups for specific subjects or societies is another good idea \u2013 if you send a message to the group owner explaining why you want to join, they should be happy to add you on a short-term basis. As with any social media interactions, it's important to keep yourself safe, so use privacy settings where appropriate and be wary of publishing any personal information about yourself (such as phone numbers or pictures of your home or school). While it can be daunting to reach out to people you've never met, it's definitely worth the effort, says Molly Massey, who contacted students on Facebook and Twitter to find out about living costs and accommodation at Lincoln University, where she has been offered a place to study biology. Online discussion forums can be helpful too. Ash Miah, who hopes to study mathematics and sports science at the University of Birmingham, says he used the Student Room's discussion forums to get information that wasn't available on university websites, and found out about \"the social scene, what lectures are like, the cost of living and so on\". Bloggers are another useful source of information. A quick search on Google or Tumblr should lead you to bloggers studying at your chosen university. And to get a more realistic impression of the campus and accommodation, you can search for images \u2013 taken by students \u2013 on social media platforms like Instagram and Pinterest. While it's a good idea to combine online research with university visits, this isn't always possible, says Moj Taylor, executive and business development manager of Push Talks, which delivers training and guidance on higher education in schools. He recalls one student he worked with who was applying for universities in Western Australia. \"She'd have loved to visit, but this just wasn't an option. So she found someone on Facebook doing the course she wanted to study and sent him a message. They chatted about the course and she ended up asking him if he'd take some footage of the campus for her. This gave her the chance to see beyond the marketing brochures.\" As Miah puts it: \"All universities try to sell themselves. It's a business at the end of the day. So what can be better than [hearing about universities] from people who are actually there.\" Kirsten's story Kirsten Kurt-Elli has an offer to study political science at Birmingham University, starting in September. I spent hours researching universities online before I decided where to apply. Initially, I was obsessed by league tables, until I discovered there were different kinds \u2013 and they all contradicted each other. Thankfully, a teacher explained that university rankings can vary quite significantly from subject to subject, and from year to year. That helped me get things into perspective. I messaged people on Facebook from my secondary school who had gone to the universities on my shortlist to get their honest views. I also searched on Twitter to see what students were really saying about the quality of lectures or the accommodation. This gave me a much more realistic idea of what was going on. LinkedIn was useful to track where graduates from particular universities end up \u2013 and how favourably this compares with the impressive employment stats in their prospectuses. I also read some reviews on TripAdvisor so I could get a feel for the nightlife, restaurants and things to do in the area. It was a tedious process at times \u2013 but not as tedious as spending three years on a degree you're not really interested in, or in a city you don't like.
