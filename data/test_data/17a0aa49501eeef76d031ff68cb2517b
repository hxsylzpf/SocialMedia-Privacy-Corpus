  "content": "Can Facebook really be worth $100bn? Mark Zuckerberg hasn't yet put a price tag on his creation, so it's still premature to say he'll attempt to achieve that big fat round number when the flotation happens. But read last week's prospectus and put yourself in the position of a long-term investor. Would you really pay 100 times profits of $1bn, and 27 times last year's revenues of $3.7bn, for a seven-year-old business \u2013 even one with 845 million users? If you are tempted to do so, there are probably three reasons why you should lie down until the feeling goes away. 1. Zuckerberg's first-person letter to potential investors \u2013 a now-obligatory inclusion in a prospectus out of Silicon Valley \u2013 was a strange dispatch. Here's the ambition: \"Facebook aspires to build the services that give people the power to share and help them once again transform many of our core institutions and industries.\" OK, but the reason advertisers might use Facebook is to flog stuff. What if Zuckerberg's \"social mission\" collides with the commercial mission being pursued by the advertisers, who provide the revenues? Nobody really knows. But WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell's analysis that \"you interrupt social conversations with commercial messages at your peril\" sounds correct. Looking at your mate's photos on Facebook will be less fun if the system is badgering you to give a thumbs-up for a new washing powder. \"As people share more, they have access to more opinions from the people they trust about the products and services they use,\" continues Zuckerberg. \"This makes it easier to discover the best products and improve the quality and efficiency of their lives.\" What he is describing there is word-of-mouth endorsement, which is indeed a highly prized form of advertising. But word-of-mouth recommendations are valued because money doesn't change hands \u2013 surely a problem for a profit-seeking business. 2. Facebook has no need to float. It doesn't require money to invest. It is profitable and generates enough cash to pursue its current ambitions. In a 200-page document, the section titled \"Use of proceeds\" runs to four paragraphs. That's because there's little to say. A portion of new capital (expected to be $5bn) will go on paying taxes that arise from the flotation itself; the rest will go on deposit. The main reason for floating is to allow longstanding investors to cash in a portion of their winnings. Fair enough, but, in a rational world, those investors would have to accept a hefty discount to reflect the fact that Facebook is an immature business whose earnings potential can only be guessed at. For example: Facebook hasn't yet cracked how to present adverts on mobile devices, and saturation point may be approaching in countries such as the US, where the growth in monthly active users slowed to 16% last year. The float's promoters will seek to emphasise the potential for profitable growth and play down the risks \u2013 that's their job. But, come on: valuing a company at 100 times earnings assumes years of 50%-plus profits growth. Very few companies in history have achieved that. Uncertainty ought to imply caution in pricing a business; at $100bn, there would only be optimism. 3. Zuckerberg is keeping control of Facebook by adopting a dual voting structure that, to British eyes at least, belongs to an era that has thankfully gone. Facebook's arrangement is deemed excusable because the company must avoid becoming bogged down by bureaucracy. But will investing absolute trust in Zuckerberg always be seen as sensible? Is he more interested in changing the world or in making money for his investors? The twin goals may currently be aligned \u2013 as Zuckerberg puts it, \"the best way to achieve our mission is to build a strong and valuable company\" \u2013 but what happens if the circle becomes less easy to make square? Do outsiders get a real voice in how the company is managed? Surely that's what you'd expect from a company that says it champions \"direct empowerment\" and \"more accountability\". What happened to empowerment of the owners of Facebook shares?"
