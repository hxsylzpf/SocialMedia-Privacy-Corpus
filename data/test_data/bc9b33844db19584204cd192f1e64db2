  "content": "It is more than 17 years since the tribunal system was set up to handle complaints from members of the public who believed they were the target of unlawful surveillance by the state agencies, including the police and MI5. During that time, not a single complaint has been upheld. Far from providing a crucial check and balance on the powers of the authorities, the system is derided by its critics as undemocratic, secretive and unjust. Today's decision by two senior judges to allow the merest chink of daylight into these proceedings may just begin to change all that. In their 85-page judgment, Lord Justice Mummery and Mr Justice Burton, president and vice-president of the investigatory powers tribunal, upheld an unprecedented application by the Guardian, the human rights group Liberty and a London businessman to overturn the blanket ban on any reporting of the tribunal's cases. They quashed rules made by the home secretary which forced the tribunal, always and in all circumstances, to conduct its business in private. Until today, these rules meant that no members of the public were allowed to sit in on hearings, and neither was the media allowed to report cases. Even the rulings of the tribunal could not be revealed to the general public. Now, parts of cases in which there is no risk to national security will be held in public, complainants and their legal representatives will be allowed to attend some hearings, and legal rulings will be delivered in public. These are significant, if small, first steps towards proper accountability of the security services, with the judges themselves recognising the challenge to the rules as \"the most significant case ever to come before the tribunal\". The Guardian made its application because it wanted to report on two important cases currently before the tribunal. One is being brought by Liberty on behalf of Malcolm Kennedy, a businessman from east London. Mr Kennedy claims that police are continually interfering with his communications since he made a complaint about police conduct during a criminal case, in 1984, in which he was convicted of manslaughter. The second is being brought by Liberty, along with British-Irish Rights Watch and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, and involves allegations that telephone calls between these organisations in the UK and Ireland were routinely intercepted by GCHQ, the government's eavesdropping agency. These are important cases, which raise important questions about the way our security services operate. Now these questions can be aired in public. There remains a long way to go, however. The immediate practical effect of the judgment is that complainants and the government's lawyers will each present two different sets of arguments in future. One, dealing with legal and procedural questions, will be public, while the other, dealing with the substantive facts of the case, will remain secret. Crucially, today's ruling will do nothing to change the fact that complainants and their legal teams are not allowed to see the arguments and any evidence against them produced by the security services, even though these would be crucial to their case. Yet by opening the system up to more public scrutiny, it may lead to more far-reaching reforms. The door may only have opened slightly, but at least we now have our foot in it. And the tribunal's ruling is also the latest reminder from judges to ministers - in this case, the home secretary - that they cannot always insist on absolute secrecy by claiming that it is essential to protect \"national security\"."
