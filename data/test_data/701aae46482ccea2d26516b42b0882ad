  "content": "How does one get away with impersonating a bona fide Hollywood celebrity for four whole months? Easy \u2013 you ensure that your pronouncements are so bland, so anodyne, so utterly devoid of intimacy or indiscretion that the punters assume that yes, only a bona fide Hollywood celebrity could have written them. Take the case of the false Ewan McGregor, whose Twitter updates had nearly 20,000 subscribers thrilling to the news that the actor had \"worked with actress Uma Thurman, for Unicef\", was \"about to enjoy banana pancakes\" and that \"the official release for Angels and Demons in the UK is on May 15th\". Am I alone in seeing a kind of genius in these casual revelations? Full credit to \"Ewan\" for keeping himself on such a tight leash, and for resisting the urge to post the sort of updates that might have blown his cover. \"About to go defecate in back garden\", for instance. Or: \"OMG \u2013 have just run over a kid on my Harley-Davidson!\" For all that, False Ewan has now been rumbled and Real Ewan is apparently not best pleased about it, which suggests the scam was not so foolproof after all. Presumably False Ewan might have lasted even longer if he had been False Keith Chegwin or False Leonard Nimoy or any other of the \u2013 how to put this? \u2013 less vaunted celebrities who have been the subject of impersonations over the past year or so. Just think of the creative freedom offered by a False Dean Gaffney. You could probably have him say anything, however ludicrous, safe in the knowledge that it wouldn't register on anyone's radar for six months at least. In the meantime, False Ewan faces legal action for essentially keeping fans up to speed on the true-life movements of Real Ewan. So where's the justice here? Now admittedly Real Ewan probably didn't eat a banana pancake when False Ewan said he did. But \u2013 so far as I can tell \u2013 he really did do some Unicef work with Uma Thurman, and his crappy-sounding new film really is coming out in the UK in the middle of May. If this is identity theft, it is the most benign and grovelling form of larceny there is. Moreover, in a world of ghosted blogs and authorised websites, it might be argued that the only thing False Ewan can be found guilty of is a surfeit of generosity. At least publicists get paid for the work they do."
