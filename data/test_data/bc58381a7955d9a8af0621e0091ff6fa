  "content": "Look out, Oprah: there's a new book club on the rise. Mark Zuckerberg declared 2015 the \"Year of Books\" and invited Facebook users to join him with the aim of getting through a new book every two weeks while discussing it on Facebook. The aim is to focus on books that have \"an emphasis on learning about different cultures, beliefs, histories and technologies\", and the first choice is Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm's The End of Power which explores the changing nature of power. Na\u00edm, who previously served as the Venezuela's minister of trade and industry and as executive director of the World Bank, had no idea that Zuckerberg's selection was taking place until it was announced. \"It's gratifying and energizing and a great thing for an author,\" Na\u00edm told Bloomberg Business earlier this week. According to Zuckerberg's public Facebook page, he selected The End of Power because it aligns with his vision of empowering individuals. \"It's a book that explores how the world is shifting to give individual people more power that was traditionally only held by large governments, militaries and other organizations,\" Zuckerberg wrote. The venture might not be as simple as it seems. According to the 2012 survey conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts, only 54.6% of American adults read a book of any type \"outside of work or school\". Out of those 128 million Americans, 62% read both fiction and non-fiction with only 21% reading just non-fiction. At the moment comments are limited to a singular thread on the club's community page, which makes the substantial discussion difficult to navigate. There is also the matter of time; some users noted that two weeks is not enough time to complete any book, let alone a 320-page text peppered with economic analysis. While it may be too soon to declare Mark Zuckerberg the new de facto book recommender, the number of likes for A Year of Books doesn't lie: 216,963 and counting."
