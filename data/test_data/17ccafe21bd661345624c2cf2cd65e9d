  "content": "TECHNOLOGY Charles Arthur, Technology Editor The tension between privacy, security, sharing and impermanence that began gathering steam in 2013 will come to the fore in 2014. The Edward Snowden revelations echoed loudest through the technology business, with companies including Google, Apple, Microsoft and Yahoo all implicated in the US National Security Agency's scooping up of huge amounts of data. That, of course, is their business \u2013 but it's generally done with their users' permission. Privacy and security are becoming intertwined, though they're different. Privacy is about the right not to be overlooked; security is about the systems that ensure it. Yet we're happy to sacrifice a form of privacy, our personal data, in return for clear benefits. That's why systems such as Google Now \u2013 which try to tell you useful information before you ask for it, such as delayed trains on your commute, or hotels near your arrival points in a new city \u2013 are accepted. We'd like computers to do such boring stuff as working out if our day is going to be derailed, but we don't want that shared with other people. And what we do share is becoming both more permanent and more transient. Facebook's growth continues and people commit more and more to it. Yet at the same time a younger generation is adopting services such as Snapchat, whose key feature is impermanence: you take a photo, send it, and within seconds of its being viewed, it's gone. The web is blown away by the morning wind. That Snapchat was offered $3bn by Facebook (it declined) shows how important it is becoming to leave no trace in the modern world. The device on which all this privacy, security and sharing happens is increasingly, of course, the smartphone. We will see how all these conflicting pressures are coming together at the annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, from 24-27 February. It's where mobile carriers, handset makers, app makers and everyone around them comes together. Though not yet bigger than the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas (7-10 January), the centre of gravity in computing has now ineluctably moved to the mobile world. The PC is no longer dominant, and the new battleground for our trust is the device that we hold in our hands \u2013 and of which more than a billion will be sold during the year. But is what we do on our mobile phone private? Is it secure? Apps give us the promise of privacy yet sometimes break it (some grab details without permission) and, when it comes to security, the hacking of phones by the NSA and GCHQ demonstrates that the battle doesn't end \u2013 it just moves to a new platform. POLITICS Toby Helm, Political Editor For Britain's main political parties, 2013 was a year of consolidation. None, other than Ukip, did spectacularly well. But none did badly either. All four leaders look safe in their jobs until the 2015 general election, and in that respect they will all go into the new year content. But if 2013 lacked something in political drama, 2014 promises the reverse. The order that descended on politics in the last 12 months looks certain to be disturbed. The European elections in May are likely to have profound implications both for domestic politics and perhaps for the UK's position in the EU. If Ukip comes first, the Conservative party will implode and turn even more hostile to Brussels, which will put Britain on a collision course with the rest of Europe. Then September's referendum to decide whether Scotland remains in the United Kingdom, or splits from the almost 300-year-old union with England, will be a historic event, whatever the outcome. With the next general election now only 17 months away, 2014 will subject both the governing parties and the Labour opposition to examinations more intense than any they have undergone so far. Pressure builds exponentially the closer it gets to polling day. The Tories and Liberal Democrats, uneasily bound together, will increasingly feel the need to remind voters that they are distinct entities with different ideas on Europe, the environment, constitutional reform, school reform, welfare, immigration and taxing the rich, to name a few. Lib Dems and Tories will fall out. Tory MPs hate the coalition and want rid of Nick Clegg's mob. So will the coalition hang together? Will it last to May 2015? Ed Miliband and Labour are in reasonable shape. They are in the game, which is not bad for a first-term opposition. But confidence in them among voters, and their own party, is fragile. Miliband needs to find another gear and convince more non-Labour floating voters to trust him and see him as a future prime minister. But how exactly, with the economy on the mend and many of his own team lacking belief that he and they can actually do it? Will Miliband succeed in reforming Labour's links with the unions, and have his clause IV moment, or will a deal be done with Unite's Len McCluskey to duck the issues in order to avoid a financial meltdown? The state of the economy and arguments over Europe will be the key determinants of how the parties stand at the end of 2014. While growth is picking up, economists are not convinced recovery is soundly based. If interest rates have to rise, putting further pressure on indebted and struggling households, Miliband's cost-of-living arguments will continue to resonate. But at the moment the Tories look better positioned on the economy than Labour, which needs to marry bold thinking with a hairshirt approach to spending \u2013 a difficult combination indeed. Assuming Scotland votes to stay in the union, the Tories' biggest problem will lie with Ukip and Europe. Many of David Cameron's MPs want out of the EU. They will turn the screws on their leader in the second half of 2014 if the party flops in the European elections and Nigel Farage marches on. But how will the business community react if Cameron takes the UK further towards the exit door and if there is a breach with Europe? In a year's time, no one will be saying 2014 was a dull one for UK politics. FASHION Alice Fisher, Style Correspondent British names are going to be big in 2014. Over the last 12 months Kering and LVMH \u2013 the world's two biggest fashion conglomerates \u2013 have invested heavily in British design talent, and this year will see the results. In September LVMH bought a 51% stake in shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood's accessories company and a minority share in the JW Anderson label. Designer Jonathan Anderson was also appointed creative director of the Loewe luxury leather goods brand, another of LVMH's companies. This investment came months after Kering bought a majority stake in Christopher Kane's label. After the deal, Anderson called LVMH \"the Oxford University of luxury goods\", a perfect description for the way this sort of investment will help him develop his creativity and improve his company's infrastructure. Expect all three names to dominate the international fashion stage in 2014. British models are also heading for world domination. Cara Delevingne was the most Googled fashion name in 2013. As well as starring in advertising campaigns for Saint Laurent and lingerie brand La Perla, she is diversifying into acting and is shooting a feature film, The Face of An Angel, out in 2014. But the new name to watch in British modelling is Malaika Firth. The Essex 19-year-old starred in her first advertising campaign for autumn/winter 2013. It was for Prada, one of the most influential fashion firms. This made her the first black model to appear in a Prada campaign since 1994, when it used Naomi Campbell in its autumn campaign. Firth has been named as one of the stars of Burberry's spring campaign. British fashion has typically enjoyed a reputation for quirky eccentricity, and 2014 will show whether, with the right investment and promotion, that talent can find a strong international market. With big labels backing the UK's most promising names, it looks as though 2014 will be the year when everyone buys British. SPORT David Conn, Football writer The sporting year in 2014 is dominated by one midsummer behemoth: the football World Cup, this time in the most evocative of football countries, Brazil. The English football public seems to have wisely scaled down expectations of England's performance, from the customary, delusional, flag-waving triumphalism to realism tinged with modest hope. England will do well to even qualify from a tough group that includes Italy, Luis Su\u00e1rez's Uruguay and Costa Rica. The Football Association chairman, Greg Dyke, has already launched a commission to examine England's relatively mediocre international performances and the preponderance of overseas players in the Premier League. A poor World Cup will hasten the search for answers. The start of the action usually pushes wider social concerns about sport to the sidelines, but after this year's Confederations Cup was disrupted by mass protest in Brazil over inequality, poor public services and the massive cost of hosting Fifa's tournament, Brazil's government is bracing itself for more during the World Cup. Demonstrations would increase questions about Sepp Blatter's hugely profitable governing body, Fifa, which has been tarnished by corruption scandals yet enjoys tax-free status at home in Switzerland. The increased scrutiny of sport's integrity and its authorities' fitness for purpose will be an issue when the Winter Olympics begins in Sochi, Russia, on 7 February. The amnesties for Pussy Riot and the Greenpeace protesters, and the early release of the jailed oligarch Mikhail Khordokovsky have been widely interpreted to be Russian president Vladimir Putin's attempts at clearing away potential human rights protest points before the skiing starts. Cycling's governing body, Union Cycliste Internationale, has promised that an independent commission into the doping abuses of the 1990s and 2000s will begin early in the new year. The UCI's new British president, Brian Cookson, has said the commission will examine allegations that the UCI itself was previously complicit with doping, in the years when Lance Armstrong was riding high. Yet cycling's doping scandals seem not to have dulled huge British anticipation of this year's Tour de France, which starts in England on 5 July. Le grand d\u00e9part will follow a 190km route from Leeds, up the Wharfedale valley and then through more splendid Yorkshire countryside, before finishing in Harrogate, whose already grand streets are being further spruced up for their moment in the global spotlight. CULTURE Vanessa Thorpe, Arts and Media Correspondent London's big arts institutions are mounting a run of potentially headline-making performances, shows and exhibitions this spring, many celebrating the work of some major names. Henri Matisse's influential \"cutouts\" are appearing at Tate Modern in April, while the work of the Venetian master Paolo Veronese goes on show at the National Gallery from March to June. In February, a rarely performed piece called 1980, by the late, trailblazing choreographer Pina Bausch, comes to Sadler's Wells with a visit from her acclaimed company, Tanztheater Wuppertal. On BBC Radio 3 the legacy of Richard Strauss is to be honoured throughout the year with broadcasts of all his operas to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth. The warring antics of both the Vikings and of Sophocles's Thebans will take centre stage this year. The British Museum has a major show about Britain's early northern conquerors that runs from March to June, while a new opera by British composer Julian Anderson will be retelling Sophocles's tragedies at the Coliseum in early May. And of course the martial theme will be writ large this year, with a series of events to mark the centenary of the first world war. A \u00a310m creative scheme, 14-18 NOW, will pay tribute to artists who played little-known roles in the war, such as the painters who camouflaged British warships. Funded by the national lottery and the Arts Council, it is led by the BBC's director general, Lord Hall, Alex Beard of the Royal Opera House and Vikki Heywood, formerly of the RSC, and will involve the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Royal Opera House, Tate Liverpool and Liverpool Biennial, Welsh National Opera and National Theatre of Scotland, as well as some collaborations with German companies. A touring production of the play Birdsong, based on the novel by Sebastian Faulks, has also been announced to coincide with the anniversary. Yet perhaps the most notable battle of the year will be for arts funding outside London. Across England arts organisations are facing a further 1.17% cut to 2014-15 Arts Council funds after the reductions in the culture budget announced in the government's last autumn statement. SCIENCE Robin McKie, Science Editor At 10am on 20 January next year, a tiny electronic chip inside Europe's Rosetta spacecraft is scheduled to flicker into life. The robot probe will by then be several hundred million miles from Earth, on course for Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Once its circuits, heaters and instruments have been brought to life, the probe \u2013 which has been in hibernation for two and a half years \u2013 will make its final rendezvous with its target in August before landing a tiny craft, called Philae, in November. Rosetta and Philae will then stay with Comet 67P/CG over the next few months, studying the plumes of gas and vapour that will boil from its surface as it sweeps past the sun. The \u00a3840m project will be one of the most spectacular feats of space exploration ever planned and, if successful, will mark a major milestone for the European Space Agency which is set to fulfil a series of space spectaculars next year. Apart from Rosetta, the agency will start taking data later in the year from its robot satellite Gaia, which it launched successfully a few days ago. Carrying the biggest, most accurate camera ever constructed, Gaia will pinpoint more than a billion stars with unprecedented precision and create a 3D map of the Milky Way. The billion-pixel camera will also help astronomers pinpoint planets orbiting stars elsewhere in our galaxy, and help them in their quest to detect dark energy, the mysterious force that is believed to be pushing the universe apart. In addition to these missions, 2014 will see a programme of commercial satellite launches and flights of European astronauts to the International Space Station, demonstrating that Europe's burning ambition to become a major space power may very soon be fulfilled. FOOD Jay Rayner, Restaurant critic At the dawn of the new year the global population will stand at just over 7.2 billion and rising. We are predicted to hit eight billion by 2024 and nine billion soon after. The need to feed all those mouths remains and the diary is packed with talking shops about how to do it. The Global Forum for Food and Agriculture will hold its Empowering Agriculture summit in Berlin from 16-18 January. Likewise, the African Union has declared 2014 the year of agriculture and food security, and will debate the issues at its annual gathering in Addis Ababa at the end of January. It's likely similar discussions will be held in March at the Wheat Food Security summit in Mexico. This marks the centenary of the birth of Norman Borlaug, the father of the green revolution that ushered in a massive explosion in agricultural yields in India and Pakistan from the 1960s. But the key event in the food security diary in 2014 is likely to be the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's second international conference on nutrition in Rome in November. Given that the first one took place in 1992, it's long overdue. Back then the issue was relatively straightforward: there were people who had enough to eat and a lot who didn't. Now an explosion in the middle classes of the emerging economies \u2013 primarily in India and China, but elsewhere too \u2013 has created a different narrative. There are still nearly a billion people with not enough to eat but there are also vast numbers who are consuming too much. What's more, the two groups are increasingly living side by side. In India, for example nearly one half of all children under three are malnourished or stunted. And yet in urban areas lifestyle-related type 2 diabetes affects around 9% of the population, one of the world's highest rates. A similar patchwork of need and excess is seen across Latin America and even Africa. Meanwhile, in the developed world more than 60% of the population are overweight. Agricultural fixes alone will not secure the food supply; we need to rebalance our consumption. This is the debate that will come to the fore in 2014. TRAVEL Joanne O'Connor, Travel writer The growth of the \"sharing economy\" will continue to be one of the biggest travel stories of 2014. Once seen as niche alternatives, accommodation sites such as Airbnb and HouseTrip, car share service BlaBlaCar and dinner-party finder EatWith are moving swiftly into the mainstream and giving traditional hoteliers, car rental companies and restaurateurs sleepless nights. Airbnb has hosted more than eight million guests since its launch in 2007 and lists 500,000 properties on its site. But as the amount of online travel content has grown, so has the need for a means of whittling it down. Research shows that most people will visit an average of 20 different sites to plan a trip, a process which can be time-consuming and overwhelming. Unable to compete on size with behemoths such as TripAdvisor and Airbnb, the new wave of travel startups will focus instead on offering a personalised service, in effect performing the role of the old-school travel agent by \"curating\" information based on an individual's likes and dislikes and offering inspiration at the trip-planning stage. After all, what's the good of having half a million apartments to browse on Airbnb if you're not sure where you want to go in the first place? San Francisco-based Peek.com is typical of the new breed of startup, offering a selection of handpicked travel experiences in the US, London and Paris. Local personalities in each city are enlisted to suggest itineraries for their own \"perfect day\" and activities can be searched by category (romantic, under $50, off the beaten path etc) and then booked on any device. Mygola.com is another site that was created in response to a lack of decent online itineraries for independent travellers. Users can download a suggested itinerary, modify it and book the various components all in one place. Taking this customisation process one step further, new apps from travel website Triposo provide recommendations for things to do and places to go in 200 countries, based on your location, the time of year, the weather and your personal preferences. Even the \"peer to peer\" accommodation sector, where size has been everything so far, is showing signs of fragmentation and specialisation, with an increase in house-swap sites that target niche demographics, whether it be Oxbridge graduates, families or retired people. One of the most intriguing new arrivals is Behomm, set up by a couple of Barcelona-based graphic designers, an invitation-only site which allows designers and visual artists to swap their homes. Berlin-based Roomsurfer.com uses algorithm technology to bring together travellers and like-minded hosts, so you can search for a cheap place to stay based not just on price and location but on mutual interests \u2013 online dating meets couch surfing, if you like.",
