  "content": "Were 59 Labour MPs right to vote yesterday to \"abandon\" the computer hacker Gary McKinnon? Or were they spineless hypocrites to vote the way they did, as today's Mail thunders across page one? Strictly speaking, neither. The Conservative motion, defeated by 290 votes to 236 after a two-hour debate, had called on the government to review the 2003 Extradition Act \"in the light of a series of high profile cases\" with a view to amending it. Nothing to do with McKinnon, then, but everything to do with him, too. Some 84 Labour MPs had signed Commons motions urging a review or that he be kept in Britain. Yesterday, 15 abstained, 59 backed the government, and only 10 \u2013 mostly regular troublemakers, plus Keith Vaz \u2013 backed the opposition. Hence the Mail's fury, although Speaker Bercow, presumably seeking to improve the topicality of debate (and avoid the paper's wrath?) waived the strict interpretation of the sub judice rules so MPs could make passing reference to the 43-year-old hacker's running legal battle to avoid that transatlantic flight. As far as I can see, few other papers gave the debate much attention. That's their right. Few \u2013 certainly not the Mail \u2013 gave much attention to Nick Davies's dramatic evidence to a Commons select committee this week of the complicity of senior News of the World executives in illegal phone interceptions. In a free country, free media is free to pick and choose. To my surprise it didn't give as much attention as it should have done (says me) to today's sharp rise in unemployment either. A total of 2.38 million is a 14-year high. But the Mail's hectoring \u2013 part of its current campaign to save McKinnon from a US jail \u2013 finally prompted me to take another look. This morning, I read the debate online, snatches of which I half-heard on the Commons TV feed while working yesterday. I'm still inclined to say he should be tried here for his (admitted) offences, but it was an illuminating debate. Needless to say, there are points on both sides. Alan Johnson, our new home secretary, was not as complacent as the Mail suggests today \u2013 a \"geezerish\" disregard for justice \u2013 but his speech suggested he wasn't prepared to take on the aggravation of reversing earlier decisions. I've followed the case in the way most of us do most things: get the drift, but not the vital details. Back in 2001-2002, McKinnon got into 97 US military and NASA computers on some strange quest of his own, causing what US prosecutors call \"the biggest military computer hack of all time\". When traced by Britain's national hi-tech crime unit, he was charged by US authorities. But extradition proceedings only began after the signing of the 2003 US/UK extradition treaty and consequent legislation, the 2003 Extradition Act, which \u2013 this bit's important \u2013 went beyond the UK/US dimension and sought to improve sluggish extradition procedures with all sorts of respectable countries. Most noticeable was the European arrest warrant (EAW), the aspect that excited most Tory MPs at the time. In fairness, the Lib Dems have consistently been opposed to the lack of precise \"reciprocity\" between the US requirement (in the 1787 constitution) of evidence to suggest \"probable cause\" that X committed the alleged crime, and the US's modified request \u2013 to all acceptable jurisdictions \u2013 for \"reasonable suspicion\" of the offence. It's a lower test than the old \"prima facie\" evidence and lower than the US version, the then home office minister Patricia Scotland (now the attorney general) admitted at the time. Johnson argued this week (\"I ... am no lawyer, just a hack politician, I go by the advice I get\") that the two are roughly comparable. As a hack hack, I tend to agree. But the problem doesn't end there. Government loyalists argue that faster extradition, including the EAW, has been good for Britain, enabling 300 or so serious bad guys to be brought back and convicted as a result \u2013 not least Hussain Osman, the failed 21/7 bomber who fled to Italy but left a mobile phone trail. Tory MPs complain that some EU countries have pretty ropey legal procedures, though some feel a bit that way about ours, too. The French had to fight for a decade to get hold of Rachid Ramda so they could sentence him to life for his part in the 1995 Paris Metro bombings. He fought extradition from London. There are three problems with the US, said Chris Grayling, the new shadow home secretary: one, mission creep \u2013 a change supposedly intended to help get hold of 9/11 terrorists \u2013 is being extended to much lesser crimes, including hijacking, most of which can be tried here (and are). He's wrong about that bit: the 2003 treaty revisions were under discussion before 9/11. But the US does seem to seek universal jurisdiction over internet cases. It shouldn't. Two, the question of where best to try a case \u2013 the \"forum\" argument. Did McKinnon's hacking take place here \u2013 physically, it did \u2013 or where he did the damage: to computers in the US? For some reason, the CPS decided it didn't have enough evidence to make a case here. Pity \u2013 it would have saved \u00a31m or so in legal fees and a lot of heartache for a man described by his friends as a vulnerable loner. And three, the aforementioned imbalance in evidential requirements, the \"reciprocity\" issue. I suspect that may be a red herring, partly the result of gut anti-Americanism and distaste for such policies as capital punishment (if that was a prospect here, Johnson would legally be bound not to extradite McKinnon). I find that puzzling. We talk a lot about national sovereignty, in courts as elsewhere, and denounce outside interference in our affairs or those of others. Yet we cheerfully tell them what's wrong with their legal systems. If you kill someone in the US or import drugs in Thailand, local law says you risk being executed. Lesson? Don't do it. That said, I am about to interfere, too. John Gummer, the Tory ex-cabinet minister, put it well when he complained that US law officers are too keen to get people they don't like \"off the street\" and that disturbingly high punishments \u2013 by European standards \u2013 are routine in many states. So is plea bargaining, in which an accused facing a huge sentence offers a guilty plea in return for a lighter one. Plea bargaining has its place in any system. In the US, it has long since passed the healthy stage and is routinely abused. What's more, a \"political\" offender there can resist extradition, the definition decided by government officials, not (as here) by the courts. The IRA lobby is still powerful over there. Yet the only extradition case to get the high-profile attention McKinnon has received \u2013 that of the NatWest Three, accused of bank fraud \u2013 went quite well. The trio lost their appeals, ended up in Texas, but were given bail and their case decided quite quickly. They pleaded guilty (that naughty plea bargaining again?) and got 37 months, most of which they are now serving in British jails. Does that mean we can safely ship out McKinnon? I don't think so, and I don't care if the Mail agrees with me. McKinnon's geeky offence was relatively minor whatever the unintended consequences, and might have got him a few months in jail from British magistrates, not the up to 70 years stuff that US prosecutors apparently threaten (that plea bargaining racket again?) McKinnon is clearly a vulnerable person, and the Labour MP Denis MacShane was wrong to hint that his late diagnosis with Asperger's Syndrome (a from of autism) in 2008 should be treated as suspicious. US prisons are very bad places. Last but not least, the British authorities \u2013 courts, DPP and Home Office \u2013 should be able to find a way of putting him on trial here. Johnson says he can't intervene, but I suspect he could try harder. It's a terrifying job he has \u2013 minefields every day \u2013 but the lawyers will see him right. Failing that, ministers should seek assurances of a fair and speedy trial with any sentence to be served at home. Apparently the Israelis and Dutch have managed that, so Whitehall can, too. However, that sounds a bit feeble, so the former option \u2013 trying McKinnon in this country \u2013 is the compelling resolution. Let us hope the Mail's campaign is not counter-productive, making it harder for something to happen that ought to happen. Alan Johnson, of all people, must be aware of this possibility. He might have been prime minister by now ...",
