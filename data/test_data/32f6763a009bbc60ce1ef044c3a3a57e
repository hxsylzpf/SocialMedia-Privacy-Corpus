  "content": "Anyone who fears their phone calls or personal data may have been hacked could potentially bring an invasion of privacy action against the News of the World, lawyers said today. \"While there is a potential criminal path open, that would have to be brought by the Crown Prosecution Service,\" said Rod Christie-Miller, of Schillings, a law firm that specialises in defamation and privacy. But there is a civil route too, he said. \"The obvious action here is a right-to-privacy breach under article 8 of the European convention on human rights. That generally doesn't give out big damages. Max Mosley got \u00a360,000 from the courts over the News of the World allegations [about his sex life] and Naomi Campbell got \u00a33,500 from the Mirror [after she objected to the paper publishing pictures of her leaving drug addiction treatment in 2001].\" Gavin Millar QC, a specialist in media law at Doughty Street Chambers, said public figures and their lawyers would be attempting to discover whether they had been targeted. \"As we all know, there are claimant privacy lawyers who are very experienced on behalf of wealthy clients like Sienna Miller and pop stars who see themselves as being harassed by the media and run claims against the media,\" he said. \"I'm sure that any client of those lawyers who realises that their information has been acquired by a newspaper will be running off to them to track back through the newspaper material published about them and to put two and two together.\" Millar added there was probably a bit of \"scuttling about\" going on to see whether those connections could be made. \"I think the first step would be for any individual worried about this to go to their phone company or to some expert consultancy that can help them investigate whether their phone's been hacked.\"",
