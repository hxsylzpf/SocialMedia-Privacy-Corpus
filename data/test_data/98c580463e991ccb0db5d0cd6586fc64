  "content": "The number of libel actions linked to posts on Facebook and Twitter rose last year, as overall defamation cases dropped to a six-year low. Total defamation cases in the UK fell by 27% year on year, from 86 to 63, the lowest level since 2008/09, according to a new report. The report, by Thomson Reuters, attributes the overall reduction to the Defamation Act that came into force in January last year. The new laws introduced a \"serious harm threshold\" designed to help people understand when claims should be brought and discourage the wasting of court time. Ministers and supporters claimed at the time that the new legislation would \"reverse the chilling effect\" previous libel laws have had on freedom of expression and legitimate debate. \"The new act offers stronger protections to those accused of making defamatory statements,\" said Harry Kinmonth, a senior associate in the media team at City law firm RPC. \"Fewer trivial defamation cases are now making it to court as a result, and claimants are looking to bring alternative causes of action.\" The report found that that the number of cases brought by businesses fell by 45% year on year, from 31 to 17. However, defamation actions linked to social media were one of the only types of cases which saw an increase, up from eight to 11. \"The fact that the number of cases relating to social media continues to rise is not necessarily surprising,\" said Kinmouth, a contributor to Thomson Reuters' Practical Law service. \"Someone is far more likely to find themselves the subject of online postings than of stories in the more traditional media. And there is the perception that such postings risk being shared widely and at speed. As a result, claimants view the potential for damage to be high.\" Kinmouth said that social media actions tend to focus on the individuals who post the libellous material and not the owner of the media platform on which they were made public. Notable public figures involved in defamation cases in the last year included Russell Brand and Jemima Khan, who sued a massage therapist, as well as the wife of Sir Roger Moore, who received a substantial payout for an inaccurate article in the Daily Mail."
