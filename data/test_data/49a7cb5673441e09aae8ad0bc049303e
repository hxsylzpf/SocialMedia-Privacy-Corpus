  "content": "Spider Robinson is a science fiction author, and it's his words that open the short film Mob by 25-year-old \"geek comedian\" Tom Scott. \"The whole world turns upside down in 10 years,\" the quote from 1977 reads, \"but you turn upside down with it.\" This is a social media horror story, told in five fast minutes but depicting two hours and the whole internet, and as I watched a shaky video of Scott presenting it, pony-tail bobbing excitedly on his shoulders, I felt distinctly haunted. It begins with a Japanese YouTube user uploading a clip he's recorded of a stranger called Jacqueline singing Never Gonna Give You Up for him, badly, on webcam site Chatroulette. The time is 16.22. Someone copies it from YouTube and posts it on the site 4Chan.org, and from there it spreads to messageboards worldwide. In 10 minutes the clip has had 5,000 views. Half an hour after Jacqueline logs off Chatroulette \u2013 Scott narrates from his position in front of the slide show \u2013 she tweets: \"Offline for a bit, working on my pots\". \"It's the last thing she's ever going to post on Twitter,\" Scott says, \"and actually, it's the last thing she's ever going to type.\" In Dubai, Jacqueline's heartbroken ex sees the video, and drunkenly posts her London address in a comment box. A few minutes later, the first stranger appears outside Jacqueline's house, calling up to her window, asking her to sing. She doesn't hear them \u2013 she, remember, is in the back, doing her pots. Then, online, someone somewhere uses the word \"flashmob\". The video's had 50,000 views by 17.00, the time that bored men leave their offices. CCTV footage from outside Limehouse station in London shows them, mobile phones in hand, using GPS to find directions to Jacqueline's house. At 17.22, a 999 call warns the police about the gathering crowd. An hour's elapsed \u2013 the video's been viewed 150,000 times, and there are 100 people standing outside her window. Stephen Fry wades in on Twitter: \"From zero to street party in an hour. Do feel a little sorry for her though.\" Docklands Light Railway trains arrive every five minutes, each one spilling more people into the growing crowd. Police request a riot squad \u2013 the crowd is dancing to a remix of Jacqueline's song. At 18.21 the dancers surge forward, still chanting for her to sing. Suddenly there's fighting. 1,000 people are trying to get out, relying on their phones for navigation, but 3G has broken down, and their phones aren't connecting any more. When the riot settled, says Scott, the screen behind him now a rich broken computer blue, there were 167 arrests and 23 dead, including Jacqueline, whose door had been forced. \"Everyone knows the internet has always worked that fast\", he says quietly. Though the events in his story are fictional, everything in it has already happened. Personal details have been leaked on messageboards; in 2009 a huge flashmob gathered within an hour; this year an uploaded video made it to national news in less than a day, and a flashmob became a riot in an American mall. Two years ago this story would have sounded implausible, Scott says, and five years ago it would have been impossible. I email him, shakily, and he responds in seconds. \"I've not met anyone who's said that the story's unrealistic \u2014 yes, it describes a 'perfect storm', and everything happens exactly as the plot requires, but there's nothing that's really a break from reality,\" he says. \"Three years ago, a flashmob arranged so quickly would have seemed unlikely at best. Ten years ago, it would have been science fiction.\" Does he, a self-proclaimed geek, find the internet scary? \"Only when it breaks out into 'real life',\" he says. \"Nothing of note ever happens purely online. If you're being harassed over the net, the best defence is just turning your computer off and going outside. But if it starts breaking out into what used to be called 'meatspace' [the physical world], then it's time to start worrying.\" For me, this story is the new terror. Forget Saw VII, The Human Centipede, forget Hostel, or that one that shows bedrooms in night vision, Scott's five-minute presentation is the ultimate horror film for today, frightening because it seems to occur just minutes, seconds in the future. I ask how the real stories make him feel. \"Uncomfortable, to say the least. They show a really quite dark side of humanity \u2014 the fact that a lot of people will become very nasty indeed if they're sure they can't be identified.\" The day I first watched Scott's video happened to be the day Gawker.com detailed the unravelling story of 11-year-old American schoolgirl Jessi Slaughter. Earlier this month, Slaughter was the victim of fabricated online rumours involving the lead singer of emo band Blood on the Dance Floor, Dahvie Vanity. When she replied to these rumours, the story swelled, with one commenter concluding: \"If Dahvie were a paedophile, why would he pick her! Other than the fact she's a slut!\" She responded with an angry YouTube video, which was then uploaded to 4Chan. It was posted and reposted, and people began circulating her phone number and address. Encyclopedia Dramatica currently has a page on \"How to troll\" Jessi: 1) \"There are pics of her holding her boobs\" 2) \"Tell her to kill herself\" 3) \"Tell her dad that we are going to beat her up.\" The final video went viral too \u2013 Slaughter weeping by her computer monitor, while her father screamed at the screen. In the past week, it's been reported, she's been put under police protection after death threats. Without bubbling into a fit of hysterical technophobia, it's worth considering what these stories, both fictional and true, could teach us about how we use the internet. As the world turns upside down, and the flimsy barriers we've erected between our online and offline existence collapse, and the number of girls \u2013 for it's usually girls \u2013 whose lives are scarred or cut short after an internet scandal rises, we don't notice the world changing; we unthinkingly join the crowds, and turn upside down right along with it. \u25a0 You can watch Tom Scott's video at http://vimeo.com/10060159"
