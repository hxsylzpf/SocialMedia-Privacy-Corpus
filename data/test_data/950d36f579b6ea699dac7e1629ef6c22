  "content": "Whatever happened to the latest royal \"fairytale\" romance? Were they too young? Was he too rowdy? Or she too possessive? Was it the pushy mother-in-law's fault? Or the Duke of Edinburgh's for telling him to make up his mind and not keep the gel hanging about? Were careers getting in the way? Was he too posh, as heir to the throne, and she too common, as a mere millionaire's daughter? Or was their friendship simply too intruded upon by the media? For some, it was egg-on-face time. Royal biographer Christopher Wilson - who told the Sunday Times three months ago \"They are in effect man and wife already. It's a done deal\" - was fulminating like a spurned courtier in the Mail on Sunday: \"Tossing away the girl who saved his reputation ... is a historic act of folly and supreme egotism on William's part. It augurs badly for his future and the future of the monarchy.\" The fact that they had been seen less frequently in public recently is now seen as a sign they were growing tired of each other. The photographs of Prince William fondling a woman in a Bournemouth nightclub, viewed by some as a boys-will-be-boys joke at the time, could now been seen as the final straw that Made Kate Mad. Or was the press attention just too stifling? Although Ms Middleton complained about a photograph of her holding a cup of coffee in the Mirror, many think that the British media did not intrude obsessively. Some have argued that had there been more photos of the prince in clubs - as he was again on Friday, evidently not too devastated by the break-up - the news might not have been such a surprise to royal watchers. There was one last speculation however: that Kate and Wills might one day get back together. That's what his dad did with Camilla."
