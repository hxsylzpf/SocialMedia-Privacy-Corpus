  "content": "Charles Arthur and Jemima Kidd (What can you do to take action against the trolls? 30 July) posed the question \"Is a rape threat on Twitter more urgent than a real-life stalker?\". In the digital world, and certainly for \"digital natives\", there is no distinction between the \"real\" and the online world. A \"like\" on your Facebook page is as great as someone saying something nice to you in the playground. A nasty comment on your timeline hurts just as much as any spoken bullying snipe \u2013 and lasts longer and is more widely shared. Similarly, a rape threat online should be treated exactly the same and with no less seriousness and urgency than one in real life. Sarah Mann Head of e-learning services, Civica \u2022 The rules for social media sites should consider their size and market dominance. Consider a town with several pubs. Behaviour tolerated in one pub may cause some to drink elsewhere. But if the customers have nowhere else to go, it seems reasonable to expect the landlord to adopt a more interventionist role. Sadly, the way Mark Luckie, Twitter's manager of journalism and news, withdrew when subjected to a fraction of the abuse endured by the people who indirectly pay his salary shows corporate incomprehension of this responsibility. Why not provide tools to formalise natural tribal segmentation, as noted by Professor Vincent Jansen? That way we can all choose which pub to chat in and avoid the boors as well as the bores. Philip Cunningham London \u2022 Threats have always been sent by any media that do not have an intermediary, as the abuse of snail mail and the telephone demonstrate. However, the internet has seen an escalating coarsening of social life. When haters can threaten their victims with apparent impunity, it is not just those targeted who are at risk. The threat is to us all. Trevor Fisher Stafford \u2022\u2008After a handful of articulate and influential middle-class women find people have posted tasteless and/or insulting comments, the media subjects the topic to intense scrutiny (Report, 4 August). As a result, Twitter is to add a complaint button, and apparently staff will also be questioned by a government select committee. Meanwhile, women who might be defined as non-influential, or poor and inarticulate, are, and continue to be, victims of domestic violence: the actual violence of a physical assault by a current or previous partner that results, on average, in the death of two women a week (see, for example, statistics on domestic violence cited by Women's Aid). Where's the outcry from the chattering classes about the two \"real victims\" of gendered violence that are killed, offline, every week? Eddie Duggan Ipswich, Suffolk \u2022 I'm sure GCHQ would be happy to help locate the Twitter trolls. After all, if it's not to help fight crime, why else are they collecting the data? John Gessler Barnsley \u2022 While I have great respect for many of those involved in Sunday's Twitter boycott, do they really think that Rosa Parks would have been remembered if she'd stayed off the buses, and walked? Dan Adler Farnham, Surrey",
