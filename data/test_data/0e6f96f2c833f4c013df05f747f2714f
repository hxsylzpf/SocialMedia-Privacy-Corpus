  "content": "Trying to prise coins from pockets and purses in mid-recession has become an ever-present conundrum for charities. Last week, it was time to try a new tactic. Fifty-eight web-savvy charities signed up to get donors to pay not in cash but with a pledge of appreciation in the new Twitter currency, the twollar. The international twollar aims to appeal to a young demographic group that can move freely in a virtual world. To spend twollars, you have to be a user of Twitter, the real-time micro-blogging website where you send tweets, or messages of no more than 140 characters. Each user automatically gets 50 twollars just for having an account. Twollars can be passed on to anyone, perhaps in appreciation of a funny message. But they realise their true potential when given to charity, and can be bought, at $1 for 10 twollars, from charities that have signed up at twollars.com. Twollars co-founder Eiso Kant has published a booklet that advises charities on how to increase their following on Twitter. He launched the twollars site after realising there were many forms of giving taking place on Twitter, including the sharing of tips. The twollar came into existence in February, but was relaunched last week. By day two, twollars had become a trending (most popular) topic on Twitter, and by day four 58 charities had signed up and 2,000 twollars (equivalent to $200) had been bought. Camfed, one of the first charities to be involved, was selling on average 100 twollars ($10) a day. While this is not a vast amount, it is early days for this form of giving, and Kant hopes that twollar donations will move beyond Twitter, so that, for example, they can be made via email. A day after joining the scheme, The Water Project had received 12 donations of 150 twollars. The \"low barrier to entry\" makes giving via twollars attractive, says Water Project president Peter Chasse. \"People are tired of being asked to join things. It's [just] as easy as sending a tweet.\" The Water Project has set a target of 40,000 twollars ($400) to build a well. The first stage is in engaging \"a large amount of people, with small incremental gifts, to do a lot of good,\" says Chasse. The second stage will be attracting corporations. And that's when big money could roll in. \u2022 twollars.com"
