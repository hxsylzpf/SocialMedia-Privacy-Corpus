  "content": "Hollywood actor Michael Douglas said he felt like there was a \"peeping tom\" at his wedding when he discovered a paparazzo photographer had sold sneaked pictures of the event to Hello! magazine, the high court heard today. Mr Douglas told the judge, Mr Justice Lindsay, that he and his wife Catherine Zeta Jones struck a \u00a31m deal for exclusive rights to their wedding pictures with OK! so their fans could get a flavour of the event. The couple are seeking \u00a3500,000 in damages from Hello!, which published six unauthorised pictures of the wedding ceremony and reception at the New York Plaza Hotel in November 2000. The court heard earlier how the couple chose two photographers to capture the event and then carefully selected the pictures that would appear in OK!. \"My wife and I spent a long time choosing these two photographers to take these pictures based on how comfortable our guests and family would feel,\" Mr Douglas said. \"I felt like a peeping tom was present, someone who snuck in not having any idea what images he had captured was deeply offensive. \"The intention was by having a contract with one magazine, paparazzi would know that they did not have outlets to sell pictures to.\" When James Price QC asked him whether it would not have been preferable to make authorised photographs available to all publications, Mr Douglas disagreed. \"This was the situation that we thought was the most controlled, this was the choice we made to make the most enjoyable evening for us with the least pressure. Control is what gives you privacy.\" Despite a lifetime in the limelight - as son of Hollywood actor Kirk and then as a movie star - the 58-year-old actor said he was unprepared for the huge interest in his wedding. \"I've been around this for a long time. I grew up with my father who is an actor and to tell you that I was not prepared for the attention when an actor and an actress comes together - it's tenfold. \"I wanted my wedding to be everything that my wife wanted it to be, a day of celebration and of joy to be shared with our family and our friends to let them understand the love we have together.\" Mr Douglas said he was \"completely devastated and very offended\" that Hello!, which had been involved in negotiations for the wedding pictures, acted in this way. \"The first day of being married we were thrown into a chaotic turmoil. It was a devastating time.\" The Douglases were granted an injunction preventing Hello! from publishing the sneak shots two days after their wedding but this was lifted a couple of days later."
