Could they now procure a copy of the disc, supplied by the German government to the UK tax authorities, giving information about approximately 300 British citizens with bank accounts in Lichtenstein. The first prosecution, based on this disc, has recently taken place in Germany involving Klaus Zumwinkel (a political appointee charged with the privatisation of the German post office). He lost his job, got at two-year suspended sentence and was made to repay almost \u00a32m. More than enough, I should think, to clean hundreds of moats. Paul Hewitson Berlin",
