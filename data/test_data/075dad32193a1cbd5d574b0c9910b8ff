  "content": "In a world that claims to be increasingly connected, I find most people exist in a state of almost perpetual disconnection from one another. Plugged into our electronic devices, focusing on games and entertainments and the dubious intimacies of social media, too many of us live in a bubble-world peopled by fantasies. Outside the bubble, reality becomes ever more distant, ever less real. Instead of making it work for us, we are allowing technology to take up more and more of our time. If I were in charge for 24 hours, I would reclaim some of that time. Computer games, the internet, television \u2013 everything \u2013 would be turned off for the duration of my reign. And the following things would be mandatory. First \u2013 and for the time it would take to oven-cook a frozen ready meal \u2013 everyone would have to participate in preparing and sitting down to food with at least one other person. Food and its preparation have always brought people together, and \"convenience food\" \u2013 which is often neither convenient, nor even really food at all \u2013 often robs us of the ritual of being in the kitchen together as one person lays the table; another chops the vegetables; another pours a glass of wine \u2013 instead of all being glued to our separate screens. The meal doesn't have be showy or complicated. Cheese on toast would do, or pasta, or a salad\u2013 but the participants would have to prepare it themselves, sit down at a table, with knives and forks and glasses and plates and napkins, and eat together, and talk (or not) without allowing the TV, that square-faced, yakking intruder, to make a single comment. Second \u2013 for the time that it takes to drink an overpriced coffee \u2013 during the course of that day, everyone would have to find a quiet place, \u2013 a park, a garden, a balcony \u2013 close their eyes and listen to the sounds of the birds, the wind in the trees, or water. Too often we forget these things, surrounded as we are by traffic, activity and noise. Third \u2013 and for the time it would take to leave a comment on an internet message board \u2013 everyone would have to say something nice to a stranger: ask how they're feeling, compliment them on their shoes, even just smile. Social skills need daily practice to survive, and we don't connect well with others when we're used to dealing virtually. Last \u2013 and for the time it would take to watch a TV reality show \u2013 everyone would have to sit down before bedtime and tell a story. It wouldn't have to be clever, or true, or new and original. Stories \u2013 be they our stories, or those of other people \u2013 are what connect us : they teach us how to live, to dream, to listen to one another. And if we all did these things, then maybe we wouldn't need anyone \u2013 human or electronic \u2013 to be in charge for a day, or a year, or ever again.
