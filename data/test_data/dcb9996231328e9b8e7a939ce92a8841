  "content": "The England footballer Ashley Cole and a radio DJ have received an apology and damages from the News of the World over articles published this year wrongly linking them to a \"gay sex romp\". The newspaper ran articles on February 12 and 19 that alleged that unnamed Premiership footballers and a DJ had used a mobile phone as a \"gay sex toy\". The latter piece was accompanied by a partially obscured photograph, and Cole's lawyer said he had been wrongly identified by insinuation and innuendo. Ian Thompson, or \"Masterstepz\", a DJ with Choice FM, also claimed the article would have led readers to believe that he had been involved. An apology printed on page three of yesterday's News of the World says: \"Although the photograph was pixillated some readers have understood Mr Cole to be one of the footballers and Masterstepz to be the DJ concerned. We are happy to make clear that Mr Cole and Masterstepz were not involved in any such activities. We apologise to them for any distress caused and we will be paying them each a sum in the way of damages.\" The newspaper also wished Cole, 25, \"the very best of luck\" in last night's World Cup match against Ecuador. Internet rumours spread after the original stories were published and the issue became the subject of wide discussion in web chatrooms. Many lawyers were monitoring the case as a test of how the libel laws dealt with allegations made against unnamed individuals. One issue to be determined is whether there will also be repercussions for the websites that also carried allegations of inappropriate behaviour. In March the paper's lawyers and those from the Sun warned a gay website it could face costs if they lost a libel case against Cole. Websites, including PinkNews, which were alleged to have wrongly identified Cole following their articles on the alleged bisexuality of unnamed soccer players, were contacted. PinkNews never claimed Cole was gay or had been involved in a videotaped sex act, but the site did reproduce the pixillated version of a photograph that the News of the World claimed to be of a Premiership footballer and a well-known music industry figure. The site also compared the picture to a photograph available on the internet showing Cole and Thompson. Issuing writs, Cole's lawyer, Graham Shear, said the articles were \"false and offensive\". He added: \"The newspapers knew there was no basis to name Ashley but arranged the articles and pictures in such a way that readers would identify him. There is no truth whatever in these allegations. Ashley Cole will not tolerate this kind of cowardly journalism or let it go unchallenged. \"It is disgraceful he should be faced with this kind of unpleasant insinuation and innuendo at a time when he is trying to focus on [the] World Cup and his forthcoming wedding.\" The footballer is to marry the singer Cheryl Tweedy. The footballer's lawyers attempted to use the internet while preparing their case against the News of The World. They reportedly set up a website, www.ashleycolesurvey.com, which invited people to answer a series of questions about \"newspaper articles that are of concern\". Among the questions asked was: \"Did you read any stories about a video of gay Premiership footballers?\" Google was also drawn into the controversy. The net search engine was asked to explain why Cole's name had been linked to the word \"gay\" in search results."
