  "content": "2000 January In the US, America Online merges with Time Warner; and in the UK Greg Dyke becomes 13th BBC director general, ending the eight-year John Birt era. Bolstered by a generous licence fee settlement, Dyke moves main news from 9pm to the 10pm slot vacated by ITV and allocates \u00a3115m extra a year to BBC1, a 15% increase. May Radio Authority fines Virgin \u00a375,000 for Chris Evans's on-air endorsement of Ken Livingstone as London mayoral candidate. July Big Brother ushers in a decade of reality entertainment shows after becoming an instant hit for Channel 4 with the final peaking at 9.9 million. It heralds a TV-led internet age, with live streaming. And also ensures the rise of Heat magazine, relaunched earlier in the year by its new editor, Mark Frith. BSkyB ends the year with 4.6 million subscribers while Carlton and Granada's challenger ONdigital has 1 million. Almost a third of the population have multi-channel TV. 2001 January E4 launches as a pay channel, with rights to Friends and ER. April Cond\u00e9 Nast launches Glamour magazine in pioneering \"handbag\" size, and it swiftly becomes the top monthly. September 9/11 changes everything. The dotcom bubble bursts, destroying the value of companies such as AOL, checking Yahoo's rise, and denting confidence in online investments. UK TV advertising collapses by 10%. Escapism rules \u2013 Pop Idol launches on ITV in October, making a star of Simon Cowell, and starting a global phenomenon of the rise of \"shiny floor\" entertainment. The revolutionary Sky+ service launches. Access Radio pilot experiments pave the way to a rapid spread of community radio. 2002 March ITV Digital collapses, losing Carlton and Granada \u00a31.2bn. Greg Dyke's consortium later recycles the digital proposition as Freeview, and Granada and Carlton reject opportunity to join it. Mark Thompson joins C4 as chief executive and, in an uncertain climate, opens talks with Channel Five on merger. The free Metro newspaper moves into profit. Robert Thomson replaces Peter Stothard as Times editor and the BBC presses ahead with bbc.co.uk website expansion. 2003 July The communications act creates one powerful regulator, Ofcom. The act allows US media companies to own broadcasters such as ITV, though European companies cannot own US networks. A new code of conduct hands programme rights to independent producers from broadcasters, which, together with the BBC \"Window of Creative Competition\", leads to a five-year boom in business.
