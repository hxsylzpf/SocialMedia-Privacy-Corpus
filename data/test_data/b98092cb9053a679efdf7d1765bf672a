  "content": "The newspaper world is not so very different from other professions or bodies. We are bad at seeing ourselves as others see us. We have a tendency to close ranks when attacked or interrogated too intently. We passionately believe in the efficacy of self-regulation. We reject external interventions and regulation. One way or another, we quite like the status quo. So when - as this week - someone arrives bearing bad news about that status quo it is entirely predictable that many would prefer to ignore it; and that the motives of the messenger are questioned. Some journalists - perhaps more than a few - disapprove of a continued light being shone on the actions of colleagues who systematically, and for many years, intruded on the privacy of others. Such coverage, they warn, will lead to stricter regulation or some form of privacy law. The argument is understandable, but perverse. The threat to press freedoms in this country comes not from the exposure of rogue behaviour. It comes from the rogue behaviour. Try this scenario: a prominent private company or public agency - say, the police, or security services - has paid a seven-figure sum to hush up evidence of its own criminal activities. It has furthermore persuaded a judge to seal the court papers so that the deal will never see the light of day. Is there an editor in Britain who would not seize on that story and pursue it with a righteous vengeance? Of course not. How, as an industry, could we command any public respect if we suppressed such a story when it related to our own trade? To be clear: this newspaper believes in effective self-regulation. It does not want a privacy law. It does not want further restrictions on our freedom to report on matters of public concern. It does recognise that there are occasions when the public interest pushes editors to commit acts which are deeply questionable, if not illegal. (The recent receipt of, payment for and publication of presumably stolen information relating to MPs' expenses by the Telegraph was such a case.) It believes our libel laws chill freedom of expression. It would like a more workable and open freedom of information regime. It further recognises that all these freedoms are, to some extent, dependent on each other. The libel laws will never be relaxed unless the press can offer some reassurance on privacy, and so on. So there is a direct link between rogue journalists who bring down the threat of greater regulation and the work of decent journalists - some of them on the same newspapers, or in the same companies - who pursue an honourable course in the genuine public interest. The press cannot expect to be immune from a widespread and growing public concern about access to databases and personal information, whether it be CCTV, medical records, ID cards, emails or mobile phones. In a world in which editors plead total ignorance of industrial-scale data-burglary under their noses it can hardly be surprising that wider questions are being asked about accountability and regulation. We report on page 13 a suggestion by Sir David Omand, a distinguished former securicrat, as to how intelligence agencies might operate by an ethical code for intrusions into privacy in the public interest. In a recent IPPR paper he suggested that such acts of intrusion should pass a number of tests, including: 1) There must be integrity of motive; 2) The methods used must be in proportion to the seriousness of the business in hand; 3) There must be proper authority; 4) Recourse to such methods of intrusion must be a last, not a first, recourse. They are not bad guidelines for editors. Decent journalism has never been more necessary, or more threatened by political, economic, technological and legal forces. Finding an effective form of self-regulation is an urgent requirement to enable the press to hold the public confidence it deserves and so badly needs."
