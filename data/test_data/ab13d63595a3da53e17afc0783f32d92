  "content": "Jodie Ginger, 19, apprentice business administrator, Leicester When I was at school I was worried about the way I looked. Social media didn't help, even though you knew people had changed their photos to make themselves look better. I don't spend much time on social media, particularly now I have a job. I don't like the way sites like Facebook and Twitter have become a way to bully people. When I was younger, there was a point when I was smoking and drinking and doing stuff that I shouldn't. I had gone through some negative experiences at school, and I was kicked out at the beginning of year 11, but I did get support from the Job Centre and a college, and through an organisation called TwentyTwenty. I like myself more now. Growing up through the financial crisis, I do worry about whether I'll have a job or a house when I'm 25, or be able to have a family, but I also feel I'm a bit too young to think about it at the moment. But other things worry me. I'm too scared to go abroad \u2013 watching the news and seeing stuff like terrorism and the rise of Isis, it does scare me. I don't think politicians know what our lives are like, or how the changes they make affect young people in the real world. Young people are unfairly treated by lots of policies \u2013 for instance, you're only allowed working tax credits from the age of 25, even though lots of young people earn very little. There are young people who work but really get nothing for working. Zachary Phillips, 15, London I want to be a professional tennis player, and I spend most of my time training for it. I'm an athlete, and I don't drink or smoke, but other people at school do. Tennis is everything, and I'm not really thinking about doing any other jobs. If I don't become a player, I could become a coach, so that's my back-up plan. If tennis goes well, then hopefully everything will go the right way for me, financially. I think many young people are unhappy. There's nothing for them to do. If I didn't have tennis, I don't know what I'd be doing \u2013 probably hanging around on the streets with my friends. That's the way people seem to pass their time, and you can get into trouble. My friends get stopped and searched a lot by the police, and I have been as well. It's disappointing that they would stop and search me for no reason. It's frustrating but I just get on with it. Isaac Grinnell, 16, Leeds There is definitely pressure at school. I've got mock exams starting soon, and school piles on the pressure to do well. That makes you feel nervous. Things like university fees worry me a lot because I don't know whether I will be able to afford to go, even though I really want to. Stuff like alcohol hasn't been a problem for me because my parents have always brought me up thinking it wasn't appropriate for my age. But when I'm walking to school there are lots of people smoking, and I see pictures on Facebook of people drinking alcohol. Body image affects boys too. There is pressure to look a certain way, and social media heightens it \u2013 for men, it's to be really fit and have muscles. I feel like people my age have grown up with some serious and frightening events going on around us. It's not necessarily that I'm worried that, say, I walk into Leeds and there's going to be a terrorist attack; it's more that I'm worried about how it affects other people. After the Paris attacks, I got worried about people living in Paris, and also about migrants having to flee from their country. It all just adds to the pressure \u2013 that you're thinking about them, while also trying to do your exams. Keiarnya Grant-Blissett, 20, student, Manchester While I was growing up, my mum had a lot of control over my social media and what TV programmes I watched, so I think I was protected from some of the negative aspects, but now you go on and it's: \"You need to be this if you want to be perfect.\" Social media isn't great at showing the diversity of people, and it does make you question yourself. There is so much expectation on how young women should dress, and there is too much sexualisation. But if you wear tight clothes or too much makeup, you get shamed for that as well. I live my life how I want. I took a step back from social media so I could focus on studying, but I still find there is too much media around. Sometimes when I've spent too long online I think I could have read a book, or gone out exploring. There was a lot of pressure at school \u2013 from the moment you pick your GCSEs, you feel that if you do well you'll get into college, and then you'll get into university and then you'll get a good job. But even if I do this degree, am I going to get a job? That worry is always there. My mum has always made sure we've had anything we needed, but I've seen her struggle financially \u2013 she's a carer \u2013 and it's made me want to do well so I can give back to her and make her proud. Willa Duggan, 15, Surrey There can be a lot of pressure, and I feel like the decisions we make now will have a big impact on our future lives, but generally, picturing what adulthood might be like, I feel like I don't really have a lot of responsibilities right now, and so I don't really feel like it's a miserable time. I do think about things like whether I'll be able to afford a house in the future. I would need my parents' support \u2013 it's harder for people to do it on their own. Climate change really scares me. My mum is really passionate about politics, so I learn a lot from her and I watch the news. I feel like politicians are all quite well off and have a good lifestyle, and don't really know how a lot of people live. I spend a lot of time on social media \u2013 Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram are the main ones. I feel like it's a bit of a competition. People judge you by how many followers you have or the pictures you post. It becomes a bit of an obsession to check up on people to see what they're doing, rather than getting on with your own life. I'm pretty attached to my phone. When I'm on my phone, all my friends are messaging each other and I feel like, if I'm away from it, I'm being left out. It's hard to be the person who doesn't go on it."
