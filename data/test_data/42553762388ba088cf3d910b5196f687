  "content": "The runaway popularity of photo-sharing site Pinterest, on which users mount images on virtual \"pinboards\", is generating some impressive statistics. Here's a key one: 97% of Pinterest's Facebook fans are women. Tucked among the millions of pinboards of crafts, clothes, cupcakes and cats, is there anything on Pinterest for men? Let's see \u2026 \u2022 Heineken keg R2D2 model. Typing \"Star Wars\" and \"beer\" into Pinterest's search engine seemed the quickest way to get started, but this model robot, made from a five-litre party barrel, was actually pinned by a woman. \u2022 A cool picture of a guy cycling with his bike tyres on fire. A man put this one up, natch. \u2022 Interesting knives. From a board entitled \"Sharp and pointy\". \u2022 Sheds. Mostly twee and largely pinned by women, but worth sifting through. \u2022 Very expensive trainers. Like many objects of male interest, the best of these can be tracked down just by searching for the comment \"Sick!\"",
