  "content": "David Beckham and Andy Murray are helping to promote what appears to be a YouTube trailer for an upcoming vampire film, but is in fact a clever spoof for a viral anti-malaria advertising campaign. A trailer for the \"film\", called The Hunting Moon, was posted on YouTube earlier this week. However, the trailer is part of a guerilla campaign by Malaria No More UK, which has signed up support from a range of stars and celebrities to join the wheeze and promote the film as \"social media envoys\" including Beckham and Murray. Murray, a prolific user of Twitter, tweeted recently: \"#TheHuntingMoon....good &gt;&gt; movie ... big twist at the end. Bet you can't guess the killer\", while Beckham plugged it on his Facebook page. The \"film\" has also been promoted with tweets from the Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. Sky Movies was also in on the spoof, reporting the movie looks set to be a \"mash-up of 28 Days Later, Saw and Twilight\". The YouTube trailer, which has attracted more than 35,000 views, will today be revealed as a vehicle for promoting the charity's latest campaign to raise awareness of its goal of ending deaths from malaria by 2015. A full three-minute version of the film, which was made by Red Bee Media, will run today revealing that the \"movie\" about four British students surrounded by \"invisible killers\" in Africa is, in fact, all about malaria. Beckham, a founding member of the leadership council for Malaria No More UK, appeared in a TV campaign for the charity last year. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
