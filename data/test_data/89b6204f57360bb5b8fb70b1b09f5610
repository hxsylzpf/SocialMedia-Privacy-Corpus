  "content": "Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have announced the birth of their daughter, Max, and said they will gradually give away 99% of his stake in Facebook, worth $45bn (\u00a330bn), to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative John Naughton, Observer technology columnist Mark Zuckerberg's letter makes me feel a bit queasy. The content is fine, as far as it goes \u2013 mostly unexceptionable platitudes about the state of the world and hopes for the future, with a heavy dose of tech evangelism thrown in. But it all feels like a bit of a performance. In that sense, it belongs perfectly in Facebook, because that's mostly a performative space in which people project the images of themselves that they want the world (or at any rate their friends) to see. The only difference is that Mr Zuckerberg has thousands (maybe millions \u2013 I haven't checked) of \"friends\". Once upon a time, a couple had their first child and their family and friends rejoiced within those smallish circles. But now Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have to share their joy with the whole world. I'm pleased for them, as I would be for any young couple, but really I could have done without the sermon masquerading as a coy letter to future generations. In putting on this little performance, though, Mr Zuckerberg is also conforming to another stereotype \u2013 that of the tech billionaire who has made so much money by his early 30s that he couldn't spend it if he lived to be 500. But instead of leaving it to a charitable foundation when he dies (like the Carnegies and Rockefellers of old), the contemporary template dictates that the mogul should personally disburse it while he lives. This is the Bill Gates model \u2013 in which the insane profits of running an abusive monopoly finally get spent on good causes, under the direction of the Gates family. The record so far suggests that this model has much to recommend it: the Gates foundation is focused, efficient and decisive, and it has made a measurable difference in some of the areas it decided to tackle. If Zuckerberg can do as well, then I might overlook his syrupy performance. Justin Forsyth, chief executive, Save the Children Maybe it's because so many of Save the Children's supporters join our cause at the very point they first start a family that I'm not surprised Zuckerberg and Chan have had such a big reaction to becoming parents. Loads of people start thinking about the state of the world at the moment they realise they'll be handing it on, and I don't see Zuckerberg's message as any more of a \"sermon\" than the nice notes we get when other new mums and dads set up their standing orders. The scale is obviously a bit different, though! And that's the thing about which I disagree with you most \u2013 are we supposed to like him less than other people because he's able to do more than other people? That seems perverse. Where we do agree, though, is on the impact of the Gates Foundation. For both of us the lesson there seems to be the power of focus: picking a few key issues and seeing them through. Bill and Melinda Gates have helped save millions of lives from malaria, diarrhoea and other killer diseases. If Zuckerberg and Chan can make the same kind of \"big bets\", then they'll be formidable allies for the causes they choose. Will two Facebook philanthropists save the world? Of course not. But that they're prepared to try gets a great big \"like\" from me. And if they harness the power of Facebook alongside their philanthropy, then they could have even more impact. JN I hadn't known about new parents joining Save the Children, but I do remember vividly the moment when my first child was born, and it's true that the experience definitely alters one's outlook on life. But as to whether we're supposed to like Zuckerberg less than other people because he's able to do more than other people, while charities have to be relatively agnostic about how their donors got to be rich, newspaper columnists can be more critical. Microsoft often behaved appallingly when Gates ran it. Facebook's business model is, in my humble opinion, an exploitative one. It's basically digital sharecropping \u2013 its users do all the work, while Zuckerberg and co get all the rewards. So I'm not exactly enamoured of the wealth that flows from exploiting people's personal data, which is what Facebook does for a living. On the other hand, Gates and Zuckerberg are not arms dealers, and they are relatively angelic compared with, say, John D Rockefeller, Henry Ford and Andrew Carnegie, whose vast fortunes have been put to great and humane uses over the decades since those old monsters passed away. Another interesting difference between the new moguls and the robber barons of old is that Zuckerberg and co aren't setting up old-style charitable trusts, but are operating instead through LLCs \u2013 limited liability companies. This reduces the tax breaks a charity would provide, but also frees them from the requirement to disburse 5% of the company's assets every year. And, most importantly, it gives them more control over what's done with their money. JF I don't really agree with you on agnosticism or the positive power of Facebook. I don't think most charities are agnostic about where their donations come from; we certainly aren't at Save the Children. We have clear criteria for who we work with, but we also want to harness the business and research power of companies. We don't just want cash from the private sector; we want to work with them to change how they do their everyday activities so their core business becomes transformational. We work with the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, who are transforming a mouthwash into a gel to stop newborn babies dying of sepsis when their umbilical cords get infected at birth. We have a similar core business partnership with Reckitt Benckiser Group on diarrhoea \u2013 the biggest killer of children \u2013 and they have invented two new products. For me, the lesson from Gates is not just the power of money but how Bill and Melinda Gates use their power to lever wider change. Can Zuckerberg and Chan use their money to do this too? In my view, Facebook is already a force for good. This summer, it was a hugely powerful tool to galvanise people to take action for refugees. We saw amazing DIY action from the public, whether it was people using the platform to organise a 10,000-strong \"refugees welcome\" march through London or our amazing network of parent bloggers sharing powerful posts they'd written with their children about how it \"could have been me\". You'd call that \"sharecropping\", I'd call it 21st-century activism \u2013 and it works! JN We'll have to agree to disagree about the benign impact of Facebook. What I see is a global corporation that now wields significant power in unexpected areas \u2013 like being able to manipulate its users' moods, and influence their voting behaviour. Zuckerberg is going to drip-feed his charitable venture a billion dollars at a time because his Facebook shares are preferential ones that give him total control of the company, and he isn't going to give that up any time soon. As the head of a successful and thriving charity, you have to take the corporate world as you find it \u2013 and invent ways of partnering with it to do good. And I applaud that. But as a close observer of the tech industry \u2013 and a citizen \u2013 I'm very wary of corporate power. It's always sensible to explore the motives behind the actions of corporate leaders. For example, like many tech moguls, Zuckerberg thinks that many of the world's problems will be solved by getting poor people on to the internet. (And he reiterates that belief in the letter to his daughter.) So he sets up Internet.org, ostensibly to achieve that laudable aim. But it turns out that the \"free\" access to the net that Internet.org will provide is actually access to sites approved by Facebook only. If poor people want to access the real Internet, the one outside of Facebook's walled garden, then they will have to pay. In the old days, moguls used to say that what was good for General Motors was good for America. Their successors have adapted that mantra. They think that what's good for Facebook (and Google, and Amazon, and Microsoft) is good for the world. I'm sceptical. JF I agree we should not look at global corporations or billionaires through rose-tinted spectacles. Some have done enormous harm. But people can come at global justice questions from radically different perspectives and backgrounds, and in my experience the more diverse the input, the bigger the impact. My big lesson from the last decade working in No 10 or now at Save the Children is that unusual coalitions can make truly transformational change. The halving of child deaths in recent decades is a remarkable story that wouldn't have happened without the power of the Gates Foundation and innovation from the private sector, NGOs and governments. We can't stop dangerous climate change, end extreme poverty or end child deaths from malaria and diarrhoea without everybody playing their part \u2013 so when companies like Unilever, GSK or RB step up, we should back them and when billionaires follow the lead of Bill and Melinda Gates and use their wealth for good, we should urge others to follow. The question with Zuckerberg and Chan is whether they will be new or old philanthropy \u2013 whether they use their core business combined with their wealth and power, and how they work with others to create these unusual coalitions. That's why I wish them all the best in what they are trying to do and feel it is such a fitting welcome to the world for baby Max."
