  "content": "I have a little pet theory, based purely on wild speculation and a little bit of observation: web companies are really interested in people with game development experience because games folk know how to keep audiences' attentions for more than just a click. I know, it's revolutionary. But it's proven successful for Jason Rubin and Andy Gavin, who brought the gaming world Crash Bandicoot and Jak &amp; Daxter (and don't say a word against 'em) when they created development studio Naughty Dog. The pair's latest project, a social interactive slideshow thingie named Flektor, has just been bought by Rupert Murdoch's MySpace branch less than a month after it was launched. It has nothing to do with games, folks. After landing a nice little buy-out package from Sony when Naughty Dog was purchased by Sony, the pair are set to land a cool 10-20 million USD for getting into bed with Rupert. According to TechCrunch: Rubin and Gavin have leveraged their experience with gaming to create an awesome user experience at Flektor. I imagine $10,000,000 is a lot more than most game developers will see in their lifetimes. Will a surge of interest in gaming's interactivity lure more games bods away from their dev kits and into Web?"
