  "content": "Anyone who's been surfing the web, listening to the radio or reading this website over the last few months cannot have failed to notice the enormous explosion of people using social microblogging service Twitter recently. There are already a number of Guardian sites and sections using the service to connect with users as well as provide updates about what they're working on, thinking about or publishing, such as: @mediaguardian @commentisfree @lifeandstyle @guardiantech @guardianfood You'll also find a lot of our journalists, editors, production and technical staff on there, if you know where to look (and we'll be publishing a list, to help, soon). But we've also recently created a Twitter stream - @GuardianVoices - specifically to highlight community activity on the theguardian.com. The brainchild of some members of our community team, the GuardianVoices Twitter stream means that moderators, journalists, subs and editors across the site can now bring attention to the interesting conversations, insightful (and/or witty!) comments, interactive events, curious questions and thorny threads they come across, including user-initiated topics in Guardian Talk (now in its tenth magnificent year, by the way, and well worth exploring) as well as blogposts and articles in all corners of our content areas. Some recent highlights we've spotted include: Books blog commenters anthologise the best of each other's poems from the 'poster poems' series Does the Internet spell the end of Literary Culture (with capital letters), as many talk to many? Lively debate here Our Deputy Money Editor was online answering your questions on the pension crisis from 1230 - 1330 on 23 March Guardian user DarkMoonRising remembers the miners' strike and makes a plea for a broader green movement, alive to class GuardianTalk users cast their minds back to remember what life was like in 1993 You can tune in by following @guardianvoices on Twitter - and please do let us know if you've spotted any interesting conversations or comments worth noting.",
