  "content": "Katie Hopkins has found herself in the middle of a fresh social media storm after tweeting a joke about the name of a sick child featured in a charity appeal on The X Factor. The Apprentice star and Sun columnist posted her message after 10-year-old Kaychanel Willson, who has had 25 operations and suffered from MRSA, appeared in an appeal for Great Ormond Street children's hospital during Sunday's show. Hopkins tweeted: \"Kaychanel has enough on her plate without me adding to it. Could have been worse. KayEsteeLauder.\" Any Beveridge from Aberdeen tweeted: Katie Hopkins now making fun of an ill child ... no 'ill-timed' excuses, just plain cruelty\". Donna Whitelaw from Glasgow added: \"So after making that joke after the Glasgow crash. Weasel Katie Hopkins has now mocked a sick child!!!! Nasty piece of work!\" The controversy follows outrage over a tweet Hopkins posted on 30 November about Scottish life expectancy: \"Life expectancy in Scotland based 07/08 birth is 59.5. Goodness me. That lot will do anything to avoid working until retirement.\" The tweet sparked outrage among social media users, coming the day after the Glasgow helicopter crash, and Hopkins later apologised for the timing of the message. On Monday, the Daily Star threw its support behind a petition urging TV broadcasters to ban Hopkins from TV, which has reached nearly 90,000 names. \"As rent-a-gob Katie Hopkins struck again this weekend \u2013 hurling her latest 'joke' at a sick child \u2013 we are encouraging readers to sign the petition banning her from TV,\" it said. The online petition read: \"On the 30th of November 2013, Scotland was still in shock and trying to come to terms with a horrible crash that took the lives of innocent people. Within 24 hours of this happening Katie Hopkins posted vile remarks on Twitter about how long the people of Scotland live for. \"This is unacceptable and distressing to those who lost friends and family. \"We the undersigned are sick and tired of ITV and Channel 5 giving her airtime and want her banned from all TV shows on your channels such as This Morning and The Wright Stuff. \"This woman is nothing more than an attention seeker who does not deserve to be a celebrity.\" ITV said in a statement that it had \"no plans for Katie to appear on This Morning at this present time\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
