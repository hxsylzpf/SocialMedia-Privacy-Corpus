  "content": "Newspaper editors should have been cautioned for allowing their journalists to employ investigators to obtain private information illegally, the information commissioner was told in confidential legal advice revealed for the first time at the Leveson inquiry. Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry into press standards was told on Monday that a barrister advised the Information Commissioner's Office in 2003 there was a strong case against those journalists under the Data Protection Act. \"Having regard to the sustained and serious nature of the journalistic involvement in the overall picture, there could be little doubt that many, perhaps all, of the journalists committed an offence,\" the ICO was told by counsel, in written advice read out on by the Leveson inquiry QC Robert Jay. \"It seems to me ... that several editors must have been well aware of what their staff were up to and [were] therefore party to it.\" The legal advice was sought after the ICO in 2003 had seized material from Steve Whittamore, an investigator who worked for dozens of newspapers and magazines, which showed he had been paid to provide them with home addresses, phone numbers, car registration details and copies of phone bills. \"The evidence of involvement in systemic and often unpleasant offending is, in my opinion, clear enough in very many cases and it would be appropriate to caution identified journalists and their editors,\" the unnamed barrister wrote. Counsel to the ICO advised that an informal caution by letter, with a suitable selection of heavily edited evidence attached, should achieve the intended aim of stopping such activity. He also told the ICO it might be necessary for it to provide him with an explanation for any decision not to purse this option against journalists or editors as \"I many need to explain or even defend the decision to the judge\". Whittamore was prosecuted and imprisoned in 2005. The ICO obtained the names of reporters who apparently commissioned work from him but journalists did not face any action. The ICO revealed that more than 300 unnamed journalists from 17 newspapers and magazine had regularly used Whittamore's services in a 2006 report, What Price Privacy?. The Daily Mail was top of that list in terms of volume of work and other titles that had employed Whittamore included the Sunday People, Daily Mirror, Sunday Times and the Guardian's sister title the Observer. Alex Owens, the ICO's senior investigations officer from 1999 to 2005, told the inquiry last week that former deputy information commissioner Francis Aldhouse had told him in a March 2003 meeting that the newspapers were \"too big\" to take on. Owens was back before the inquiry on Monday. However, in his own evidence to the inquiry on Monday, Aldhouse insisted he had not taken that view. \"Not only do I have no recollection of saying that\", he said. \"It simply isn't the sort of thing I would say \u2013 and indeed, as I say, it does not reflect my view of \u2013 or indeed my previous practice of dealing with \u2013 the media.\" He insisted his advice on whether to take action against newspapers had not been sought by Richard Thomas, who was information commissioner at the time. \"I have no recollection of being asked 'did I think we should bring proceedings',\" Aldhouse said. He added that was a decision for Thomas, who is due to give evidence on Friday. \"I don't fear the media,\" Aldhouse added. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
