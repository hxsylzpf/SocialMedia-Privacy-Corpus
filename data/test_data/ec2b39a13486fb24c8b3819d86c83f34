  "content": "Many claim that we live in Orwellian times. There are spycams on every street corner. The war on terrorism increasingly looks like a \"war without end\". The government uses the politics of fear to keep us in our place. It seems that Eric Blair's nightmare has become the stuff of Tony Blair's (and now Gordon Brown's) New Britain. Yet many overlook the real Orwellian strain in contemporary society. It is not the CCTV cameras or bulging databases that make Britain Orwellian - rather, it is New Labour's taste for intruding into our personal lives. The most terrifying thing about the dystopia of Nineteen Eighty-Four was the Party's management of people's relationships with each other, and its attempts to replace the human emotions of spontaneity and passion with conformity to a soulless etiquette. Something similar is happening in Britain 2007 - yet this very real Orwellian outburst is ignored by those who bang the drum for liberty. Orwell depicted a world in which personal relationships were smashed apart and reconstituted as relationships between the individual and the state. \"We have cut the links between child and parent, between man and man, and between man and woman,\" boasts torturer O'Brain: \"No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer.\" New Labour is instituting a similar tyranny of distrust. Its Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 - a Stalinist piece of legislation that requires the 10 million adults who work with children to undergo criminal records checks - transforms what were once relaxed relationships between groups and individuals into relationships managed and monitored by the state. Even the dad who coaches a kids' soccer team on Sunday mornings, or a mum who organises school runs in her 4x4, will have to regularly submit to a background check by the suspicious state. In treating every adult who comes into contact with kids as a potential deviant, the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act implicitly educates young people to regard adults with caution. As the Mayor of Oxford, Jim Campbell, said of the Act: \"We are in danger of creating a generation of children who are encouraged to look at people who want to help them with suspicion.\" We have cut the links between child and adult. New Labour tramples on the sacred terrain of family life, too. It uses parenting orders and compulsory parenting classes to \"re-educate\" feckless mums and dads. And it has set up a National Parenting Academy (a Ministry of Parenting), in order to, as the Home Office puts it, \"nip antisocial behaviour in the bud\". In short, the government must play in loco parentis to the nation's children, by developing what it calls a \"parenting workforce\", because real parents cannot be trusted to turn out well-behaved, model citizens - or \"child heroes\", as conformist brattish children are described in Nineteen Eighty-Four. In the discussion about \"fetal ASBOs\" - the government's attempt to determine which unborn children will become criminals in the future - we see Orwellianism run riot: here, ideas of pre-crime meet the state's desire to police even fetuses. Even Orwell's Party waited until people were born before it put them on the conformism treadmill. New Labour has cut the most intimate link of all: that between mother and fetus. Orwell's Party had an intense suspicion of spontaneous, emotional relationships. The Party's aim was \"not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control\", but to eradicate the \"sex instinct\" altogether. New Labour fears the sex instinct, too. Its safe sex campaigns - which long ago crossed the line from polite advice into moralistic hectoring - seem designed to dampen lust. In the Department of Health's latest disgusting TV ads, young men and women are shown in the throes of passion wearing Y-fronts and knickers that say \"chlamydia\" or \"gonorrhoea\" on them. The message is clear: sex is dirty and dangerous. Think twice; wear protection; practice caution; do not give in to your sex instinct. New Labour's plethora of legislation on \"personal harassment\" and \"stalking\", now so broadly defined as to be meaningless, brings passionate relationships under the watchful eye of the state. And the unstoppable rise of codes of conduct in workplaces and colleges, which dictate what we can say to each other and even what tone of voice we should use, has killed off flirting and sexual banter. In Nineteen Eighty-Four, the Party turned children into instruments of government policy. Indeed, \"it was almost normal for people over 30 to be frightened of their own children\". New Labour is moving towards recruiting child spies, too. Last year it introduced the first speaking CCTV cameras, and launched a competition in schools to find \"socially conscious\" children to provide the hectoring voices on the day the cams were launched. The Respect Taskforce (the Ministry of Respect) said this was about \"encouraging children to use their pester power in a positive way\". A government report has proposed urging schoolkids to educate their parents about eco-living, in order to bring about a \"cultural shift\" in the attitudes of the population. In Orwell's dystopia, the Party implores everyone to keep fit. Winston Smith always wakes to a \"grim\" reality: he has to \"join in compulsory exercises following the instructions given by a woman from the telescreen\". New Labour is likewise obsessed with telling us to exercise, what to eat, whether we should smoke or drink. Government bodies also regulate our behaviour through the issue of climate change; they enforce compulsory recycling and cajole us into living meek, austere lives. Indeed, if there's one \"war without end\" that is used to justify rationing, restraint and repression today, it is not the war against terrorism but the war against global warming. The government, supported by an army of slavish greens, evokes images of future doom in order to lower our expectations and keep us in our place. The spying technology was not the scariest part of Orwell's nightmare vision. Rather it was the Party's hostility towards emotion and desire, and its interventions into every corner of people's private thoughts and personal lives, that marked it out as terrifyingly new and tyrannical. And so today, we might do better to focus less on New Labour's hi-tech spying, or even its anti-terror legislation, and more on its deep distrust of private life and loving relationships. \"They can't get inside you,\" Julia tells Winston Smith when they start their illicit (non-safe sex) love affair. Let us stop New Labour from getting inside us, too. For more blogs in the Liberty and the state series, click here."
