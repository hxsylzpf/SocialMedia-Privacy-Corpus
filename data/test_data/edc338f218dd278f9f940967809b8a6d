  "content": "Last month, in our rolling TwiTrip series, we went to Bristol, where for an entire day our reporter's actions were solely inspired by real-time advice from Twitter users. He hung out in record shops, had an agreeable lunch, stared into arty space in galleries, supped pints in a few nice pubs, then rounded the evening off with a gig. All in all, not a bad day. Today we're off to Birmingham - home of the Balti, the new Bullring, Black Sabbath (back in the day) and Bourneville. Not to mention lots of contemporary art spaces. But we'd really like your help in finding some of the good stuff that's out there - places, views, entertainment or anything that could make up the perfect day out in Brum - so join us on our day trip to the city and let's get the tips rolling in. Follow our reporter Sarah Turner, send tweets and find out more about her TwiTrip at twitter.com/sarahturner. Please start the tweet with @sarahturner and, if possible add #Twitrip to it."
