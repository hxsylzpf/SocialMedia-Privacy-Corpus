  "content": "The Conservatives today expelled a leading young activist from the party after he boasted about dressing up as the missing five-year-old Madeleine McCann at a new year party. Caroline Spelman, the Tory party chair, expelled Matthew Lewis after it emerged that he had discussed plans to wear a blonde wig, \"pink pyjamas, a teddy bear and a vial of fake blood\" to the event on his Facebook page. Other figures from the organisation left messages on the Facebook paghe, with one responding: \"Is this a cunning (Baldrick style) plan to obtain the reward money?\" Spelman described the behaviour of Lewis, a member of the party's Conservative Future youth wing, as \"completely unacceptable\". \"This offensive behaviour is not only shocking but intolerable and completely unacceptable,\" she said. \"There is no place for this sort of person in the party.\" The \"swift and appropriate\" decision to oust Lewis was welcomed by Clarence Mitchell, the spokesman for Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann. Mitchell said Lewis's actions were \"almost beyond belief\" and called on him to apologise. \"I know Gerry and Kate will be grateful that the Tory party has taken swift and appropriate action by ejecting him, he said. \"His actions are not only disgraceful in themselves, they will also cause great hurt to Kate and Gerry. I feel it is appropriate that he now apologises both privately and publicly to them. It is a complete disgrace that Madeleine's name and image should be made fun of in this way.\" Lewis \u2013 believed to be in his early 20s and a student at Queen Mary University of London \u2013 resigned as chairman of Staffordshire CF last month in protest at internal reforms. Images on the group's website show him campaigning with David Cameron for last year's Crewe and Nantwich byelection. Lewis was not answering either his mobile phone or his emails today, but most of the exchanges were still visible on his Facebook profile. Page snapshots showing other comments were featured on the Tory Bear blog. On New Year's Day after the party, Lewis told another CF member, Flick Cox, online: \"There was a brief moment when I thought I might have gone too far with elements of the costume, but it was OK.\" He added that another guest at the party was dressed as Baby P, the toddler who died after a catalogue of horrific abuse. \"There may not be photos, I don't think anyone wants to risk being associated with them!\" he wrote. Cox suggested he may have \"pulled a Prince Harry\" \u2013 a reference to the royal's controversial decision to wear a Nazi uniform to a fancy dress party in 2005. She said she would \"hate to have to end our friendship when I become an MP\" if he got into trouble over the fancy dress outfit. Madeleine McCann went missing while on holiday with her family in Portugal in May 2007. She has yet to be found despite a huge worldwide hunt."
