  "content": "Technology is advancing more rapidly than ever these days, but these advances bring new meaning to a variety of common human experiences, particularly death. For example, there are one billion or so people around the world who now have an online presence -- a collection of status updates, tweets and connections, stored in the cloud. This prompted journalist Adam Ostrow to ask a philosophical question: What happens to your online personality after you've died? Could it ... live on? What does 'life' and 'death' mean when we can live 'forever' digitally? What do you think of this? My initial reaction is this view of humanity's future appears to be rather cylon-like. But realistically, I think that we've a looong way to go before making this a reality. I mean, just look at that amusing time-waster, that can be my next tweet, and the hilarious but spamalicious stream of nonsensical tweets that it generates by recombining your existing tweets. Granted, ThisCanBeYourNextTweet operates under a simple algorithm, but I am wondering if it is even possible to capture even one human personality using a computer? It seems there are far too many connections, memories and experiences, both old and new, along with the underlying psychology and brain structures, neuropeptides and hormones that contribute to and affect \"personality\" ... the essence of what an individual is. To successfully capture a human personality in a computer, it seems that we have to first understand the human brain and mind, and this insight doesn't seem like it's going to happen anytime soon. But beyond the scientific, psychological and technical complexity required to \"capture\" a human personality digitally, there's also the related question: is it worth doing? If so, why? Which humans are \"worthy\" or \"deserving\" of being preserved digitally? I guess this technology would be extremely expensive, so should we only digitally preserve the personalities of rich people? If we decide to preserve the personalities of humans who can benefit society, who would pay for that? What constitutes a benefit to society? Further, is it possible to \"murder\" a digital personality? .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. IfIDie.net and 1000memories were specifically mentioned in this video, but a quick internet search shows there are dozens of similar sites out there that you might wish to check out, too.
