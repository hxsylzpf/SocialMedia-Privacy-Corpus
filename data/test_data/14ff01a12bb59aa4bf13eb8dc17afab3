  "content": "So, anyway, how's that support contract from Microsoft for your company's web server running IIS looking? Because you might need to call on it. According to Brian Krebs on the Washington Post's Security Fix blog, \"hundreds of thousands\" of Microsoft web servers have been hacked. Among those claimed to have been seeded with malicious code are some run by the UK government. And the United Nations. Though we're more concerned about the UKgov ones. (Further details below.) The weakness is being used to seed sites with malware which will get installed on visitors' machines - perhaps by the IFrame method. How? Through a vulnerability in IIS, acknowledged by Microsoft last week (\"Vulnerability in Windows could lead to escalation of privilege\" - in other words, if someone figures this out, they rule your boxen). Is it widespread, Microsoft? Apparently yes, affecting Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and all supported versions and editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. F-Secure, which has a very solid reputation in the security community, reckons that more than half a million servers have been hacked. F-Secure's quick explanation of the exploit: It finds all text fields in the database and adds a link to malicious javascript to each and every one of them which will make your [ hacked] website display them automatically. So essentially what happened was that the attackers looked for ASP or ASPX pages containing any type of querystring (a dynamic value such as an article ID, product ID, et cetera) parameter and tried to use that to upload their SQL injection code. Microsoft's advisory does include a workaround. Let's hope that everyone, especially in uk.gov, is using it. Krebs's conclusion: These types of attacks that infiltrate legitimate, trusted Web sites are precisely the reason I so often recommend Firefox over Internet Explorer. There is a great add-on for Firefox called \" noscript,\" which blocks these kinds of Javascript exploits from running automatically if a user happens to visit a hacked site. Currently, there is no such protection for IE users, and disallowing Javascript entirely isn't really an option on today's World Wide Web. True, you can fiddle with multiple settings in IE to add certain sites to your \"Trusted Zone,\" but that option has never struck me as very practical or scalable. So, now, which UK (gov) sites? Using searches suggested at F-Secure suggests that Faststream (a Cabinet Office service) and the Civil Service Recruitment Gateway were affected, but my own checks just now suggest that script is gone. Among non-government sites, Powerhouse Fitness has noticed and taken its pages down; Greenfield School in Surrey hasn't (just emailed them); nor has the Faroe Islands Tourist Board (with their \"diffirent experience\" - and diffirent dicktionary?). I hope the reasons for my not linking to the sites is clear - I can't be sure that the malware really is gone, so don't want to put people in harm's way. OK, so let the games begin with \"IIS has more holes than Swiss cheese\" stuff. Kneejerk, certainly. More important, why don't companies protect better against SQL injection, which is now a standard mode of attack? Is it just the law of large numbers - that with Windows so widespread, you'll get people who've never heard of an SQL injection attack looking after them? The strings to search for (at present) are nmidahena.com, aspder.com and nihaorr1.com. If the page pulls in code from there, you've got trouble. There's a good explanation at hackademix, including everyone's favourite XKCD cartoon (\"little Johnny tables, we call him\" - if you don't get the joke, you'll not follow how this exploit works.) (The image? It's what seemed nearest to appropriate when I did an image search for \"fail\" on theguardian.com. Why do you ask?) Jack adds: Microsoft's Bill Sisk has now commented at the Microsoft Security Research Center. He says: \"our investigation has shown that there are no new or unknown vulnerabilities being exploited. This wave is not a result of a vulnerability in Internet Information Services or Microsoft SQL Server. We have also determined that these attacks are in no way related to Microsoft Security Advisory (951306).\" Instead, he points developers to a page from 2005, How To: Protect From SQL Injection in ASP.NET. There's a similar comment on Bill's IIS blog."
