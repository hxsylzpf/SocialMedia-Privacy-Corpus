  "content": "David and Victoria Beckham's former nanny is willing to offer interim undertakings over the couple's legal bid to prevent her making further allegations about their marriage, the high court heard today. Mr Justice Eady was told that Abbie Gibson was also prepared to \"hold\" the \u00a3125,000 she received for a story that appeared in the News of the World last weekend. Mark Warby QC, for 27-year-old Ms Gibson who is on holiday in Spain, emphasised that any undertakings were an arrangement \"to hold the ring\" pending a possible further application by her to be relieved of the \"prohibitions which are being sought\". Hugh Tomlinson QC, for the Beckhams, who were not at the London hearing, said that undertakings made in an open letter received today \"more or less\" covered the confidentiality aspects of the injunctions sought. Mr Tomlinson said the couple were seeking to restrain disclosure of confidential information and to freeze the sums obtained from the newspaper. \"The position is that we accept that the substance of the injunctions that we seek will be covered by way of undertakings from the defendant but there are one or two points we are still debating.\" Mr Warby said that one question in dispute was whether it was legitimate for the Beckhams to seek \"to shut the stable door after the horse had bolted\". He added that the injunctions sought included a prohibition by which the couple sought to \"bring down the shutters\" on any statement of any kind by Miss Gibson which related to them. It covered taking or providing any photographs or film footage, providing any information, making any comment for the purposes of publication, giving any interview, writing any article or book, appearing in any TV programme or film concerning the couple or any person, firm or company associated with them. Last weekend's News of the World story came after the Beckhams' lawyers failed to secure a last-minute injunction on the basis that Miss Gibson was in breach of a confidentiality contract. They argued that her contract included an obligation not to speak about the Beckhams' private lives. But Mr Justice Langley ruled that the newspaper could publish. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
