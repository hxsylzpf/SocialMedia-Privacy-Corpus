  "content": "A lawyer acting for the EastEnders star Chris Parker has fired a warning shot across the bows of the Sun after the paper reported he had been rushed to hospital after attempting suicide. Jonathan Coad, a partner at law firm Simkins, has written to the Sun and sent a copy of the letter to the Press Complaints Commission, warning the paper not to intrude on his client's private life. But he has not yet made a formal complaint over coverage in various papers about the actor's private life following a Sunday Mirror story last weekend. \"We've dropped a line to the PCC about this,\" Mr Coad said. \"I have drawn their attention to it - it's a softly, softly approach in these circumstances. \"My client makes the decision, and my client's in hospital. Firing a shot across the bows of the Sun is to try to reduce intrusion to a minimum.\" Mr Coad has also acted for Spectator publisher Kimberly Quinn, who last week had a complaint of intrusion against the Sunday Mirror rejected by the PCC. The commission also ruled that an earlier request from lawyers for journalists to stop approaching her could not last \"in perpetuity\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
