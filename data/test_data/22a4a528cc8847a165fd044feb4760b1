  "content": "When New York-based start-up Datacoup set up shop in June 2012, it had a question it wanted answered: if companies can make tonnes of money from gathering and trading people's information, why can't those individuals gain from it too? After receiving $565,000 in seed funding and spending two years of development, the company believes it has found a solution, and officially opening its personal data marketplace to the general public on Thursday. It gives people the chance to make small sums of money from their information, whilst knowing exactly how all those details of their existences are being used. Datacoup is taking on the big data brokers and aggregators of the world, such as Acxiom, Datalogix and Epsilon, who mass harvest personal information, analyse it all and sell their findings on, all without affected parties knowing a thing. Their often-secretive activities have caught the attention of global regulators: in May the US Federal Trade Commission said Congress should force brokers to be more transparent and give consumers greater control over their data. Co-founder of Datacoup, Matt Hogan, believes the market is worth as much as $15 billion, but says his young firm is going disrupt the industry, make it more honest and bring that figure down to below $10 billion. Datacoup is actually going to acquire revenue by doing something similar to those aggregators, but in a wholly transparent way, only collecting and analysing the information users agree to give away through its website. The average user can expect to make around \u00a35 a month ($10 is the most anyone can earn for now), though they don't have to do very much to get the dosh. Unsurprisingly, privacy advocates loathe those surreptitious brokers and approve of what Hogan is trying to accomplish. \"Companies have been profiting from selling our data for decades, yet other than the use of free services we have seen no benefit of that,\" says Emma Carr, director of the Big Brother Watch. \"This service [Datacoup] will give the public a much clearer idea about just how valuable their information is, which will inevitably lead to people being much more discerning about what information they give up about themselves and to who. From a data protection standpoint that can only be a good thing.\" How to sell your data Having been part of the beta programme (and made a whopping $8 in the process), your reporter was delighted to see the same simple, intuitive interface in play. As soon as a user is logged in, they are given a guided tour, which will introduce them to the three pages related to their account. First, there's the main account page, where the user selects which online accounts they're happy for Datacoup to extract data from. These include Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Instagram, Tumblr, Last.fm and Meetup, which lets people easily organise meetings around special interests. It's also possible to share transaction data from credit and debit cards. Datacoup promises to do so securely and sharing this information will be rewarded with higher earnings. The Account page lets Datacoup members get a better understanding of what specific information is being taken from each account and why it is of value. Finally, the Market page shows who is buying the data and when. None of the information users submit can be directly linked back to a specific person, though giving away gender, hometown and date of birth might give some indication of who an individual is. Indeed, anyone who got hold of such data could, if they so desired, find the related person. Once the user has selected the data they are happy to relinquish control of, they can logout, sit back and wait for the money to come in via PayPal. It's that simple and there's no need to go back unless users want to turn the info taps on or off. Can it work? Matt Hogan, co-founder of Datacoup and a former bonds salesman who was at Lehman Brothers when it went bankrupt at the start of the crash, believes many want to regain control of their information and how it's used. He says as many as 15,000 are set to use the service from launch. \"We're going towards a world where users have control over their data\u2026 this is the first step,\" he says. \"We think it's the consumers right to utilise their data as they see fit.\" He thinks those data aggregators making billions from the details of other people's lives will soon see a decline in their revenue, once users are more aware of what's happening and demand more transparent services. Hogan also thinks Datacoup will have more reliable datasets as they're coming straight from consumers, rather than the disparate sources that aggregators rely on. That means purchasers will also ditch the old guard, he claims. \"Their data is really dogshit data [compared to our] data\u2026 It's not looking good for data harvesters who are giving nothing back.\" Yet he admitted Datacoup itself is having to pay users right now, as no data purchasers were ready to roll at launch. \"We knew we'd have to get to certain thresholds before purchasers would commit,\" he told the Guardian. \"The beta did not really provide a large enough data set.\" Hogan claims as many as 20 data purchasers have shown a strong interest and he expects a handful to join in the coming months. As soon as they're signed up, users will see their names appear on the Market page and whether they've bought data or not. More than money may be on the table too. Data purchasers will be able to exchange offers, such as vouchers or free goods, in return for people's information. A sad fact of internet life... Though Datacoup does have ostensibly altruistic aims, it isn't likely to eradicate secretive data brokering practices on its own. By extension, it won't give the masses much more privacy. \"In some ways I think sites like this are inevitable \u2013 it's a sad fact of life that despite the various regional regulations governing data protection, the global nature of the internet means that once your personal data is in the wild it will be used, so why not get paid by others who would wish to use your data?\" notes Professor Alan Woodward, of the computing department at the University of Surrey. Yet data brokers are clearly facing a backlash, whether from regulators, companies like Hogan's or privacy-conscious citizens. If governments are convinced to enforce controls on the industry in favour of openness, if similar services to Datacoup are launched in response and those concerned individuals jump on board, it's likely privacy will get a significant fillip on a global scale."
