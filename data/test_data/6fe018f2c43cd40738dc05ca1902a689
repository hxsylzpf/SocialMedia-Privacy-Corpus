  "content": "I have had my differences in recent years with The Sun's (and News of the World's) legal eagle Tom Crone. That has never blinded me, however, to his extraordinary qualities as a lawyer. I think it's fair to say that his skills are appreciated by other newspaper office lawyers too. He is recognised as a champion of press freedom and does all he can to ensure that some near-the-knuckle stories are published. Unlike some office lawyers I have known he is also passionate about his role, as his piece in today's Sun, Hypocrisy of TV star who runs to lawyers, illustrates. Aside from being a full-frontal assault on Jonathan Ross, it raises questions about where to draw the line on intrusions into privacy. Here's the burden of his argument: \"Jonathan Ross is a serial litigant. Get anywhere near his private life and you're likely to hear from m'learned friends... This week he published a book about his life which called for respect for privacy. 'I feel some things are best kept to yourself,' he writes, adding he feels sorry for people subjected to kiss 'n tells. This is the summit of hypocrisy. Anyone who read the transcript from Russell Brand's Radio 2 show will see it was Ross who led his young friend across the line into abuse and gratuitous intrusion into the privacy of Andrew Sachs and his granddaughter. It's interesting someone who hates kiss 'n tells should egg Brand on by shouting: 'He f****d your granddaughter.' Since Mr Ross is so keen on consulting his lawyers, perhaps he should ask them to explain what the laws on privacy and harassment mean. He might find it would moderate his behaviour and keep him out of this sort of mess.\" I'm with Crone, of course, on the Sachs episode. It was disgraceful and unacceptable. It certainly intruded into the privacy of the granddaughter, Georgina Baillie, and arguably Sachs too. I'm also with Crone when he points to Ross's sometimes absurd legal actions against newspapers. For example, in April 2006 Fleet Street editors were informed that solicitors acting for Ross were contemplating suing papers for a breach of privacy because photographs had been taken of Ross playing tennis with David Baddiel. Then again, consider the case of Sienna Miller, the actor who has launched a privacy action against the photographic agency Big Pictures. Her complaint is that her life was made intolerable by the actions of the paparazzi. She argues that she was continually harassed by photographers and I know how distressing that can be. To those who are not in the public eye (and who would love to be) it might seem like a small price to pay for fame. But not being able to step outside without having a camera poked into your nose is unduly intrusive. So it's possible that Ross's tennis complaint was merely the last straw at the time. In other words, to return to Crone's argument, every case has to be dealt with on its merits because each one comes down to proportionality. If a celebrity is stalked by the paparazzi at what point does it become intrusive? Is there a genuine public interest reason for the photographic hounding? Crucially, has the celebrity been guilty of intruding into his/her own privacy by courting publicity and speaking candidly (for money, possibly) of his/her private life? Furthermore, given the Ross-Brand incident (and some modern chat shows and phone-in spoofs), is it not the case that celebrities themselves seem increasingly keen to intrude into the privacy of other celebrities? How should we handle that? The details will always differ in every case. There cannot be hard and fast rules to cover every instance. But we should not be fooled into believing that all celebrities should be regarded as fair game. I sincerely hope that Crone agrees with me on that point."
