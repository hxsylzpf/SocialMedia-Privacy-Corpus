  "content": "So, that's it sorted, then. We cancel big government IT projects, kick out the consultancies and bring in Google, and let citizens manage their own data. Result: more responsive services, less public spending on computers and more privacy for citizens. And a final goodbye to the long, painful saga of public sector IT fiascos. This, roughly, is the picture of the future of government IT emerging from the Conservative party and associated thinktanks. Labour's identity card and the NHS care records service in England have long been Tory hate targets. David Cameron seems to have added the whole IT-based transformational government programme to his little list. Last week, shadow immigration minister Damian Green described the programme's ambition for shared databases as \"highly sinister\". Green's assertion that transformational government is \"toxic to our basic freedoms\" will be challenged by those who say there is a basic freedom in the right of disadvantaged individuals to access public services without having to become experts in bureaucracy. Philosophers will recognise in this debate a contest between negative and positive liberty, with the government trying to enforce freedoms, such as automatic enrollment for free school meals, whether we want them or not. Such a debate about transformational government's underlying philosophy is welcome. It's also long overdue - as Green tacitly admitted in his speech, the Tories initially missed the significance of the programme \"which has understandably not grabbed the tabloid headlines\" in the four years since its launch. Also welcome is the need to end what Green calls \"the dominance of suppliers which has led to the plethora of big government IT schemes\". Instead, as this column has long argued, we should be more creative and open-minded about how we provide public sector technology, looking to what Green calls \"localist and individualist solutions\". However, one such solution to emerge from Tory circles (via the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank) is not well thought-through. This is for personal electronic health records, held on free web services such as Google Health and Microsoft HealthVault, to replace the NHS electronic-care record service. While I have doubts about the Google and Microsoft offerings, which raise questions of confidentiality, the idea of individuals taking control of health data is a fine one. But any hope that personal records can replace the need for NHS computers is moonshine. NHS professionals and institutions must keep their own detailed records for legal and auditing reasons. The NHS has a legitimate claim on anonymised data for planning and clinical research. All these would be imperilled by fragmentation. Green remarks critically that the Department for Work and Pensions' Customer Information System is one of the largest databases in Europe. Short of dismantling the welfare state, what's the alternative? Is he proposing to split it into county-sized systems? Actually, there could be something in that idea. The Conservatives run many local authorities, including England's largest, Birmingham, which was several years into its own IT-based transformational government scheme when they took control. Glyn Evans, corporate director for business change, says the city's plan to create a joined-up view of citizens' data is compatible with Tory philosophy because people will be asked first if they want to take part. That seems a good model for transformers of all political colours to follow.",
