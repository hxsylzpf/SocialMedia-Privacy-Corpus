Mashable has been planning a major expansion beyond the US for some time, with the UK and London its second largest audiences by country and city. Blathnaid Healy, a former multimedia journalist with Irish broadcaster RTE, has been appointed UK editor. Tim Chester, digital editor for Rough Guides at Penguin Random House, has been appointed deputy editor. The senior executives of the UK team are rounded out by Ben Maher, advertising director, previously agency director at mobile commerce business Weve. \"As media and technology continue to shape the international landscape, it only makes sense that Mashable expands in order to continue to thrive within the intersection of these spaces,\" said Pete Cashmore, founder and chief executive of Mashable. \"With an already strong international readership, we at Mashable are excited to continue growing our team in London.\" The London office will open next month. Mashable said its London-based audience has grown 47% year-on-year, with traffic from the UK rising 42%. \"Mashable's expanded presence in London will allow us to better serve our international advertisers by offering them tailored solutions for a more authentic Mashable experience,\" said Seth Rogin, chief revenue officer of Mashable. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
