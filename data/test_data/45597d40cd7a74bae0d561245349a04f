  "content": "Tweeters and bloggers have been having enormous fun this morning at the expense of the Daily Telegraph. People have been exercised enough to post - some seriously, many facetiously - about the front page juxtaposition of a royal picture and an unrelated headline, on a tragic story, just below it. The picture and headline clash is amazing, said one Twitter user, whose tweet was then re-tweeted scores of times. Another saw it as an hilarious layout clanger while others tweeted about it being \"a classic\" or \"golden\". Yet another tweeted: \"OMG, severe failing by this morning's Telegraph.\" Really? Some of the remarks are sort of amusing - the three witches of Windsor, for example, or the notion that Camilla looks as if she is wearing a tracksuit top - but I always find these kinds of criticism of editorial placement underwhelming. I wouldn't think the editor, Tony Gallagher, is going to lose much sleep over it. So tweet on if you must. PS: For those readers in the US, and elsewhere, who cannot identify the women in the picture, they are, from left to right: Queen Elizabeth, her daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall, and the wife of her grandson, the Duchess of Cambridge."
