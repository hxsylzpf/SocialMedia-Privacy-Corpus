  "content": "In August 2009, alongside the traditional coverage of Japan's general election, a group of PhD graduates and engineers began analysing online discussion about the election to try and identify any connection between the buzz and the final outcome. The result? In most constituencies, the most high profile candidates won the seat. The team at Tweetminster, which, unsurprisingly, aggregates and curates various Westminster-related tweets, will be doing the same for the forthcoming UK election. Initial results based on 2m tweets predict either a small Labour majority or a hung parliament. Photo: ktylercronk/Flickr/Some rights reserved Data is selected from consitiuencies with a candidate that uses Twitter, the most frequently mentioned constituencies and marginal or high-profile seats. Tweetminster says it doesn't want to compete with the traditional polling companies, but rather work out, by the time the results are announced, quite how accurate social media is as a predictor of the results. To date 376 constituencies are represented on Twitter, and based on a first-past the post count, results are as follows: Labour 35% Conservatives: 34% Liberal Democrats: 22% Others: 9% In Parliamentary terms, that gives Labour a 14-seat majority, or, allowing for the same margin of error as the Japanese project, a hung parliament. Not great news for the Tories, but then is Twitter's userbase inherently liberal? Tweetminster also reports a decline for SNP support in Scotland, while the Liberal Democrats are generating more supporting some key marginal seats in the South-West. Interestingly, this may be because the LibDems have a higher proportion of MPs using Twitter than the Tories. As you would expect, campaign activity is most intense in marginal seats including Derbyshire, Luton, Manchester and in Brighton and Norwich where the Green Party is performing strongly. (Disclosure: In a personal capacity I have endorsed Green Party candidate Caroline Lucas.) A grading of the most influential MPs on Twitter (and excluding the Prime Minister), Labour's Tom Watson came out top followed by Nick Clegg of the LibDems and Conservative Eric Pickles. The top ten: Tom Watson, Labour - West Bromwich East Nick Clegg, Liberal Democrats - Sheffield Hallam Eric Pickles, Conservatives - Brentwood &amp; Ongar David Miliband, Labour - South Shields Douglas Alexander, Labour - Paisley &amp; Renfrewshire South Jeremy Hunt, Conservatives - South West Surrey Harriet Harman, Labour - Camberwell &amp; Peckham Ed Balls, Labour - Normanton Vince Cable, Liberal Democrats - Twickenham Louise Bagshawe, Conservatives - Corby We'll be watching to see whether Tweetminster's predictions change as election discussion evolves, and ultimately how accurate their predictions are."
