  "content": "A movie trailer in which you see no images save a brief pixellated mugshot of Jesse Eisenberg is a brave movie trailer. But I'm rather liking this teaser for David Fincher's Facebook film, The Social Network. Partly because it could be some sort of elaborate viral spoof \u2013 after all, the script has been doing the rounds online for yonks, and it wouldn't be hard to mimic a few lines of preppy, techie dialogue, nor rip a pic of Eisenberg. I like, too, the way they cheerlead your thoughts about Mark Zuckerberg right from the start \u2013 \"Punk! Genius! Prophet! Traitor! Billionaire!\" yell the caps as doomy brass plods away in the background. I like it most, though, because this sort of small-room sweaty chat vibe seems to suggest Fincher is harking back to the days of Zodiac. Dare we dream that Benjamin Button really was just a blip?"
