  "content": "Twitter, which has brought the public some of its most beloved public arguments \u2013 including Taylor Swift v Nicki Minaj and BoB v Neil deGrasse Tyson \u2013 has played host to another great face-off: Kanye West and fellow rapper Wiz Khalifa. When West announced that his upcoming album would be titled Waves rather than Swish, Khalifa claimed he'd stolen the name from Harlem rap artist Max B. \"Please don't take the wave,\" he tweeted. After various tweets about Max B and waves, Khalifa added: \"Hit this kk and become yourself.\" West didn't handle seeing the initials of his wife, Kim Kardashian, in the tweet well. He proceeded to post a plethora of responses lashing out at Khalifa. \"Your first single was corny as fuck and most there after,\" he tweeted. Khalifa explained: \"KK is weed fool. Reason's why your not wavy. Go bacc to Swish.\" But West continued. He has since deleted his Twitter rampage. He moved on from insulting Khalifa's music to attacking his family. \"You let a stripper trap you,\" West tweeted, referring to Khalifa's ex-wife and West's ex-girlfriend Amber Rose. He later made reference to Khalifa's son with Rose: \"I know you mad every time you look at your child that this girl got you for 18 years.\" West continued to mix insults and self-praise for a while. He did throw in the occasional compliment, stating he thought Khalifa dressed cool, adding: \"I wish I was skinny and tall.\" But West quickly turned his compliment around in his next tweet, with the characteristic thought: \"Maybe I couldn't be skinny and tall but I'll settle for being the greatest artist of all time as a consolation.\" West ended his Twitter rant with a thank you for the extra promotion for Waves. He explained that he loved the world and \"all I want is peace and positive energy\". His final tweet, aimed at Khalifa, apologized for the earlier confusion. Too bad his ex-girlfriend Rose wasn't feeling too forgiving."
