  "content": "Amid the flurry of excitement over Rupert Murdoch's tweets on Scottish independence and Page 3, let's not overlook his most surprising tweet of all - about Piers Morgan. In what amounts to a gratuitous insult to a man he once appointed as an editor, Murdoch tweeted: \"Piers Morgan seems unemployed after failing to attract any audience in US. Seemed out of place. Once talented, now safe to ignore.\" It followed an ingratiating tweet by Morgan an hour before: \"Love @rupertmurdoch's Twitter feed.\" Clearly, the former editor of the News of the World and the Daily Mirror was expecting a rather more friendly response and lamented the \"safe to ignore\" insult by tweeting: \"Thanks @rupertmurdoch ... I was actually paying you a compliment! I really do enjoy your Twitter feed. But never mind...\" After hundreds of retweets of Murdoch's comment, and other people weighing in on Twitter to abuse Morgan, he tweeted pathetically: \"At least @rupertmurdoch still follows me - so I don't feel completely ignored.\" Some 10 hours after his insulting tweet, Murdoch apologised to Morgan by tweeting: \"Did not mean to hurt Piers Morgan. Piers a friend and a legend.\" For the record, Murdoch appointed Morgan to edit the NoW in 1994. After intruding into the privacy of a woman undergoing treatment for an eating disorder in a clinic Morgan was publicly admonished by Murdoch. He left to edit the Mirror soon afterwards. He then left the Mirror under a cloud in 2004 after publishing hoaxed pictures of British soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners. Morgan became host of a CNN chat show in 2011 until March this year. He is now a free agent."
