  "content": "Copyright claims against the regional newspaper publisher Newsquest/Gannett are increasing because its journalists are publishing photographs without checking their provenance. So bad has the problem become that the company's editorial development director, Toby Granville, has circulated a memo across the group's 215 titles warning editors to beware. It includes a set of guidelines drawn up by Newsquest's head of legal, Simon Westrop, on how to operate within the law. In his memo, Granville writes: \"Copyright claims against Newsquest are growing exponentially and are bringing real cost to the business in every region.\" And Westrop tells editorial executives that they should \"ensure\" that all their editorial staff have read and understood his guidelines. As a first step, he demands that photographers are identified in captions and \"if the source is unknown, you must say so\". He continues: \"Investigations are underway to determine how editorial systems can be developed to allow better recording of rights and licensing information.\" Westrop's advice states: \"Unless you are satisfied that we own the copyright or we are licensed for the particular use you are contemplating, or there is a legal defence available, or there are other special circumstances (which you should discuss with your editor), then don't use it.\" He is especially exercised by the use of pictures found online: \"Never simply find a picture on Google (or elsewhere on the internet or from any other source) and use it to illustrate a story without first considering whether you have the lawful right to use it or a sound legal defence... \"There are plenty of free stock pictures available \u2013 for instance, www.pixabay.com is a source of copyright-free stock pictures for commercial use not requiring attribution.\" Although he doesn't mention Facebook specifically, the staffer who leaked the memo to me said the \"borrowing\" of pictures from the social media site had engendered several complaints. Westrop writes: \"If you are sourcing a picture on social media, try asking for permission to use it first if that is practicable. \"If the picture you have found on social media is something for which you are unlikely to get permission - eg, it relates to someone who has died or been convicted of a criminal offence, or the person you have asked for permission does not respond - be aware that just taking it regardless comes with a risk.\" Westrop notes that there are \"possible defences in law... but there is no general public interest defence to copyright infringement.\""
