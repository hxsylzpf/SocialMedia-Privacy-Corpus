  "content": "The phone-hacking scandal, the Royal Wedding, the death of Osama bin Laden or even a television appearance by Justin Bieber \u2013 none of these events or people can compete with the Women's World Cup final. At least not in terms of Twitter use. The women's final may have made history as Japan defied the odds to defeat the USA and lift the trophy for this first time, but the game in Frankfurt also broke records on Twitter as the most tweeted event in the social networking site's five-year-history. Twitter confirmed that the dramatic end to the women's final, as Japan equalised with three minutes of extra-time remaining and went on to win on penalties, produced a record 7,196 tweets per second (TPS). Clearly in the mood, Twitter users then set a new second-place total with 7,166 TPS during the climax to the Copa Am\u00e9rica quarter-final between Brazil and Paraguay. The technology website Techcrunch reports Sunday's matches as surpassing the previous record, set on New Years Eve in Japan in 2010, which hit 6,939 TPS at its peak. The devastating earthquake and tsunami which hit Japan in March peaked at 5,530 TPS while the 2011 Super Bowl between the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers saw 4,064 TPS. Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding in April produced 3,966 TPS at its peak. Of course, due to Twitter's exponential growth - Techcruch report 600,000 new users signing up daily \u2013 more recent events are clearly going to lead to a greater number of tweets, but regardless the Women's World Cup final has its place in social networking history. For now at least."
