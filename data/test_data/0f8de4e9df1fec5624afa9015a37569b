  "content": "So what is \"the public interest\"? Philosophical tangles don't come much knottier in a world where this defence of journalism's essential freedom is always under siege. Remember last week's T-Mobile scandal, where staff illicitly sold customer details to rival mobile operators. Is stopping such scams in the public interest? Enter (at the Society of Editors conference) a reassuring Christopher Graham, ex-BBC News managing editor turned national Information Commissioner. Telephone tapping in News of the World mode? Done with since the Press Complaints Commission acted in 2007, Graham thinks. The problem now is crooks peddling stolen data for profits so fat they make the old Data Protection Act fines seem puny. He wants prison sentences of up to two years thrown in. Journalists' hackles rise at this. There's an exception for \"legitimate and responsible\" reporting on offer from the Ministry of Justice, a new defence under Section 55 of believing that \"obtaining, disclosing or procuring\" protected data was necessary in the public interest. But how many half-finished investigations would warm a cold judge's heart? And Joe Public might ask the question the other way round. Why should he be harassed by salesmen using protected data when papers espousing the public interest could help him by choking off this dodgy trade? There: is that tangled enough?"
