  "content": "When you communicate your NGO's work, are you building on the ignorance and romanticism of poor countries or challenging it? This was one of the key thoughts that came out of The Development Element report released last month by Georgetown University and how-matters.org. With supporters growing tired of poverty porn, the sensationalism of poverty, there is a clear need to re-evaluate how development organisations effectively deliver information about their work to the public. Kony 2012 was hugely popular because of its black and white, us vs them perspective. But while effective at pulling in supporters, most development organisations would struggle how to portray any one of their issues in such simple terms. Challenge-style campaigns like the no make-up selfie and ice bucket have also taken off, but similar campaigns with a clear ask haven't. \"[Kony] was not the reality of how social, political, and institutional change works anywhere,\" says Jennifer Lentfer, one of the report's authors. \"Global issues like poverty and hunger are incredibly complicated and representing these issues' inter-related contributing factors is even more difficult within the public's short attention span. \"When organisations are still under pressure to bring in the fundraising dollars, how are we enabling people in wealthy countries to relate and connect to issues in the global south without eliciting pity, guilt or shame?\" The increasing number of mediums you can deliver your message has also made the job of the communicator more difficult. More violent imagery on 24-hour news channels and adverts openly trying to pull on viewers' heartstrings has also left the public desensitised. So how can communications professionals paint a fuller picture of the realities of people's lives? Is there a difference between development and humanitarians comms and what can they learn from each other? And finally, as has already been debated on this site, does complexity help tell the global development story?
