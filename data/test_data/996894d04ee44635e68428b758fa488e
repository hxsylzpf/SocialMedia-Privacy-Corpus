  "content": "People who share personal information online undermine everyone else's right to privacy, according to Dr Kieron O'Hara, senior research fellow at the department of electronics and computer science at the University of Southampton. Those naughty internet users! They're to blame for invasions of privacy. Or are they? Dr O'Hara states, \"If you look at privacy in law, one important concept is a reasonable expectation of privacy. As more private lives are exported online, reasonable expectations are diminishing. When our reasonable expectations diminish, as they have, by necessity our legal protection diminishes.\" No doubt O'Hara's first line of attack would be bloggers such as myself, but saying that those who share intimate details online are to blame for the erosion of privacy is like saying newspapers are to blame for etching their words onto people's eyeballs and causing blindness. Humans will always be interested in reading/learning about other humans' lives, whether via websites, or via printed papers: curiosity is the human condition. Divulging personal information on the web does not make one accountable for privacy laws. As Marshall McLuhan once said, \"the medium is the message\". It's not the content that has moved the goalposts of our privacy, rather, the way in which we've come to use technology. If O'Hara wants to attack the blurring of boundaries between public and private, why not criticise those who allow their every purchase of household goods to be known (Nectar, Tesco Clubcard holders); or who allow their spending habits (and credit scores) to be tracked (ATM and credit card users); or those who allow their information from the electoral register to be used by marketing firms? Hey, if they didn't opt out, they're to blame for all the junk mail that's sent to them, right? Just because one medium \u2013 the internet \u2013 appears to attract more headlines about its supposed effect on privacy, it doesn't mean that other areas in life are less responsible for any loss of privacy we might experience. Of course, there are serious moral and ethical issues concerning the loss of online privacy. Facebook has frequently been accused of revealing, by default, personal information about its users; the company recently changed the privacy settings for all its members. Its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, claims that privacy is no longer a \"social norm\", and that people no longer have an expectation of privacy online; but maybe that's just as a result of 350 million people using the service: they've become indifferent to sacrificing their privacy in exchange for the gains they receive. Perhaps, in our rush to embrace the digital era, we've voluntarily, albeit unwittingly, forfeited any privacy protection we had. Every social networking site we sign up to involves another profile, more uploading of information, further chipping away of the private block, shaping it into the public one that's on display. But is this such a bad thing? Is it not a fair price to be paid by the dramatic improvements in communication, connectivity and socialising, gained by embracing the online medium? We may be sharing more, but we're gaining more too. No longer the forum (no pun intended) merely for chat, the web \u2013 and social networking in particular \u2013 offers people the chance to connect (Facebook, Twitter, Bebo, MySpace); share pictures and videos (Flickr, Qik); find out who's in town when you're passing through (Dopplr); get book recommendations (GoodReads); listen to great music (Last.fm); get motivated to run a particular path/distance (Daily Mile); cook a delicious recipe (Bake Space); find hints on keeping fit (Spark People); knit something nice (Ravelry); or find who is doing something local in your area (Smugly). We're social beings: social networking allows us to explore what comes naturally to us \u2013 sharing and connecting with others. As O'Hara says in a recent paper, Lifelogging: Privacy and Empowerment with Memories for Life: \"The privacy argument is clearly real, but it must be offset against the empowerment of the individual.\" We may have lost some privacy in our embrace of advancing technology, but what we have gained from it, both personally, and in society as a whole, is worth much, much more.",
