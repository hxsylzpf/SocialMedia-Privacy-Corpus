  "content": "Age: 27. Interested in: Women. Political views: Monarchist. Location: Las Vegas. Status update: \" \u2026 is a very naughty boy!!!\" Let me guess. Prince Harry's Facebook page. Or is it? I don't know. Is it? Could be. You're being very coy. Care to elaborate? Oh OK. Basically, yes: we think we've found Prince Harry's private Facebook page \u2013 but we can't be sure. Why not? Because a) it was closed down this week, after Harry was photographed playing strip billiards in Las Vegas. And b)? It was listed under the name \"Spike Wells\". What makes you think it was Hazza? Well, his nickname is Spike. Apparently even his bodyguard calls him that. And Wells? It's a homophone of Wales, which is Harry's surname. Gotcha. Any other clues? Plenty. Spike's birthplace was listed as Maun, Botswana \u2013 where he and his ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy once holidayed. And? And Spike is a Facebook fan of Walking with the Wounded, a charity heavily supported by Harry. Uncanny. Is there a killer blow? Yes. One of Spike's profile pictures showed a redhaired youngster, accompanied by the caption: \"Oh my god. I'm ginger!\" Prince Harry's hair is strawberry-blond. QED. I know! Meanwhile, Spike was friends with many of Harry's real-life bezzies, including Arthur Landon, multimillionaire son of an arms dealer. This chap sounds charming. And also very naive: young Arthur has posted some compromising pictures of someone who looks the spit of Harry. What's Harry doing in them? He's, er, asleep on the beach \u2013 to put it mildly. And underneath, Landon has written: \"The perfect start.\" To what? To their recent and much-documented tour of the Caribbean and the US. The Caribbean? Yes, they went there first. To Richard Branson's Necker Island, in fact, where much fun was had by all. Evidence? Landon again. Below a photo of his holiday inventory, he writes: \"2x flip flops, 3x board shorts, 8x fancy dress outfits, 1x toothbrush, 1x toothpaste, 10x awesomeness \u2026 Let the good times roll, let em roll, let em roll!!!\" Do say: \"Is that Prince Harry?\" Don't say: \"Or is it the Naked Rambler?\""
