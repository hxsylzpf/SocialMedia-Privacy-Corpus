  "content": "Monday's Twitter storm in a teacup comes courtesy of Zane Lowe, who some felt dissed Beyonc\u00e9 on the BBC Glastonbury coverage immediately after her Sunday night headlining turn. In his defence, his outburst of laughter and admission that he went to watch Queens of the Stone Age when invited to comment on Knowles' performance could have been prompted by a producer screaming in his earpiece to get to the next VT, following co-presenter Lauren Laverne's extended eulogy to the Bootylicious one. Lowe later tried to make amends on-air and on Twitter. But the BBC appeared to be taking no chances, swiftly benching him for Jo Whiley for a post-match interview with the R&amp;B star, following an awkward farewell exchange with Laverne \u2013 complete with excruciating \"small fist bump\" between the pair. However, a BBC spokeswoman assures Monkey that Zane was due to leave then anyway - he said he had transport pre-booked to \"race home to see the boys\", a reference to his children. The final indignity? According to Mail Online, \"Radio 1 DJ Zane Jone [sic] churlishly refused to comment on her set... and caused outrage of Twitter\"."
