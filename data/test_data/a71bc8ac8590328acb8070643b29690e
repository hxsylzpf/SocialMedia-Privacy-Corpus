  "content": "The former deputy editor of the News of the World, Neil Wallis, acted as an unofficial adviser to a succession of Met police commissioners and helped Lord Stevens secure the top role in 2000, the Leveson inquiry has heard. Wallis described on Monday how he gave advice on an ad hoc basis on policy and strategy to three police chiefs at the force going back to the mid-90s when Lord Condon was the Metropolitan police commissioner. When John Stevens was applying for the commissioner's job in 2000, Wallis was at hand throughout, telling him he would improve his chances if he fashioned himself as the \"copper's copper\" and a \"man of action rather than rhetoric\". \"I advised Lord John Stevens throughout the application and interview process in which he was ultimately successful,\" Wallis said. \"I recall having a number of discussions with him on the subject of his candidature. My input in this process was that he would be well advised to emphasise that he was a 'copper's copper' or 'thief taker' \u2013 in other words he was a man of action, rather that rhetoric.\" He added: \"He was a consummate professional in his role as a police officer and had been for number of years who was, therefore, highly respected in this role.\". The 60-year-old former newspaper executive is one of the key witnesses of this phase of the Leveson inquiry into press ethics. Last summer Wallis was arrested in relation to phone hacking and it transpired weeks later that he was paid \u00a324,000 by Scotland Yard to work as a two-day-a-month consultant. That contract was cancelled less than six months before the launch of Operation Weeting \u2013 the second investigation into phone hacking at News International. He told the inquiry he was not surprised to land the PR contract in 2009 \u2013 all it meant was he was getting paid for advice he had been giving for free for years. At the Leveson inquiry on Monday, he told how had first met Stevens in 1997 when he was introduced to him by Dick Fedorcio, the head of press who resigned from the Met last week over questions related to the award of the PR contract to Wallis. At the time the police were suffering from the fallout of the MacPherson report into the Stephen Lawrence investigation and Lord Condon's ending of a \"jobs for life\" policy. Under questioning, Wallis described the arrival of Stevens as the \"opposite of a perfect storm, a perfect sunburst\" because his views chimed with those of the Sun where he was then deputy editor. He told Leveson that his advice during his candidature \"grew like topsy\" and that Stevens would use him as a sounding board for non-operational matters. Wallis also told the inquiry into press ethics how Stevens was \"anxious to widen his circle of acquaintances\" and how he introduced him to Lord Alli, the former chairman of Chorion. \"Lord Alli's is an old friend of mine so I introduced him and they got on very well,\" said Wallis. The former deputy editor of the now defunct Sunday tabloid was recalled to the Leveson inquiry to give evidence for a second time to answer questions on his relationship with five senior Met figures. Striking a confident note throughout, Wallis appeared relaxed and at times mischievous in his answers. He recalled how Stevens successor, Lord Blair, was very unhappy that the News of the World had given his predecessor the title \"The Chief\" and told him so on a visit to the paper's offices in Wapping. According to Wallis, Blair told him: \"I don't know how you can call him 'The Chief'; he's not the chief anymore, I am.\" Robert Jay, counsel to the inquiry, put it to Wallis that the newspaper didn't like the new commissioner and had done this to be \"provocative\". Wallis said: \"No, not me,\" as he turned grinning to Lord Justice Leveson and then to the public gallery. He later added: \"Mischief is a significant component of tabloid newspapers.\" Wallis told Leveson that Blair wasn't interested in the views of the tabloid or mid-market press and agreed that his failure to establish relationships with senior editorial figures was partly responsible for the negative reporting about him. But he denied that the News of the World or the Sun were responsible for his resignation. He put this down to Blair's \"arrogance\" and to the broadsheet papers. He said Blair was out of touch and recalled how the former managing editor of the NoW called him following an interview and told him the moment he learnt of the innocence of Jean Charles Menezes, who was shot by anti-terrorist police post 7/7 bombings in 2005, as \"like a Houston, we've got a problem\" moment. \"Ian Blair couldn't have rescued himself from the press by buying us drinks and being friendly,\" said Wallis. Wallis was also questioned about Met chief Paul Stephenson who succeeded Blair. When he arrived he \"made it plain to him that I thought John Stevens's relationship and attitudes and policies towards the media were more successful than Ian Blair's was.\" Wallis who is also due to be questioned about his controversial \u00a324,000 a year PR contract with the Met described himself as an expert in his field and somebody who police commissioners could learn a lot from. When he picked up the contract in 2009, he was used for \"crisis management\". \"That was my value to them,\" he said. He taught them about the \"rhythm\" of newspapers and that if a story hadn't broken by the weekend \"it's over\". At one point he interrupted Jay to make his point about being an expert who justified the contract more explicit. \"I'd been at deputy editor level for 20-odd years. This is what I do. I understand newspapers, and I understand mass market newspapers and that's a particular area of expertise.\" He said the relationship with the Met was two-way and the press industry as a whole benefited because he was able to offer the \"police perception\" of matters as input into the Press Complaints Commission's code of practice as he sat on the editor's code committee. \u2248 The former deputy editor also vented his frustration when asked about the appointment of his daughter Amy to a post at Scotland Yard. He said it was unfair her privacy was being invaded when everyone involved in the process of selecting for a \"dull\" junior clerical role was cleared by an Independent Police Complaints Commission inquiry of wrongdoing. Wallis quoted an email from Martin Tiplady, the Met's former human resources director, stating that senior figures at Scotland Yard, including two who referred his daughter's case to the IPCC, had referred family and friends for work opportunities with the force. \"So I'm a bit raw on this issue. You can beat me up as much as you like, frankly \u2013 you've given me 300-odd name checks so far in this module [of the Leveson inquiry], you've asked me all sorts of questions. \"But when my daughter gets pilloried, when you have an email that says the two senior people to John Yates did exactly the same, I'm still wondering whether you should have asked Catherine Crawford [the chief executive of the Metropolitan Police Authority] or Tim Godwin [the former deputy commissioner] the circumstances of their children.\" \"Catherine Crawford and Tim Godwin are the people who referred this to the IPCC and yet they have done it themselves.\" Lord Justice Leveson said he regretted the \"upset\" caused to Wallis's daughter. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
