  "content": "New year resolutions can start very early this old year by popular acclaim, or revulsion. Three weeks ago, the Guardian's Hadley Freeman nailed her pet hatred: \"If I read one more so-called news story featuring the words 'Stephen Fry' and 'Twitter' in breathless proximity, I may have to start up my own TV reality show simply to have a sufficient canvas on which to self-destruct.\" Since when Steve has tweeted his disgust for Carter-Ruck, slammed Jan Moir, thought much more kindly of her, abandoned Twitter because someone was horrid to him, and cancelled his abandonment because 900,000 wittering twitterers allegedly begged him to stay. Frankly, Hadley, can self-destruction wait until 1 January?"
