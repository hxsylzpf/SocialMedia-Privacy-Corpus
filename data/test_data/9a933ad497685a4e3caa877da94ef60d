  "content": "Catherine Zeta Jones today told the high court that \u00a31m was \"not that much\" for her and her Hollywood actor husband Michael Douglas. The stars, who are taking celebrity magazine Hello! to court over an alleged invasion of privacy, are adamant that the fact they were not paid for the six unauthorised pictures that appeared in the celebrity magazine, was not the issue. Rival magazine OK! had paid \u00a31m for a series of authorised photographs, but the pictures they published were chosen by the Hollywood couple and everything remained within their control. In a light-hearted exchange, James Price, QC for Hello!, said he was sorry to say his own wedding photographs had not sold for \u00a31m, to which the smiling star quipped: \"I can understand.\" She continued: \"I get well compensated in my job and my husband has had a long career, financially successful, and it is a lot of money maybe to a lot of people in this room, but it is not that much for us.\" She told the court she had gone to great lengths to keep her wedding as private as possible, while at the same time giving the public a small glimpse of the wedding in which they were so fascinated. Ms Zeta Jones told the court: \"I went to great lengths to retain the privacy of my wedding dress and the cake, which was of a personal design.\" She said that unfortunately the location of the wedding was published in a newspaper before the guests were informed. Mr Price reminded her that what the case was about was the privacy of what was published in Hello!. She replied: \"I understand that is part of the case, but I think that I have a right to have that privacy, the right to have my wedding the way that I wanted to have it and not have a different person's interpretation of it and show it in a light that I did not want it to be shown.\" Ms Zeta Jones added that an official photograph was released because she and her husband did not want people to feel they were being \"shunned\". She said: \"Everybody was desperate to see something.\" Asked to look at a copy of Hello! containing the photographs at the centre of the case, she described one which featured her father - who \"was a very proud man that night\" - as \"very offensive\". Another made everything look as if it was \"doused in bad disco lighting\". Mr Price asked if she found offensive a picture showing her husband feeding her a piece of wedding cake. Again to laughter, she replied: \"Yes. I did not want my husband shoving a spoon down my throat to be photographed... It looks like all I did was eat. It is offensive and it is obviously a stolen photograph.\" She told the court it was not all about control but about \"being able to let my hair down, do whatever I want, have the security of privacy in my own wedding and not have the stress and angst that happened after the wedding\". Ms Zeta Jones added: \"I'm allowed to have that and I don't think anybody can argue about that.\" She said she was entitled to choose the images she wanted and not have them snatched \"and the whole conspiracy that happened after to get them in so quickly\". Mr Price referred to a wedding photograph in the Sun headlined \"Catherine Eater Jones\", showing her being given a piece of wedding cake by her husband, to which he said she had \"taken some objection\". Counsel asked if she had been teased at school. The actress answered: \"Not particularly.\" Mr Price said the headline was simply a tease and suggested she had the sense of humour to deal with it. The actress replied: \"At this point I had no sense of humour.\" The case continues."
