  "content": "As a \"tech-savvy\" parent (I write about video games, for heaven's sake), I was probably slightly less perturbed by the revelation from Ofcom's consumer survey that six-year-olds understand more about digital technology than 45-year-olds. I actually think that's incredibly positive. My own sons (aged six and eight) had the latest gadgets to hand from birth, due to my inability to put anything away. Their inquisitive, sticky fingers were smearing mashed banana all over iPad screens and Xbox controllers before they could talk. There have been many occasions where I've sat in my home office happily slaughtering enemies in Call of Duty only to turn around and find my boys staring open-mouthed from the doorway (\"Daddy, what are you doing?\"). Now games like Minecraft and Terraria are part of their daily lives. They text their nan, they download apps, they can take a photo and make it a smartphone wallpaper. That's all fine; they are going to need that level of digital literacy to survive \u2013 that's what I tell myself. But there are some elements of my digital lifestyle that I'd rather protect them from; some routines I hope don't become inveterate to them. I mean, imagine if their daily lives started to work like mine \u2013 a digital obsessive with a compulsive need to share everything. They wouldn't just be able to go out into the garden for a casual kickabout \u2013 they'd need to set up a live stream over Twitch, with ongoing commentary \u2013 then edit the funny bits into a YouTube video, promoted via Twitter. Playing hide and seek in the park would involve GPS tracking. I'd think I had geo-located one of them, only to find that he'd attached his smartphone to a squirrel. I don't want to deliver their bedtime stories via a series of Snapchat mimes. What if the prevalent digital culture made it into the classroom? I don't mean educational iPad apps, that is already so pass\u00e9; I mean the way that we (and by that I mean I) now consume information \u2013 in stuttering land drops of meaningless pacifying garbage. Soon, every lesson will have to match the alleged ideal length of a YouTube video \u2013 between three and three and a half minutes. Teachers will be kept in a central staff room until summoned into the class by pupils via a tablet-based \"lesson on demand\" app. During the course of the session, students will just wander out or leave damning error-strewn comments on the blackboard. Lessons will have titles like \"The 26 best historical plagues\" or \"This archduke was assassinated in Sarajevo \u2013 I couldn't believe what happened next\". I fear a future in which my kids will have to learn everything through the medium of comedic cat videos. My life is a constant quest for better, more efficient social media solutions; the consumer technology life cycle has turbo-charged to such an extent that Moore's Law feels like a geological era. Childhood probably shouldn't be like that. Childhood is about gradual discovery. When my sons are old enough to, you know, have \"that talk\", I don't want \"that talk\" to be delivered via an app, with an Ask.fm link. My formative romantic experiences were at school discos with Careless Whisper playing. That experience cannot be fully replicated by searching for Wham! on Spotify while booting up Tinder. Digital media is by its very nature invasive \u2013 information used to want to be free, now it wants to own you. I love the fact that my sons can use a tablet computer; but I don't really want it to use them.",
