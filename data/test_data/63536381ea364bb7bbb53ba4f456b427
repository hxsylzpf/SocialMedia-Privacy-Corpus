  "content": "A job that offers free rent for six months in exchange for posting photos to Instagram and tweeting sounds like every cash-strapped millennial's dream. That's what the Vue, an upscale apartment complex in Cleveland, Ohio, is proposing for one prospective tenant who will also be its social media ambassador. \"Imagine if your job required you to do yoga, swim and grill, focus on wellness in a deluxe two-story exercise room, relax in the garden, get your car washed, host parties and make gourmet meals courtesy of food delivered from Miles Farmers Market,\" says the job advertisement on the Vue Beachwood Facebook page. Payment is free rent for six months in a one-bedroom apartment that normally costs $1,700 a month, a $50 monthly grocery stipend from Miles Farmers Market, which delivers to the complex, and a parking space. Utilities are not included. Property manager Brittany Perez, who will select the ambassador, said tenants at the Vue should have a \"full lifestyle in one building\". Apart from living in the free apartment, the ambassador can participate in the \"lifestyle\" by swimming in a heated pool and relaxing in the courtyard. The ambassador is expected to contribute daily tweets, and multiple Instagram posts and at least one blogpost a week. He or she is also encouraged to contribute to the resident e-newsletter, help coordinate events and participate in them, and develop relationships with other Vue residents. \"Whoever gets this job has to be able to get straight to the point and wow us,\" Perez said. Candidates also must provide their name, age, current address and links to all social media accounts. A perusal of #HireMeVue \u2013 created by the apartment complex as part of its vetting process \u2013 reveals several tweets and Facebook posts from hopeful candidates."
