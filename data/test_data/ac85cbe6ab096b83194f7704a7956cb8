  "content": "The unveiling of a new football sponsor is usually a momentous moment for the team and its fans. For Blackpool South FC Under-15s it was a less than glitzy affair when it turned out the advertising tie-up had been struck with the, er, Tripe Marketing Board. The Daily Mirror reports that the TMB popped out of the woodwork after the team appealed on Twitter for \u00a3500 in sponsorship \u2013 probably not enough to entice a Coca Cola or McDonald's. \"Rivals have been saying we will be rubbish, the lads will be keen to prove they are not tripe,\" quipped manager Paul Adams, seemingly unaware his first comment on the deal was a put down of his new sponsor. \"We may not have the cachet of an AON or Emirates, but we are pleased the deal was done,\" said level-headed TMB chairman Sir Norman Wrassle. No word yet on an ad strapline to back the deal, how about: \"Tripe a day helps you work, rest and play?\".",
