  "content": "Prince William, who turns 21 later this year, is expected to give his first interview to Peter Cox, editor of the Glasgow-based Daily Record. The coup follows a seven-month campaign by Cox to gain greater access to the prince, who is studying at St Andrews university. Like other newspapers, the Daily Record has an agreement with St James's Palace that it will not intrude on the lives of Princes William and Harry until they have completed full-time education, in return for official photo opportunities and access. However, there is a feeling among newspaper editors - expressed recently by the News of the World editor Andy Coulson - that the palace has not kept its side of the bargain. \"I deserve it. I'm the one who's led the campaign to try to get St James's Palace to shift its position,\" Cox said. \"William is being very selective about what he's doing.\" Cox said that the interview - which will be pooled among all Scottish newspapers at the end of May - will focus on Prince William's time at St Andrews and his experience of Scotland, although he hopes to touch on other issues. He added that the Record's fellow Trinity Mirror title, the Daily Mirror, will not be included in the pool. \"The Daily Record is the market leader up here. Where we go people tend to follow. We've been extremely good and played absolutely fair,\" Cox said. \"There was a deal on the table and William is 21 in June - he's a man by any standards,\" he added. \"The deal that was brokered by the PCC [press complaints commission] was that if we and other newspapers keep off his tail there will be photo opportunities and opportunities to make contact with the prince. They've not kept their side of the bargain,\" said Cox. Cox has met Prince Charles' press secretary, Colleen Harris, at least twice to discuss the interview, and expects to receive a full briefing from St James's Palace when he returns from holiday in a couple of weeks' time. Coulson lambasted St James's Palace for failing to keep its side of the bargain over access to the young princes when giving evidence in March to a parliamentary inquiry into privacy and media intrusion. His complaint came just two days after the News of the World published a set of unauthorised pictures of Prince William walking down a street in St Andrews.",
