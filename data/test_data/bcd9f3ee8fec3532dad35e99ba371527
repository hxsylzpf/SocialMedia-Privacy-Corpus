  "content": "Twitter has reinstated the banned BlackBerry and Android apps, UberSocial and Twidroyd, after a weekend in the sin bin for privacy and trademark violations. The popular UberMedia-owned apps were suspended on Friday for a number of serious-looking policy violations affecting \"a large number of users\". UberMedia estimates its apps have \"millions\" of users. \"These violations include, but aren't limited to, a privacy issue with private Direct Messages longer than 140 characters, trademark infringement, and changing the content of users' tweets in order to make money,\" Twitter said on Friday. The $10bn-valued company really did pull no punches. UberMedia's polished apps were allowed back into the ecosystem on Sunday night. Twitter said: \"We've given the developers of twidroyd and UberSocial for BlackBerry (formerly UberTwitter) access to the Twitter API again. \"Our initial review indicates that steps have been taken to remedy the violations for these applications.\" The Bill Gross-fronted company, which is reportedly close to adding TweetDeck to its formidable roster, has every right to feel aggrieved by Twitter's short shrift. Gross claimed that the ban \"completely took us by surprise\" and that Twitter \"didn't raise [the issues] before\" \u2013 despite Twitter's insistence that it had been speaking with UberMedia about \"policy violations\" since April last year. UberMedia has simply been made an example of. Some of the violations UberMedia was alleged to have made \u2013 particularly using the tweet-elongation service tmi.me which could publicly display some users' private Direct Messages, and changing tweets to make money \u2013 could have seriously damaged the third-party developer's reputation. According to Seesmic founder Loic Le Meur, UberMedia apps carry as much as 20% of the tweets carried worldwide on a daily basis. This at a time when Twitter is boosting promotion of its own mobile apps. Gross explains what went wrong with his apps on Q&amp;A site Quora. But the affair has left a bad taste in the mouth. As Mark Suster, a prominent venture capitalist and angel investor, says: \"Yes, and it's total coincidence that on the day they were suspended Twitter ran the promoted Tweet #TwitterMobile and that UberTwitter was never suspended before being bought by Bill Gross &amp; raising $17.5m. \"As a long-time user of UberTwitter I find this kind of platform behavior offensive. Not as a VC or as somebody who loves Twitter &amp; always has. But as a user of a product Twitter chose to punish. It sure would have been nicer on your users if you issued a public warning and had given them 72 hours to respond. Who got fucked today was me. A loyal Twitter user.\"",
