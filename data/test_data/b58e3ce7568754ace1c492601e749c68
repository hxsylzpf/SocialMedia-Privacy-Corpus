  "content": "This may go down in history as the moment Twitter went mainstream in the UK - equally, it may not. One by one, the celebs - some real, some fake - have joined the messaging-service-without-a-business-model in recent weeks. Yet the likes of @stephenfry, @Wossy and @bobbyllew have (sorry, guys) largely been the same kind of early-adopter geeks that already inhabited the site. But you don't get much more middle-of-the-road than the co-host of ITV's mid-morning talk show. Philip Schofield (@schofe) went on This Morning on Tuesday to confess to Britain he is just as geeky as the rest of us. Then he tweeted it. Twitter commanded a greater proportion of UK web users last year than even in its native US. The service is still more esoteric and limited than services like Facebook, when went through its own mainstream adoption in winter 2007. But could British housewives now be about to become tweeters? Jury's out\u2026"
