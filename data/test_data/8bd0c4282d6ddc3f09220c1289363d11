  "content": "A former News of the World executive and a private eye used by the tabloid will not be charged over allegations of computer hacking after prosecutors ran out of time to bring a criminal case. Among those investigated were the former NotW executive Alex Marunchak and Jonathan Rees, a private eye and one-time murder suspect whose agency worked extensively for the defunct Murdoch tabloid. They deny any wrongdoing. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded that Scotland Yard had begun investigating the allegations too late. The claims centred on alleged hacking from 2005 to 2007, but the Met did not begin a criminal investigation until 2011. Under the Computer Misuse Act, charges have to be brought no longer than three years after any alleged offence. The Met investigated 15 suspects and 13 complainants and says it uncovered evidence of the use of spyware to target computers. Among the cases investigated was that of a former intelligence officer, Ian Hurst, who claims in a civil action that he was hacked by the NotW on Marunchak's orders as they hunted for information about an alleged IRA informant codenamed Stakeknife. After the CPS announcement, Hurst said he would continue to pursue his case, adding that he had been constrained while police investigated because of legal restrictions. \"Now the information we've identified can be used,\" he said. \"We've got a civil action against the NotW.\" The Met inquiry into computer hacking, Operation Kalmyk, investigated allegations that Hurst's computer had been hacked by an investigator working for the NotW. Hurst had worked as an army intelligence officer in Northern Ireland. Philip Campbell Smith is alleged to have hacked Hurst's computer in 2006 as part of a commission from the NotW, passed to him by Rees. The computer hacking involving Smith is alleged in her civil action to have been carried out in July 2006 by sending Hurst an email containing a trojan virus that copied Hurst's emails and relayed them back to the hacker. In Hurst's civil action he claimed this had been commissioned by Marunchak, who was a senior editor on the newspaper when it was edited by Andy Coulson. Hurst found out that Smith had hacked his computer and went on to tape him confessing to it, which was first reported by the BBC. MI5 suspected that Smith had targeted Hurst's email in an attempt to find the location of Stakeknife. They made no approach to Hurst, apparently on the grounds that he was preparing to write an unauthorised book about his experience in Northern Ireland and could not be trusted. They then asked the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) to investigate. Hurst believes they did not do so adequately. Hurst told the Leveson inquiry he had been shown evidence by police that his computer was hacked and that he had uncovered a lot of information that also led him to question \"the unhealthy role of the police\". He added: \"I am also absolutely certain that there were strong links between certain newspapers and former and current officers of the Metropolitan police.\" Rees has worked as a private investigator for the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and the NotW. He was jailed for trying to frame a woman, and on his release from prison in 2004 he resumed his work for the NotW. The Sunday tabloid paid Rees up to \u00a3150,000 for his services, and a bug placed by police in his south London office recorded corrupt officers taking cash for information. He was previously cleared of murdering his one-time business partner Daniel Morgan. An internal police report claimed Rees and his network were involved in the long-term penetration of police intelligence and that \"their thirst for knowledge is driven by profit to be accrued from the media\". In 2012 Smith pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud by illegally obtaining confidential information in a case unrelated to working for a media organisation. In a statement the CPS said: \"Any decision by the CPS does not imply any finding concerning guilt or criminal conduct; the CPS makes decisions only according to the test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and it is applied in all decisions on whether or not to prosecute.\" Hurst said he would ask the CPS to review its decision not to prosecute. The collapse of Operation Kalmyk is the latest blow to the CPS and police, who this year effectively abandoned Operation Elveden, the investigation into alleged illegal payments to public officials for stories by journalist at the Sun and other tabloids. Elveden and a parallel Operation Weeting investigation into phone hacking at the NotW led to 38 journalists being charged over three years. Seven journalists were found guilty or pleaded guilty to phone hacking but only three journalists out of the 26 charged with Elveden offences have been found guilty and two of those have had their convictions overturned by the court of appeal. A number of public officials were also convicted."
