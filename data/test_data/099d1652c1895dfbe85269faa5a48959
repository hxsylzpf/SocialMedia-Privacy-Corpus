  "content": "The veteran media and entertainment executive Lord Grade is to give evidence at the Leveson inquiry next week, when it will scrutinise the workings of the Press Complaints Commission. Grade, whose colourful media career spans six decades and includes stints as a talent agent, US TV producer, chairman of Camelot and Pinewood Studios, as well as senior positions at the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, will appear on Tuesday in his role as a PCC commissioner. The week will also give the PCC a chance to salvage its reputation, which has taken a mauling since the phonehacking scandal erupted last July. Politicians \u2013 including David Cameron and culture secretary Jeremy Hunt \u2013 have called for the PCC to be replaced with a new press regulator with beefed-up powers, a move that is backed by several national newspaper editors. The PCC has also faced sustained criticism at the Leveson inquiry from victims of alleged press harassment. Six witnesses with current or past connections to the PCC, including Grade, have been lined up for the inquiry, with the body's current director Stephen Abell and his predecessor Tim Toulmin appearing on Monday. On Tuesday, Grade will be joined by the former PCC chairman and ex-British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer. But all eyes will be on Lord Hunt, the new chairman of the PCC, who has been waging a behind-the-scenes campaign for reform of the existing body that will win favour with the press, the public, Lord Justice Leveson and the government. Also appearing is Lord Black, seen as another behind-the-scenes kingmaker, trying to repair relationships between newspaper groups that became fractured in the fall out over the PCC's failure to question News International when it misled the watchdog about the extent of phone hacking at the News of the World. Black is an executive director of the Telegraph Media Group and a former director of the PCC. He is currently chairman of Press Standards Board of Finance Limited \u2013 Pressbof \u2013 the committee of newspaper and magazine executives responsible for the PCC's funding and enforcing the editors' code of practice. During his time as director of the PCC, Black was responsible for strengthening the code in 1999 in the wake of the death of Princess Diana to tackle the issue of what the watchdog's then chairman, Lord Wakeham, called the \"cumulative intrusion\" into Prince William and Prince Harry's life. Black will appear on Wednesday along with representatives from three other media industry regulators \u2013 Colette Bowe, chairman of broadcast regulator Ofcom, Guy Parker, chief executive of the Advertising Standards Authority and Ed Richards, chief executive of Ofcom. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
