  "content": "Hollywood stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie today began a privacy action against the News of the World over a story that alleged the couple were separating. The News of the World claimed in a story last month that the pair, who met on the set of the film Mr &amp; Mrs Smith in 2004, had visited a divorce lawyer in December and agreed to divide up their \u00a3205m fortune and custody of their six children. Keith Schilling of Schillings, the couple's London lawyers, said today: \"The News of the World has failed to meet our clients' reasonable demands for a retraction of and apology for these false and intrusive allegations which have now been widely republished by mainstream news outlets. We have advised them to bring proceedings, which they have now done.\" Pitt and Jolie commenced action through Schillings in the high court in London today against News Group Newspapers, the News International subsidiary that publishes the News of the World. Schillings said that the News of the World article contravened the Press Complaints Commission code of conduct that states that a significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion \"once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and \u2013 where appropriate \u2013 an apology published\". The law firm added that publication of the story amounted to a serious misuse of private information and that it was not required to disclose if the information was true or false. \"However in this case we can confirm unequivocally, and upon instructions, that the allegations published by the News of the World are false as well as intrusive,\" the firm said. The News of the World alleged on 24 January that the couple visited a divorce lawyer in December 2009 to begin thrashing out a separation deal and that last month they signed a deal to divide their assets of \u00a3205m. The article also claimed that the couple's children would live with Jolie but that Pitt would have visitation rights and that the separation would occur imminently. Pitt and Jolie have three adopted children \u2013 Maddox, eight, Pax, six, and Zahara, five \u2013 and three biological children \u2013 Shiloh, three, and 17-month-old twins Knox and Vivienne. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
