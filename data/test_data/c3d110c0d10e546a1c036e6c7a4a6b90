  "content": "The News of the World's expos\u00e9 of Max Mosley's participation in a sadomasochism party was branded a \"gross and indefensible intrusion\" by his QC during closing arguments at the high court today. A ruling is expected in the middle of next week in Mosley's potentially landmark high court privacy case against the News of the World. Mr Justice Eady reserved his decision on the fifth day of the hearing, following closing speeches by QCs for Mosley and the News of the World, which has strongly contested the action. Mosley's counsel, James Price QC, in his closing arguments today said that the News of the World's \"gross and indefensible intrusion\" was made substantially worse by the entirely false suggestion that the president of formula one's governing body the FIA was playing a concentration camp commandant and a cowering death camp inmate. Calling News of the World reporter Neville Thurlbeck's evidence dishonest, Price added: \"He is not a reporter on whom a responsible editor could place any reliance on any matter of importance, and that must have been clear to those in charge of that newspaper.\" He went on: \"This is not a newspaper that is looking to find out the truth - that is irrelevant. What it is doing is looking to publish the story.\" Referring to the fact that informant Woman E was not called as a witness, Price said: \"There was not a scrap of evidence that she was not fully fit to come to court and give her evidence.\" The \"true reason\" she was not called \"is one or other of two things\". \"Either the defendant could not risk her going into the witness box and telling the truth, as told by Women A to D, or she herself feared that the truth would emerge from the cross-examination,\" Price said. In his own evidence last week Mosley, the 68-year-old son of the 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, said his life was devastated by the newspaper's expose in March of his encounter at a London flat with five women, which it described as a \"sick Nazi orgy\". Mosley, who has been present throughout the hearing, is asking for an unprecedented award of punitive exemplary damages. The News of the World editor, Colin Myler, told the high court last week that he believed the story was one of \"legitimate public interest and one that I believe was legitimately published\". Earlier today, Mark Warby QC, for the News of the World, said in his closing arguments that there was no basis for punitive damages, because the newspaper believed what was written and that it was legitimate to publish. Warby asked why, if there were no Nazi elements to the session, Mr Mosley and woman A were so desperate to try to cover up what went on, such as through the deletion of emails. \"If it's not meant to be Nazi, then what on earth is it meant to be?\" he said. Warby added that even in a tolerant and broadminded society, there were some things that were fundamentally contrary to western values, such as the brutality of the Nazi era, and that the FIA's membership had a right to expect their elected leader to comply with proper standards, both in his professional and private life. Mosley's \"unhealthy addiction\" was vicious, he said, and the amount of money he devoted to it - \u00a375,000 in a year - was a measure of how much it had taken over his life. Price, for Mosley, countered that Warby's words were aimed at the press in court, rather than the judge, and were deliberately designed to increase his humiliation in return for him having the temerity to bring the action. He told Mr Justice Eady, who is expected to reserve his ruling when the case concludes this afternoon: \"We shall invite you to reflect the outrageous things which have just been said in your award of damages.\" Price argued that compensation for intrusion of privacy should be greater than those for defamation \"because invasion of privacy can never be repaired and the claimant has to live with it for the rest of his life\". An award of exemplary damages should be made \"to show that the law cannot be mocked as it was in this case\", he said. Price emphasised the unprecedented and \"phenomenal scale of the promotional advantage and growth achieved by the News of the World\" arising out of the publication of stories about Mosley and the accompanying video on its website. \"This story arrived like manna from heaven,\" he said. He told the judge that it was \"now beyond argument that there was no Nazi element\". Price added that it was also not accepted that if there had been a Nazi aspect it would have justified the intrusion or publication of the salacious detail and film. Mosley's QC said the outrage from the Nazi era was the abuse of human beings and human rights. \"To dress up in Nazi clothing is tasteless and puerile, but it is not an abuse of human rights,\" Price added. \"The defendant's motivation was to publish a scandalous expos\u00e9. End of story. Nothing else,\" he said. \"It's wholly obvious that the enjoyment of lawful consensual S and M activity in private cannot justify the use of a hidden camera recording for publication.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
