  "content": "Chris DeWolfe has given an illuminating interview to the Daily Telegraph's Katherine Rushton. The co-creator and former chief executive of MySpace accused Rupert Murdoch of ruining the social network after News Corp bought it, for $580m, in 2005. Its popularity was short-lived. It was soon overtaken by Facebook and in 2011 News Corp offloaded it at a loss to a consortium led by singer Justin Timberlake. DeWolfe, who now runs the Social Gaming Network, also addressed the false rumours that surfaced in 2008 alleging that he had had an affair with Murdoch's wife, Wendi Deng. DeWolfe told Rushton he had previously discussed the allegations with Murdoch. \"He knows it's not true\u2026 I worked for him and he came to me and said, 'Ignore this stuff, it happens all the time.'\" But DeWolfe did say he was \"taken aback\" when it was announced in June this year that Murdoch had filed for divorce from Deng.
