  "content": "Aim \"To facilitate a secure and reliable record of registrable facts about individuals in the United Kingdom and to ensure a convenient method for individuals to prove registrable facts about themselves.\" Main provisions \u2022 Provides the legal framework to establish a national identity register and to issue identity cards. \u2022 Lists more than 50 possible categories of information for the register including date and place of birth, principal place of residence, every other place of UK or overseas residence, head and shoulder photograph, signature, fingerprints, and other biometric information (which might include iris scans, and a facial measurement template). \u2022 Enables the government to authorise additional information categories by regulation, on a single vote of each house. \u2022 Permits the home secretary to \"designate\" any document issued under a statutory power, making it a condition of applying for such a document that you join the national identity register. \u2022 Requires a cost estimate for the following 10 years of the identity card scheme to be presented to parliament once every six months. \u2022 Empowers the government to create regulations to make \"public services conditional on identity checks\" in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. \u2022 Requires that once registered, you keep all the \"registrable facts\" about you up to date. \u2022 Lays out civil penalties for non-cooperation \u2013 for example, failure to notify officials of a change in your personal details can be punished by a penalty of up to \u00a31,000. \u2022 Enables a number of public authorities access to the information on the database, including the Secret Intelligence Service, GCHQ, Serious Organised Crime Agency, and HM Revenue and Customs and any government department. \u2022 Provides for the Home Office to pass information on the register to any other public authority where deemed necessary for security, law enforcement, prevention of crime or government efficiency. Background Within weeks of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, home secretary David Blunkett was publicly discussing proposals to introduce a compulsory identity card, though the government went on to reject them. In 2002 the Home Office began a consultation exercise on the introduction of \"entitlement cards\" and in November 2003, it published a report laying out the government's plans for a \"national, compulsory ID card\". The government said the scheme was essential to protect Britain against terrorism, organised crime and prevent identity theft, illegal immigration and illegal working but a cabinet wrangle over whether it should be compulsory or voluntary or indeed whether it was worthwhile delayed the publication of a draft bill until April 2004. The bill itself was published in November 2004. After Blunkett's resignation, just prior to the bill's second reading in December 2004, the new home secretary, Charles Clarke, rejected a Liberal Democrat call to \"pause for thought\" on identity cards. Clarke described the bill as a \"profoundly civil libertarian measure because it promotes the most fundamental civil liberty in our society, which is the right to live free from crime and fear\". The bill had the formal support of Conservatives, under the leadership of Michael Howard, although several senior members of the shadow cabinet had expressed severe misgivings about the ID cards. The Tories attempted to reconcile this cabinet split by maintaining support for identity cards in principle but saying they could not support the legislation unless it passed five tests: robust technology; clarity of purpose; cost-effectiveness; efficient organisation; and the safeguarding of civil liberties. Time constraints in a busy legislative calendar meant the government was unable to push the bill through parliament before the April 2005 election. Labour's 2005 manifesto stated: \"We will introduce ID cards, including biometric data like fingerprints, backed up by a national register and rolling out initially on a voluntary basis as people renew their passports.\" By the time the new parliament convened, opposition to ID cards had hardened on several fronts. The scheme's detractors argued registering individuals when they applied for a designated document (for example, a passport) amounted to \"compulsion by the back door\". Fears also began to grow that the government's costing analysis, \u00a36bn over 10 years, was optimistic. In June 2005, the London School of Economics released a report estimating the cost over 10 years at between \u00a310.6bn and \u00a319.2bn, a figure dismissed by Clarke as \"complete nonsense\". The bill received its third reading in the Commons on 18 October 2005. The home secretary promised to guard against \"function creep\", assuring the house that sensitive information like criminal convictions, financial records and religious faith would be excluded from the national identity register. The bill passed by 309 votes to 284. Peers voted five times to reject plans to require applicants for passports to accept an ID card but in March 2006, they passed the bill. Tory peers had been mollified by a government concession that delayed issuing the first cards for British nationals until January 2010, giving David Cameron a chance to campaign against a project he described as \"profoundly unBritish\" and a \"monument to the failure of big government\". Since March 2006, the scheme has been beset by delays. In December 2007, the Identity and Passport Service, the branch of the Home Office responsible for delivering the scheme, announced they had dropped plans to utilise iris scans. Plans to compulsorily register on the National Identity Register the details of people who apply for a passport have drifted to 2012. In November 2008, the UK Border Agency began issuing the first identity cards \u2013 visas designed to form part of the ID scheme when it is established \u2013 to some foreign nationals from outside the European Economic Area (students and those applying for a spouse visa). The home secretary Jacqui Smith has announced plans to begin an 18-month pilot scheme this year for airside workers at Manchester and London City airports. Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have both announced they would scrap the scheme but home office minister Meg Hillier has said there \"isn't an easy way to unpick this scheme.\" Criticism NO2ID, the campaign group set up by opponents of the scheme, was angered by the bill's enabling agenda. Early drafts of the bill did not require new primary legislation in order to make the scheme compulsory. The final act allows the home secretary to make changes by an order, meaning they would receive only cursory parliamentary oversight. Liberty vigorously opposed the introduction of the act and has consistently campaigned against it, noting that the privacy implications of the scheme are profound and that it has \"far reaching implications for the relationship between the individual and the state\". The government's official privacy watchdog, Richard Thomas, told MPs that identity cards would represent a \"sea change in the relationship between state and every individual in this country.\" There are myriad concerns about the future security of the government's database. Privacy campaigners argue the database will create an enormous target for abuse: in particular that vulnerable groups such as members of the witness protection programme, scientists involved in animal experimentation, celebrities and victims of domestic violence will find that their personal details are sold to the highest bidder or circulated among interested parties. There is already a substantial body of anecdotal evidence that existing government databases are used to trace victims of domestic violence. In December 2007, Thomas told the justice select committee that the government needed to review its plans for the identity scheme in the wake of the loss of 25m child benefit records, which included names and addresses of recipients. Thomas said: \"Keeping this massive database with records of every time the card is swiped through a terminal is distinctly unattractive and would increase the risks.\" This idea of an audit trail is of key concern to privacy campaigners who point out the register could provide a detailed log of every identity check creating a map of individual's movements and transactions. The Identity and Passport Service provides a list of other organisations and businesses it expects to utilise the scheme. In total they estimate that 265 government departments and 44,000 private sector organisations will be accredited to verify identity using the national identity register. In May 2007, James Hall, chief of the Identity and Passport Service, admitted that the government intended to allow the audit trail to be used by the police or security services in the case of serious crimes. Phil Booth, national coordinator of the NO2ID campaign, says: \"Each time anyone checks on your ID, it will be recorded. That means that over time the authorities could build up a very accurate picture of everything you do.\""
