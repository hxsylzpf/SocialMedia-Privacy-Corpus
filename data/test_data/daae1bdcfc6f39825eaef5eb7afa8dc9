  "content": "\u2022 Nick Clegg backed Jeremy Hunt's explanation to the inquiry last month of how he acted correctly in his quasi-judicial oversight of News Corporation's BSkyB bid. \u2022 David Cameron gave Clegg assurances on Andy Coulson after the 2010 election. \u2022 Clegg endorsed statutory backing for the new press regulator and the definition of the public interest. \u2022 Clegg was \"quizzical\" about the timing of the BSkyB bid after the election following a warning from outgoing PM Gordon Brown. \u2022 Norman Lamb, Clegg's ex-political adviser, warned the deputy PM of \"lack of favourable coverage\" from News International papers if the Lib Dems opposed BSkyB bid. \u2022 Vince Cable wanted Ed Davey to assume the BSkyB role after he was stripped of quasi-judicial oversight on 21 December 2010. \u2022 The Press Complaints Commission is \"toothless\" and self-regulation has failed repeatedly, Clegg said."
