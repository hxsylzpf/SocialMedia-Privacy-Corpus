  "content": "Publications in the UK and around the world have been warned against printing topless pictures of Claudia Schiffer. The photographs are believed to have been taken at the exclusive Sandy Lane Hotel in Barbados. Several titles were planning to use the pictures until Schiffer's lawyers pointed out they were taken on private property so any publication could be prosecuted for using them. It is understood a number of European publications had gone to print with the pictures before they received the warning. \"The vast majority of magazines have agreed to not use these pictures,\" said a spokesman for the German model. \"Anyone who does decide to use the pictures will have Ms Schiffer's lawyers chasing them.\" It is believed the agency Big Pictures was involved in selling the photos and agreed to recall them. No one from the agency would comment but Schiffer's spokesman said: \"Claudia has not started legal action against Big Pictures.\"",
