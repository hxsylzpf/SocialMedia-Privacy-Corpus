  "content": "\"Gerald Scarfe has never reflected the opinions of the Sunday Times,\" Rupert Murdoch tweeted on Monday. \"Nevertheless, we owe major apology for grotesque, offensive cartoon.\" And with that, in 137 characters, the matter was settled. Martin Ivens, promoted barely more than a week earlier to acting editor of the title, had initially been bullish in his defence of Scarfe's depiction at the weekend of Binyamin Netanyahu building a wall using the blood of Palestinians, saying that the \"typically robust\" cartoon was \"aimed squarely at Mr Netanyahu and his policies, not at Israel, let alone at Jewish people\". But with the emphatic \u2013 and very public \u2013 smackdown from his proprietor, Ivens had no choice but to backpedal, fast. The day after Murdoch's intervention he issued a second statement that, tellingly, echoed his boss's description of the work as \"grotesque\". \"I'd like to apologise unreservedly for the offence we clearly caused. This was a terrible mistake.\" With Murdoch having assured the Leveson inquiry last year that he guided his editors only with the lightest of touches, the incident offered a revealing glimpse, in case there were any doubt, of where the final editorial word still lies in the Murdoch newspaper empire. Also revealing, however, was Murdoch's choice of Twitter both to upbraid his new editor and to scramble in defence of his group's reputation. The octogenarian proprietor was late to the microblogging site, sending his first tweet, complete with typing error, from his holiday in St Barth's on New Year's Eve 2011 (\"Have just. Read The Rational Optimist. Great Book.\"). So notable was his acquisition of a Twitter account that the site's founder, Jack Dorsey, heralded his arrival, saying the mogul had been tweeting \"with his own voice, in his own way\". And for 13 months that is exactly what Murdoch has been doing, in a stream that is always opinionated, at times combative, but often surprising \u2013 and offers arguably a fuller portrait of the billionaire than has been available at any time during his long career in the spotlight. Murdoch types his tweets himself on his iPad \u2013 any suspicion that he is not personally behind them is dispelled by the frequent slips (\"Re complaints about my spelling! Problem is my pathetic typing. Sorry, if anyone really cares,\" he tweeted on 8 January last year), and by a tone that, for those who obsessively followed his appearances before parliament and Lord Justice Leveson last year, is recognisably his own (\"Only ever met PMs when asked, believe it or not. And NEVER asked for anything. That is, I never asked for anything!\" \"I stand by every word is aid at Leveson\"). Though he rarely responds directly to a follower, Murdoch has told his followers that he \"reads all\" (while upbraiding them on their language), and his tweets are frequently responses to questions \u2013 however impolite \u2013 from his followers. Certainly Murdoch uses his feed strategically. During the US election campaign he kept up a stream of disdainful tweets about Barack Obama in a forlorn bid to help Mitt Romney to the presidency. \"Romney looking better and better while Obama seems devoid of anything new,\" he said on 26 October. \"May try October surprise, bomb someplace! Remember Clinton?\" Even after the president's re-election in November, he couldn't resist a sniff. \"Obama looking confident, presidential, even if not totally frank about number of issues. He won, and sure knows it!\" He is repeatedly sceptical on the merits of green energy, but has been an outspoken proponent of gun reform, even tweeting this week: \"Let's have petitiion to keep Piers Morgan in US. We need him, as does CNN.\" \"Maybe a Fox/NYPost campaign?\" replied Morgan. (\"MAKE OUT. MMMAAAAAKEEE OOOUTTT]\" was the response of user @piss_wizard). He is no less outspoken on British politics, though his view of the prime minister is decidedly ambivalent. \"Cameron's UK cabinet reshuffle first class and probably secures his position for full term. Previous ditherer- in-chief looks better,\" he judged in August. Alex Salmond, pointedly, he named \"clearly most brilliant politician in UK\", while even Gordon Brown \"deserves much credit on euro\". About Michael Gove, whose frequent dinners with him drew criticism, there is no ambiguity. \"Don't know how many meals with Gove, but not enough. Admirable character, great work.\" The News Corp chief executive is also happy to nudge his 401,000 followers towards his own products, praising Team Sky during the Tour de France, the Wall Street Journal (frequently compared to the \"boring\" New York Times), and a succession of Fox films from Life of Pi to the critically panned Taken 2. But there are also glimpses of the family man: \"Young daughters looking for another dog to adopt! Help!\" He takes hikes in Australia (\"saw hundreds of kangaroos, two wombats, two foxes, two echidnas, great birds\") and reads books by Alain de Botton and Niall Ferguson, others about US politics or energy, and even a dieting volume called The Lean by Kathy Freston (\"v interesting book on health and weight loss \u2026 Makes sense and seems ez\"). And however sharp his reprimand this week, in a year of tweeting Murdoch has himself had cause to apologise more than once \u2013 to Lord Coe (\"Sorry, it's Sebastian Coe, not Zeb!\"), General Petraeus and Hugh Grant (\"Hugh Grant states that he is deeply involved in his daughter's life \u2013 I accept that,regret tweet on the matter. Apologies to both parents.\") In November, the stridently pro-Israel Murdoch was even obliged to backtrack over accusations of antisemitism, after wondering why the \"Jewish owned press\" was not more supportive of Israel. The tweet had, he acknowledged the following day, been \"sternly criticised\" for relying on prejudiced tropes. \"Don't see this, but apologise unreservedly.\" Murdoch's top tweets 31 Dec 2011 Vacations great time for thinking.
