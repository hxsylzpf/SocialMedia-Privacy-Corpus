  "content": "School's out for summer \u2026 and what better way to spend it than glued to a computer trying to beat Facebook at its own game. That is what four developers studying at New York University's Courant Institute will be doing for the next three months. They raised $200,000 through public donations in support of their pledge to develop a \"privacy-aware, personally controlled, do-it-all, open source social network\" called Diaspora. With so much public drumbeating in the debate over control of our personal information, Diaspora's idealistic and simple idea captured the public mood. Daniel Grippi, Maxwell Salzberg, Raphael Sofaer and Ilya Zhitromirskiy initially aimed to raise $10,000 through the Kickstarter funding site, but have now received $200,000 in just one month \u2013 as well as pledges of support from some high profile digerati. Despite vast resources and many of the world's best engineers, Facebook has always approached control of data in a proprietary way and is therefore not ideologically disposed to handing control of data to users. Facebook is a service based around a repository of information you upload, like much of the \"free\" internet. But, rather than creating another centralised network, Diaspora will exist as a network of \"seeds\" \u2013 individual computers that host their owners' personal information. It will pull together that information from the web \u2013 including tweets, photos and Facebook posts \u2013 though the idea is more than just a social media aggregator. \"Decentralising lets us reconstruct our 'social graphs' so that they belong to us,\" explain the team on their blog. \"Our real social lives do not have central managers, and our virtual lives do not need them. Friend another seed and the two of you can synchronise over a direct and secure connection instead of through a superfluous hub ... Eventually, today's hubs could be almost entirely replaced by a decentralised network of truly personal websites.\" Under this model, users would curate their own content and publish it when and where they want. Ultimately, Diaspora may be an academic idea that fails to gain traction in terms of numbers or as a proposition simple enough for the mainstream. But what it has done is provide a constructive focus for a complex and often combative debate that deserves a more creative solution."
