  "content": "Here is a notional, going on wholly ludicrous, scenario. The president of the United States has dumped his wife and family. He's taken up with a blonde newscaster from Fox and installed her in the White House, with a budget to fund her activities. But now his eyes are roaming again and the New York Post has caught him slithering round to see Kim Kardisomethingorother at her DC pad. Meanwhile, it's the day of the vital state of the union address and the president has a press conference scheduled. Hundreds of correspondents pour in. Hundreds of questions pour forth. But the chief pleads privacy as though it were the fifth amendment. Well, I said it was a ludicrous plot. Perhaps 50 or so years ago, when JFK was pursuing Marilyn, Judith and every willing woman in sight, there was a certain silence-cum-reverence for the office. But today? After the Clinton years? Dozens of political sex scandals later? There is no privacy argument here, either in practice or \u2013 more importantly \u2013 in American law. If you're a public figure, a star golfer let alone a president, you effectively waive most of your privacy rights. Simply, what happened in France last week couldn't happen in Washington DC. It would, inescapably, be a global shocker. And, European convention on human rights or not, that would surely be true of a British prime minister, too: hung by the tabloids, drawn by the internet, quartered by the posher end of the media market. He would be a figure of fun, or probably worse. He'd be finished. Ah! but France is different, we're told. France builds a wall of discretion around its head of state. France has a corps of political reporters who know when to touch their forelocks. France won't let rowdy foreign correspondents near a microphone. France scorns Anglo-Saxon papers with their prurient obsessions. France leads on economic reforms and sticks sex on page three. France is different. At which point, perhaps, it's time to take a deep breath. For the plain fact, the plainest fact of our digital world, is that there is no real privacy left for players on a global stage. America \u2013 from Golden Globes to White House cavortings \u2013 imposes a cultural context that can't be bucked. So Closer magazine might not have stalked and exposed Fran\u00e7ois Hollande three decades ago? So Mitterrand, Chirac and Sarkozy had an easy ride, at least whilst they ruled from the Elys\u00e9e? So what? The question you'd like to have heard Hollande answer is straightforwardly covered by article 10 of the human rights convention, on the public's right to know. Sir, you're deeply unpopular on the polls with just 22% approval and have come here today to relaunch your entire economic policy? What on Earth are you doing, floating around town on a motorbike, betraying the mistress you had and taking a smiling actress instead? Don't the people who elected you, the people you promised \"exemplary conduct to\" after the Sarkozy era, have a right to something better than that? The difficulty with the whole debate about the media and privacy (as the admirable Professor Ros Coward wrote in the Guardian the other day) is that it needs a new and more nuanced look. It doesn't work digitally when the heart of celebrity culture \u2013 Hollywood \u2013 works to totally different rules. Its judicial and political lurches in Britain are mostly driven by an old, post-social-media regime desperate to hang on to its traditional ways. The debate, such as it is, seems to depend on whether you hate or revere Rupert Murdoch. Yet, in reality, privacy and secrecy cohabit in the same dark corner. It's no surprise that French presidents tend to come up soiled once they're retired. Secrecy stains. And no country, least of all France, is an island. I bet Cheltenham knew Hollande's last romance was on the rocks way before the news came Closer. \u25a0 Look at this high-level World Association of Newspapers delegation, in London last week to protest about shrinking freedoms for journalists here (especially for Guardian editors and reporters investigating intelligence surveillance, but never forgetting the 61 others much too insouciantly arrested since 2011). Where have such delegations voyaged before? Why, Ethiopia, South Africa, Libya, Yemen, Tunisia, Mexico, Honduras, Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Burma. It's interesting, very seriously, to see the company we keep.",
