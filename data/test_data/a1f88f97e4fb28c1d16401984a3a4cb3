  "content": "Injunctions have become one of the most effective tools powerful individuals and corporations reach for when they want to silence the media. In their simplest form, they prevent news organisations from reporting what happens in court, usually on the basis that doing so could prejudice a trial. \"Super-injunctions\" that prevent news organisations from revealing the identities of those involved in legal disputes, or even reporting the fact that reporting restrictions have been imposed, have emerged recently. They grew out of family cases and then developed further as a result of the privacy law that has come into being in the UK on the back of the right to privacy enshrined in the 1998 Human Rights Act, itself based on the European convention on human rights. That law has evolved through a series of high court rulings and was used by Max Mosley, the Formula One chief, last year to win damages from the News of the World when it revealed details about his sex life. But this privacy law, welcomed by some as a way of protecting against tabloid intrusion, has further boosted the use of injunctions whose terms of reference are far wider than ever before. Libel lawyers Carter-Ruck and Schillings have proved adept at persuading judges that injunctions should now be granted on privacy grounds. Some tabloid newspapers are being served with \"a handful\" of such orders each week, according to media lawyers. The Guardian has been served with at least 12 notices of injunctions that could not be reported so far this year, compared with six in the whole of 2006 and five the year before. The motivation is straightforward, according to Mark Stephens, a partner at law firm Finer Stephens Innocent. \"As the libel and privacy capital of the world, people are coming here [to London] to bully the media and NGOs into not reporting on their nefarious activities,\" he said. The right to report what takes place in parliament has been enshrined in law for centuries and Trafigura's refusal to allow the Guardian to publish the contents of Paul Farrelly's question caused an outcry, fanned in large part on the internet. Farrelly's question, which could be found on parliament's website and was printed on the House of Commons order paper, was available online within minutes, illustrating the futility of attempts to keep such information from public view. By lunchtime today, Trafigura and Carter-Ruck, its lawyers, had backed down. The Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger, called for the practice to end. \"It is time that judges stopped granting 'super-injunctions' which are so absolute and wide-ranging that nothing about them can be reported at all,\" he said. Carter-Ruck and its client, presumably shocked by the scale of the hostile reaction to its attempt to gag the Guardian, gave way under the weight of public protest. Many others do not \u2011 but it is unlikely most of us will ever know about them."
