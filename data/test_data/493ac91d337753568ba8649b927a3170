  "content": "The UK Information Commissioner's Office has ordered Google to destroy personal data that was collected from British home wireless networks in 2008. But the ICO says it will take no action against the company, bringing condemnation from the pressure group Privacy International, which says the ICO is \"10 steps behind the game\" in monitoring privacy intrusions and breaches by US companies operating in the UK. The row comes amid concern over the erosion of British individuals' control of personal data held by US companies, which has been highlighted at the social networking site Facebook, with about 450 million users worldwide. Campaigners are urging users to quit the site from 31 May in protest at its continual revision of its privacy policy which makes it harder for users to limit the spread of information about themselves. Google admitted last week that it collected Wi-Fi data from millions of homes and businesses around the world while it was taking pictures for its Street View product. The collection came to light following enquiries in Germany. Simon Davies, the director of Privacy International, said: \"Google is going to be the target of a criminal prosecution somewhere in the world for this. But if the evidence is destroyed, there's no way to examine whether a crime has been committed.\" The Irish Data Protection Authority has also ordered Google to delete the data collected while getting Street View pictures. The ICO said: \"It appears that while not all information collected necessarily identified individuals, there has been some unnecessary and excessive collection and storage of personal data.\" However, because Google said it was unlikely that anything other than fragments of content had been collected, \"there does not seem to be any reason to keep the data concerned for evidential purposes\". Google's chief executive, Eric Schmidt, defended his company's record on privacy, saying it has the \"most consumer-centric privacy policy of any service online\". Speaking at Google's annual Zeitgeist Europe forum, Schmidt said: \"We are not in any sort of denial or lack of understanding of how important this question is. Society as a group has not decided what is appropriate and what is not appropriate in the privacy sphere, and each society and group will differ.\" He repeated that the Street View problem involved a small amount of fragmented data that was not used and he confirmed that \"changes have been made\" to Google's procedures to ensure privacy issues are discussed \"well ahead of time. It's an absolute mistake to think about this the week before a product comes out\". Facebook's users are meanwhile showing increasing concern about its repeated rolling back of privacy provisions. More people are searching for details on how to delete their account \u2013 although some have complained that when they leave the site their data is not deleted. A growing number are signing up at a site called QuitFacebookDay.com, which urges people to delete their profiles permanently. \"For a lot of people, quitting Facebook revolves around privacy,\" says a statement on the site by Matthew Milan and Joseph Dee, who are web designers based in Toronto. \"This is a legitimate concern, but we also think the privacy issue is just the symptom of a larger set of issues. The cumulative effects of what Facebook does now will not play out well in the future.\" Richard Allan, director of policy for Facebook, responded: \"We know that people inside Facebook are taking that [criticism] very seriously with the concerns that people have been expressing.\" Allan indicated that the company may try to make it simpler for people to control the privacy settings on their accounts \u2013 which have 50 different settings with a total of 170 options. The ICO says it will investigate any complaints about Facebook's revised policy, but that none have been made so far. It said it was satisfied that Facebook does delete data when a profile is completely removed \u2013 but that some people make their profile \"dormant\", meaning it can be revived at a later date. Davies commented: \"Facebook's privacy has been in slow corrosion mode for three years. Its ethical compass has slipped at the same rate as Google's.\" Last week the European commission's data protection working party wrote to Facebook saying that its recent changes, which made previously private information publicly viewable by default, were unacceptable. The letter said: \"Providers of social networking sites should be aware that it would be a breach of data protection law if they use personal data of other individuals contained in a user profile for commercial purposes if these other individuals have not given their free and unambiguous consent.\" Allan said that Facebook will respond to the letter presently. Davies urged the ICO to investigate Google's use of systems to collect data about wireless networks more closely. In its blogpost, Google said: \"In 2006 an engineer working on an experimental project wrote a piece of code that sampled all categories of publicly broadcast Wi-Fi data. A year later \u2026 our mobile team \u2026 included that code in their software \u2013 although the project leaders did not want, and had no intention of using, payload data.\" However, said Davies, \"code doesn't just get mixed with the main system like raspberry cordial. Someone must know how it got there. There's more to this than meets the eye\". Secure surfing Safer Wi-Fi: All Wi-Fi systems offer built-in security \u2013 but almost all leave it off by default. To stop strangers hacking into it (and possibly planting malware or changing settings), connect your computer to it via an ethernet cable and enable wireless security, which will either be WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) or WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access). WEP is now considered weak, but you may find it easier to set up. Every computer and device connecting to the network will need to know the password you use, so don't lose it. Your communications are all encrypted over the air. You can also restrict access to the network by limiting it to the hardware numbers \u2013 known as the MAC addresses \u2013 of your devices: no one else will be able to join your network to see its contents. Facebook: Go to your profile settings: you'll see there are settings for your profile, contact information, applications and visibility in Google searches. As there are 150 possible options for the 70 tabs, it's impossible to give a one-size-fits-all recommendation. Just ask yourself: is there anything here that I don't want shared with the world? If so, limit its visibility to \"friends\" \u2013 and be careful who you befriend. You can even limit which friends see specific information \u2013 handy if you have too many distant \"friends\" who actually aren't.",
