  "content": "Celebrities, beware! There is nowhere left to hide. Darryn Lyons,, the larger than life founder of the Big Pictures photo agency, is encouraging budding paparazzi with nimble fingers and a mobile-phone camera to start sending him celebrity shots. Lyons is getting in on the user-generated content boom by launching a new service allowing snap-happy punters to upload and sell celebrity shots directly from their mobile phones. He will be offering the new service via a mobile version of the website, MrPaparazzi.com, which he launched 18 months ago, combining celebrity news, photos and videos in a Perez Hilton-style blog. The new mobile version, built by mobile content specialists MoMac, makes all the content accessible by mobile, but also allows users to upload celebrity photos that, once approved, can be sold on by Big Pictures. Lyons' agency has previously sold on images sent in by nimble-fingered picture phone snappers to MrPaparazzi.com of Cameron Diaz surfing, which made \u00a316,000, and pictures of Amy Winehouse, sold for \u00a3500. Contributors earn around 50% of licence fees Big Pictures gets from selling images sent in via the website. Lyons said the website, which claims 1.7 million unique users each week, is already profitable through a combination of selling material, a branded bingo service and advertising. He now wants to extend the reach of the site by expanding onto mobile. \"The difference [from Perez Hilton] is that we own and generate the content - he doesn't,\" he added. Lyons said contributors to the MrPaparazzi.com site had to agree to clear terms and conditions stating that submissions have not invaded the privacy or caused inconvenience to any subjects. \"Photos from the biggest news events are rarely taken by the media, like 9/11 and 7/7. The better quality, iconic images of the news are always by professionals, but often someone has exceptional access or is in the right place at the right time,\" he added. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857. For all other inquiries please call the main Guardian switchboard on 020 7278 2332. \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
