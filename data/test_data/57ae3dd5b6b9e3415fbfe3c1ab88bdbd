  "content": "Prince Charles's decision last night to try to stem a tide of gossip by issuing a denial without spelling out just what he was denying may have come too late to suppress the allegations - for all that there is no evidence they are true. Websites across the world, in several languages, are already carrying colourful variants of what they say the story is about. And the circulating band of self-styled royal commentators are vying with each other in the make-up rooms of TV studios to trade purportedly knowledgeable accounts. The public relations guru Max Clifford, who claims to know what the allegations are, said last night there had been no choice but to make a statement: \"They must have been aware that his name would come into the public arena, with foreign media using it. \"I can see what they are trying to do, but I don't think it's going to be effective. There are more and more accusations and allegations out there, and if they are going to continue just to try to suppress things then they are going to find it difficult.\" He said the problem had been intensified by Diana's former butler, Paul Burrell, who stood to make hundreds of thousands of pounds from a variety of revelations that were embarrassing to the royal family. \"In the past nobody would have dared [to do this],\" Mr Clifford said. \"But he has, and is getting away with it. Now if you're earning \u00a39,000 a year and see a chance to set up your family with a large cash sum, then more and more people are going to think about it. \"When anybody is surrounded by servants, the likelihood is that there are lots of things those servants will have witnessed which would be embarrassing. \"The royal family desperately needs to understand what is going on. They have to face up to reality. It's for them to find out what potential problems there are out there and address them.\" Dickie Arbiter, the Queen's former press secretary, told Sky News he thought releasing the statement was a mistake. \"Given the same scenario I would have maintained a dignified silence, this should be nothing to do with them,\" he said. \"The injunction was brought by a former employee, I think they should have distanced themselves from it.\" He said he did not believe the Queen was involved in the decision. \"Sir Michael [Peat] works for the Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales works from Clarence House; I think we have to separate the two. This is very much a Clarence House initiative, with the approval of the Prince of Wales.\" He added that the statement was likely to prompt \"wild speculation\" in the public, fired by the media, describing the resulting rumour mill as a \"three-ring circus\" that was not about to go away. The royal biographer Penny Junor told Sky News she thought releasing the statement was \"quite sensible\". \"The allegations are so vile ... I find them offensive and extraordinary and I think it was right somebody put something into the public arena saying this is not true.\" She said the statement was an indication of how angry the prince was. Every time allegations against him were made he and his family suffered, she added. \"It's important the Prince of Wales establishes early on that the allegations are false,\" she said. \"The truth is the best form of defence. If the allegations are false then someone needs to say so. The person who knows if they are true or false is the Prince of Wales and he is saying they are false, and I personally choose to believe him.\"",
