  "content": "Nick Hewer, the PR man now better known Lord Sugar's sidekick on The Apprentice, has been named as the new host of Countdown. He will join Channel 4's longest-running show on 9 January 2012, and replaces Jeff Stelling, who will presumably be moving on to spend more time with his football. It's a tough gig.

So how did the web react to Hewer's big-money transfer? Let us solve that conundrum for you...
