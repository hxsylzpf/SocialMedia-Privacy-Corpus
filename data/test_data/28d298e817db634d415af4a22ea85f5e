  "content": "We are delighted to announce the distinguished members of our Public Leaders Network 2016 editorial advisory board. Nine leaders have been selected to provide expert insight over the next year. They will work with our editorial team to ensure we tackle the most important issues facing public services. Once again, members of the network nominated a wide cross-section of public leaders. The nine members of this year's board come from all parts of public services, from central and local government to health and social care, from the voluntary sector to housing and support services. Here are the members of this year's board: Christian Brodie, chair, Student Loans Company Christian (Chris) Brodie has been the non-executive chair of the Student Loans Company since 2014. A qualified solicitor, he is also the chair of the governing body of the University of Sussex and retired in July 2013 from the role of vice chair of UBS Investment Bank. Brodie's roles give him a perspective on the delivery of public services and major government transformation programmes, including major change at the Student Loans Company. He also serves on a number of other public bodies: he is co-chair of the BIS Partnership Organisations Chairs' Forum and co-chairs the Regulatory Partnership Group for Higher Education. Anne Byrne, head of regeneration (Woodberry Down), London borough of Hackney A highly experienced public sector professional, Anne Byrne has worked in the housing and regeneration field for more than 25 years. She has held a number of senior roles in local government, which has provided her with a breadth of understanding and perspective on the challenges and opportunities of working within the public sector. Hackney council's estate regeneration programme is one of the largest in the country and the Woodberry Down scheme on which Anne leads is a major project that will deliver more than 5,500 new homes. She worked on the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) and has recently been appointed by the Design Council as a building environment expert. Stewart Carruth, chief executive, Stirling council Stewart Carruth has been chief executive at Stirling council since July 2014 and is the former strategic director of the Scottish Cities Alliance, the body representing Scotland's seven cities set up to boost economic activity and create new jobs. He was previously director of corporate governance at Aberdeen city council, and he has worked as director of corporate services at Learning and Teaching Scotland. Carruth has also held senior management posts at PwC where he worked with a large number of clients from across the public sector, and he spent three years in Turkey working on a range of public sector projects. He has a master's degree in economics and accountancy, an MBA, and a postgraduate diploma in housing. Carruth has a breadth of experience in the public sector and is fiercely ambitious for local government at a time of enormous change, upheaval and pessimism around the sector in Scotland. Sherry Malik, director of children's services, development and delivery, NSPCC Sherry Malik has been in her present role at the NSPCC since August 2014, where she leads an ambitious programme that aims to bring more evidence of what works to prevent child abuse into the wider children's sector. She has spent almost three decades working in the public, voluntary and private sectors. Previous roles include director of strategy for Cafcass; deputy chief executive for the General Social Care Council; and director of children's and adult social care at Hounslow. Originally as a teacher, Malik went on to become a social worker and is a huge champion of the profession, with strong ideas about how the public sector can develop in tough times, with a particular emphasis on strong, evidence-based outcomes frameworks. Christine Moore, chief executive, Manchester Credit Union Christine Moore is the chief executive of Manchester Credit Union, a not-for-profit financial co-operative that serves people who live or work in Manchester, Tameside, Trafford, Rochdale, Bury and the High Peak. Manchester Credit Union is the largest credit union in the north west at a time when credit unions are increasingly picking up some of the financial impact of welfare reform. Moore is a leader in the field of credit unions and other sectors across Greater Manchester, with valuable insight into related issues, such as poverty, financial exclusion, high cost lending and wellbeing issues related to excessive debt. Joe Rafferty, chief executive, Mersey Care NHS Trust Joe Rafferty has been chief executive of the Mersey Care NHS mental health trust since September 2012. Prior to joining Mersey Care, he was a director of commissioning support at the NHS Commissioning Board, where he had national responsibility for the design and delivery of a significant reforms. Rafferty has worked in the health service for more than 25 years, having joined the NHS general management training scheme in 1999. From 2007 to 2010, he was chief executive of NHS Central Lancashire, with an annual commissioning budget of \u00a3750m. At Mersey Care, Rafferty has set up a number of initiatives that have gained national recognition, including the trust's No Force First strategy, which aims to eliminate the need for seclusion and physical or pharmacological restraint on people who are mentally ill, a commitment to a zero suicide strategy for people in the trust's care and a partnership with Stanford University to build on the use of incident data. He is part of an NHS trade mission to China. Helen Reynolds, director, Social for the People Helen Reynolds was one of the first people to understand the potential of digital communication to promote engagement in the public sector. She began using social media in local government in 2007, with a MySpace page dedicated to getting people to help a council restore a town hall. Since 2011, Reynolds has run a social media consultancy to help government, public sector and charity organisations communicate online. Before that, she worked for nine years in comms at Monmouthshire council, using her knowledge to revolutionise the way the council communicated and engaged with its residents. Other previous roles include developing a social media strategy for the Social Care Partnership in south east Wales. Her work has been recognised through several awards, including coming 16th on the 2014 list of 100 UK digital leaders. Zoe Sweet, director, leadership &amp; organisation development, Academi Wales Zoe Sweet has been director of organisation development for public services in Wales since 2009, initially working for Public Service Management Wales, which in 2013 became Academi Wales, the strategic centre for leadership excellence across the Welsh public service, including the NHS.

Sweet is described by colleagues as an inspiring, resourceful leader, able to find creative solutions to longstanding problems. Carolyn Wilkins, chief executive, Oldham council Carolyn Wilkins has been chief executive of Oldham council since May 2014, having been interim chief executive since the end of the previous year. As well as managing a large council she is the lead for the development of services to tackle complex dependency across Greater Manchester.
