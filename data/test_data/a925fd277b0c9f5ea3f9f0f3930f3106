  "content": "The assistant manager of a prestigious stud yard hanged himself after being outed as an author of a spoof Twitter account that poked fun at the Queen's racing adviser, an inquest heard on Tuesday. Father-of-one Derek Larkin, 32, was found dead in a barn days after an anonymous source claimed he was behind an account falsely set up in the name of John Warren. The profile \u2013 under the tag \"Lord\" John Warren \u2013 posted jokes about the racing world, quips about celebrities and the royal family. It also sought to puncture the supposed self-importance of Warren, who is the Queen's bloodstock and racing adviser \u2013 though not a lord \u2013 and regularly entertains royalty at his exclusive Highclere Stud in Berkshire. Larkin became increasingly frantic after an anonymous email named him as one of the authors of the account. Fearing he would lose his job and family, he hanged himself. Speaking after the inquest in Salisbury, Wiltshire, his widow, Laura, said Larkin took his life to \"save his family from the shame he thought he had brought upon himself and the stud he worked at\". She added: \"Derek took his life in the misguided belief we would all be better off without him. However misguided, it was a pure act of love and care on his part.\" The email naming Larkin, who worked at the Biddestone Stud, in Chippenham, Wiltshire, was sent to high profile members of the racing community in March. Larkin initially denied being involved but then contacted his friend, James Morgan, who was also involved in the account. Morgan, a bloodstock manager, said: \"He texted me very early in the morning saying 'I have been rumbled'.\" \"He thought he was going to lose his job, his wife and his home. \"I told him he needed to come clean and that I was going to come clean with him.\" Larkin finally told his wife he was involved in the account. She told the inquest: \"He came home barely able to talk to me, his mouth was very dry and he had little expression. \"He just came in and said: 'I have got the sack, I am going to lose my job'. \"He said that what he had told me about the Lord John Warren account was a lie and that he had been involved in it. He said that he was not the person running it, that was James Morgan, and that he knew he shouldn't have done it. Then he just said, 'I have to go, I have to go'.\" Later he was found hanged in a barn in a nearby village. Coroner David Ridley, recording that Derek took his own life, said: \"At some point after 4pm on 3 April 2013 Derek drove to a remote farm building and hanged himself. \"I am sure the appropriate conclusion is that he took his own life. I don't think we will ever understand what truly went on in Derek's head and why he felt the need to do what he did.\""
