  "content": "Facebook has acquired photo-sharing app Instagram, a two-year-old start-up, for $1 billion in cash and shares. The deal was announced by Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook \u2013 but Instagram users immediately took to social networks to denounce the deal. For many, Facebook is already an internet hate-figure \u2013 and the prospect of an internet behemoth swallowing up a popular start-up seems to have caused a pretty strong backlash. At BreakingViews, Robert Cyran thought the acquisition a defensive move by Facebook, keen to retain the \"whip hand\" in mobile photo-sharing. But he worried about the implications: The precedent is worrisome, though, if it means every time a startup encroaches on one of Facebook's presumed strengths it will need to take out its pocketbook to defend its turf. That's hardly a robust justification for a lofty valuation. At The Verge, Chris Ziegler raged at Instagram's basic premise, giving bad photographers a false sense of \"artisanship\". But you're not an artist. If you were an artist, you wouldn't be using Instagram in the first place. You certainly wouldn't be using a filter as a crutch. At the end of the day, that's what Instagram filters are: a crutch, a misguided replacement for a properly composed shot and a decent sensor. Here are more responses to the sale, and we're collecting more of your reactions. Tweet us @GuardianUS, or share your thoughts in the comments below. Guardian commentator Charlie Brooker mused on the ubiquitous nature of Facebook. At this rate Facebook's going to end up owning the rights to all actual human faces. \u2014 Charlie Brooker (@charltonbrooker) April 9, 2012 Marketer Monica van Leer had a personal response: I had a higher opinion of you Instagram. But now...http://bit.ly/IjrhVR \u2014 Monica Van Leer (@MonicaVanLeer) April 9, 2012 Gabriel Snyder, editor of The Atlantic Wire, compared it unfavorably to Microsoft's decision to buy AOL patents. If I had $1 billion to spend, I think I'd actually prefer patents to a social network. \u2014 Gabriel Snyder (@gabrielsnyder) April 9, 2012 Harry McCracken of Time magazine drew lessons from history: Trying to remember the last time that a large Silicon Valley company buying a small Silicon Valley company wasn't bad news. \u2014 Harry McCracken (@harrymccracken) April 9, 2012 Stockholm media planner Helen Alfvegren suggested Facbeook had overpaid for a ephemeral product: @instagram Hey guys, thank you for such an amazing app! Have you heard from Gowalla lately? \u2014 Helen Alfvegren (@rockspindeln) April 9, 2012 ... as did Al Shaw of ProPublica. In conclusion, Gowalla. \u2014 Al Shaw (@A_L) April 9, 2012 Chris Ziegler, an editor at The Verge in Chicago, wondered whether Instagram's technology was all that innovative anyway. mark zuckerberg entering instagram HQ and discovering hundreds of college interns setting photos on window ledges to age in the sun. \u2014 Chris Ziegler (@zpower) April 9, 2012 Guardian reader @DaisyFrisco tweeted us with this: Dear Zuck: You can buy groovy apps, but you can't buy fickle app users. Congrats to Instagram on cashing in big stylee. (@GuardianUS) \u2014 Ange (to my friends) (@DaisyFrisco) April 9, 2012 And Ant de Rosa of Reuters felt sorry for a predecessor. How sad do you think the Hipstagram founders are today? \u2014 Anthony De Rosa (@AntDeRosa) April 9, 2012 ... by which, he meant... (sorry, I meant Hipstamatic) \u2014 Anthony De Rosa (@AntDeRosa) April 9, 2012",
