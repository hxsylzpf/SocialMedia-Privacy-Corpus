  "content": "MySpace is to make its first move into print publishing through a deal to turn an edition of UK style magazine Marmalade over to user generated content. Marmalade's March issue will feature cover-to-cover MySpace content submitted by users. MySpace users can make themselves and their work known via Marmalade's profile on the website myspace.com/marmalademag, and the magazine's editorial staff will also be trawling MySpace to find talent. The deadline for content for Marmalade's March issue is January 26. The aim is to tap into the 70-plus million regular users of MySpace to find talented up-and-coming creatives who use the social networking site to promote themselves through their online profiles. Marmalade, which competes with i-D and Dazed &amp; Confused, has carved out a reputation for discovering and championing new trends and talent in the fields of music, film, art and fashion. \"MySpace is the ultimate democratic medium where anyone with talent can showcase their work,\" said Jamie Kantrowitz, the senior vice-president of marketing and content at MySpace Europe. \"Through our partnership with Marmalade we hope to translate this DIY quality into print, and hand the reins over to undiscovered creatives with fresh ideas.\" The magazine is also going to hunt for journalists, photographers, stylists and illustrators to produce three reportage pieces, profiles and a featured interview for its March issue. \"We are consistently bombarded with reels, portfolios, fanzines, demos and brilliant ideas from Marmalade readers so throwing it open to the whole of MySpace is a complete no-brainer,\" said Kirsty Robinson, co-editor of Marmalade. Past contributors to the magazine, which has a circulation of 30,000, include writer Irvine Welsh and Vogue creative director Robin Derrick. MySpace's deal marks a fledgling step by the social networking website to leverage the popularity of its web brand to multiple platforms. In May, MySpace tied-up with US title Nylon to help create the magazine's seventh annual online music issue. And in August it was rumoured that MySpace was looking to extend the relationship and create a spin-off print magazine for its users featuring their content. However, the magazine did not materialise. A spokeswoman for MySpace in the UK said that the deal with Marmalade marked the website's first foray into print publishing. On the advertising sales front both Google and Yahoo! have in recent months made significant moves to start offering advertisers the option of placing ads in other media. Both have branched into newspaper advertising, while Google also offers the opportunity to book magazine and radio ads. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
