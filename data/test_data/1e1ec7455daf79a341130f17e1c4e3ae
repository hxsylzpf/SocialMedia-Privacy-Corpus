  "content": "About 84% of Australian telecommunication service providers are not ready to implement the national data retention scheme, which came into force on Tuesday. According to an anonymous survey by industry group the Communications Alliance, just 10 of the 63 telcos were ready to retain and encrypt customer data by October 13, the deadline set by the legislation that passed in March. The survey also found that two-thirds of telcos were either not confident at all or only somewhat confident that they correctly understood what data they were required to retain and for how long. Only 11% were very confident that they understood their obligations. Only 58% had lodged a data retention implementation plan with government - the deadline for that passed in August - and of those who had lodged an implementation plan, 75% were yet to hear back from government. The scheme will require telcos in Australia to keep the metadata of their customers \u2013 which includes certain types of phone, internet and location data \u2013 for two years, ostensibly for use in anti-terrorism investigations. John Stanton, the chief executive of the Communications Alliance, said most telcos were still trying to determine how the legislation ought to be interpreted, how to update their systems, and how much of the cost of those upgrades would be covered by the $131m promised by the federal government to assist service providers. That government assistance package, which is targeted toward smaller telcos, will not be enough. Many have found the cost of complying with the legislation is even greater than expected. \"Six months was never enough (time) but that was the legislated deadline,\" Stanton told Guardian Australia. \"The fact that the government hasn't yet decided how to distribute the the money it allocated in the budget suggests it wasn't enough time for them, either.\" The attorney general, George Brandis, told ABC's AM programme on Tuesday that the data retention scheme had been \"very thoroughly discussed with industry\" and that telcos would be given 18 months to apply for an extension of their compliance obligations. That would see full compliance in April 2017. \"Our objective here is to ensure that there is compliance ... we are more concerned with implementation than law enforcement,\" Brandis said. Brandis said the obligation on telcos was \"expressed very clearly in the legislation,\" and that the uniform standard of data required was \"set out with particularity\". \"This is an important national security obligation,\" he said. \"We do, frankly, expect the industry to assume a large part of this burden.\" But Stanton said the legislation was not explicit about the exact data that telcos were required to retain, adding that it was \"probably impossible to put that down in legislation.\" \"If George Brandis had been part of the conversations among service providers as they have all compared their notes and tried to figure out the elements of particular sections, he would know that it's not explicit what's to be retained and what's not,\" he said. Telstra, Australia's largest provider, says it is ready to retain customers' metadata.. \"Telstra is one of the few \u2013 if not the only one \u2013 telecommunications providers that has submitted a data retention plan and had it approved by the government,\" Telstra chairwoman, Catherine Livingstone, told shareholders at the company's annual general meeting on Tuesday. \"So, we are organised to do this and will implement it over 18 months.\"",
