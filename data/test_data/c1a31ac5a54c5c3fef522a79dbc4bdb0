  "content": "One of the men behind MySpace is calling for a federal investigation of the site's purchase by Rupert Murdoch. Brad Greenspan, who helped found MySpace's former owner, Intermix Media, has launched a scathing attack on the sale of the popular website, claiming that senior executives conspired to dispose of the brand for a criminally low price. The site, which was sold for $580m (\u00a3310m) to Mr Murdoch's News Corporation in July last year, has become one of the most popular destinations on the web. It has more than 100 million registered users, and one analyst has said the company could be worth $15bn within three years. Mr Greenspan alleges that this expectation was clear to the Intermix board when News Corp made its offer. He has put the claims online, at a website called freemyspace.com. On it Mr Greenspan alleges that the chief executive Richard Rosenblatt led a concerted effort to keep information about the site's spectacular growth from shareholders. \"Deliberate steps were taken to withhold and manipulate information,\" claims Mr Greenspan on the site. \"Money was improperly gained and laws were broken. It is my hope that regulatory bodies will begin their investigations quickly, before evidence is destroyed.\" At the time of the sale, Mr Greenspan had no active involvement in the company, after being forced out amid an investigation into its affairs by the securities and exchange commission, the US financial watchdog. He still owned a substantial share of the company, believed to be about 11%, which netted him $47m in the Murdoch deal. Critics say he is merely fishing for more cash rather than making a legitimate complaint. \"It's unfortunate that Mr Greenspan continues to issue press releases complaining about a deal that many industry experts initially believed was a risk for News Corp to take,\" a spokeswoman for the company's Fox Interactive Media division said. \"We've strategically built this business since the acquisition and are just now beginning to realise real financial value. This is simply a case of sour grapes making for loud complaints.\""
