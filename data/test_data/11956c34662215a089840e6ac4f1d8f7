  "content": "Though the President's mistress (mark two) won her privacy case against Closer, instant wisdom says she really lost it because the magazine had to pay her just \u20ac15,000. What Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Julie Gayet (right) might call a no-score draw. Are the French really so tough on extra-marital gossiping after all? Rather more reflective wisdom produces a second opinion: \u20ac15,000 is getting close to the top European tariff for cases that balance article 10 of the Strasbourg convention (your right to know) against article eight (your right to be left in the dark). It's only UK civil law, with our bewigged friends trading in hundreds of thousands of pounds, that makes Gayet's result look puny. Even the French don't value privacy as ripely as they like to in the Strand."
