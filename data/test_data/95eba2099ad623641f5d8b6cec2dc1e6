  "content": "The life of a British teenager who attempted suicide by taking an overdose was saved following an extraordinary transatlantic police operation involving the Facebook website, the British embassy in Washington, Scotland Yard and Thames Valley police. The alert began when the 16-year-old boy, who had contacted a girl in Maryland, US, on the social networking site Facebook, told her he was about to kill himself. The girl's shocked mother phoned Maryland police, who, via a White House special agent, contacted the British embassy which in turn alerted police in London. Thames Valley officers were contacted at 12.25am on Thursday morning, because it was believed the boy attended a school somewhere in Oxfordshire. Knowing only his first name, detectives used Google and the electoral register to narrow his location to eight potential addresses in the county. They began checking each of the addresses and finally found the teenager, who has not been named, at the fourth address - on the outskirts of Oxford - unconscious in his bedroom. He was rushed to hospital, where he made a full recovery. Chief Superintendent Brendan O'Dowda, who led the operation for Oxfordshire police, said: \"We really didn't have much to go on. It was just scant information.\"",
