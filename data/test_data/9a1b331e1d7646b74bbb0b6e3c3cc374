  "content": "There's a particularly enjoyable feeling of suspicion when flicking through the papers on 1 April, though I do wonder if we shouldn't adopt the same sceptical approach for every other day of the year... But here's a few April Fool stories we spotted this morning. Have we missed any? \u2022 It's nothing to do with me! The Guardian is scrapping the paper in favour of Twitter. Not the most subtle April Fool but the sample Tweets from the archive are great: \"JFK assassin8d @ Dallas, def. heard second gunshot from grassy knoll WTF?\" There's also the obligatory Daily Mail dig, saying the paper has launched an iPhone application \"with a one-click facility for reporting suspicious behaviour by migrants or gays.\" Check out the Tech department's contribution, too. \u2022 We're not quite sure about this one: the Daily Mirror claims the first exclusive interview with the Deal or No Deal banker to mark the 1,000th edition of the show. If it is an April Fool, it's very long for something not that funny. \u2022 Football fans are bracing themselves for a six-minute rendition of the Ukranian national anthem at tonight's World Cup qualifier match, says the Sun. \"Ukraine's anthem will be sung by folk star Furstov Aprylova, who hails from capital Kiev.... And in a dig at its former Soviet rulers, the tune ends: 'Kiev, Kiev - there is no such thing as a Chicken Moscow...'\" \u2022 There's tartan sheep in the Times (though no link online), the Independent says Egyptian queen Nefertiti had a facelift and the Telegraph has gone for harnessing the power of fish to supplement Britain's electricity needs. Rib-tickling stuff. \u2022 The Economist is launching a theme park as part of the wider diversification of its business. \"As part of a strategy designed to broaden the revenue base, leverage content over new platforms and promote The Economist brand to a young and dynamic audience, The Economist Group is delighted to announce the development of a public-entertainment facility that combines the magic of a theme park with the excitement of macroeconomics...\" We can't wait for Econoland to open. \u2022 The Daily Mail managed to combine its April Fool with a further twist of the knife, Photoshopping home Home Secretary Jacqui Smith so she appears to be exiting Ann Summers. \"Considering her husband's rather adventurous viewing habits, Jacqui Smith would be perfectly justified in showing her own broad-minded streak...\" Never knowingly under-dug. \u2022 I've looked through the FT, and unless we count \"Nestle chairman warns on inflation risks\" or \"Laura Ashley profits halve as costs of extra promotions bite\", I can't see anything. \u2022 Anchor Butter claims Google Street View has ruined its new TV ad campaign by capturing cows not in those idyllic pastures but roaming across London. That's not butter I'd like to eat. \u2022 Online, meanwhile, we have the global collection of Web 2.0 scents at smellr.com including Isolation by Mark Zuckerberg, Modesty by Mike Arrington and Loquacious by Ev Williams. My favourite: Humility, by Jason Calacanis. YouTube has a new look with interesting implications for the 'thumbs up ratings', and there's acres more tech tomfoolery at TechCrunch. \u2022 Elsewhere, ITV has to apologise because Linda Bellingham said 'bastards' on Loose Women, desperate record label EMI has partnered with a lottery firm to try and make some cash and Sacha Baron Cohen is teaming up with Bono and Chris Martin to launch a spoof charity single to promote his new Bruno film. \"For people of Africa who live in hell/They will never wear Chanel.\" And the Mirror also says we're in for a long, hot summer. \u2022 The BBC website features exclusive first images of the shark-whale. Stephen Fry and naturalist Mark Cawardine front a film in which they discover the mythical creature, which is half whale, half \u2013 yep, you guessed it \u2013 shark. While it doesn't quite scale the heights of last year's inspired April Fool's Day spoof in which ex-Python Terry Jones apparently discovered a whole species of flying penguins, it does have its moments, such as when Cawardine says \"This is just like discovering the Loch Ness Monster\". Like the penguins, which promoted the fledgling iPlayer service, this year's wheeze aims to promote Beeb content, this time Fry and Cawardine's forthcoming BBC2 natural history show Last Chance to See. I just can't tell any more..."
