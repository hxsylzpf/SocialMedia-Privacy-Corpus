  "content": "British businesses aren't hurrying to follow their government in pledging free access to non-personal datasets they collect, a new study has found. Of those surveyed, 68% said that they would not be prepared to open up access to their own data - despite recognising that sharing data could bring commercial benefits, according to a study by Informatic Corporation, which sells data integration software. However, companies are keen that the government should continue with its plans to increase access to public data, such as the Ordnance Survey's OpenData scheme and the measures put in place to make more non-personal central and local datasets available through services such as the data.gov.uk portal. Among the reasons that the companies gave for not opening up their own data were: \u2022 Corporate privacy (43%) \u2022 Protection of intellectual property (32%) \u2022 Concerns that online data may be mismanaged (29%), which could result in poor quality information and a loss of data value. Even so, 83% of businesses surveyed believe they should be entitled to greater access to public sector data: \u2022 32% believe that access to this data should be a right for businesses and the public \u2022 61% of businesses have no concerns around the exposure of public sector data \u2022 46% think that greater access to public data would provide commercial insight \u2022 43% believe access to this data would provide practical business benefits. This report was conducted on behalf of Informatica by LM Research in April 2010. It surveyed 1,000 national and multinational businesses with 100 employees or more from across the UK. In April Ordnance Survey released a number of its mapping products for free commercial reuse, including a postcode-to-location dataset. On 24 June the Prime Minister, David Cameron, chaired the first meeting of the government's Public Transparency Board which declared that public data should be released under an open licence that enables free commercial re-use, and in a machine-readable format. But businesses are less willing to join in - possibly because they see a commercial risk in being making their data available if others do not reciprocate. While a number of companies participate in open source software projects such as the Linux operating system and Apache web server, to which companies such as IBM and Sun have been substantial contributors, that is some distance from making data - even anonymised - about the business visible to rivals. \"These results reveal a serious disconnect in attitudes of the business and public sector communities when it comes to sharing data online. But with many multinationals and governing bodies pledging open data initiatives, data transparency looks set to become the status quo,\" said John Poulter, senior vice president, EMEA, Informatica. \"We operate in an increasingly digital society, where knowledge sharing has become central for day to day business. Prospective customers are more likely to engage with companies that they feel provide them with added value and insight and it is increasingly important for businesses to recognise, this when embracing digital practices.\" The same proportion - 83% - of businesses which thought they should have access to public sector data said they would use it to identify new commercial opportunities - which indicates that the freeing of that data should have the effect intended of both increasing government transparency and encouraging commercial exploitation of the data. In the survey, 78% said they would utilise the data as a point of reference when making future investment decisions, and 76% would use it to build knowledge of their customer base. Having greater access to public data would provide the opportunity to make their company more agile and competitive, respondents said. \"If the government executes its plans effectively, businesses have the potential opportunity to use this data to suit their business needs,\" said Poulter. \"In order for its plans to open up public sector data to be successful, it is vital that the government puts the right measures in place to ensure that the available data is managed correctly; relevant, structured and precise.\" Poulter added: \"While the value of increased access to data is clear, it's understandable that businesses worry about what competitors would be able to do if they opened up the windows to their world. By harnessing their own data and sharing information, businesses could build their customer knowledge even further, providing potential customers with greater insight into their business, whilst at the same time ensuring that confidential data remains protected.\"",
