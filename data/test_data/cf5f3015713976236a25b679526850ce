  "content": "What is content marketing and how can it help your company grow? Definitions vary but, to put it simply, it is any content you create to promote your business; which might include videos, blogs and social media posts. It should be relevant and useful to your target audience and should represent your business's expertise. An online fashion brand might regularly blog about celebrity style to boost website traffic, for example. While a computer software company could offer how-to videos for solving common IT problems. Used well, content marketing can help build awareness of, and trust in, your company. In a 2013 study by content marketing agency Seven, 57% of consumers agreed they felt more positive towards brands that produced content for them, compared to just 10% that had a positive attitude towards advertising. But which medium is most effective? According to the Content Marketing Association's 2015 industry report, photos and memes account for the biggest proportion of shared content (33%). Meanwhile, video is responsible for 50% of all mobile traffic. Tapping into your target audience's interests and producing something they'll want to share with their friends and peers is key. Whether you're a prolific small business blogger or a novice tweeter, our expert panel will be available for a Q&amp;A to offer advice on using content marketing to grow your venture.
