  "content": "\u2022 European competition regulators are due to rule on the long-standing Intel antitrust case this week - and Reuters is reporting those old \"sources familiar with the case\" who say that Intel is set to be found guilty of coercing computer manufacturers to favour its technology over that of rivals. \u2022 American military officials have said they would not rule out responding to a cyberattack with physical force, according to Stars and Stripes. We recently reported on Nato officials suggesting that a virtual A-bomb could be required to prevent future internet attacks - but with language like that, it's a shot across the bows of President Obama's cybersecurity review, which we're told is due this week. \u2022 Some interesting reading over the weekend, including this piece from Thomas Crampton, highlighting the New York Times' botched closure of the International Herald Tribune's website. Particularly intriguing when you consider the reports that Rupert Murdoch is considering pay-for-news models, including micropayments at the Wall Street Journal.
