  "content": "President George Bush last night decried the slaying of kidnapped American journalist Daniel Pearl at the hands of Islamic extremists, saying such crimes \"only deepen the resolve of the United States\" to fight terrorism. A grim-faced Mr Bush spoke from a lectern at his hotel in Beijing on the last day of his six-day Asia tour. \"Laura and I and the American people are deeply saddened to learn about the loss of Daniel Pearl's life,\" the president said. \"We are really sad for his wife and his parents and his friends and colleagues who have been clinging to hopes for weeks that he would be found alive.\" Pearl's wife, Mariane, is seven months pregnant with their first child. Mr Bush expressed special sympathy for the unborn baby, \"who will now know his father only through the memory of others\". \"All Americans are sad and angry to learn of the murder,\" the president said. \"May God bless Daniel Pearl.\" Noting the presence of other American journalists, as well as diplomats and humanitarian aid workers, in other countries, Bush warned any would-be kidnappers not to stir US outrage with attacks or more abductions. \"Those who would threaten Americans, those who would engage in criminal, barbaric acts need to know that these crimes only hurt their cause, and only deepen the resolve of the United States of America to rid the world of these agents of terror,\" Mr Bush said. The state department announced Pearl's death based on evidence received at the US embassy in Pakistan. State department spokesman Richard Boucher did not reveal details about the evidence, but two US officials said the FBI was evaluating the authenticity of a videotape purportedly showing Pearl either dead or being killed. In Washington, lawmakers in Congress expressed shock and outrage at Pearl's death, and demanded that American and Pakistani investigators quickly bring his killers to justice. \"Daniel Pearl was a public servant in the truest sense,\" said house minority leader Dick Gephardt. \"This is a true American tragedy.\" The Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles said Pearl had been targeted \"merely because he was an American and a Jew\". In New York, the Committee to Protect Journalists called Pearl's death \"brutal, wanton, and senseless\". \"His loss will be felt most by those who knew him best, but all of us are diminished because we have been deprived of his unique voice,\" the CPJ said. \"Danny was sceptical, critical, and courageous in his reporting. He believed firmly in the truth, and he died searching for it.\" AP"
