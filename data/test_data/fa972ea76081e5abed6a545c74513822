  "content": "Johann Hari, Independent, Tuesday, 17 August 2004. Interview with Italian Marxist Antonio Negri \"He leans back as though he has brilliantly rebutted any critique of communism. So, is he seriously saying that we should never look at history, that the left should carry on as though communism was a great success, that we should not reconsider our values at all? 'Look, a truth is a collective action on the part of persons who campaign together and who transform themselves,' he says.\" Anne Dufourmantelle, in the book Negri on Negri (2003), quoting Negri \"A truth is a collective action on the part of persons who campaign together and who transform themselves.\" Johann Hari, Independent, Friday 24 September 2010. Interview with Gideon Levy, Israeli journalist \"What would happen if the Palestinians had not fired Qassams [rockets shot at southern Israel]? Would Israel have lifted the economic siege? Nonsense. If the Gazans were sitting quietly, as Israel expects them to do, their case would disappear from the agenda. Nobody would give any thought to the fate of the people of Gaza if they had not behaved violently.\" Article by Gideon Levy, 9 July 2006 \"What would have happened if the Palestinians had not fired Qassams? Would Israel have lifted the economic siege that it imposed on Gaza? Would it open the border to Palestinian laborers? Free prisoners? Meet with the elected leadership and conduct negotiations? Encourage investment in Gaza? Nonsense. If the Gazans were sitting quietly, as Israel expects them to do, their case would disappear from the agenda \u2013 here and around the world. Israel would continue with the convergence, which is solely meant to serve its goals, ignoring their needs. Nobody would have given any thought to the fate of the people of Gaza if they did not behave violently.\""
