  "content": "The hotel where Jeremy Clarkson had his \"fracas\" with producer Oisin Tymon is to instal a plaque that reads: \"Here lies the BBC career of Jeremy Clarkson. Who had a fracas on this spot 4th March 2015. The rest is legend.\" Simonstone Hall says in a post on Facebook: \"We were presented with this plaque from one of our guests last night! We think it would be quite appropriate to put it on the patio where the fracas took place!!\" Although the donor remains anonymous, suggestions it was sent by Amazon are understood to be wide of the mark."
