  "content": "The high-level Gmail hacking attacks that Google has blamed on China were first made public more than three months ago. The attacks were exposed by Mila Parkour, an IT worker and blogger, on her \"personal interest blog\" Contagio in February. \"I just shared my analysis, hoping it might help others,\" Parkour \u2013 who posts under a pseudonym \u2013 told the Guardian. On Wednesday Google used its own blog to allege that Chinese hackers have stolen Gmail login details of hundreds of senior US and South Korean government officials, as well as Chinese political activists. Google said that as well as using its own security systems it relied on user reports and an \"external report\" to uncover the Gmail-hacking attacks. The external report it referred to was a post by Parkour on 17 February. \"I did not officially notify Google as it was not a new type of attack,\" the blogger said. \"I did a mini research and analysis and posted the findings as I heard it happened to other people in the military and the US government. \"I did not realise it had as many victims as [Google] made it sound on their post.\" Parkour said she works \"in general IT \u2026My day job is not associated with malware. Contagio is a personal interest blog and I post items I find interesting or those that may help prevent future victims.\" She received information on the attacks from a source, whom she has not named, on 16 or 17 February. \"I was not the one who discovered the attack in question, I just shared my analysis, hoping it might help others.\" Parkour, who is based in Washington, set up Contagio in May 2009. The 17 February post is headlined: \"Targeted attacks against personal accounts of military, government employees and associates.\" Parkour wrote that the method used \u2013 called spear phishing \u2013 was \"far from being new or sophisticated\" but described it as \"particularly invasive\". Her description of how the attack works matches accounts given by Google. \"Victims get a message from an address of a close associate or a collaborating organisation/agency, which is spoofed,\" she wrote. \"The message is crafted to appear like it has an attachment with links like View Download and a name of the supposed attachment. The link leads to a fake Gmail login page for harvesting credentials.\" Parkour included screenshots of phishing emails \u2013 some of which were dated February 2011 \u2013 and included a \"spot the difference\" comparison between the fake Gmail login page that the scam directed users to and the authentic Gmail page. Parkour said once the hackers had victims' password they may \"create rules to forward all incoming mail to another account. The third party account ID is made to closely resemble the victim's ID.\" On its blogpost Google itself described the threat in similar terms: \"The goal of this effort seems to have been to monitor the contents of these users' emails, with the perpetrators apparently using stolen passwords to change people's forwarding and delegation settings.\" Asked about the length of time Google took before announcing the attack, Parkour said: \"I think it is great they took time to unravel and find more victims and try to trace it. \"It has been three months and considering that hundreds of victims are involved, it is not too long.\""
