  "content": "The days of dancing your heart out in a dingy nightclub are no more \u2013 today's young people seem to prefer a quiet night in instead, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In its latest trend report the ONS dropped the price of nightclub admission from the list of common goods and services used to calculate inflation. Hundreds of clubs have closed in recent years and the shift to free or low-cost entry for many of those that remain meant the prices were harder for the ONS to gather. The demise of nightclubbing has been attributed, in part, to the smoking ban, and to relaxed licensing laws that make pubs and bars more appealing options for late-night drinking. It's also been suggested that millennials \u2013 those aged between 18 and 35 \u2013 now prefer to socialise via social media sites (Facebook, Snapchat etc), rather than meeting face to face. We want to hear from our younger readers about whether this is really the case. Is clubbing a thing of the past? How do you like to spend your free time and socialise?
