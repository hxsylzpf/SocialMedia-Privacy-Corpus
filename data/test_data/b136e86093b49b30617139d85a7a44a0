  "content": "Princess Madeleine of Sweden has returned to her native country, claiming she could not cope with the attentions of the paparazzi. The 19-year-old, who is third in line to the throne, has become an increasing source of interest to press photographers while studying in London. The decision to quit Britain follows a press conference last year at the Swedish embassy to ask for \"peace and quiet\" from the media. But press and agency photographers have been increasingly interested in the so called \"bicycling monarchies\" of Scandinavia, after a series of scandals. Princess Madeleine's sister, Crown Princess Victoria, has been the subject of unwanted attention due to an eating disorder. The Norwegian royal family is also a source of interest to paparazzi, after Crown Prince Haakon married Mette-Marit Tjessem Hoiby, who already had a child by a former drug user. The wedding - last August - stoked considerable tabloid interest from European newspapers curious to know more about the \"permissive\" Scandinavian royals. But newspaper picture desk sources said so far the Scandinavian royals had failed to fill the void left by the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. One executive on a daily tabloid picture desk expressed surprise at the princess's decision to return home, noting the paper only had some four or five stock photographs of her in its picture archives, none of which were shot by paparazzi photographers. Another claimed interest in Princess Madeleine was generated largely by publications in continental Europe, including Spanish Hola! And a variety of Swedish and German celebrity and gossip magazines.",
