  "content": "The conference tracking tool Lanyrd introduced its first paid-for service on Thursday, offering businesses a group management tool for executives and developers on the tech conference circuit. Facebook, Github, Stamen and Y Combinator are among the launch companies, which will pay $99 per month or $1070 annually to manage and promote their speaker listings, branded profiles, and slides and videos from their presentations through Lanyrd Pro. Lanyrd is also developing tablet and mobile apps for delegates. The service connects to social networking profiles to suggest and track recommended conferences among friends and colleagues. Chief executive Simon Willison said: \"There are no plans to charge individual users, though lots of them are already using Lanyrd as part of larger teams \u2013 Github and Facebook already have hundreds of users. This won't be the only commercial stream and we have more in the pipeline, but it is our first monthly, regular revenue stream and as a software-as-a-service company, that's very important.\" Willison said that by focusing on the buoyant tech industry, Lanyrd had been largely protected from a broader economic downturn which has resulted in some falls in conference attendance. He added that the business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in the conference calendar, with peaks in March, April and September. London-based Lanyrd was launched in August 2010 by Willison and Natalie Downe, and has received $1.4m funding from Index, PROFounders and a handful of angel investors including Esther Dyson, Blaine Cooke and Joi Ito."
