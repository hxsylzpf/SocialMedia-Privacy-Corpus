  "content": "One of the most vital considerations when planning a New Year's Eve party is making sure you get the music right. Do you go for a populist selection to get your guests dancing, or aim for something a bit more specialist? We asked @guardianmusic Twitter followers for some recommendations for an NYE playlist. We've popped the results here: New Year's Eve Party Music Spotify Playlist. It's a collaborative list, so feel free to add your own suggestions, or leave them in the comment thread below. @JonathanEx As it's 2012, why not End of the World - REM? @dennisbowrick Party Hard by @AndrewWK obvs @serap_tweets Prince - 1999. Even though that year has been and gone, still a great NYE theme. @HuwLHopkins @serap_tweets So is Will2K by Will Smith @serap_tweets And Jump around by House of Pain. Just cos it was always played at the NYE indie night in my home town. @tabithabang For self-indulgent gloominess it's gotta be Death Cab for Cutie's The New Year, surely @lisadevaney How about Celebration for the New Year's Eve party, by Kool &amp; The Gang? @harryrm Thank God It's Not Christmas by Sparks @jkalifornia Daft Punk One More Time - EVERY TIME. @gdpreston Eddie Murphy - Party All The Time @Red8Records Sam Cooke twisting the night away! @Muckian The Final Countdown by Europe What do you think? Do you have any better suggestions? Let us know below and, if you have Spotify, add them to the playlist.",
