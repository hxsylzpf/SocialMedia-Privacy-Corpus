  "content": "London-based Green Thing has a secret for surviving the downturn - because it's built on love, just as much as money. The site aims to be a public service that uses creativity to inspire people to change their lives to help reduce climate change, and is staffed by five full-timers and a army of volunteers backed by donations. With a background in advertising and new media, co-founders Andy Hobsbawm and Naresh Ramchandani are using their experience to campaign against everything from unseasonal vegetables to buying too much meat. Can they achieve their target of 100,000 subscribers by this time next year? \u2022 Explain your business to my Mum \"Green Thing is a public service that inspires people to lead a greener life. We use emails and a website and other online bits and pieces to share brilliant videos and inspiring stories from creative people and community members around the world. Green Thing is about creativity versus climate change, which means we use great creativity to make sustainable living smart, sexy, fashionable and fun and something worthwhile on its own terms to inspire people to behave differently. \"We give people seven things they can do to lead a greener life - all they have to do is do it: - You get from A to B without any C when you Walk The Walk - It's delicious but it causes more CO2 than cars so go Easy On The Meat - Resist the urge to buy the latest and Stick With What You Got - Turn down the central heating and turn up the Human Heat - The art of wasting nothing and using up everything: All-Consuming - Instead of jetting your way around the world, Stay Grounded - Don't leave it on or even put it on, Plug Out \"Green Thing members get emails talking about one of these featured Green Things to do, with links to brilliant creative content to inspire them to do it, and inspiring stories from other community members about how they're doing it. We also tell people how much CO2 they're saving individually and, crucially, how much the Green Thing community is saving together - that's almost nine thousand tonnes of reported CO2 so far and we suspect the actual savings are many times that.\" \u2022 How do you make money? \"Green Thing is a not-for-profit company that donates any profits to a registered charity: Green Thing Trust. We bring in revenue through a combination of sponsorship from the right brands, corporate social responsibility employee-engagement services to business, e-commerce referral, micro-donation and licensing/merchandising.\" \u2022 What's your background? \"Naresh worked at ad agency HHCL in the early 90s, co-founded St. Lukes in '95 and started Karmarama in 2000 and co-founded Green Thing with Andy in 2007. I've worked in new media since web browsers were invented in 1993 and co-founded the UK's first international new media agency Online Magic which later merged with Agency.com, where I'm still European chairman part-time.\" \u2022 Name your closest competitors \"We don't really think of having competitors since we're all trying to achieve the same thing - anyone that can help people live greener lives and save CO2 is alright by us. That's why we make all of our content freely available to anyone who wants to use it on their own sites.\" \u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months? \"In the first year and a half Green Thing's content has been seen 3.3m times by users from 199 countries who have told over 46,000 different stories etc about doing the Green Thing and saved nearly 9,000 tonnes of CO2. Our target is to reach 100,000 subscribers within the next 12 months - we're currently at 25,000.\" \u2022 Any weird business experiences so far? \"We've been pretty blown away by the goodwill and positivity of everyone we've met. Being not-for-profit takes things out of the what's-in-it-for-me market-based part of people's brains and puts it in a personal, social sphere. If that's not weird enough we could tell the story about the one-legged prostitute, a sack of mule tranquiliser and a scuba suit? \" \u2022 How do you plan to survive the financial crisis? \"We're probably more focused on planning to survive the environmental crisis but we'll concentrate on what we do best in the world, creatively inspiring people to lead greener lives. We asked our members recently what they thought about Green Thing and 80% of people said they trusted information Green Thing gives them on the environment. Two separate surveys last year said that just 10% of people in the UK and the US trust environmental information from the government or business. \"Climate change is only going to grow in importance as an issue; if anything, the current economic meltdown makes the need for a sustainable society and economy seem even more urgent. If we continue to build Green Thing as a passion brand that people trust to help them lead greener lives then we can make it self-sustaining and generate profits for the charity Green Thing Trust.\" \"My experience of having survived the first dot com crash will hopefully help. The challenge for all start-ups will be economic sustainability - in other words, getting enough funding to reach profitability. But since Green Thing is a not-for-profit and a registered charity, we are supported by donations from individuals and grants and foundations, rather than venture cash which is in short supply. We are also powered by love as much as money and have an army of volunteers and pro-bono corporate contributors supporting us.\" \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? \"Fundraising - and having a work/life balance while doing Green Thing and earning bread.\" \u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch? \"For tech we read people like Clay Shirky, Nicholas Carr, Yochai Benkler, Howard Rheingold, Kevin Kelly and Bruce Sterling. For green thinking we follow things like WorldChanging.com, Max Gladwell, the TED blog, Treehugger, La Marguerite and folk like John Grant, Jules Peck and Amory Lovins.\" \u2022 Who's your mentor? \"Official mentors are my dad and my old business partner Eamonn Wilmott. Unofficially - Nigel Tufnel, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, Inspector Jacques Clouseau and Modesty Blaise. \"Naresh's mentors are Steve Henry and Axel Chaldecott, and unofficial mentors are Jim Jarmusch, Frank Black, Dr Seuss and Charles Dickens.\" \u2022 What's the most important piece of software or web tool that you use each day? \"Email, my mobile phone, Google, Skype, Word, Photoshop, iMovie and Garageband.\" \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? \"In a place where a team of creative, artistic and commercial talent together with a global community of green things will be making a real difference to the fight against climate change. When as many people as possible in as many countries as possible are doing the Green Thing, and this people power is accelerating how quickly governments and business do the Green Thing too. \"By this point we plan to spend a lot of our time marvelling at the ingenuity and brilliance and commitment of individuals and groups all over the world who are using Green Thing to express themselves and their desire for change in innovative, fantastic ways which we could never have imagined. In that sense, Green Thing will have become what we always hoped it would be, a brand that's a platform/catalyst for ongoing change. Green Thing will have become everybody's thing.\" DoTheGreenThing.com What do you think? \u2022 Even as a non-profit, do you think this business is sustainable? \u2022 What possibilities do you see to create concerns founded on alternative business models like this?"
