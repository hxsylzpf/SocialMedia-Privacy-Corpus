  "content": "You're the prime minister of the UK and you've just got off the phone to the president of the US after a serious discussion about Russia and the Ukraine situation, so what do you do? Why, if you're David Cameron, post a picture of your phone call on Twitter to keep the public up to date \u2026 What you probably don't expect though, is a parodying reply from US comic Rob Delaney, swapping the phone for his toothpaste and joining the conversation \u2026 \u2026 which was then jumped on by Shakespearean actor and Hollywood star Sir Patrick Stewart, this time swapping the phone for some \u2026 er \u2026 wipes \u2026 Soon, everyone was getting getting in on the act. This man even brought a more literal translation of the cockney rhyming slang \"dog and bone\" to the party \u2026 Elsewhere, Cameron's tweet also prompted a slew of rewritten captions. But anyway, in more serious news \u2013 follow the latest developments in the Ukraine with our live blog here."
