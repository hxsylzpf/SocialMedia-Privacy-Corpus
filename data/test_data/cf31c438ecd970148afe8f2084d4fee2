  "content": "The historian Mary Beard has become the latest woman to receive a tweeted bomb threat, sent on the eve of a boycott by many users of Twitter in protest at the site's slow response to dealing with violent and obscene threats. Although many users stayed off the site, the hashtags #Twittersilence and #connectwithrespect were trending. Caroline Criado-Perez, whose savaging by trolls prompted outrage after she launched the successful campaign to keep a woman on bank notes, chose not to join the boycott. She tweeted: \"It is not how I choose to react. I choose 2 remain on twitter. I choose 2 #shoutback. And I choose not 2 stop even 4 a day #twittersilence.\" The Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has received rape threats, tweeted: \"Take a day off twitter, spend the day tweeting kitten pics \u2013 point is you can decide your actions not the trolls.\" On Saturday, after a week of escalating protests over Twitter's response to the threats, Tony Wang, Twitter's UK general manager, and Del Harvey, director of trust and safety, posted a promise of action on the Twitter UK blog, including instant report buttons for abuse to be gradually introduced on different platforms. Wang posted a series of tweets promising action. For many women it was too little too late. On Saturday night, the classicist and television presenter Mary Beard, the object of previous vicious personal abuse, received a bomb threat \u2013 similar in tone to those received by the Guardian columnist Hadley Freeman and others on Wednesday \u2013 which she reported to the police. She told the BBC: \"To be honest, I didn't actually intellectually feel I was in danger but I thought I was being harassed and I thought I was being harassed in a particularly unpleasant way.\" She then joined the boycott. Guardian columnist Suzanne Moore explained why she was joining the boycott: \"In cyberspace, as in the real world, they will not prevail. Join us or don't. The boycott has already worked. Because Twitter, the company, is nervy and watching its back. Hello? That's how it feels when strangers abuse you en masse.\" Predictably others disagreed, some forcefully. The author and playwright Bonnie Greer posted: \"#twittersilence is well-meaning, but most folks in this world have no voice. Talk for them. Talk the trolls out. Talk for ourselves. #nosilence.\" The archaeologist and television presenter Tony Pollard wrote: \"#twittersilence? No way! NEVER give bullies dead air \u2013 it gives their fist more velocity. Talk &amp; keep talking. That's empowerment. Rave on!\" The journalist Liz Jarvis took a similar line: \"The best way to stand up to bullies is to speak out. Which is why I'm not doing the #twittersilence. Let your voice be HEARD. #shoutback.\" However, many women, including comedian Sarah Millican, posted just before midnight on Saturday that they were joining the silence. \"As I'm observing the #TwitterSilence, I'll say thanks in advance to those who came to my show tmrw night. You were ace/alright.\" The columnist Caitlin Moran tweeted: \"To people saying they don't want to do the #twittersilence \u2013 that's fine. All may do as they please. I'm just \u2026 trying a thing\" and on Twitlonger she amplified: \"August the 4th is International Friendship Day, and, personally, I wanted to do something symbolic on that day, in the spirit of international friendship. \"In the last few weeks, I've seen women on Twitter being run to exhaustion by the volume of anonymous rape and violence tweets they've received \u2013 so many that even just blocking them is a full time job. I've seen my friends' Twitter bomb-threats ON THE NEWS. I've seen the messages escalate even AFTER someone's been arrested. AFTER. \"And, obviously, it's not just women. In the wake of this, we're now talking about the problem of online abuse towards people for their religion, race, sexuality and physicality. Essentially the problems of the most nightmare playground ever have been given a jet pack and a megaphone through the power of social networking.\" Some, clearly, welcomed the prospect of a peaceful Sunday without the need for constant updates. The author and columnist Owen Jones wrote: \"I'm on #trolliday tomorrow to stand with women facing abuse and threats. (Also it'll help force me to write my ruddy book.)\" To tweet or not to tweet \u2026 Columnist Caitlin Moran: \"To people saying they don't want to do the #twittersilence \u2013 that's fine. All may do as they please. I'm just \u2026 trying a thing.\" Author and playwright Bonnie Greer: \"#twittersilence is well-meaning, but most folks in this world have no voice. Talk for them. Talk the trolls out. Talk for ourselves. #nosilence\" Labour MP Stella Creasy: \"Take a day off twitter, spend the day tweeting kitten pics \u2013 point is you can decide your actions not the trolls.\" Novelist and former MP Louise Mensch: \"Maybe we need a 'sense of proportion' day on Twitter. Instead of #Twittersilence.\" Comedian Sarah Millican: \"As I'm observing the #TwitterSilence for 24 hours, I'll say thanks in advance to those who came to my show tmrw night. You were ace/alright.\" Historian Mary Beard: \"I am not replying today (yikes?). But sexist abuse is one thing, threats of violent decapitation quite another.\" Presenter and former editor Piers Morgan: \"I find that correcting trolls' spelling is a very effective revenge tactic. But you have to know how to spell to execute it. #twittersilence\". \u2022 This article was amended on 6 August 2013.
