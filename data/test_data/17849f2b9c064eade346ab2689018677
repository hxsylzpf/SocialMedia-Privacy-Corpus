  "content": "The #FreeTheNipple campaign \u2013 \"a reaction against censorship of the female nipple\" \u2013 and its detractors (Get it off your chest, G2, 7 April) may well have had a precedent in Elizabethan England. Woodcut illustrations of ballad-sheets, such as the Roxburghe Ballads, depict what purports to be a courtly fad for topless fashion, but which could equally have been a cynical sales ploy. The French ambassador diplomatically described seeing Queen Elizabeth dressed to reveal \"the whole of her bosom\" (\"tout sa gorge\"). Campaigners against such low-cut apparel railed against \"these naked paps\" with \"their round, roseate buds immodestly [laid] forth\" in unashamedly public display. Plus \u00e7a change\u2026 Austen Lynch Garstang, Lancashire"
