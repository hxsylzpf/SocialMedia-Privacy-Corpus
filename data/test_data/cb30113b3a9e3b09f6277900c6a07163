  "content": "Northcliffe Media has withdrawn its legal action over a Twitter account spoofing its chief executive, Steve Auckland. The regional publisher sued Twitter in the US to have the identity of the tweeter known as @UnSteveDorkland revealed. But the account holder successfully challenged the order and the media group has subsequently backed down. And Twitter said it would not unmask the tweeter. The still-anonymous tweeter described the case on Friday as \"shameful and unnecessary\". He commented: \"By withdrawing the case against me they have, finally, recognised the futility of their heavy-handed approach and the entirely baseless nature of all the accusations they threw at me in a vainglorious attempt to divert attention from the real issue, namely their idea that by throwing money and bullying tactics at someone you can throttle freedom of speech. \"They underestimated me, they underestimated my lawyer Frank Sommers and they underestimated the power of the worldwide internet community.\" The unidentified person, who is thought to have once had close ties to the company, had been spoofing Northcliffe's Auckland who argued that the tweets had made staff \"fear for their safety\". In documents filed to a Californian court at the beginning of July, Northcliffe's lawyers alleged that the tweeter had gained information about the company by hacking into a company email account. It also alleged he had posted information \"apparently obtained from surveillance of plaintiff's employees\". The company insisted it was employee safety alone which had prompted the action. The tweeter always maintained that his/her activities did not constitute an impersonation of Auckland, saying that the legal action \"reveals just how intellectually threadbare [Northcliffe's] attempt to subpoena Twitter is.\" A spokesperson for Northcliffe Media said that the company's action was \"not about freedom of speech, but about a barrage of anonymous tweets that amounted to cyber-bullying and harassment.\" The statement continued: \"We believed 700 tweets in four weeks indicated a disturbing obsession on the part of the anonymous writer. Further engagement through the courts would require direct involvement of the very staff we are anxious to protect, so the legal process has been halted. \"Free speech is the lifeblood of our newspapers and websites. Here, in weighing the rights of an anonymous writer against the rights of staff singled out by name, we believed it was reasonable to ask Twitter to supply the identity of the person making these comments. \"His or her intention may initially have been humorous, but these tweets went far beyond commentary and satire, causing pain and offence. We encourage humour in our business, but no workplace should be expected to tolerate an unrelenting flow of derogatory and degrading comments of questionable legality.\" The publisher believes the case \"raises serious questions about how to deal with people using social media to defame and harass whilst hiding behind a cloak of anonymity.\" Sources: BBC/Northcliffe Media",
