  "content": "Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is dealing with the contradictions of promoting free speech while running the world's biggest social network, after being called out on the gap between his words and Facebook policy. Zuckerberg, who has been outspoken in his support of Charlie Hebdo and freedom of speech in general following the attack on the magazine, posted a Facebook message about Sunday's vigil in the heart of Paris. \"You can't kill an idea,\" he wrote. \"It's inspiring to see the videos of more than two million people of all religions, ages, ethnicities and backgrounds come together to march in unity. \"As long as we are connected, then no attacks by extremists \u2013 not in Nigeria, not in Pakistan, not in the Middle East and not in France \u2013 can stand in the way of history's arc towards freedom and acceptance for all.\" But in comments on the post, Zuckerberg was taken to task for Facebook's earlier removal of a post by Pakistani actor Hamza Ali Abbasi that questioned the value of \"insulting\" speech. \"Freedom of expression includes criticism, disagreement or even rejection of faiths or ideology \u2026 but should not and must not allow 'insult',\" Abbasi had written. \"Would it be 'freedom of expression' if I brand black people as niggers or if I say Hitler was a messiah? Would I not be branded a racist or anti-semitic?\" The post was removed by Facebook, citing its \"community standards\" \u2013 but in the wake of the criticism that followed, Zuckerberg conceded that \"our team might have made a mistake\" and instructed Facebook vice-president Justin Osofsky to \"look into\" it. A few hours later, Osofsky confirmed that Facebook wasn't supporting the removal. \"We made a mistake in taking this down,\" he said. \"We try to do our best, but sometimes make mistakes. We apologise for this error, and hope that the author will re-post it as we are not able to restore it from our end. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.\" Zuckerberg's strong response to the Hebdo attack has thrown Facebook's attitude to free speech into the public eye again. The social network is among the least permissive online, and is famous for removing content, including pictures of breastfeeding mothers, that it decides is in violation of its community standards. That has led some to ask what, exactly, Zuckerberg means when he expresses his support for Hebdo. \"Facebook doesn't support free speech as much as the magazine Zuckerberg invokes, and it's actually quite harsh when it comes to censoring content,\" argued Nathaniel Mott, a writer for Pando Daily. \"It would be one thing for Zuckerberg to express support for those most affected by the Charlie Hebdo killings. No one should be killed for their beliefs. But it's another thing entirely to use this tragedy to white-wash Facebook's murky relationship with numerous governments and pretend it's not the least free social service available.\""
