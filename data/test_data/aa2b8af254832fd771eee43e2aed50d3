  "content": "Since the Observer broke the story about novelist Julie Myerson's new book, a memoir of the destructive effect on their family that her teenaged son's cannabis use has had (resulting, ultimately, in their decision to force him to leave home), commentators have been queuing up, mostly to condemn, but in a few cases defend, the writer's disclosure of the family's personal affairs. Besides the punditry, both Julie Myerson and her estranged son Jake have given interviews in the media, and Myerson's husband, Jonathan, also a writer, has given his account of the trauma and the couple's choice to go public about their trouble. So, what obligations do writers have to protect the privacy and anonymity of relatives and friends they wish to write about? Have the Myersons, as has been said of Jade Goody, got \"no filter\" when it comes to revealing family matters. How much credence do you give to the view that they are bravely breaking taboos to reveal an experience, which, in reality, many families share and suffer in silence? But how compromised is this argument by the fact that Julie Myerson is a working writer with a book to publicise? What's your take on the controversy?"
