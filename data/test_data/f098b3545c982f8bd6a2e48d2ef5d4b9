  "content": "Memo: To all staff at Channel 8 From: Rupert Sawyer, chief executive Subject: Responsible use of Twitter Happy New Year one and all, I trust you all had wonderful Christmi (is that the plural?) \u2013 I know I did. Yes, it was a fruitful and somewhat mischievous Yuletide in the Sawyer household this year. As is customary, we spent Christmas Day on the estate in Buckinghamshire before jetting off for some well deserved winter sun on the Vietnamese Riviera to eat endless turkey B\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi and play with our new presents and each other. Personally, I was lucky enough to receive an iPhone 4GS from Santa this year \u2013 and after exhausting its ability to answer inane questions via Siri and beam 8 megapixel photographs of passing bikini-clad tourists to the iCloud, I settled into some hardcore tweeting. As many of you will already know, I'm a fully paid up member of the Twitterati \u2013 with well over a hundred followers, it's satisfying to know that at the touch of a button I can reach almost as many people as BBC Radio 3. It is with this in mind that I'm perplexed that some of my competitors have taken so long to move from using their hard earned, tried and tested global press, television empires and other meaningful media interests to the zero-barrier of entry micro-social network to truly influence people in 140 characters or less. When my old sparring partner Rupert Murdoch came online, it was all my son St John and his close friend Sebastian could do to control our bowel movements with mirth when we set up an account for his good lady wife (and good friend of ours) Wendy to flirt with the celebrities of the world. After Twitter (and News International) mistakenly verified the account we had a field day as the press gobbled up every one of our fictitious t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate's. Of course, we decided to end the joke before it got out of hand \u2013 but it raises a very important question for us news gatherers, just what is the truth, and can Twitter ever really be a reliable source? As we live in a country where law is based on precedent, the unprecedented events surrounding the @Wendi_Deng incident and Twitter's refusal to properly explain how they verify accounts has left me no choice but to issue immediate new guidelines to all Channel 8 employees. My guidance \u2013 Twitter is a good source if used responsibly by the trustworthy \u2013 also must remind you that it has started revolutions and helped destroy 40 years of gradual improvement in race relations, as well as relayed billions of very poor jokes throughout the years. Despite some criticism from other media outlets, I stand by the Channel 8 News story that we ran yesterday entitled: \"Channel 5 boss says don't watch Big Brother watch Channel 8\". After discussions with 8 News execs, I am satisfied that the source (@richard_desmond \u2013 an unverified Twitter account with no followers) did indeed tweet the following message: \"I wouldn't bother with Celebrity Big Brother \u2013 there's much better stuff on Channel 8\". Whether or not the account belongs to my old pal Richard Desmond or not \u2013 with the current Twitter verification crisis it is impossible to say \u2013 but as we are yet to hear from him personally, and the bio lists Channel 5 amongst the tweeter's interests, one can only assume the truth has outed. Similarly, \"DG admits BBC is laughable\" was a solidly sourced story \u2013 and with Twitter, I can again point you to the source without compromising Channel 8's journalistic integrity. \"Sometimes I just laugh at our output \u2013 but sadly not the comedy\", the sole tweet of @BBCMarkThompson, a Tweeter who's biography reads \"BBC DG\" \u2026 the people asked for transparency, and we have delivered it. This is responsible common-sense journalism in the digital age. Of course, this self-regulating system is open to abuse. Indeed, it's possible that an unscrupulous journalist with an axe to grind or an agenda to fulfil could set up a Twitter account in under 60 seconds and begin dropping all manner of mis-truths into the mouths of the innocent and guilty. But similarly \u2013 as we have discovered in the past few traumatic months for the industry \u2013 the same journalist could probably just as quickly hack a phone or just make up a complete lie to fill page three at ten to eight in the evening. And so, as we start a New Year \u2013 an Olympic year, which Channel 8 are proud not to be covering in any shape or form \u2013 I can say just this \u2026 the pen is mightier than the sword, and Channel 8 is the mightiest most trustworthy pen on the terrestrial dial. Go forth and make news (up). Yours, @rupertsawyerceo Channel 8 is a wasteful company \u2013 please consider printing this email before reading it"
