  "content": "Following the vile abuse directed towards Caroline Criado-Perez for having the temerity to stick up for women's rights, the kneejerk answer is to get Twitter to filter out the nasty stuff. But far more could be achieved by getting the police and prosecutors to take a stand against misogyny and abuse and actually apply existing law. Filtering and reporting are to be welcomed, but there is also a way of doing something practical and effective \u2013 not just ticking boxes. This would involve improving the ability for women to report such matters directly to the police and not just to huge American technology companies with other concerns. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) has a successful model for dealing with child abuse imagery if measured by the fact that, since its launch in December 1996, it has removed more than 100,000 images of child abuse from the web, in response to reports made through its hotline. The police-run Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre similarly has an online reporting service, which can be accessed through the \"CEOP button\" \u2013 a web tool that is easy to install on most internet browers. IWF analysts sift meticulously through image after image, determining whether they breach legal guidelines. They must know the law: and know on which side an image falls. Out of some 40,000 reports received annually from the general public, a quarter turn out to be abuse, as defined by law. Working out which is which takes time, money and resources. This is a far cry from the blunt instrument that is Google safe search, which refuses to return a single result for \"nude\", \"erotic\" or \"pussy\", nursery rhyme or otherwise. It even blocks access to images from the Sun's page 3, which might have saved David Cameron a little angst had he known. It's a long way, too, from most social media moderation, which works like this: someone, somewhere, gets a bee in their bonnet about a post, a page, a comment. They report it to an often lowly paid moderator living halfway round the world. For example, Facebook has three moderation centres in Ireland, the United States and India. Other social media moderate in different ways but there is always the possibility of a mismatch in cultural assumptions. For a start, the desire to block, ban or remove something comes up against the fact that both Facebook and Twitter are deeply imbued with the United States's first amendment and its sense of free speech, which can at times seem like the freedom of a privileged elite to speak, lecture and make jokes. This is why breastfeeding is therefore a no-no, but stuff about a woman being raped or beaten remains subject to debate. Witness Facebook's reaction to the #FBRape campaign. That's why asking Twitter to moderate misogyny is a waste of time. The male-rights activists, the racists, homophobes and bigots have got smart. They know how to insult, wind-up and hurt without overstepping the mark, with the end result that only the worst and most overt \"you should be raped\" jibes are stopped. This is in no way to say that Twitter should do nothing. There are laws in England and Wales \u2013 a couple of communications acts for starters \u2013 that make it an offence to send a message that is \"grossly offensive\" in character. The Crown Prosecution Service recently consulted on how such laws should be applied in social media settings. In the preamble to the consultation, the director of public prosecutions (DPP) raised the possibility that the courts and legal authorities could be overwhelmed if all such cases were fully prosecuted. So the law is there but only, the CPS hopes, for exceptional circumstances: triggered by a \"high threshold\". Judging this threshold might sit uneasily with its supposed commitment to tackling violence against women. If the police started to act more consistently in such instances, using the law, as they appear to have done in support of Criado-Perez, the number of cases where intervention was required would quickly reduce \u2013 and the DPP's fears of being swamped might turn out to be unfounded. Which brings us back to what can be done. Forget \"more efficient Twitter reporting\": its values are not feminist ones, and such an approach is as likely to rebound on complainants as nail their abusers. Let's focus instead on the law as it is: let's ask the CPS to enforce it, convince it that letting such crime slip past is about as acceptable as ignoring difficult assault cases. By all means, let's have a button \u2013 but one that delivers reports of online abuse directly to the local police force, a bit like a security alarm, and not just to Twitter. This relatively simple solution doesn't exist yet but I'm currently coding a mock-up of one for Everyday Victim Blaming (EVB), a not-for-profit organisation set up to help stop violence against women. Installed on your computer, the button would let you generate instant email reports, detailing online abuse and asking the police to investigate. It should also copy a report back to EVB or another campaign group. If the police really are swamped, that, in itself, is a thing \u2013 and may finally prompt politicians to ditch the soundbite and think a bit deeper on this issue."
