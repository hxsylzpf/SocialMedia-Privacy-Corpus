  "content": "Shortly after 5pm on Saturday \u00adafternoon, Hamed, an Iranian asylum seeker in the \u00adNetherlands, took a frantic call from a friend in Tehran. \"A girl has just been killed right next to me,\" the friend said. It had all \u00adhappened quickly. A young woman, chatting on her mobile phone, had been shot in the chest. She faded before a doctor, who was on the scene, could do anything to help. There was more. Hamed's friend, who does not want to be named, filmed the incident on his phone. Within moments the footage had landed in Hamed's inbox. Five minutes later it was on YouTube and Facebook. Within hours it had become one of the most potent threats faced by the \u00adIranian regime in 30 years. \"He asked me, is it possible to publish everything right now,\" Hamed said. \"I published it on YouTube and Facebook and five minutes later it started to get many emails and messages and it \u00adpublished everywhere. \"It shocked me very, very much and I was sure at that time everyone in the world if they see this movie they'll be shocked, and I felt that I must broadcast it because I try to show to the world what is going on in my country.\" The killing of Neda Agha-Soltan, the grisly images of blood spreading across her face, have become perhaps the defining sequence in the 10-day uprising against the regime in Tehran, a gruesome \u00admanifestation of Ayatollah Ali \u00adKhamenei's threat to use force on the tens of thousands of people \u00adcontesting the outcome of the presidential election. Agha-Soltan is being mythologised as a \u00admartyr to the opposition's cause, a \u00adrallying call for a protest movement in need of a hero. Her image has been printed on placards brandished during clashes in Tehrantoday. The footage is disturbing. Her eyes open, Agha-Soltan seems to radiate a \u00adcalmness at odds with the panic \u00adsurrounding her as she lies in the road after being struck by a bullet. For the authorities, it was clearly \u00adunsettling. They quickly moved to ban the victim's family from holding an Islamic funeral, apparently for fear of creating a figure that could unite and revive the \u00adbattered opposition. The details surrounding Agha-Soltan's death are as sketchy as her own story. She was 26, a philosophy student and a part-time travel agent, according to those who knew her. She was no rock thrower at the \u00advanguard of a movement for regime change, but, according to her fiance, Caspian Makan, a young woman who may have ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Makan said she had been in a car in central Tehran with her music teacher when they were caught in a traffic jam. He said the pair had left the car to escape the heat. It was when she was walking down \u00adKaregar Street talking on her phone that the shot rang out. \"Neda's aim was not Mousavi or Ahmadinejad, her target was her \u00adcountry,\" Makan said, adding that although she hadn't planned on \u00addemonstrating, she was sympathetic to the protest movement. In the footage she is wearing jeans, white trainers, a dark shirt and a \u00adheadscarf, suggesting a middle class and relatively emancipated young woman. Several men are shown frantically trying to save her life as blood from her wounds rapidly develops into a large pool beside her. Reports vary on who fired the fatal shot. Some sources suggested it was a Basij volunteer on a motorcycle, while others have attributed it to a marksman on the roof of a nearby house. Others said she may have been \u00adtargeted because she was using a mobile phone, one of the opposition's most important tools. Another video said to be of Agha-Soltan, taken just before she was shot, shows her standing among a crowd of \u00adprotesters, some of whom are heard chanting \"death to the dictator\" and \"Allahu Akbar\". Like much of the footage that has emerged from Tehran in recent days, the authenticity and circumstances behind the video could not be verified. But Agha-Soltan was quickly lionised by an engaged online community inside and outside Iran. Some have even started writing songs in her memory to accompany the web footage. One song, by a singer called Pourang Azad, contains the lyrics: \"You left and thousands of flowers grew, you left and my patience finished \u2026 Your loving look is full of demand. Sleep, sweet lady of Iran.\" The incident has taken on an added poignancy from the meaning of Agha-Soltan's first name. Neda, an Arabic word used more commonly in literary rather than spoken Farsi, conveys the spiritual meaning of \"call\" or \"voice\". The authorities are acutely aware of the threat posed to them by her killing. They only agreed to release her body on \u00adcondition that her family agreed to a quick burial on Sunday in the \u00adsprawling Behesht-e Zahra cemetery on the outskirts of Tehran. A memorial service planned for the Nilufar mosque in the capital's \u00adAbbasabad neighbourhood was called off after officials expressly forbade it. All other mosques in the Tehran area have been warned against holding \u00adservices in her memory. But that may not be enough to stop Agha-Soltan becoming a martyr, a status revered in Shia Islam, the dominant sect in Iran. Under the creed, mourning ceremonies are held for the dead on the third, seventh and 40th days after their passing. During the unrest that presaged that 1979 Islamic revolution, processions on the 40th day of mourning for fallen protesters became landmarks that created the momentum to topple the shah's regime. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2011. The original referred to the death of Neda Soltani during a demonstration in Iran. That is the name of a different individual. This has been corrected.",
