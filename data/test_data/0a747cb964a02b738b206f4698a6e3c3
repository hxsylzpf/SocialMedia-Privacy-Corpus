  "content": "Lawyers, politicians and refugee advocacy groups have expressed serious concerns that the accidental release of the personal details of almost 10,000 asylum seekers held in detention around Australia could expose them to harm if they are returned home. The release of the data could affect the protection claims of the asylum seekers identified in the database. It contains the names of every person held in mainland facilities and on Christmas Island, and thousands of people living in community detention. Labor's immigration spokesman, Richard Marles, said he was \"deeply concerned\" about what he described as \"one of the most significant breaches of privacy in Australian history\". He continued: \"This is a government which refuses to put information into the public domain which should be in the public domain, and yet makes private information that should be secret public.\" The executive director of the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, David Manne, said the release of the data could have broken the law. \"There are laws in the Migration Act that prohibit the disclosure of this kind of information,\" he told Guardian Australia. \"It is a fundamental principle of refugee law that a person seeking asylum should be free to make their claims without disclosure of their identity and with full protection of their identity from their home country \u2013 given the very real risk of retribution from those they've fled from. \"We're talking here about the Taliban and other similar extremist groups and authorities, such as North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Iran.\" Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said the privacy breach showed the government was failing to care for vulnerable people in its care. \"Thousands of people have had their privacy breached and the government must now take that into account when considering their claims for protection. \"This is a very serious breach of privacy and yet another example of this government's failure to care for vulnerable people who are fleeing for their lives. \"The immigration minister must provide a full and frank explanation of how this breach occurred and what will be done to protect the people involved.\" Graeme McGregor, the refugee campaign co-ordinator for Amnesty International, called on the government to take into account the breach in assessing protection claims. \"The release of this data online does risk the lives of asylum seekers in Australia who may be genuine refugees fleeing their government. \"What we would like to see is the risks that this has posed by the release of this information should be factored in when assessing their protection claims,\" he said. Katie Wrigley, a principal solicitor at the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, which represents asylum seekers, said it was concerned about the impact the release could have on its clients. \"We are incredibly careful in making sure that clients understand the impact of any public statement made in Australia for their own safety and the safety of family members. Now this data has just been released wholesale,\" she said. \"Knowing that people are here in Australia puts people at serious risk of harm if their claims are rejected.\" The Department of Immigration has released a statement saying the information was never intended to be in the public domain. \"The department acknowledges that the file was vulnerable to unauthorised access. The department is investigating how this occurred to ensure that it does not happen again,\" it said. The immigration minister, Scott Morrison, has not responded to requests for comment about the data breach."
