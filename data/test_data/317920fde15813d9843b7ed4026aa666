  "content": "There's a long history of technology appearing in films: from outlandish futuristic advances in science-fiction movies, to social networking and the digital-age presented on screen. From \"robot lovers\" to \"the dangers of selfies\", most themes have been covered. Some films nail their depictions of technology, but a lot of others get it embarrassingly wrong, or at least don't get it 100% right. Then there's the fact some consist of around 90% product placement (*cough* Taken 2 *cough*). We take a look at films dealing with tech, and whether they're good, bad or downright ugly. The good Hackers (1995) The film that brought Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie together in the pre-Brad Pitt era, Hackers has become a cult classic. Made in the mid-90s before the days of infamous hacking collectives such as Anonymous and LulzSec \u2013 the plot concerns a group of computer-savvy high school students. The source material for the film was the Hacker Manifesto (aka The Conscience of a Hacker), an influential essay written in 1986 by a prominent hacker. As such, Hackers is a mostly accurate depiction. Miller's character, supreme hacker Dade, who hacked 1,507 computers as an a11-year-old, is very similar to real life computer savants such as the teenage Raphael Gray and Jake Davis. Her (2013) Spike Jonze's widely acclaimed operating system rom com (never a sentence I thought I'd ever write), was a great reflection on how humans now interact with technology, and the impact it has on our psychology and social conditioning. Joaquin Phoenix's Theodore begins a relationship with Scarlett Johansson's Samantha (the operating system in question). Eventually, the operating systems in Her evolve beyond their human counterparts, so perhaps Stephen Hawking's assertion that robots will take over is not that far-fetched. And if you think the premise of forming a relationship with an operation system or a virtual assistant is outrageous, read this lovely article about a boy with autism befriending Apple's Siri. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) Who among us hasn't wanted to rid our brain of memories of an ex? Nobody. Nobody, is the answer. This is the premise of Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman's 2004 sci-fi narrative, in which Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet's former lovers erase each other from their minds, thanks to a futuristic high-tech lab. In real life there are also examples of biohacking: including \"electronic skin\", introducing computing into the body, and magnetic finger implants. WALL-E (2008) WALL-E was the darling of 2008 animated film, and was yet another much loved Pixar hit. Critically acclaimed, it holds a 96% \"fresh rating\" on Rotten Tomatoes. The picture envisions a time when robots and artificial intelligence are cognisant and have their own emotions and morality. It could also be seen as an example of how programmed and automated technology has replaced the need for manual labour, given that WALL-E is a programmed waste disposal unit, charged with cleaning up an abandoned, waste covered planet Earth. Is it, therefore, a two-and-a-half hour comment on the decline of industry and the inexorable rise of Silicon Valley? Who knows, but it sure looks pretty. The Social Network (2010) Aaron Sorkin, currently putting the world to rights with his press ethics heavy HBO series The Newsroom, wrote this 2010 narrative of how Facebook came to be. David Fincher of Seven fame directed. The film of the social network's rise to ubiquity, from Mark Zuckerberg's initial idea as a Harvard undergraduate student, through his legal battles with the Winklevoss twins, and the teaming up with Napster's Sean Parker (played by an able Justin Timberlake). The Social Network was critically acclaimed, has a 96% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and won a slew of awards, including Best Motion Picture at the Golden Globes. It also probably had the most redundant wardrobe department ever, given Zuckerberg's normcore look. Although Zuckerberg said the film was \"hurtful\", for a step-by-step guide to setting up a megalomaniac social media company and earning tons of money, you could do worse. Great trailer too (below). You've Got Mail (1998) It's testament to how perennially loved and resonant You've Got Mail is that its original website is still up and running, a lovingly preserved \u2013 like the mosquitoes encased in amber in Jurassic Park \u2013 late-90s effort, written in verdana font and featuring a pop-up gallery and not much else. The Nora Ephron-penned film sees veteran rom-com leads Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks fall in love via an over-30s chat room, under typically banal usernames (in this case Shopgirl and NY152), and then by AOL inbox. Which I guess in this scenario counts as second base. If You've Got Mail was made today, in the age of the naked selfie, it could have turned out a completely different prospect altogether. Lucky escape there. The bad AI Artificial Intelligence (2001) Any film which involves Jude Law muttering seductively: \"Once you have a robot lover, you'll never want a real man again\", is obviously a winner . Steven Spielberg's 2001 sci fi epic, based on a Brian Aldiss short story, took a haul at the box office, but I remember being so bored by it that I gave up halfway through. If living with AI is gonna be this dull, then pray the robot revolution never comes. If shagging technology is your thing though, there's plenty of fun to be had IRL. How about a Fleshlight? Or the Autoblow 2? AntiTrust (2001) When I was younger, I thought I would marry Ryan Phillippe. Part of me still thinks I will, because I'm not the type of person who lets reality stand in the way of ambition. Phillippe moved away from his pretty boy and/or jock roles with AntiTrust, in which he played a nerdy hacker with prescription glasses fighting against an Evil Tech Corporation. AntiTrust was widely panned, because of its ostensibly ludicrous plot (and, to be fair, bad acting). But in a post-Snowden world, the idea of a tech behemoth in bed with the Justice Department and surveilling everything and everyone around it, and stealing secrets and information, no longer seems ridiculous. In fact, it seems prescient. The name of the fictional tech company is bang-on in its ambition and cringe-worthiness - Never Underestimate Radical Vision, or NURV - and believe me, programmers really do get as excited about code as they do in this movie. And apparently, there are lots of inside coding jokes and easter eggs scattered throughout the film for those in the know. The ugly Jobs (2013) The first biopic of the late iconic Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs came out in 2013. Ashton Kutcher takes the role of Jobs, and the film charts the beginnings of Apple in the 1970s, to Jobs' leaving and returning to the company, and then the massive successes of the i-prefixed product ranges. The film was, obviously, pretty much full of product placement for Apple \u2013 as if they didn't have enough advertising. It was critically a dud, though, with one review calling it \"the equivalent of a feature-length slow hand clap\". However, fans of Jobs need not despair \u2013 a new biopic, written by The Social Network's Aaron Sorkin, is due for release this coming year with Christian Bale in the lead role (after Leonardo DiCaprio dropped out). That version will be based on moments from Walter Isaacson's bestselling biography of Jobs, including real-time depictions of Apple product launches. Men, Women and Children (2014) The most recent film we're looking at, Men, Women and Children, addresses the very pertinent issue of internet privacy and the dangers of sharing risque photographs on the internet or across networks. On the back of the hacking scandal which saw stars such as Jennifer Lawrence and Rihanna's phones scraped for pictures, it's an issue which has inspired hundreds of think pieces and become uppermost in the public's consciousness. Just a shame this flick is so awful. The Fifth Estate (2013) Oh, where to start with this one? Despite being based around a real-life story perfect for the blockbuster treatment: subterfuge, war crimes, government fury and cross-continent chases, The Fifth Estate flopped majorly. And it wasn't just Benedict Cumberbatch's awful hair do that did it \u2013 in fact Cumberbatch was the only good thing about the picture. The hacking scenes could have been an advert for a Fisher Price \"My First Hacking\" set, so amateurish did they seem, and the strange language the tech whizzes spoke, an attempt at jargon, came off sounding both laboured and ridiculous. This lax approach to accuracy even extended to a awkward replica of the Guardian offices, which is, quite frankly, unforgivable. The Fifth Estate definitely belongs to the category of film in which the trailer is superior to the full feature. Skyfall (2013) Last but not least, Daniel Craig's portrayal of James Bond and Ben Whishaw's Q might have attracted critical praise, but there is one particular scene in the third Bond installment of Craig's tenure which is ridiculously cringeworthy. It's a hacking scene that includes the usual cliched tropes of a man typing incredibly quickly, muttering about \"polymorphic changes\", and scrolling numbers and 3D shapes flashing across a screen. OK, so maybe it's not that far fetched that somebody could hack into the MI6's computer network, and by managing to do that, crash a tube in London's underground, right? Adele should totally have sung about that instead. Finally, while not a scene from a feature film, it would be remiss not to mention this beautiful moment in the video for Nelly and Kelly Rowland's inescapable early 2000s hit, \"Dilemma\".
