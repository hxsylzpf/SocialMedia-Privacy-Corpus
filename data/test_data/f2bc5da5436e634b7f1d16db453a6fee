  "content": "There was no emotional acceptance speech, no vote of thanks to family and friends, just a dispassionate press statement when Catherine Zeta-Jones and her husband Michael Douglas claimed legal victory over Hello! magazine yesterday. It was a rather low-key end to a spectacular six-week show trial at the high court in London which kept the pre-war press enraptured with its insight into celebrity, the cut-throat world of the glossy magazine business, and the lengths to which the paparazzi will go to get a picture, not to mention the particularly peculiar brand of journalism practised by Hello! All of which would have been avoided had the Douglases not been so determined to protect their privacy - or their \u00a31m contract with OK! magazine, depending on which side you take - by going to court in November 2000 when the icing on their wedding cake had barely set. Hours after they had taken their vows in front of a triple-A guest list that included the United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan, the couple got word that a paparazzo had evaded the elaborate security and managed to smuggle out covert shots of the reception. (Even more intriguingly, it turned out to be Rupert Thorpe, son of the former Liberal leader Jeremy.) These had found their way to Hello! arch-rival of OK! Zeta-Jones told the court that she was \"devastated, shocked and appalled\": instead of basking in wedded bliss, the couple were enjoined in a frenzied legal action to get the unauthorised pictures stopped, combined with a frantic effort to choose the authorised shots that would be rushed into print by OK! At first it seemed that things were going their way. Only a month after the Human Rights Act came into force, with its vaunted privacy protections, the high court granted an injunction prohibiting OK! printing the covert snaps. But this was overturned by the court of appeal, and both magazines hit the streets the same day. The loss of the injunction led the Douglases to sue for \u00a31.75m, citing stress, loss of income, and damage to their professional careers because of the poor quality of the images. Zeta-Jones told the court that, as a woman in Hollywood, her image was all-important; the Hello! pictures showed her husband shovelling wedding cake down her throat. \"It's offensive because I didn't think I would want the world to see that at my wedding day all I did was eat,\" Zeta-Jones said in her recently acquired Hollywood twang. Hello! countered by claiming that the couple had forfeited their right to privacy by turning their wedding into an \"international media event\". Much colour, if not clarity, was provided by the arrival of Hello!'s former fixer the Uruguayan-born Marquesa de Varela. She admitted knowing that paparazzi were prepared to infiltrate the wedding which, she said, could not possibly be kept under wraps at the Plaza. \"It's a hotel. It's not a private place. There you have 1,000 South American waiters, it's easy, easy, easy,\" she said in a typical moment of melodramatic overstatement. She agreed that the quality of the pictures was poor in comparison with the official shots. \"You cannot compare Armani to Zara,\" she said, referring to the Spanish high street fashion chain. But she agreed that, in the celebrity wedding of the year, anything was better than nothing. The marquesa said Hello! pressurised her into signing a fax, which was submitted to the court of appeal when the magazine was fighting the injunction in November 2000, saying she was responsible for buying the pictures from the paparazzi. The marquesa, described in court as a \"volatile and eccentric lady\", said she feared being sacked if she did not sign, thereby jeapordising her \"three children, six grandchildren, an elderly mother and almost 200 dogs\". (She runs a canine rescue home.) Charter Hello! insisted that this was the result of a misunderstanding. The magazine's more phlegmatic Spanish owner, Eduardo Sanchez Junco, denied that a deal had been struck before the wedding, but admitted that Hello! had chartered two planes to fly extra copies from Spain to Britain in the event of paparazzi pictures arriving from New York. Mr Justice Lindsay was impressed by neither the marquesa nor Mr Sanchez Junco, and the Douglases were celebrating - in private, naturally - yesterday. They said, in a statement released through their public relations agents: \"We deeply appreciate that the court has recognised the principle that every individual has the right to be protected from excessive and unwanted media intrusion into their private lives.\" Not quite. Crucially, the judge did not rule that the couple's distress was caused by a breach of privacy per se. Instead, he held that the Douglases' rights could be protected under the existing law of confidence and data protection provisions. This was presented in some quarters yesterday as a \"defeat\" or just a \"partial victory\" for the Douglases - suggesting that the judge had \"rejected\" their claim of a breach of privacy. Not altogether true either: Mr Justice Lindsay simply found that the couple did not need to rely on the privacy aspect of their court action to achieve the remedy that they desired. \"There is ... no need for me to attempt to construct a law of privacy, and it would be wrong of me to attempt to do so,\" he said. Indeed, he warned that judges would begin to rule on privacy actions in cases where claimants were unable to rely on a breach of confidence action - a situation that would be wholly unsatisfactory. \"So broad is the subject of privacy, and such are the ramifications of any free- standing law in the area, that the subject is better left to parliament. That parliament has failed so far to grasp the nettle does not prove it will not have to be grasped in the future.\" So, despite, the attempts of politicians and press to make it go away, the privacy issue is showing ever-stronger signs that it may tip the government into a big vat of treacle. And as the cynics predicted, the Human Rights Act is providing plenty of business for clever lawyers. Next stop: the court of appeal."
