  "content": "\u2022 No let up on the coverage of Google's decision to lift the censorship of its Chinese search engine. As reaction to the move spread around the world, it was widely welcomed - but significantly, most of the company's major rivals remained tight-lipped. Details on the hack are beginning to emerge, but there is still no movement from the government in Beijing, however. \u2022 Potentially positive news for Gary McKinnon, the hacker accused of damaging US military networks and awaiting extradition to face trial in the states. A high court judge granted a judicial review of his case, suggesting that the home secretary's decision to extradite him could be unlawful. \u2022 Rob Glaser, the founder and chief executive of RealNetworks, is stepping down after more than 16 years in the job. Why? Last week a San Francisco judge ruled against Real in its ongoing battle over the legality of DVD ripping software. But an internal memo (from PaidContent) suggests that it was just a matter of time after such a long stint in control, adding that it is something he's \"been thinking about for a long time\". He'll remain chairman, but is passing the torch over to Robert Kimball.
