  "content": "Chris McCafferty has left his job as European corporate communications director of MySpace and parent company Fox Interactive Media after just 16 months in the role. MySpace said the departure was \"due to a restructuring by Fox Interactive Media of the MySpace global communications department\". Before joining MySpace, McCafferty was head of PR and corporate affairs for MSN UK and divisional director at PR firm the Red consultancy. McCafferty declined to comment on his departure from MySpace or his future plans. News Corporation-owned Fox Interactive Media now employs more than 100 people in London and has 13 other offices around Europe. It is shortly due to open more bases in Turkey, Russia, India and Korea. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
