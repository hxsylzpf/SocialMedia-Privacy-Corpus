  "content": "Russell Brand has responded to last week's Parklife internet meme, which involved people tweeting passages from his book followed by the words 'Park Life', with his very own version of the 1994 Blur hit. The meme emerged after somebody pointed out on Twitter that his prose style was rather similar to that in the song. Brand didn't seem too offended, singing: \"Verbal dexterity plus estuary accent is what leads to the parody of ... park life.\" In a rival to the John Lewis Christmas advert, which this year told the troubling tale of a penguin mail-order bride, Sainsbury's has released their very own Christmas extravaganza \u2013 a big budget depiction of the famous Christmas day football match on the Western Front. The film was made in partnership with the Royal British Legion and ends with the tagline 'Christmas is for sharing'. Plenty of people have questioned the ethics of using the tragedy of the First World War to flog groceries, so we don't have to. An emotional video in which Chris Picco sings 'Blackbird' to his dying new born son Lennon after Chris's wife died giving birth has been shared widely across social media. Messages of support and donations have flooded in to the newly founded Ashley Picco Memorial Fund, which has raised over $65,000. Elsewhere on the internet, one woman explains exactly why Monster energy drink is the drink of the devil. In a video that seems to have been staged, a woman feigns inebriation to attempt to demonstrate how many creepy men there are on Hollywood Boulevard. And astronauts on the International Space Station play around with a water bubble. Lions feature twice in this week's run down \u2013 a lion lies back and happily accepts a foot massage from his brave owner and a baby elephant triumphs in a fight with a pride of determined lions. \"Dan O'Reilly, at best what you do is offensive, at worst it incites harassment and violence\" \u2013 This was Emily Maitlis's killer opening line in her interview with Vine star Dapper Laughs who went Newsnight to defend himself against accusations that his now-cancelled ITV show was offensive. He says the backlash against his rape jokes has \"wrecked his life.\" Poor Dapper Laughs. Finally, the intrepid travellers making their way up Kishtwar Kailash in the Indian Himalaya seem to find it hilarious that they're on one of the most terrifying roads in the world. Viewers who suffer from vertigo will not find it so funny. 1. PARKLIFE - featuring Rubberbandits Class Strife 2. Sainsbury's official Christmas 2014 Ad Christmas is for sharing 3.
