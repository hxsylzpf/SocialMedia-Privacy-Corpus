  "content": "When the towers fell on 9/11, Twitter and Facebook didn't exist and social networking was only used by a few people for fun. 12 years on, these platforms are synonymous with branding and marketing, and every company and organization uses them to push their product or cause. The line between smart strategy and insensitive insult, however, is thin on social media, and today more than one company was called out for crossing it. AT&amp;T got the most heat after posting the image above. The company quickly issued an apology and deleted the tweet after Twitter users screamed their disapproval. The team Twitter account of the Los Angeles Lakers tweeted an image of Kobe with the caption #NeverForget, which also did not go down well. They did, however, take it down almost as quickly as it was posted. Attempts to make something of the anniversary were not limited to the virtual world, though it's unclear whether these companies were attempting to capitalize or simply offering misguided memorials. The hotel chain Marriott, for instance, offered complimentary mini muffins. Nor were media publications left out of the mess up. Esquire had a technical glitch that caused an article to pull the now-famous image of the Falling Man beside an unfortunate headline. They issued a tweet in response, which may itself have been received as insensitive. Print ads were not far behind. A Wisconsin golf course advertised nine holes of golf for $9.11 to mark the anniversary. The owner later apologized, after receiving a heavy backlash and even death threats. Not all the news was bad though \u2013 a few companies managed to find the balance and recognize that sometimes less is more. The restrained social media from Waffle House and Canon USA, for example, seemed to have been appreciated. What do you think of product placements and promoted tweets?"
