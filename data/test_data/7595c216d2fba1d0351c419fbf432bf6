  "content": "Sue Perkins has said she is taking a break from Twitter because she received threats after speculation she might replace Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear. The Great British Bake Off presenter \u2013 who also hosts an ITV chatshow with co-star Mel Giedroyc \u2013 tweeted on Tuesday to say that she was \"off Twitter for a bit\". She said she had received comments from \"blokes wishing me dead\", including one who \"suggested they'd like to see me burn to death\". Scores of fans tweeted messages of support for the presenter, including BBC Radio 1 presenter Fearne Cotton. Perkins tweeted last Thursday, when she was filming in India, that she was facing abuse from \"middle-aged man-trolls\". Perkins was tipped on Friday as favourite to take over Clarkson's role, but her odds have slipped, with Dermot O'Leary currently in the lead, followed by Philip Glenister and Jodie Kidd, according to Ladbrokes. Perkins appeared to rule out joining Top Gear on Saturday when she tweeted in response to a (now-deleted) question from a fan:",
