  "content": "Social media streams were chock-a-block with photos of nature's great, fiery show on Monday night. Unusual cloud formations created a spectacular sunset over the east coast of NSW and captured the imagination of photographers. Tuesday's sunrise was also something to behold. Condoblin, in central NSW on Tuesday morning. Some of the most beautiful sunset shots were taken over western Sydney, like these photos from Penrith and Richmond. Stunning colours could be seen over the Blue Mountains. The Monday evening commute was spiced up for thousands of Sydneysiders. South of Sydney, the purples and pinks were shining through. The ACT also got in on the action."
