  "content": "David Beckham yesterday turned on the media for its lurid coverage of his private life, condemning stories in the tabloid press as an \"absolute disgrace\". The England captain said he had considered boycotting some sections of the media, including the satellite broadcaster BSkyB, which paid his former personal assistant \u00a3150,000 for an interview in which she recounted details of their alleged affair. Beckham's comments follow orchestrated leaks of a trip by his wife, Victoria, to a poverty-stricken part of Peru to record a film for Sport Relief. She has also given an interview to the forthcoming issue of Marie-Claire magazine; taken together, the developments suggest the couple's public relations advisers are moving to rebuild their wholesome reputation, seen as crucial to the value of the \"Beckham brand\". Speaking publicly for the first time since the controversy about his alleged infidelity broke last month, Beckham insisted he was a loving family man. In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live in Sardinia, where he was training yesterday, Beckham said he had complained to the newspapers concerned: \"I've made it clear that, with two papers, the way I and my family have been treated is an absolute disgrace because at the end of the day I'm a nice person and loving husband and father, and that's what I've made clear to these people.\" Beckham also reacted angrily to claims about his wife: \"Things always hurt that are said about my family, and for people to call my wife a bad mother is unbelievable.\" There have been reports that Beckham had considered refusing to do any post-match interviews with any BSkyB channel. But yesterday he said he decided against the ban. \"I realise as England captain I have an obligation to talk to the fans and that's why I do it.\" The News of the World broke the story of Beckham's alleged affair with his former assistant, Rebecca Loos, last month, sparking a feeding frenzy as rivals raced to get a new angle on the story. The NoW paid Ms Loos \u00a3350,000 for an interview, brokered by the publicist Max Clifford, and followed its first story with claims of an affair with a second woman, Sarah Marbeck. Ms Loos also gave an interview that was shown on Sky One. In total, she is said to have made \u00a3800,000. Clifford criticised Beckham for his attack on the press. He told the ITV News Channel yesterday: \"The advice I would have given to David is: don't attack the messenger if you don't like the message. You cannot use the media and then be petulant and childish when they say something you are not happy with.\""
