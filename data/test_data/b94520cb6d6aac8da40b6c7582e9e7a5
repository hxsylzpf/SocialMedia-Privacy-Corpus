  "content": "Lord Justice Leveson has been urged to do what he could to ensure reform to libel laws is not delayed because of his inquiry into press ethics. John Kampfner, chief executive of Index on Censorship, told the Leveson inquiry on Tuesday it would be a \"tragedy if, inadvertently, the work of this inquiry delayed the inserting of libel into the Queen's speech in May\". Index on Censorship has been leading the campaign to reform England's libel laws. A defamation bill has been drafted and Index is hoping to see it into entered into the next legislative schedule. However, Kampfner is concerned that this could be held up pending resolution of the many issues thrown up by the inquiry. Leveson told Kampfner that he had not \"studied the legislation pre-scrutiny\" because it was not part of the inquiry. However, he said was keen to learn more from Index on Censorship and would like to make a considered response to Kampfner's request. Kampfner has said previously that libel law and the use of superinjunctions is having a chilling effect on freedom of expression. The US has viewed English libel law as so damaging to free speech that president Obama signed into law the Speech Act, which would protect Americans from British libel decisions. He added that Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention, which offers general protection of a person's private life, was being abused by those who want to stop journalistic investigations. Kampfner told Leveson it was set up after the second world war to prevent intrusion by the state but it was being used to protect corporations. The inquiry again grappled with future regulation. Leveson expressed his enthusiasm to hear from Index on Censorship and Jonathan Heawood, director of English PEN, the writers' organisation that is also campaigning for libel law reform, who was also giving evidence. Kampfner told Leveson that self-regulation would \"suffice to improve standards\", as long as there was a robust environment in which the press could operate. \"It is extremely difficult for the media, faced with a wall of laws and other restrictions, to find out what otherwise is legitimate information,\" he said. Heawood told Leveson he was opposed to statutory regulation. He said there was a new buzz around \"co-regulation\" \u2013 a hybrid of statutory and self regulation \u2013 but added that he was not convinced it would work. \"Co-regulation, this term [is being] used as a magical third way between a rock and a hard place. It seems to be a veiled form of statutory regulation, in so far as it usually provides that somewhere in the process an elected politician has the capacity to exert some sort of influence,\" Heawood said. Leveson pointed out that it would be easy to remove the political element, to which Heawood replied: \"I haven't yet seen the model that somehow charts a magical course between these routes and somehow manages to get the best of both. I'm not sure it exists.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
