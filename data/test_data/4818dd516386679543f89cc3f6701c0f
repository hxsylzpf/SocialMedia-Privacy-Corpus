  "content": "Coverage of Twitter has been approaching somewhere near fever pitch this week. We can thank/blame celebtwitties like Stephen Fry and Jonathan Ross for that, and perhaps Thursday's Twestival, the global, 24-hour Twitter meet up that is predicted raise as much as $1m for a water charity. But more on that later in the week. How will Twitter make money? It's an issue that intensifies as the service continues to grow, particularly now that businesses are expected to slim down and become more efficient in the downturn. There's also the matter of that $20m in funding by investors who will, at some point, expect to see slightly more than a promise of income. The Church of Twitter. Photograph: wiseleywoven/Flickr/Some rights reserved I have three theories on how Twitter will make money. The first, as we explained as far back as 2007, is to charge brands for using the service. The value is proven, as far as the service extends now, and brands including Dell reportedly made $1m in sales by promoting discounts and offers on Twitter over Christmas, according to TechCrunch. The second is by selling, in some presumably anonymised form, demographic audience data to marketers. With Twitter rumoured to have between 4m and 6m users, that's a very valuable, active and engaged audience - though the same dynamic has not helped social networking sites to make money. The third is far less explored; using Twitter as an official, integrated back channel for TV. This has already started, through the Intel/Yahoo collaboration announced at CES that puts web widgets onto a TV screen. Though I'm dubious about the long-term potential of this particular product, I think the more formal integration of web and TV is inevitable and that Twitter will be exploring partnerships that link the two. How many of us have laptops open while we watch TV, and how many Twitter users react and respond to TV as we're watching it? One to watch. Will the BBC launch its own version of Twitter? Oh good god no! This headline has been picked up in a few places, so where did it come from? A post on thenextweb made the suggestion that with so much coverage of Twitter, perhaps the BBC should stop promoting a commercial company and start its own microblogging service. The argument that the BBC shouldn't use Twitter because it's a commercial service is flawed. The corporation exists in a unique space in a commercial world; it cannot money and resources attempting to replicate a non-commercial version of everything in the outside world to create some giant BBC bubble. A Twitter clone wouldn't work because it is not needed, just as Jaiku didn't take off because there was no benefit in users duplicating their activity. And as influential as the BBC is, its presence on Twitter is still extremely marginal, represented in the most successful examples by individuals rather than its brands or programmes. More relevantly, BBC Backstage's Ian Forrester described some experiments with microblogging tool Laconi.ca. He raises some far more meaningful points: \"I think as the BBC gets its heads around microblogging it will quickly notice that not only is it somewhat promoting a single startup through its wording but that Microblogging is much bigger and like how we don't host our blogs on wordpress.com, we will want to host it ourselves. \"There's all type of things we could do with our microblogging system, things which are forbidden on Twitter or even not possible because of the way Twitter is setup. The obvious example is a children's microblogging service. This will resolve its self and it will be the geeks who had a hand in the new bright future of the BBC.\" It makes far more sense for the BBC's developer talent to take what we have learnt from Twitter and build on that, rathe than replicating the service just because it is going through a high-profile boom patch. Imagine if the corporation had tried to do that with MySpace? Twitter in the top 100 UK sites? Web statistics are notoriously fickle, so take with with a pinch of salt, but Hitwise reports the Twitter's UK traffic has risen 27 fold in the past 12 months and is now the sixth most popular UK website, as dutifully blogged by TechCrunch UK. I've never placed any weight on their 'market share' statistic (surely if you're defining who is in a market sector, you have to cut out some sites, and if that means chopping off the fascinating and very relevant long tail?!) but there's another problem here; these stats don't include traffic through third-party clients, like TweetDeck and Twitterrific, that use the API, which should surely be included in a more accurate measurement of Twitter's traffic? The burden of Twitter Stephen Levy in Wired complains of his social networking 'guilt' at not Facebooking, Digging or Twittering enough, and his worry about personally revealing himself - 'disrobing 140 characters at a time'. Lighten up, I'd say. Most of us with a technological curiosity try out a large number of services but it's the job of that service to make it work for you, not the other way around. If it makes you feel guilty or bogged down with too much information (you know who you are - Facebook) - don't use it. I've invested a lot of time and energy in Twitter but have gained far more. If your social networking service is all take, give it up. A final word from the Dalai Lama. Or is it? \"@Karageorgakis HH thought it was prudent to make his office open and accessable [sic] to a more youthful and technologically advancing audience...\" They said the Dalai Lama was on Twitter. He wasn't. Twitter is looking at account verification for famous people or brands, which might save Jonathan Ross the detective work in phoning his celebrity mates each time a new Twitter character emerges pretending to be Lily Allen, or whoever."
