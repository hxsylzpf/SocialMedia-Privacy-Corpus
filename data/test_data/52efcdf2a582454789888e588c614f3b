  "content": "Facebook is paying news publishers and broadcasters, including the New York Times, BuzzFeed and Sky, to provide content on its live video service. Video has become a priority for Facebook and Live is a core part of its push into the area. The payments to newspapers and digital publishers reflect Facebook's desire to ensure Live has enough content on it to persuade people to use it. Previous partnerships with news organisations, such as Facebook Instant Articles, have relied on splitting ad revenues rather than direct payments. However, Facebook Live does not currently carry ads and it takes more effort for publishers and news organisations to produce live video. US tech site Re/code reported the New York Times, Huffington Post and BuzzFeed were being paid to live stream by Facebook and the Guardian understands the service has similar arrangements with UK-based organisations such as the satellite group Sky. The system of payments is understood to be temporary, and the company hopes to rapidly switch to a different way for it and its partners to make money from Live videos. Facebook had already indicated it was providing financial incentives to celebrities to live stream and had been pursuing sports rights, though it was beaten to a deal to show live American football games by Twitter. Separately to its arrangements with media companies, Facebook has also rolled out updates including a dedicated section within its mobile app for Live videos, and a standalone site running for 24 hours designed to showcase live content from a range of sources. It has also added new features including the ability to invite friends to watch a live stream, and add filters to videos. Facebook Live was launched last August and outlets in the US and UK have been experimenting with it extensively. CNN used the service to stream its presidential debate in October and the Guardian has used Facebook Live to report from events such as the junior doctors' strike. A Facebook spokesperson said: \"We announced in March that we're testing different ways to support partners so they begin experimenting with Facebook Live. We're investing in live video as we think it's a great fit for our platform \u2014 more and more people are choosing to watch and share live video on Facebook because it is personal, real-time and authentic. We'll be working closely with these partners to learn from them how we can build the best Facebook Live experience and explore with them potential monetisation models.\""
