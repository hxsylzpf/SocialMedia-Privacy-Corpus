  "content": "One of the country's highest ranking judges has called for continental-style privacy laws outlawing the photographing of people without their consent. Master of the Rolls Lord Justice Phillips said a new law protecting people's right to privacy \"would make our life very much easier\". \"There is scope for moving further in the direction of protecting individuals' privacy against, for instance, intrusive photography,\" he told BBC2's Newsnight. Lord Phillips' call comes less than a week after a leftwing thinktank concluded that a privacy law was required to \"protect the public\". The influential Institute of Public Policy Research said without legislation only the \"rich and famous\" would have access to proper legal redress. But the National Union of Journalists said today the introduction of a privacy law would be a \"serious retrograde step\". \"The unwanted photography of celebrities does at times cause friction with the press, but banning it is not the answer,\" said Jeremy Dear, the general secretary of the NUJ. \"The public's right to know requires that the media take such pictures at times - not so much because of salacious interest in celebrities' lives, but because of the journalists' duty to reveal what is going on in society. \"Such a law would have been used by people like Jeffrey Archer or Jonathan Aitken to stop the press doorstepping them,\" he said. \"Many celebrities live by positive publicity and just want to control what images of them are taken and used. If they don't like it they can sue under the Human Rights Act - an avenue of redress they didn't have until two years ago. \"The fact we now have a right to privacy under this Act means there is even less reason for a special statute law. \"The purpose of media law should not be to make life easy for the judges but to protect the right of the people to be fully informed by the media. This bandwagon for a privacy law should be stopped in its tracks,\" he added. But last week's IPPR study said media self-regulation had been a failure. It said judges' interpretations of the Human Rights Act had been damaging and pointed to the cases involving footballer Garry Flitcroft, Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones, and Naomi Campbell. In the absence of legislation, it said, Britain could \"end up with the worst of both worlds - courts interpreting the Human Rights Act in a way that only benefits the rich and famous and journalists' freedoms being curbed unnecessarily\". Les Dennis and Amanda Holden successfully used the Human Rights Act to win a record \u00a340,000 settlement after the Daily Star published photographs of them on holiday at a private villa in Tuscany without their knowledge. Naomi Campbell also used the Act to win a landmark case against the Daily Mirror for publishing details of her Narcotics Anonymous treatment. But the Mirror successfully appealed against the ruling, in a case coincidentally overseen by Lord Phillips. Lord Phillips used the ruling to emphasise that public figures had a right to privacy. \"We do not see why it should necessarily be in the public interest that an individual who has been adopted as a role model, without seeking this distraction, should be demonstrated to have feet of clay,\" said Lord Phillips at the time."
