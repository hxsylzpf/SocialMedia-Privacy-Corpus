  "content": "Kate Hudson has accepted an apology and damages from the UK edition of the National Enquirer it implied the actor had an eating disorder and was \"looking like skin and bones\". The gossip magazine, which is owned by American Media, the publisher of the National Enquirer, today apologised, paid undisclosed damages and costs and promised never to repeat the libel. In October the magazine ran a paparazzo photograph of Hudson taken in August purporting to show her as frail and gaunt along with a story headlined, \"Goldie Tells Kate: Eat Something! And She Listens! Star confronts daughter after photographs show her painfully thin.\" An anonymous source quoted in the article claimed that Hudson's mother Goldie Hawn was \"growing concerned as her normally glamorous and curvaceous daughter, Kate Hudson, started shrinking before her eyes\". \"In fact, the position was not all it seemed,\" Hudson's solicitor Simon Smith, from the law firm Schillings, told the high court in London. Other photographs taken about the same time, some of which appeared in the Enquirer, showed Hudson happy and healthy. The actor denied the implication in the article about her health and the confrontation with her mother and sued for libel after the magazine refused to apologise. Hudson, who has received an apology and financial settlement from American Media, issued a statement about the libel case. \"I am very relieved that the matter has been resolved,\" Hudson said. \"The allegations that I sued over were blatantly false and I felt that I had no choice but to set the record straight by challenging it in court. \"I could not stand by while such lies were perpetrated about me and I am relieved that the matter has been resolved.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
