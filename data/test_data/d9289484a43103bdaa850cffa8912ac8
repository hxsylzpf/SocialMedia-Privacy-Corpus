  "content": "Formula one boss Max Mosley will today hear whether he has been successful in his privacy action against the News of the World after the Sunday tabloid accused him of taking part in a \"sick Nazi orgy\". Mosley, 68, the son of the 1930s British fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, is suing the paper for grossly invading his privacy after it printed pictures of him indulging in a five-hour sadomasochistic sex session with prostitutes in a Chelsea apartment. The paper alleged the session had \"Nazi overtones\", but Mosley - the president of the FIA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile) - has strenuously denied this. He said his life had been devastated by the expos\u00e9 and is seeking an unprecedented award of punitive exemplary damages. However, the News of the World told the high court in London that there was no basis for punitive damages because it honestly believed there was a Nazi theme to the sex session and was convinced there was a genuine public interest in publishing the story. The case, which has made headlines around the world, saw Mosley give evidence, sometimes of a highly sexual nature, while the News of the World editor, Colin Myler, defended the paper. However, the newspaper's key witness, the dominatrix who filmed Mosley's sex session, failed to appear, the paper's QC citing her \"emotional and mental state\". The verdict is expected to be handed down by Mr Justice Eady at the high court at 10am. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
