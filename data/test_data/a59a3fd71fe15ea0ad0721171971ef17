  "content": "Scotland Yard commander Brian Paddick is suing Associated Newspapers for breach of privacy over two \"kiss and tell\" articles in the Mail on Sunday last year. Mr Paddick is not claiming a specific amount, but his advisers believe he is entitled to a sum in the region of \u00a3100,000 - the money paid by the Mail on Sunday to James Renolleau, Mr Paddick's former partner. Mr Renolleau, 37, a former male model, alleged in a story last March that Mr Paddick smoked cannabis regularly and allowed the drug to be stored in the flat they shared. Mr Paddick denied the allegations and an eight-month investigation by the crown prosecution service, the police complaints authority and the Metropolitan police authority cleared him of any serious wrongdoing. The paper also quoted Mr Renolleau giving intimate details of their life together. He accused Mr Paddick of having frequent casual gay sex encounters and visiting gay saunas. All the allegations were denied. The following week the Mail on Sunday ran an interview with a former girlfriend of Mr Paddick, to whom he was engaged 20 years ago. Lawyers acting for Mr Paddick believe that the articles contain material which are a clear breach of his privacy. They claim they cannot be defended on the grounds of public interest. \"There are many intrusive details about Commander Paddick's private life in the two stories,\" said Tamsin Allen, a media specialist at London solicitors Bindmans. \"Mr Paddick is not making any specific claim for damages. That will be up to the court to decide.\" Mr Paddick, the country's most senior openly gay officer, had to leave his post as borough commander of Lambeth after the allegations of drug taking. He had pioneered the softly-softly approach to the possession of cannabis, telling officers to caution rather than arrest people caught with the drug so that they could concentrate on tackling class A drug traffickers and users. Mr Paddick became a target for the homophobic vitriol of some tabloids. The Sun said he was the \"commander [who] brings a whole new meaning to the expression bent copper\", and the Daily Mail called him the \"camp commander\" and an \"an icon for our moral decadence\". The home secretary, David Blunkett, has announced that he intends to downgrade cannabis from class B to class C. A modified form of the Lambeth experiment has been extended across the capital."
