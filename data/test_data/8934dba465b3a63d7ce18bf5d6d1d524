  "content": "Online gaming company Zynga has become the latest social media company to join the virtual gold rush gripping the world of tech companies. The maker of the phenomenally popular FarmVille game is reportedly holding discussions with investors about raising $250m (\u00a3156m) in a deal that could value the three-year-old start-up at between $7bn and $9bn, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company joins a small band of social media firms all now attracting huge interest from investors and equally huge valuations. Last week it emerged that Facebook and Google were stalking Twitter, the micro-blogging site. Twitter is now thought to be worth close to $10 billion. Zynga's new valuation is roughly double the $4bn valuation the company received in April when it filed papers authorising the issuance of new stock. FarmVille is the most popular game on Facebook with some 62 million active users tending its virtual farms. When Zynga recently launched its latest online game, CityVille, 16 million users signed up in the first month. The game firm now has 275 million users playing all its games and has been broadening its reach beyond Facebook to iPhones, iPads and other platforms. Game players buy virtual goods for real money and Zynga reportedly generated about $400m profit last year from revenues of $850m. The appetite for social media firms has reached new heights in recent weeks. Facebook, the sector's biggest player, is now considering plans to let its staff sell shares worth $1bn in a deal that would value the firm at $60bn. Groupon, an online discount company, is lining up an initial public offering that is believed to value the firm at $15bn. It raised close to $1bn in new funds earlier this year. Last year Google offered $6bn for the company. JP Morgan Chase has announced it is raising a $500-750m fund that will invest in social media companies. Mark Pincus, Zynga's 44-year-old founder, has said he is not interested in an IPO at present. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, has expressed a similar sentiment on several occasions but appears to have changed his mind. But the company has no pressing need for financing. Virtual sheep shearing has proved very profitable and the company is well funded by a range of backers including Google and venture-capital and firms.",
