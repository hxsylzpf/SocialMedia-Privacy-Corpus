  "content": "Facebook has begun to experiment with warning messages on some violent, sexual and sensitive content in the wake of the controversy over its decision to allow a graphic video of a beheading, the Guardian has learned. The site is also discussing the introduction of age-restriction warnings that would alert a user to more extreme content, which \u2013 according to Facebook's revised policy \u2013 will be allowed if deemed to be in a suitable context. Facebook's policy change follows comments by David Cameron on Twitter on Tuesday calling the site \"irresponsible\" for posting \"beheading videos, especially without a warning\". It is also stepping up what it calls its \"educational checkpointing\", delivering tailored messages to users who attempt to post unsuitable content and sometimes stopping them from uploading content for a period. Earlier this week the social network appeared to reverse its policy under which violent content had been banned. It blocked a violent video in May this year but then allowed a Mexican protest group to post footage of a masked drugs-cartel member murdering a woman and call on members of its Facebook page to join its campaign against the cartels in Mexico. This prompted anger from charities supporting the families of hostages, including Hostage UK, which said this type of video would add \"imaginable suffering\" to the families of the victims. Facebook said it had extended its policy on controversial content to allow context to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. A post intended to provoke discussion among campaigners would be allowed, for example, where a graphic video being shared and joked about would be removed. \"We ask that people who share graphic content for the purpose of condemning it do so in a responsible manner, carefully selecting their audience and warning them about the nature of the content so they can make an informed choice about it,\" said Facebook in a statement. The firm, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has regularly been the subject of controversy over its policy decisions \u2013 disputes that have intensified as its site's size has grown. Many users were uncomfortable with the introduction of a news feed in 2006, while the site was restricted to US students. Later controversies focused around its location tool, targeted advertising and, in 2011, its decision to remove photographs of breastfeeding mothers with exposed nipples. The site's censorship guidelines were leaked in 2012, revealing that breastfeeding animals were acceptable, however, \"in the context of food processing or hunting as it occurs in nature\". A Facebook spokesperson described age-restriction tools as promising but said the company was not planning to announce a widespread implementation. \"We piloted putting up a graphic-content warning message on one of these videos before it came down. [Age restrictions] could be a useful solution but we don't have the technology in place today.\"",
