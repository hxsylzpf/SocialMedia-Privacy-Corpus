  "content": "I was struck by what Sir Christopher Meyer, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, said of those who had been mistreated by the press - particularly a client of my firm, Max Mosley: \"It would be a desperate man to measure the quality of the PCC's service by something that Max Mosley said\" (PCC chair criticises media law firms, March 25). Meyer was addressing the parliamentary select committee for culture, media and sport, responding to evidence given by Mosley and Gerry McCann as to why the PCC was of no use to them; and his comments illustrate perfectly where his loyalty lies. Leaving aside that he is wrong to say that their evidence was orchestrated or \"probably ventriloquised\" by the law firm Carter-Ruck (who played no part in my client's case or his evidence to the committee), can it ever be appropriate for the chairman of an organisation that is supposed to regulate the press to pour scorn on an individual who has been the victim of the unlawful activities of the press? Meyer's defence of the PCC is fundamentally flawed. Mosley's complaint about the PCC was that first it is an organisation run by individuals within the newspaper industry who are often the subject of complaints themselves; and second that it lacks the necessary teeth to provide an adequate penalty when newspapers are found to have behaved in breach of the law and/or its own code. McCann's evidence echoed these concerns. As the Guardian article reported: \"He was surprised that the Express editor, Peter Hill, had remained on the PCC code committee while his newspaper attacked the McCann family.\" While it is arguable that the \u00a360,000 in damages and costs paid by the News of the World at the conclusion of Mosley's successful court case remains an inadequate deterrent to an organisation the size of News International, what would the PCC have done? The only weapon the PCC has (or wants, according to Meyer) is to require the newspaper to publish its finding - hardly a fitting penalty for a publication that may well have ruined a life. In fact Mosley, through this firm, did complain to the PCC but its response was that it could do nothing while legal proceedings were ongoing. As those at the PCC will know very well, the outcome of the court case was conclusively in Mosley's favour, the judgment included a finding that there had been a clear breach of his right to privacy; that the News of the World had published knowing that Mosley would have been likely to have been awarded an injunction if he had been notified; and that the chief reporter of the News of the World had blackmailed a number of women in an attempt to force their co-operation. It is astonishing in this context that, instead of criticising the News of the World or even warning those involved as to their future conduct (both the editor and journalist concerned remain in their roles), the chairman of the PCC reserves his scorn for Mosley. Meyer's approach does nothing to relieve the perception that anyone seeking redress from a national newspaper is wasting his or her time by going to the PCC. \u2022 Dominic Crossley is a principal in the litigation team at the firm Steeles Law dcrossley@steeleslaw.co.uk"
