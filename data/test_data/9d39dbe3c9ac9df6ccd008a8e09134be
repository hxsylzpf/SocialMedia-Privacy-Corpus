  "content": "Michelle's gym Michelle Obama: the new Sarah Brown of social media. She's already on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Instragram, and now Pinterest. We particularly enjoyed this White House workout post. Less to chew on? We're cheered to hear 9 bars, the healthy energy snacks, are going to be in most supermarkets from July. Gutted they'll be 10g smaller though. Putting the glam in glamping AKA, luxury residencies in NYC, are offering \"urban glamping\". Includes rooftop bed and an e-reader for \"campfire\" stories. All for a mere $2,000 a night. Al over for Campbell? Previously politicians might have dreaded the fourth volume of Alastair Campbell's diaries, published on Thursday. But with the Leveson inquiry in full swing, it's Robert Jay who now has them double-checking their diaries. Name a species Fancy naming a species? Last year's winner was \"hotlips\", given to a vivid red fungus. Can you do better?",
