  "content": "My mum had superhuman powers when I was a kid. When I was about eight, a friend and I would play spies on our council estate. We'd use the poorly designed walkways as our lookout posts, and the labyrinth of corridors were the motorways for our high-speed chases. The fun we were having was obviously lost on the angry older lady who lived on the corridor we raced down. She opened her door and shouted at us to stop running and making so much noise. My friend shouted back colourfully, suggesting she go back into her flat and leave us alone. We ran off laughing and I felt like a gangster. I got home to find my mum waiting and angry. She knew what I'd done, who I'd been with and what had been said. At the time I had no idea how she had become so well informed so quickly, but in later years she explained that she'd been informed by the estate's internal communications system \u2013 her network of other mothers and friends who picked up the phone and let her know what I was up to. Now, almost 40 years later, a lot has changed. For many children their playground is digital. Alice Phillips, president of the Girls' Schools Association, warned at a conference recently that some parents had grown afraid of chastising their children in case the little cherubs embarrassed them on social media. She went on to claim that parents were becoming less bold and intuitive and instead were constantly second-guessing themselves. \"I find myself increasingly wanting to reach out to them as I believe that parenting has never been as difficult as it is today,\" Phillips said. \"Why? Because one's instincts are constantly challenged and spontaneous confidence dissolves. Today, social media means they are conscious that their every action is the subject of global scrutiny.\" I'm not sure what sort of people send their children to St Catherine's school in Surrey, where Phillips is head, but parents need to be immune to embarrassment.The job of a parent is to bring up a well-adjusted, balanced young member of society, not to be \"down with the kids\". \"It takes courage and a long time these days to stay out there in the wrong until your teen gradually realises that you are, in fact, dependable, wise and in the right,\" Phillips said. Social media are just another platform for communication, and can be used by parents just as much as by their children. My niece \u2013 let's call her D \u2013 is 11 going on 28. She's bright and cheeky and is constantly testing the boundaries of my sister's parenting. At the age of seven she hacked into my sister's eBay account and tried to negotiate a freebie from a seller of antique dolls. In the face of scare stories about online dangers my sister had been reluctant to let D join social media. Now that D has her own Facebook profile, social media have become the bush telegraph. D is \"friends\" with numerous aunties, neighbours and friends who all keep an eye on her postings and report anything untoward back to my sister. This means my sister gets the information she needs to make informed parenting decisions without having to follow her daughter around social media like some crazed stalker. This, of course, has nothing to do with technology and everything to do with community. The reality is that we don't just live in nuclear-family bubbles. We should all be looking out for each other and each other's children. Instead, too often, we feel that it's none of our business what other people's kids get up to \u2013 and as a result some parents are left feeling isolated. If all else fails and social media are sapping your powers as a parent, you can always confiscate phones and switch off Wi-Fi. But, I guess, if you're highly strung enough to be daunted by your offspring's moaning to their peers, I doubt you'd be able to face down the screams that would inevitably result.",
