  "content": "Lord Browne stepped down as chief executive of BP with immediate effect this afternoon. He tendered his resignation after the House of Lords lifted an injunction that prevented the Mail on Sunday from publishing details of his four-year relationship with another man. He also admitted lying at an earlier court hearing. Lord Browne will forfeit his entitlement to a year's notice, and a bonus worth more than \u00a33.5m. He will also miss out on a long-term share plan that could have generated \u00a312m over the next two years, and had been opposed by BP shareholders. \"In my 41 years with BP I have kept my private life separate from my business life. I have always regarded my sexuality as a personal matter, to be kept private,\" said Lord Browne in a statement released today. \"It is a matter of deep disappointment that a newspaper group has now decided that allegations about my personal life should be made public.\" Today's ruling, and subsequent resignation, came after Lord Browne fought a long-running battle to prevent publication of details about his relationship with Canadian Jeff Chevalier. During the original injunction hearing in January, Lord Browne had told the court that he had met Mr Chevalier by chance, while jogging in Battersea Park. He admitted today that this was not true. \"I deny categorically any allegations of improper conduct relating to BP. The company has confirmed today that it has found no such wrongdoing. My initial witness statement, however, contained an untruthful account about how I first met Jeff,\" said Lord Browne, who said he apologised unreservedly. The injunction had been overturned by the high court in a private session earlier this year, and Mr Justice Eady upheld this ruling today, In refusing to uphold the injunction, Mr Justice Eady said that Lord Browne had told the court \"a white lie\" during the initial injunction hearing. The financial markets reacted calmly to this afternoon's revelations, with BP shares closing 2.5p lower at 563p. Lord Browne's resignation means that Dr Tony Hayward, who had already been named as his successor, becomes chief executive three months earlier than expected. One of the most successful British businessman of recent years, Lord Browne's final few months as BP chairman had already been scarred by revelations surrounding the Texas City disaster. The official inquiry into the tragedy, in which 15 workers died, found that BP had ignored warnings that an accident was imminent at the site, and that cost cuts means that employees involved in the explosion had worked 12-hour shifts for more than four weeks. Earlier this month BP also faced the wrath of shareholders who opposed Lord Browne's remuneration. They were angry that the departing chief executive would be entitled to take part in an incentive scheme until 2009, two years after his departure. Today's shock resignation means this \"golden goodbye\" is no longer an issue."
