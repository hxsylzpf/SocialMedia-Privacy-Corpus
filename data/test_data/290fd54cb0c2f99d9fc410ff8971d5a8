  "content": "The new generation of Friends is upon us. Quarterlife has been airing on MySpacetv.com since November. QLC (Quarterlife crisis) was first identified in 2001 and is a term applied to the period of life immediately following adolescence, usually 21-29; it is now recognised by many therapists and professionals in the mental health field. Personally, I'd call it TBB - That Boring Bit before life gets really interesting and you can leave the worst decade of your life behind. Quarterlife features six twenty-somethings with bad dress sense and even worse taste in furniture: all 70s leather and tank-tops, with nothing matching and not a Jimmy Choo in sight. Some of the characters live or work together, but what they all have in common is that they drink gallons of coffee and, during breaks between coffee breaks, sleep together - in bed or toilets, lying down or standing up, they hardly care which. Such has been the online success of the show that, on February 26, it will launch on NBC. It is the first time a major network is broadcasting an internet service, and the Emmy-winning writer-producer team behind it, Thirtysomething creators Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, claim (wrongly) that it possesses all the qualities of any mainstream TV or film. The website quarterlife.com also offers a \"social network ... a place to explore the issues in your life\". So, what are those issues? Take Dylan, a writer who taps away on her Apple iBook, just like Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw. Unbeknown to her friends, Dylan has been secretly filming them and commenting on their lives on her camera blog and, rather stupidly, is mystified that they aren't happy about this. But Dylan is no Carrie. Here's how she describes herself on her written blog, which you can access in order to find out more about her: \"I believe in the redemptive power of confusion.\" I'm confused already. Does that mean I'm redeemed? I'm confused, therefore I am? Dylan claims to have 873 friends. Yeah, right. Neither have I. This week Dylan has been getting heavy with her mother; the pair argue all the time, a situation not helped by Dylan telling mommie: \"You are the cause of global warming\" (watch that friendship list diminish, week on week). Jed, who works in advertising, thinks Dylan is OK; he didn't even object to the blog, telling Dylan: \"You're a writer; you have to write what moves you.\" Andy will doubtless feel differently after seeing Danny going into the public loos with his girlfriend Vanessa (who's a sideshow, alongside the central six). \"Is Vanessa too attractive for me?\" asks Andy's blog. Nobody thinks she is and now she's been sacked from her band for not turning up to rehearsal, expect more people to take Andy's side. Sex aside, Quarterlife is high on \"issues\". The environment, drug-taking, the state of American politics - all the characters take to the soap box at some point and spout forth. There are also personal issues to explore. Lisa describes herself as a \"heart-breaker, dream-maker, love-taker\". Where I come from, I think that means \"slut\". Dylan's sister Debra wears glasses, so she is deemed The Sensible One. The \"blurb\" on her website announces: \"I just wanted to let everyone know ... I love you.\" The words \"pass\" and \"bucket\" spring to mind. The enthusiasm with which the web audience has embraced Quarterlife (it has 13,444 \"friends\") is a variation on the virtual realm that web-browsers are enjoying on the different sites that allow them to reinvent themselves in worlds they could never hope to inhabit. Here, a cast of characters, a ready-made family, is offered up for speculation and comment, in film and print. One forum, for instance, asks: which character do you most relate to? Hmm. I've been thinking long and hard. Jed, who \"aims to put the gritty back in artistic integrity\"? Nerd. Lisa, who, between breaking hearts, reads Kerouac? Liar. Debra, who loves everyone? Undiscerning. Danny, who enjoys fly-fishing (is that a euphemism, I wonder?) and ladies' lingerie? Perv. Andy, whose girlfriend prefers one-minute stands in public loos? Idiot. Or Dylan, who blows hot air and yet comes out top? Danny sounds the best option. He also has just 87 friends and could do with a bit more support. But to be honest, if I owned a virtual gun, I'd shoot the lot of them."
