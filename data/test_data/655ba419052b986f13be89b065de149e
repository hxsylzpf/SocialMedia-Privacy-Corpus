  "content": "The results are in: Malcolm Turnbull has won the election ... on Instagram. New figures from the photo-sharing platform show the prime minister had the best response of any politician over the eight-week campaign, posting all 10 of the most popular images. The best-liked was of him drinking tea backstage before going on Q&amp;A with a cold. But the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, deserves a nod for increasing his followers by nearly 78% from 8 May to 29 June. He also had the \"most overperforming post\" in terms of engagement in relation to following: a snap of him and the former Labor leaders Bob Hawke, Paul Keating and Julia Gillard just before the Labor campaign launch. Here's a selection of highlights of the campaign, as it played out on Instagram. Tanya Plibersek poses with a pineapple Steven Ciobo, minister for rock lobsters Barnaby Joyce 'catching up' with a bag of tomatoes Ed Husic, Richard Marles and Jason Clare: we're the worst band in the world but we don't give up A campaigning classic from Turnbull Terri Butler celebrates 800 phone calls in a day A #throwback to Lucy Turnbull 'with a very young Daisy' Nuns defacing the Sex party's posters (... allegedly) Behind the scenes at the Labor launch (no bowls of brown M&amp;Ms here) Julie Bishop feigns interest in QR codes Shorten on marriage equality Richard Di Natale's second wombat of the campaign Barnaby Joyce's dog in a suitcase A confronting selfie from Christopher Pyne Turnbull nails it with a picture with Waleed Aly"
