  "content": "Workers be warned: taking to your Facebook page or another social networking site to make derogatory comments about a colleague is not a wise move. Comments that would be construed as bullying in the office are not out of bounds to employers if you make them in public, as one worker found to his cost at a tribunal in Belfast. It upheld a decision by a firm who dismissed an employee for gross misconduct after he posted offensive comments aimed at a co-worker on Facebook. In the case of Teggart v TeleTech UK Limited, Teggart made a Facebook posting referring to the promiscuity of a female work colleague (\"Ms A\") from his home computer, and in his own time. Ms A had not seen the Facebook comments, but was told about them by another colleague. Instead of removing the offensive remark, Teggart posted a further lewd comment about Ms A, who was naturally upset and distressed by the comments. The incident was reported to TeleTech by a concerned colleague of Ms A and Teggart. The tribunal found that the Facebook posts did amount to sexual harassment, and were contrary to the employer's disciplinary and code of conduct policies. In accepting the employer's decision to dismiss, the tribunal rejected Teggart's argument that his rights under the Human Rights Act 1998 had been interfered with because he should not have been dismissed for making \"private\" comments to his circle of friends on Facebook. The tribunal said \"when [Teggart] put his comments on his Facebook pages, to which members of the public could have access, he abandoned any right to consider his comments as being private\". This seems a pretty sensible approach. It's not just on Facebook that employees can come unstuck if they are seen to be bullying colleagues. The following things could all be construed as cyber bullying: \u2022 Sending offensive or threatening emails to a colleague, especially where that person has asked you to stop. \u2022 Texting or tweeting. \u2022 Sharing a person's private data online. \u2022 Bombarding someone with emails where previous email approaches have been rejected. This can happen where a superior is placing unrealistic expectations on another employee, leading to the distress of that employee, and can amount to cyber bullying in extreme cases. Such behaviour poses a serious concern for employers who will need to consider if there is a right to interfere with employees' personal activities, especially outside work. Employers have a duty of care towards their staff and shouldn't refrain from taking action because the bullying activity is taking place outside work or, for example, via a personal mobile phone. Many employers already have well drafted policies in place enabling them to monitor what you do at work, and setting out what conduct is deemed unacceptable whether during work time or otherwise. This will make it far easier for an employer to raise a successful claim for misconduct against the cyber bully wherever and however it is perpetrated. One advantage in dealing with cyber bullying over traditional bullying is that it occurs in a public domain and is not easily hidden. Emails, text messages, posts and blogs can often be traced, even if the bully posts anonymous comments. If you do find yourself on the receiving end of abuse from a colleague, you should bring this to the attention of your employer as soon as possible. It is easier said than done when it's your line manager who is the problem, of course, but you really shouldn't suffer in silence."
