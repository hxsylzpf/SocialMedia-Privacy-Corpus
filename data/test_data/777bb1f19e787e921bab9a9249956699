  "content": "A major social media firm was \"frozen\" with indecision over whether and how to share information with the police in the midst of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, according to journalist and academic Emily Bell. Speaking at SXSW in Austin, Texas, Bell \u2013 Director, Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School \u2013 cited the case as a major example of the way social media firms are completely unprepared to adequately wield the power they have developed. \"For one reason or another I've talked to a number of individuals at social media companies, and what seems to be the case at three or four of them is that they genuinely don't know what to do. Some of these ethical challenges are completely new territory to them,\" Bell said. \"I can anonymise one: there was a social media company which, during the Charlie Hebdo shootings, realised that there may be aspect of the data they owned which was enabling the gunmen to get away \u2013 or might enable the police to stop them. \"One of [that company's] employees told me that they were literally frozen, because they didn't have a rulebook for that situation.\" Also speaking on the panel was former NSA general counsel Stewart Baker, who accused Bell of \"moral bullying\" when it came to Silicon Valley. Quoting author Janet Malcolm, Baker said that \"every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows what he does is morally indefensible,\" and that the industry suffers from the presumption that \"what we think is ethical is what's ethical\". \"What is central to our idea of privacy may be something we didn't care about 20 years ago and won't care about 20 years from now,\" Baker continued. \"The whole right to privacy was invented by an eminent american jurist who said the pain of his privacy being invaded was shocking, worse than physical. And what did he mean? Someone took his picture without his permission. \"I would submit that the reason Silicon Valley is less sensitive to these privacy issues is that they live with the future.\"",
