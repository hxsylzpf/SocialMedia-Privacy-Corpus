  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission today launched a review of phone hacking, asking all newspaper and magazine editors to explain their internal controls aimed at preventing fishing expeditions. The PCC acted after the News of the World royal editor, Clive Goodman, was jailed for four months for phone hacking staff members of the royal household, forcing the resignation of the paper's editor Andy Coulson. The PCC has dropped its proposed questioning of Coulson but has decided to question his successor, Colin Myler, who took up his post this week. Mr Myler will be asked several questions about the incident, including what he will do to ensure that the situation does not reoccur. \"I have previously made clear that I deplore the breach of the code and the law in this case. The commission had announced that it would make specific inquiries of the editor of the newspaper, but as he has now resigned this is no longer appropriate,\" said the PCC chairman, Sir Christopher Meyer. \"There are now various steps that need to be taken. The public has a right to know that lessons have been learned from this episode, both at the newspaper and more generally.\" The PCC was acting \"in order to prevent a similar situation arising in the future\", he added. Editors of national and regional newspapers and magazines and their managements will have to justify the \"extent of internal controls aimed at preventing intrusive fishing expeditions\". They will also be asked to justify steps taken to instil understanding of the PCC code of practice, the law and journalistic public interest exemptions. The PCC board will consider industry responses and publishing a review with recommendations for best practice. Clause 10 of the code of practice state that journalists must not obtain or publish material acquired by intercepting private or mobile telephone calls or messages except in cases of public interest. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
