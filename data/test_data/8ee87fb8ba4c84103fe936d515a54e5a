  "content": "Yet more proof that my cosmic ordering is working, as Broken Britain demagogue Nolly Edmonds hits the headlines again. Noel has met a troll \u2013 or, in the preferred parlance of Lost in Showbiz, Nolly has met a trolly. There seems to be quite a vogue for tracking down one's online tormentors in order to explain to them what arses they are in a more patient, less homicidal way than they explained it to you, and on to this bandwagon has leapt the spry former squire of Crinkly Bottom, arranging a rendez-vous with the creator of a Facebook page entitled: Somebody Please Kill Noel Edmonds. \"We shook hands,\" says Nolly of the detente. \"It was very much a student prank in its origins, no doubt alcohol was involved and he was very apologetic and realised the seriousness of what he had done.\" Good to know. And yet, had I been given prior warning of this high-risk strategy, I might have cautioned against it. When writing this newspaper's Diary column some years ago, a facetious campaign to restore Nolly to TV glory saw me arrange to have dinner with him in a London restaurant. The evening began well enough, but descended into darkness when Noel recommended a book called Why Men Lie and Women Cry: How to Get What You Want Out Of Life By Asking. Attempting to keep things light, I sought to re-engage Nolly on an earlier topic, only for him to lean in and inquire: \"Why are you such a deeply unhappy person?\" I left soon after that, only for Noel to somehow avail himself of my home landline and call me after midnight once or twice \u2013 calls I never picked up. Looking back, I suppose it could have been the Banker phoning to make a deal, but the lesson is surely that one has to be wary of dealing with these people face-to-face. One simply never knows.",
  "lead": "I had the pleasure of meeting 'Nolly' a few years back \u2013 but it seems his encounter with his Facebook tormenter was more fruitful"
