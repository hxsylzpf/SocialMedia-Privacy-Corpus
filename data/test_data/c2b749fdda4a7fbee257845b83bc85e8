  "content": "The crisis over the security of personal information spread to Scotland last night when it emerged that confidential documents had gone missing in transit to Glasgow. The office of Alex Salmond, Scotland's First Minister, was forced to admit that a package containing printed pension benefit statements dispatched from the Scottish Public Pensions Agency to NHS Greater Glasgow cannot be accounted for. The package was sent by the SPPA on 26 October, as one of 162 packages going to 14 separate addresses throughout Scotland, by Fed Ex, the Scottish Executive's official courier. The lost package contains around 200 pension benefit statements, the First Minister's office said. Each contains personal details of names and national insurance numbers, but no addresses and no bank details. 'We consider this to be a serious matter and our inquiries are continuing,' said a spokesman. 'There is no reason to suspect fraud or theft and FedEx are working to trace the package. If the package remains unaccounted for, affected individuals will be fully informed. There is a review under way around data-handling issues in the Scottish government.' The revelation will reignite concerns about the security of data. Last week Gordon Brown apologised to Parliament after personal data on 25 million people went missing."
