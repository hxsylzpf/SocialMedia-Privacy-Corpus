  "content": "OK! magazine breached the privacy code after identifying a woman attending Alcoholics Anonymous, the press watchdog found today. The woman was pictured in a photograph accompanying a male celebrity and the magazine reported that the pair were \"spotted at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting\". Her treatment had not been made public. The Press Complaints Commission said the Northern and Shell magazine's justification for running the article was \"entirely without merit\" and that its actions were \"reckless\". The PCC upheld the woman's complaint that the magazine breached the privacy clause of its code of practice. OK! argued that the woman was not the focus of the article and said as it had not published details about her treatment, readers might conclude that she was simply providing moral support to her friend. However, the PCC ruled that the magazine had clearly published private information about the woman. \"Taken together, the photograph, its caption, and the information in the article constituted intrusive material about her attendance at an AA meeting,\" the PCC said. \"The fact of her treatment was not in the public domain, and there was no public interest reason for publishing references to it without her consent. \"The defence advanced by the magazine - that there was no breach of the code because readers might think the complainant was at the meeting only to provide moral support - was clearly without merit. \"The fact was that the magazine had stated that she had attended the meeting and published a photograph of her outside it. It did not know whether she had been there for treatment herself, and took no care in its presentation of the material to avoid a possible intrusion into her privacy. \"This was reckless in the circumstances, as shown by the subsequent revelation that she had indeed been at the clinic for treatment.\" OK! apologised to the woman and undertook not to republish the material under complaint. In March 2002, supermodel Naomi Campbell was awarded \u00a33,500 in damages when the high court ruled that her confidentiality had been breached when the Daily Mirror published a photograph of her attending a Narcotics Anonymous clinic. Six months later the court of appeal overturned the ruling on the basis that the paper's story was \"a legitimate, if not essential, part of the journalistic package designed to demonstrate that Ms Campbell had been deceiving the public when she said she did not take drugs\". In May 2004 last year the House of Lords ruled by a majority of three to two that the photographs had breached Campbell's confidence and said she should be repaid the costs awarded against her by the appeal court. Campbell had declined to go to the PCC. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
