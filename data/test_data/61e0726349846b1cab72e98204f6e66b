  "content": "Future generations of theologians will look back on today with a mixture of awe and reverence. For on the 12th day of the 12th month of the 12th year of the millennium, Pope Benedict XVI made his foray on to Twitter. At 10.30am GMT, the pope put his sacred hands to the Vatican's holy iPad for the very first time, and wrote: \"Dear friends, I am pleased to get in touch with you through Twitter. Thank you for your generous response. I bless all of you from my heart.\" Now, there's no easy way of putting this to his holiness but, as first tweets go, isn't that a little bit rubbish? The buildup had been monumental. The pope \u2013 or @Pontifex, as he's known to his 700,000 followers \u2013 registered his account last Monday. It took him 10 days to come up with that first missive. Most people assumed the delay was down to him consulting hundreds of ancient spiritual texts in order to find a suitable message of hope with which to announce his presence on social media. But no, instead he basically came on and wrote: \"Look at me everyone! What am I like, eh? LOL.\" It doesn't really matter what @Pontifex does as the weeks go by. He might use Twitter to engage in a serious discussion of faith with his followers. He might just use it to intermittently broadcast inspirational messages of hope, as do the Dali Lama and Yoko Ono do. He might start finishing all his tweets with #YOLO to try to appeal to the kids. Or he might get into a fight with Donald Trump. It is Twitter, after all. That's sort of what it's for. But however the pope chooses to use Twitter in the future, he will for ever have to live with the fact that his first tweet was a dud. And not even a spectacular dud. He's not in Moira Stewart's league. Within minutes of joining, she'd only really managed to blurt out Fiona Bruce's name in a fit of tragic incomprehension. Nor was his first tweet as tentative and bland as many others, such as Alan Hansen's \"Hello\" or Joan Rivers's \"Testing my new account\". He didn't start it with terrible grammar, like Shaquille O'Neal's \", this is the real SHAQUILLE O'NEAL\". It was just a bland, nothingy greeting. Perhaps his holiness should have taken a leaf from Charlie Sheen's book and attached a photo of himself drinking chocolate milk with a porn star to his first tweet. Or followed Sylvester Stallone's lead by basically just boasting about his accomplishments (\"Just enjoying being number one at the box office two weeks in a row \u2026\"). Or Samuel L Jackson's, by swearing needlessly (\"Can-a muh fukkasay fuck on here?\"). But this is all too little, too late. You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and the pope will have to live with the fact that his first step on Twitter was a stumble. Let's just hope he makes up for it when he joins Instagram.",
