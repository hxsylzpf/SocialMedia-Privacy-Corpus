  "content": "Gottfrid Svartholm Warg, founder of the file sharing site and peer-to-peer network The Pirate Bay, has been convicted on hacking charges and illegal downloading in a Denmark court. Warg, who is Swedish, was found guilty of hacking into the US technology service firm, CSC, in February 2012, alongside a 21-year-old Danish accomplice. The pair remained inside CSC's system for four to six months, altering data and downloading social security files. The co-defendant walked free, having been detained for 17 months in pre-trial. Warg argued that he was not responsible for the hack, but that he had been framed, despite documents belonging to CSC being found on his computer and IRC logs between two people using the handles \"Advanced Persistent Terrorist Threat\" and \"My Evil Twin\". Warg denied being behind the \"My Evil Twin\" alias. The unidentified co-defendant, who refused to hand over his encryption key to authorities, testified that Warg was not \"My Evil Twin\", having met in person with the individual behind the online identity. The judge and jury dismissed these claims, asserting that it was unlikely Warg was not behind the hack. Warg will be sentenced on 30 October and could face a sentence of six years. It is not the first time he has fallen foul of the law \u2013 in September 2013 Warg was deported from Cambodia to Sweden after being convicted of copyright charges in relation to the Pirate Bay site. In June of the same year, he was sentenced to two years, also in Sweden, for hacking into Nordea bank's computing system and the UK services firm, Logica."
