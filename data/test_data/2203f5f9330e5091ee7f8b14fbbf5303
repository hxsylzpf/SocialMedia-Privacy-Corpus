  "content": "Its specialist action cameras allow surfers, skiers and other thrillseekers to record their exploits. The devices have been strapped to eagles to give a real bird's eye view of the landscape, and can even be attached to a specially designed harness so that dog owners can view the world through the eyes of their pet. When GoPro floated its shares on Wall Street in June 2014, there seemed to be no limit to how high they might go. Snapped up at $24 a share by an eager investing public, the shares rocketed to $94 as investors backed the US company's vision of fun videos and fast-growing revenues. The company was valued at $3bn (\u00a32.1bn) on flotation and its chief executive, Nick Woodman, scooped $86m by selling part of his stake in the deal. This week, the group's shares lurched dramatically downwards. On Wednesday, they plunged 28% to just more than $12 as the group said sales were not meeting targets and it would miss revenue projections by around 14%for the calendar year. The problems are centred on GoPro's Hero4 Session \u2013 a new camera released last year small enough to fit in the palm of a hand. But buyers balked at the $399 launch price. GoPro cut the price to $299, and then again to $199 (about \u00a3170 in the UK ) in a bid to boost sales. Cheap Chinese competition, from firms like Xiaomi, is another headache. And spooking investors further, the group said it would cut its workforce by around 7%, costing it between $5-10m in restructuring expenses. The statement was more bad news for investors who have been disappointed time and again in recent months. The shares dropped below the issue price of $24 for the first time in November. Over the whole of 2015 they were down 70% . Citi analyst Jeremy David slashed his price target last month from $75 to $22, saying the GoPro novelty may be wearing off: \"We are becoming worried that poor sell thru could be a reflection of diminishing consumer interest in new GoPro devices.\" After this week's news, he's reduced his target further, to $12. Woodman dreamed up the idea for GoPro during a surfing trip after the digital marketing firm he started after college became a casualty of the dot-com collapse. At the time of the float his GoPro shareholding was valued at around $1.3bn. Now it's worth around half that. Needless to say, shareholders have been left unimpressed and are reaching for their lawyers. At least one law firm has started legal action, claiming that the company's management has been too slow to warn investors about its deteriorating sales prospects. Glancy, Prongay and Murray, a Los Angeles-based law firm, alleges in its class action lawsuit that GoPro's management statements since July 2015 have been false and misleading \u2013 specifically with reference to sales of the group's Hero camera range. For others, the extreme market reaction to problems in the delivery of one product is a very good reason to remain in the private sector and not float. Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at Balderton, an investor in companies such as Betfair, Wonga and The Hut, said the huge share price reaction was down to one product not working out as expected: \"While that is not a good thing, the reaction seems extreme and is typical of public markets \u2013 extreme enthusiasm/pessimism around technology companies.\" That overreaction, he says, \"is one of the big drivers of why many big tech companies, such as Uber and AirBnb, are choosing to stay private. It allows them to stay agile, build for the long term,\" he says. GoPro's statement came in the middle of a difficult week for US technology stocks. Over the last week both Fitbit, the exercise monitor, and Etsy, the digital crafts marketplace, have sunk to all-time share price lows. Shares in the larger technology companies are also well down on their three-month highs. Facebook was trading at $95 on Friday afternoon, compared with $107 at the end of December. Netflix is down from $130 to around $103, and Amazon's shares are trading at around $570 compared with $694 at the end of 2015. GoPro's management and investors will be hoping its next products can revitalise its flagging stock. The company is expected to launch a new line of products in the first half of 2016, including a flying camera. Should that catch on, investors could return. Woodman tried to remain optimistic, when he addressed employees by email after the news of the revenue shortfall. \"Today isn't the type of day we're used to at GoPro. But from the looks of things \u2026 tomorrow is looking pretty damn good.\" How the tech giants have fared All the major US technology groups have suffered from share price falls, along with the market, so far this year. Facebook Shares in Facebook performed strongly in 2016, finishing the year 33% up. But, in common with its peers, 2016 has been a different story so far and its shares are down 6%. Still they're trading around $98, which is way above the social media group's $38 issue price at the time of its Wall Street flotation in 2012. Amazon Amazon shares, which finished 2015 122% up on the previous year, have also been losing ground in the first few days of 2016. The Amazon share price, which has touched $700 in the past three months, has now dived under $600 as investors worry that founder Jeff Bezos might ramp up investment in the group again rather than restrict it in order to boost profitability. Netflix Netflix shares, which have hovered around $130 in the past three months, have come perilously close to dropping below $100 this week. The nervousness comes in line with the sector but also reflects nervousness over subscriber numbers. Netflix recently announced an earlier-than-expected expansion into 130 new countries, including India and Russia. Alphabet (formerly known as Google) Alphabet, the company created last year to become the parent for Google's search engine and several other companies it owns, is also seeing some weakness, with its shares trading at just under $700 after being around $750 towards the end of last year. Its market capitalisation, though, at $482bn, is fast catching up with Apple. Twitter Twitter's share price has been hitting all-time lows of around $18, well below the $26 price at the time of its flotation in November 2013. Investors are worried about the messaging platform's slowing user growth and they aren't yet sold on the idea of adding a service that would adapt its 140 character model. Apple Apple's shares have drifted down from around $120 to $96 since November last year as concerns have grown over iPhone sales. The technology giant is scaling back orders for its previously hot-selling device. But it remains the world's biggest company by market capitalisation, at about $550bn."
