  "content": "Instagram's new Hyperlapse app has made it possible for users to create high quality timelapse videos using their iPhones. In the past, timelapse videos have required specific expensive equipment and therefore they have been difficult to make but the Hyperlappse app has made timelapse photography more easily accessible for all. With the app launching last week, this is the perfect chance for you to share your Hyperlapse efforts with us. We will include the most impressive of them on our site. GuardianWitness is the home of user-generated content on the Guardian. Contribute your video, pictures and stories, and browse news, reviews and creations submitted by others. Posts will be reviewed prior to publication on GuardianWitness, and the best pieces will feature on the Guardian site."
