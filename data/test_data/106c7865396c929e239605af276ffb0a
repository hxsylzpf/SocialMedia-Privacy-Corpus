  "content": "Twitter will expand its efforts to \"curate\" tweets and media for its users, according to chief executive Dick Costolo, although his latest comments to analysts stopped short of signalling a Facebook-style filter for people's main timelines. In the social network's latest earnings call, Costolo was asked whether Twitter plans to expand to all users the curated feed of noteworthy tweets that logged-out users see when visiting its site. \"As we iterate on the logged-out experience and curate topics, events, moments that unfold on the platform, you should absolutely expect us to deliver those experiences across the total audience and that includes logged in users and users in syndication,\" said Costolo. Twitter recently launched a new version of its homepage for people who visit without being logged in to the service \u2013 more than 500 million of them a month, according to the company's latest figures. \"By organising our content in a way that's easily discovered and consumed, we extend the reach of Twitter far beyond the 302 million people who log in every month,\" said Costolo earlier in the earnings call. \"We first introduced the logged-out home page on desktop in the US and we intend to bring it more places over time, while also iterating on it and making improvements that keep it informative, entertaining and relevant.\" Twitter's plans for curation are being followed closely by its keenest users, who fear that it may change its current system of an unfiltered timeline of tweets presented in reverse-chronological order. That contrasts with Facebook's news feed algorithm, which analyses the 1,500-odd posts that the average user could see in any given day, and narrows them down to around 300 that are actually shown in the feed. In September 2014, Twitter's financial chief Anthony Noto suggested that the unfiltered timeline approach \"isn't the most relevant experience for a user\" and hinted that Twitter was keen to \"organise that content better\". This, of course, would give more scope to prioritise ads, at a time when Twitter has admitted that its \"direct response\" technology to target ads is underperforming. But the changes might also help the company reignite growth from its current 302m monthly active users. Early adopters may not need to panic just yet, since unfiltered timelines and curated timelines are not necessarily an either/or choice for the company. If the goal genuinely is to make Twitter more accessible for new users, it is quite possible that the company will introduce an option to have its main timeline curated \u2013 it already offers new signups an \"Instant Timeline\" of accounts to follow based on their existing contacts \u2013 while leaving in the ability for experienced users to keep the traditional unfiltered feed.",
