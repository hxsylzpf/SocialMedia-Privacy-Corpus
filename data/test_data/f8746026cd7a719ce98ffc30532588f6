  "content": "Criterion Capital Partners, the US investment firm that snapped up Bebo for a knock down price, is poised to do the same with online TV service SeeSaw. SeeSaw-owner Arqiva, the broadcast transmission company, is close to signing an 11th-hour deal. Arqiva said in late May that it intended to close SeeSaw, which employs 28 staff, this week after failing to find a buyer following a strategic review carried out by Ingenious Media. Criterion is headed by Adam Levine, who last June bought Bebo for the reported price of about $10m (\u00a36.17m) as part of the investment company's strategy to buy and turnaround companies with revenue between $3m and $30m. AOL had acquired Bebo just two years previously for $850m. Michael Jackson, the former Channel 4 chief executive, runs the Bebo operation for Criterion. \"Arqiva is still in discussion with various parties about a possible sale of SeeSaw,\" said a spokesman for Arqiva. SeeSaw was launched using the assets of ITV, Channel 4 and BBC Worldwide's defunct video-on-demand venture Project Kangaroo, which Arqiva acquired for about \u00a38m. At its launch in February last year, SeeSaw offered 3,000 hours of free programmes including Skins, Kingdom and Doc Martin. Three months later it began offering paid-for content, with 1,000 hours of shows including South Park and Spooks, and struck deals with US broadcasters including MTV and NBC Universal. But third-party internet TV aggregators have struggled to compete with broadcasters' own in-house on-demand services, and SeeSaw failed to gain a significant following compared to rival offerings such as the BBC iPlayer, ITV Player and Channel 4's 4oD. Joost, the web-TV service founded by the Dutch technology entrepreneurs behind Skype, closed its UK service in 2009. SeeSaw's predecessor, Kangaroo, was originally conceived as a way for the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, to generate digital revenue from the corporation's content. While iPlayer programmes are free, they are only available for a limited window after broadcast. The future of SeeSaw rival Blinkbox looks assured following Tesco's decision to acquire an 80% stake in the business last month. Blinkbox offers a range of free and paid-for downloads, with shows including Shameless, Peep Show and Top Gear. Tesco is one of the largest UK retailers of physical DVDs and Blinkbox will complement its in-store offering as the market for downloads grows. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
