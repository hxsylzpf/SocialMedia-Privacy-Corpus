  "content": "Job: chief executive, Twitter Age: 49 Industry: digital media 2012 ranking: 2 His unlikely past as a standup comedian might help Dick Costolo make light of the rigours of running the 140-character social network. But the pressure he faces to turn Twitter into a global moneyspinner grows greater by the tweet. He has made headway. Twitter is a noticeably more commercial vehicle than it was just two years ago, with a growing number of promoted tweets in the news streams of its 200 million users. Promoted trends also look to have taken off: big brands now routinely pay to appear top of Twitter's most talked-about topics, and there has been no major backlash from users about artificial devices muddying the waters. And that is significant, because Costolo's courtship of advertisers will necessarily increase over coming months and years. Twitter is said to be preparing an advertising exchange, where marketers would be able to target users directly based on their assumed interests. For example, tennis retailers would be able to push ads promoting the latest rackets to a Twitter user who had recently visited a website offering that equipment. Such a move would doubtless suffer unflattering comparisons with rival Facebook's successful advertising exchange, which it launched last summer, but that is unlikely to concern Costolo in his hunt to generate more revenue from the free service. Analysts eMarketer has forecast that Twitter will earn $582.8m (\u00a3373.7m) in global ad revenue this year, rising to nearly $1bn next year, as advertising on mobile hots up. More significantly, perhaps, Twitter is estimated to earn $309.9m in ad revenue from mobile this year, which is more than it generated in total across all platforms in 2012, when it made $138.4m from mobile ads. Analysts believe that Twitter has benefited from the increased enthusiasm for mobile thanks to rivals Google and Facebook, which are both boosting efforts to coax advertisers to target users on their smartphones and tablet computers. Twitter was forced to apologise after a campaign by a number of UK women targeted with rape and bomb threats on the social network and has introduced \"report tweet\" option for abusive messages. Come 2014, when Twitter is expected to make its hotly anticipated stock market debut, Costolo will hope to have convinced all commercial partners that his site is more than the trading place of 140-character quips \u2013 or abuse."
