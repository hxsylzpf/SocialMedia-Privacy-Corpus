  "content": "Where are you now? An office, a library, an internet cafe in Calcutta? Are you somewhere you shouldn't be? Perhaps you're reading this on your mobile phone after taking the day off work to stomp in the snow? Have you sneaked away from your desk for a cigarette? It's a silly question really, because I know where you are. I'm looking at you now. And not just me, but your family, friends and work colleagues too. We're all looking at you. Move, and a smiling icon of your face will glide across a personalised map on our computer screens. Anyone who sees Google's tracking system launched this week as nothing more than a cool gadget is playing with with fire. Some have characterised yesterday's critical House of Lords report into the surveillance society by its omissions, such as its failure to mention government plans to monitor all our calls, emails and internet use. Doing so is unfair, because the authors probably went as far as the political context would allow them. But it would have been good to read more about the perils of toys created by Google. The Google people give their own cute explanation for what Latitude is all about. Essentially, though, you can enable people to track you and, in return, if they're nice, you can watch them too. The technology uses GPS-equipped Smart phones, or triangulation using cell towers, or Wifi, but there is really nothing scientifically new here. The telecoms industry, and others, have been experimenting with \"location-aware\" devices for some time. Technology blogs are buzzing at the prospect of a new toy, with 10 reasons why Latitude will succeed to 10 uses off the top of my head. Here are two reasons why Google Latitude is deeply sinister. The first is highlighted by Privacy International, a decent thinktank that employs wizards to look through the complicated fine print of invasive technology. On this occasion though, a child could have stumbled across the \"fundamental design problem\": Step 1: Pick up someone's phone without them knowing. Maybe you're a manager who wants to check on a serially late employee. Or a jealous boyfriend. Or a serial killer. Doesn't matter, just do it. Step 2: Enable Google Latitude. Step 3: Mask your presence so the owner of the phone doesn't know that you're watching them. But no, Google responds! Latitude's built-in mechanism to prevent fraudulent use will send text messages to your phone to inform you the system has been installed. If, that is, you have the programme installed on the right device. And if you \"have not used it recently\". And if not? Enthusiasts will respond that Google is not the only mobile tracking device on the market, nor the only one that can be used fraudulently. They will point out that Google has been kind enough not keep a database of our whereabouts. That misses the point. Google practically is the internet, and its services have become as intrinsic to our use of the internet as keyboards and Internet Explorer. What happens when Latitude becomes as ubiquitous as Google Search, GoogleMap and Gmail? Well, then we arrive at reason number two why this technology constitutes a serious threat. The more people who use Latitude, the more it becomes embedded in the way we live, the more freedom and unpredictability are curtailed. Imagine the popularity of Google Latitude balloons, without those inevitable privacy breaches. MI5 leaves laptops on trains, hackers steal 4.5 million CVs from a recruitment website and the government loses 25 million child benefit records. But no one thinks to pinch someone's phone in a pub to spend the rest of the night tracking them, for a laugh. Latitude is just a soft, bubbly, Googley toy that harms no-one. This is called suspending disbelief. Everyone you know is \"Latitude-enabled\". Peek at your screen and hundreds of smiling icons peer back at you on a GoogleMap. You're no longer free. If you're married, you might not want to spend a night in someone else's bed. But at least you have the choice. Less infidelity is a good thing, of course. But part of the reason couples stay together is that bond of trust in knowing that the other half could, if they wanted, sleep with another, but they don't \u2013 not because Google Latitude will catch them out \u2013 but because they choose not to. The same goes for skyving off work, or surprising a friend with an unplanned visit to their house, or organising a surprise birthday party for your kids. The option for that party has been snatched away. On his eighth birthday, your son is going to come home from football practice, glance at his phone, and see the smiling faces of 17 classmates lingering above a satellite image of the roof of his house. Call me an anarchist, but I don't want to see who in my network is in a cafe before deciding whether that is the place I should buy my coffee. I like the surprise behind the door, whether good or bad. And I especially like the idea of walking down the road not knowing who I might bump into around the corner. If I'm alerted beforehand by a beep in my pocket and two faces \u2013 one mine, the other a friend I haven't seen for years \u2013 sliding towards each other on a map, then the moment has been spoiled. Google Latitude, you have just sucked the fun out of my life."
