  "content": "Kate Middleton is pursuing legal action against a photographer who took pictures of her on Christmas Day, a month after the Queen warned the media over publication of paparazzi photographs of the royals. Law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis, which acts for the Queen and Prince Charles, is understood to be demanding damages from the photographer and Rex Features, which distributed the images, for invasion of privacy, and for the pictures to be withdrawn from circulation. The photographs, which have been published in Germany but not in the UK, show Middleton, Prince William's girlfriend, playing tennis at Restormel Manor, Cornwall. Prince William was not present at the time the photographs were taken. A spokesman for St James's Palace confirmed a \"private complaint\" was being pursued by Middleton for \"alleged harassment\" of her family on Christmas Day. The Queen's lawyers contacted newspapers last month informing them of privacy obligations under their own code of practice, having become frustrated about intrusion into the private lives of the royals and their friends. The move was thought to have had the full backing of high-profile members of the royal family, including Princes William and Harry and their father, Prince Charles. William previously voiced concerns after Middleton was hounded by the paparazzi in 2007. Neither Rex Features nor Harbottle &amp; Lewis were available for comment at the time of publication. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
