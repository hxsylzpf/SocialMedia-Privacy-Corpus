  "content": "The wife of the world's number one golfer, Tiger Woods, today obtained a judgment awarding her \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3180,000) in damages against Irish magazine the Dubliner, which apologised in court for publishing fake porn photos of her during the Ryder Cup last year. The Dubliner magazine has also agreed to pay some of Elin Nordegren Woods legal costs after it ran a picture of a semi-naked woman alongside a caption referring to the Swedish model. Nordegren Woods is donating the sum she receives to cancer support charities in memory of Irish golfer Darren Clarke's late wife, Heather. The explicit photographs and article, which was titled \"Ryder Filth for Dublin\", featured in an edition of the Dubliner magazine published just days before the opening of the US Ryder Cup match against Europe in the Irish Republic in September last year. In a statement read by senior counsel, Eoin McCullough, at Dublin's Circuit civil court the Dubliner's publisher, Trevor White, admitted the story was cheap, tasteless, and deliberately offensive and completely untrue. \"The story and photograph generated worldwide publicity which was profoundly hurtful to Nordegren Woods,\" he said in the statement. \"It is particularly shameful that this article was published at a time when Nordegren Woods was, like thousands of others, a guest in this country and when the international media attention was focused upon the event.\" Settling the case before a full hearing commenced, the magazine agreed to pay \u20ac125,000 (\u00a390,000) over the next two years and a contribution towards costs. \"The false and deeply offensive article in The Dubliner magazine, with the accompanying photograph of another woman wrongly claimed to be me, caused great personal distress to me and my family,\" said Nordegren Woods. \"We are delighted at today's outcome and relieved that we may now put the experience behind us,\" she added. \"This regrettable episode in our lives in no way detracts from the great love of Ireland that Tiger and I share. We look forward to experiencing the extraordinary warmth of its people and of our many friends in Ireland again in the future.\" As a result of the controversy, Ireland's largest chain of newsagents, Eason, withdrew copies of the lifestyle magazine. But the image was reproduced in Irish editions of some British tabloids. The Dubliner's Publishers, Dubliner Media Limited, immediately issued a full apology, insisting the article was intended to be satirical. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
