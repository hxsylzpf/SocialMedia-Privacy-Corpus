  "content": "The Information Commissioner's Office has issued a privacy warning to users of social networking sites, but Emily Hill says we should stop being paranoid. She seems to think her email address and mobile phone number would be needed to make use of her identity. Not so. After all, identity theft isn't likely to involve someone donning your clothes and swanning down the street pretending to be you. It can just constitute borrowing your personal information for, say, a fake credit card application. Now that will look nice on your credit record, won't it? Identity fraud can be perpetrated without the help of Facebook, but let's not provide a leg-up by splattering our personal details over the web. You wouldn't leave a poster bearing your full name and date of birth taped to a lamppost, so why do the equivalent online? As to Hill's assertion that \"no one can fire you for posting pictures of your drunken exploits on a website\", tread carefully. It's already happening. One story that recently did the internet rounds concerned a bank intern busted for skiving after photos posted on Facebook revealed he was not, in fact, absent from work due to a family emergency (it was the fairy outfit that gave it away). Then there was the student from Pennsylvania's Millersville University who was refused her education degree due to an \"unprofessional\" picture she posted on MySpace (it was a pirate get-up this time). Check Facebook in work time and you also risk dismissal. Public sector workers in particular have been warned off Facebooking on the job so they're not seen to be wasting public money, while the army have been told to watch their electronic footprints for security reasons. Most worrying, though, is Hill's assertion that there are \"plenty of reasons to get paranoid about the use and abuse of personal information in cyberspace, but teenagers' posting their dates of birth and mobile numbers on social networking sites isn't one of them.\" Really? Would you be happy for your teenage child to post his or her mobile number online so absolutely anyone could get their hands on it? Hill's assertion that the internet is somewhere teens can merrily and safely go to have fun is naive at best. The internet is not a fluffy, friendly place. Take the case of 13-year-old Montana teenager Megan Meier, who committed suicide after falling victim to a web hoax. Whatever your age or occupation, if you leave any kind of electronic footprint, you are taking risks. We should be following the advice offered by sites like Get Safe Online, not encouraging teenagers or anyone else to shrug off these risks. By all means use Facebook, but use it safely and wisely."
