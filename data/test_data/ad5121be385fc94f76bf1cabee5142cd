  "content": "The recent earthquake in New Zealand was a good example of the way many governments use social media, with the country's ministry of civil defence and emergency management providing updates on vital information and tweeting from @EQKalkoura. But now that organisations in all sectors, public and commercial, have gone beyond using social media for basic communication and are instead exploiting it for sophisticated campaigns, government departments and local authorities around the world are looking at how to use social media more creatively, for themselves and their citizens. One country leading the way is Canada, including the cities of Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver, which have made great strides in \"devising capacities for interaction and engagement, rather than merely informing the public,\" according to author Jeffrey Roy, who has written about the use of social media in Canadian local government. Toronto's public health division runs an annual condomTO campaign, which uses social media to address a public health issue, and which has won several prizes for its social media efforts. Vancouver uses social media to inform citizens about emergencies. Following a fire at the city's port in March 2015, the local government's main Facebook post on the incident reached nearly 250,000 people \u2013 almost half of the city's population \u2013 and its tweets were trending across Canada. Calgary has made social media its \"primary communication tactic\". It puts out relatively few posts but aims for more interactions of engagement per post, which it says has been effective. This month it put out a blog with a map showing the potential amount of sunshine on roofs of Calgary homes. It was the city's most popular blog of the year, with 35,000 visits. In Australia, Brisbane council uses social media to raise awareness of areas of civic pride in the area, as it felt people didn't know enough about its cultural sites. It has begun an Instagram campaign, which has 57,000 followers. A survey by consultancy BDO in 2015 found that 74% of UK councils believed there was a moderately or extremely high appetite within their organisations to maintain a strong social media presence \u2013 an increase of 7% from the previous year . The way UK councils use social media is also changing. One example is Shropshire council's WhatsApp a councillor, which lets residents use the messaging app to ask their local councillors questions. At the London borough of Camden, interim chief information officer Omid Shiraji says his council uses a number of social platforms to communicate with residents on specific issues. \"We're using it for targeted campaigns \u2013 such as for raising awareness on issues like domestic violence,\" he says. This enables the borough to highlight relevant details and direct people to services. Social media has also been used for voter registration: by targeting people by age and location, the council was able to boost electoral registrations to \"record levels\", says Shiraji. The next step, according to Shiraji, could be to reinventsome services with social media at their centre. Cost-effective recruitment For lessons on how to use social media, local authorities can look to police and fire departments. Vancouver's police department uses Twitter to seek information on wanted criminals, while Cambridgeshire Fire &amp; Rescue has used Facebook advertising to encourage more women to become firefighters. \"It was a hugely successful campaign which didn't cost us much, as we were able to target the age group, gender, and ensure candidates lived within a 10-mile radius of Cambridgeshire,\" says Hayley Douglas, head of media and communications at Cambridgeshire Fire &amp; Rescue. Five of the 21 recruits who joined after the campaign were women, a jump in number from the previous year. Most forms of digital technologies come attached with huge costs, but social media is an exception. It is free to use for organisations and citizens alike, which makes it attractive for public sector bodies. But it is hard to analyse whether social media use has been successful or not. Some local authorities, such as Suffolk county council, have decided to focus more on engagement than views or shares. \"We used to use Twitter because we thought it was getting us the most reach, but we have now understood that it isn't all about reach, it's about how many people are going to find value in the posts we put out, and that's where Facebook is having more of an effect,\" says Matt Woor, social media channel manager at the council. At Cambridgeshire Fire &amp; Rescue, Douglas says they look at how certain social posts are faring and use this information to decide which type of content to share. This is also the how Holly Springs, a small town of 30,000 people in Wake County, North Carolina, claims to have increased its number of followers on Facebook] and Twitter last year. The town, whose strapline is \"Best place to raise kids in North Carolina\" uses its Facebook page to talk to residents about local events or traffic holdups. It may, right now, be a trial and error approach to new social media, but as new apps and features emerge, it's clear there's plenty government organisations can learn from one another and other public organisations what will work best for them and their citizens.
