  "content": "Tomorrow is the day that Conficker - one of the most widespread computer worms in recent years - gears up towards its next stage. Athough it's estimated that vast numbers of Windows PCs have been infected, nobody is quite sure what to expect, even the experts. Although there is no need to be alarmed, you might be wondering how to check whether you're infected. In January, we gave some advice in the Ask Jack column on how to screen for and eliminate Conficker, but given that it has mutated again (the newest variant was only discovered earlier this month) it's worth revisiting the method for protecting yourself. First, check whether you are infected. Only Windows PC users should be concerned (people who use Macs or other operating systems are not vulnerable). The easiest way is to conduct a quick check is to try and visit pages from anti-virus companies Symantec and McAfee. If you can't get there, the chances are you've been infected: Conficker blocks access to some to keep you in the dark. Although anyone who downloaded Microsoft Security Update MS08-067 should be safe, it's worth checking anyway - Conficker can also spread by guessing your passwords or hiding on like USB sticks and iPods. If you are concerned that you've caught a case of Conficker, then you'll need to get hold of a removal tool to clean your machine. The Conficker Working Group - a coalition of security experts - has been keeping track of some, while community detection website DShield has a good list of Conficker repair tools. You can use any of these programs to clean your PC and give Conficker the boot. However, make sure you download your removal program from a source you trust: lots of malware writers create fake anti-virus software that actually infects your computer with more bad stuff instead of cleaning it. And once that's over, it's always worth keeping in mind the basic tenets of protecting yourself from malicious code: keep your anti-virus software up to date, and make sure that you regularly download software updates to keep your machine patched. That way you should stay virus-free - and whatever happens on April 1, you'll be immune.",
