  "content": "A Facebook campaign is calling for Sky News reporter Martin Brunt to be sacked following the death of a woman the broadcaster alleged to be one of the internet trolls abusing the McCann family. The woman, who was subsequently identified by the media as Brenda Leyland, was found dead in a hotel room days after she appeared on Sky News in an investigation into internet \"trolling\". The campaign, based at a Facebook page called Sack Martin Brunt, follows Brunt's exclusive report. Sky News has a rigorous set of internal guidelines for its reporters but insiders say each story is handled on a case-by-case basis. Although she appeared on camera, Leyland was not named and registration plates on nearby cars were pixellated. During the report, Brunt and his team took extra precautions such as not naming the village where Leyland lived and Brunt referred to her only by her Twitter name, @sweepyface. However, she was subsequently named in newspaper reports. The Guardian understands the story was looked at closely by Sky's lawyers before it was broadcast and Sky is confident that proper procedures had been followed. The broadcaster is reviewing in the situtation in the wake of Leyland's death. Sky News' guidelines state: \"Any grounds for an investigation that involves significant intrusion into any individual's privacy must be very strong. Before we start out we must be certain that any such intrusion is outweighed by the seriousness of the story and the amount of public good that will be delivered by its publication and/or broadcast.\" The detailed guidelines also say: \"People who are the subject of reports should not be treated unfairly. Where wrongdoing is alleged, they should be offered an opportunity to respond. \"Where there may be doubt or uncertainty over a legal issue \u2013 in the first instance check with the Head of Home News or Head of International News, as appropriate. Remember: if in doubt, do not proceed, broadcast or publish. Always refer upwards.\" Brunt \u2013 who has himself become the subject of online abuse \u2013- is said to be upset by Leyland's death but has not yet made any comment. Sky News is not expected to comment further beyond a statement that said: \"We were saddened to hear of the death of Brenda Leyland. It would be inappropriate to speculate or comment further at this time.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
