  "content": "To quote Polonius, \"brevity is the soul of wit\" \u2013 and the proof is the #15secondshakespeare trend on Twitter. Users, mostly actors, have been sharing 15-second videos in which they recite song lyrics with the chops usually reserved for the most dramatic of Shakespeare scenes, and then nominate others to do the same. Here are some of the best. Amanda Abbington does Pharrell Williams's Happy: Cynthia Erivo does Beyonc\u00e9's Single Ladies: Minnie Driver does Kanye West and Jamie Foxx's Gold Digger: Jenna Russell does Pulp's Common People: Fisayo Akinade does Nicki Minaj's Anaconda: Aneurin Barnard does Gina G's Ooh Aah Just a Little Bit: Andy Nyman does S Club 7's Reach: Edd Post does Meghan Trainor's All About that Bass: Mark Bonnar does PSY's Gangnam Style: Alec Newman does Huey Lewis and the News's The Power of Love: Rebecca Callard does Shaggy's It Wasn't Me: Drew Ballantyne, Rachel Marwood, Kamaal Hussain and Tom Power do Destiny's Child's Bootylicious: Caroline Sheen does the Bangles' Manic Monday: Why not show your own dramatic chops? Join in the fun by tweeting your 15-second video with the hashtag #15secondshakespeare."
