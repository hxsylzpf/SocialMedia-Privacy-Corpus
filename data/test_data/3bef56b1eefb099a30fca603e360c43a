  "content": "ITV News is to incorporate social media into its TV bulletins as it launches a year-long strand called The Cuts: Your Stories, which will follow a panel of viewers as they deal with the impact of measures announced in today's budget. For the first time, from this evening, ITV news bulletins will frequently incorporate social media, by encouraging viewers to ask questions of reporters and financial experts during the news. At first it will be limited to the early evening news but ITV plans to expand it to News at Ten. During this evening's 6.30pm ITV News, viewers will be invited to join the nationwide project The Cuts: Your Stories. From those who get in touch, ITV will recruit what it calls a \"giant panel\", focusing on public service workers such as GPs, teachers, refuse collectors, people who deliver care for the elderly and the disabled, librarians and swimming instructors. ITV said it was also looking for \"families of all shapes and sizes, as community care and support services that form the fabric of their lives are cut back or disappear altogether\". The ITV News editor, Deborah Turness, said: \"Government cuts will dominate the news agenda for a long time to come, and our panel will show their direct impact on people from all walks of life.\" Turness added that the leaders' debates during the general election campaign earlier this year had spurred on ITV News to incorporate social media into bulletins. \"The debates brought social media out of the teenage bedroom and into the living room. So many people enjoyed the experience of watching TV whilst chatting online it became a mainstream experience. \"We wanted to build on that in our news programmes and use social media as a platform to offer useful information to our viewers whilst harvesting their take on living in 'austerity Britain'.\" Initially the opportunity to ask questions of ITV reporters will only happen during the 6.30pm bulletin and for around half an hour after the news finishes. Viewers will be able to do so via www.itv.com/news. Tonight, questions will be taken by ITV News reporter Phil Reay Smith and experts from Fidelity International and moneysupermarket.com. The reporters and experts available to answer viewers' questions will change over the weeks, depending on the focus of that particular day's report. It is expected that a package on the panel and the social media element will be incorporated into ITV News bulletins around once a week or fortnight, depending on the news agenda. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
