  "content": "Another royal privacy battle is being fought, this time in Spain. Telma Ortiz, sister-in-law of Prince Felipe, the heir to the throne, tried unsuccessfully to obtain a restraining order against 50 media organisations. She claimed photographers were making her life a misery. But a judge in Toledo confirmed a ruling in May that the order would be \"legally unviable\" because, whether she likes it or not, Ortiz \u2013 as the sister of Felipe's wife, Princess Letizia \u2013 is in the limelight.
