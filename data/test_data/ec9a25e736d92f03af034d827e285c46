  "content": "The chairman of the Press Complaints Commission today defended the watchdog against the charge that it was a \"cosy editors' club\" by insisting it had \"broken free\" from its creators in the media. Speaking a fortnight after the launch of a private member's bill calling for the replacement of the PCC with a new statutory body, Sir Christopher Meyer insisted the self-regulatory body \"grants no privileges to editors\" and denied the long-standing criticism that it is too close to tabloid editors. \"This charge is actually the old conspiracy theory in new clothes: that Tim [Toulmin, the director of the PCC] and I plot with editors from, say, Associated Newspapers and News International to dish the complainant - of course, I pluck the names of these newspaper groups entirely at random,\" he said today in a speech to the Society of Editorsy. \"The PCC grants no privileges to editors. We are acutely aware that a complainant, who has never been in the media's glare before, may require from us special support and advice in what can be a deeply intimidating situation, confronted by the Goliath of a major newspaper.\" Sir Christopher, who took over as chairman of the PCC two years ago after Lord Wakeham's involvement in the Enron scandal forced him to resign, said the commission was not an organisation in which \"journalists sit in judgment on journalists\", pointing out that none of its staff has a journalistic background. \"If this is a cosy editors' club, my name is Max Clifford,\" he saod. Sir Christopher said the weight of lay-dominated majority opinion on the commission was such that \"no single editor can pursue a personal agenda at the expense of the common good\". \"At the risk of the press standards board of finance terminating me with extreme prejudice, I would venture that the PCC has now become a bit of a Frankenstein: the creature that broke free from its creators. Another analogy would be the relationship between the Bank of England and the Treasury. Sure, the newspaper industry pays our wages and bills. But, like the Treasury with the bank, it tampers with our independence at its peril,\" he added. Sir Christopher, the former British ambassador to Washington, made his comments after the MP Peter Bradley called for the PCC to be replaced with a statutory body that would give people the right to correct significant inaccuracies about them in newspapers. Mr Bradley claimed that complaining to the commission was \"futile\" because out of the 3,649 complaints made under the editors' code of practice in 2003, only 11 (0.3%) were upheld. Sir Christopher also called on those newspaper publishers that do not already do so to make compliance with the PCC code a contractual obligation for journalists. Of national newspapers, only the Independent and Express groups do not include compliance with the code in contracts. \"Most companies make it a requirement, but not all do. Yet it is an initiative that has helped raise editorial standards. It has underlined the PCC's credibility. I see no reason for it not to be as widespread as possible. I will therefore shortly be writing to newspapers where it is not currently the norm to find out whether and when it will be,\" he said. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
