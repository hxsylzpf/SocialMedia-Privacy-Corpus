Seesmic, the video community site, is sponsoring a few episodes of the John Cleese's 'Headcast' podcast. We did notice Cleese pop up on Twitter a couple of months ago and are assured by Dean Whitbread, the Headcast producer, that this is the genuine article. \"John is a genuine 'silver surfer',\" said Whitbread. \"He's into web chat, and he likes Seesmic because of it's frank and unmoderated style. I showed him a while back that Deepak Chopra was a fairly frequent visitor. They know and like one another, so that piqued John's interest and he's done an intro for an audio project of Deepak's I believe.\""
