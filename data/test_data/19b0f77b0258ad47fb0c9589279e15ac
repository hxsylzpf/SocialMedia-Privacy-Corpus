  "content": "There are obvious problems for journalists tweeting live trials. Reporters want people to be able to follow the twists and turns of the courtroom in real time, but need to hold something back too, otherwise there would be no point writing lengthy (as in longer than 140 characters) copy afterwards. Attempts to reconcile this dilemma can result in frustrating experiences for readers. When Colorado's Greely Tribune covered the case of John Sandoval \u2013 accused of murdering his estranged wife 14 years ago \u2013 the last of its tweets read simply \"jurors have reached verdict\". Talk about a cliffhanger \u2013 you had to wait for the newspaper to find out what they said. Then there is multi-tasking. Until there are dedicated court-tweet-correspondents, humble reporters like me have to juggle tweeting, taking a note for fuller copy later, and \u2013 not to be forgotten \u2013 listening to what's going on. Once you start tweeting, people get upset if you stop. At the truly gruesome sentencing hearing for Russell Williams, the British-born Canadian air force commander who filmed the rape and murder of a woman to fulfil his lingerie fetish, readers complained at the agonising gaps between twitter updates. Williams, the \"shining, rising star\" of the Canadian military \u2013 who had once flown the Queen \u2013 but lived a double life of sexual perversion, was told by the judge that he \"will forever be remembered as a sadosexual serial killer\", and that \"the depths of [his] depravity have no equal\". Such was the interest in the trial, it was difficult for reporters to keep up. Sadly, there is no further guidance on any of these journalistic dilemmas today. And in another classic example of how far behind these other jurisdictions we are in England and Wales, the lord chief justice Igor Judge has issued guidance on whether journalists can tweet from court at all. The law is hazy on the subject \u2013 there is no explicit ban on tweeting in court, or on any other \"live text-based communications\" as the judiciary have snappily called them. That doesn't mean it's permitted either; today Judge said they should be allowed if the court is \"satisfied that its use does not pose a danger of interference to the proper administration of justice in the individual case\". This sounds a lot like a presumption against tweeting in court, unless the court decides the \"no danger of interference\" test is met. Given the type of cases that have been tweeted in the past, it would make more sense to me to have a presumption in favour, unless someone can show that such a danger arises. But then Judge does add that silent, hand-held devices used for tweeting are \"unlikely\" to interfere with justice, so there are ample grounds for judges to take different approaches. Which leaves things largely unchanged. As we saw with district judge Howard Riddle's decision to allow tweeting in one of Julian Assange's bail hearings, judges have wide discretion as it is. Judge also announced a forthcoming consultation, which will seek the views of the legal profession, the government, prosecutors and journalists on what the permanent rules about tweeting in court should be. Which is quite a relief because as we all know, relying entirely on attitudes towards Twitter of individual judges is an approach which carries risks all of its own.",
