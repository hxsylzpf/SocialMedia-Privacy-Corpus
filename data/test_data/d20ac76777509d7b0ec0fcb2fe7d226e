  "content": "Up to \u00a333bn a year could be saved from public spending without cutting services by making better use of data about citizens, from applications for passports and driving licences, to tax returns and social media. A report released today by the Policy Exchange thinktank says possible savings are equivalent to \u00a3500 for every person in the country. The scale of money involved compares to total savings that the government is trying to make over the life of this parliament, creating the greatest cuts in public spending in living memory \u2013\u00a383bn by 2015. \"Across the public sector, extraordinary quantities of data are amassed in the course of running public services,\" said Chris Yiu, author of the report. \"Finding ways to share or link this data together has the potential to save time for citizens and money for taxpayers. The government will need the capability to conduct analytics effectively, and the courage to pursue this agenda with integrity.\" Among the most dramatic suggestions from the Policy Exchange is to axe the 10-yearly census and instead gather data from the electoral roll, council tax registers and other sources to estimate the total population of the UK and its breakdown according to types and sizes of household, occupations, religion and other factors. Done this way, the government could save \u00a3500m for each census, and the information could be \"acceptable quality and more up to date,\" says the thinktank. Other examples given in the report, The Big Data Opportunity, include the Home Office using real time flight data and social media sites, such as Twitter, to anticipate bottlenecks at UK airports, so extra staff can be put on duty if necessary to avoid the long queues and type of bad publicity endured earlier this year at Heathrow. Tax officers could also look at how much tax people pay to company accounts and other data to highlight individuals who are paying less than expected. The report advocates a \"data force\" \u2013 modelled on the prime minister's \"nudge unit\" and also reporting to the PM \u2013 which could access all data from different departments and identify where savings could be made. It also acknowledges the risk of angering individuals who feel \u2013 or fear \u2013 their privacy is being invaded, and suggests the government adopt a code of conduct called the Code for Responsible Analytics. \"This is only partly about cutting-edge data science skills,\" said Yiu. \"Just as important \u2013 if not more so \u2013 is ensuring its leaders are literate in the scientific method and confident combining big data with sound judgement.\" This is not the first time the government has been told it is ignoring sensible ideas to save large sums of money \u2013 though the figure for data savings is vast by comparison to most schemes. In May the Audit Commission, the official independent watchdog on public spending, criticised central government departments for not joining en masse the National Fraud Initiative, which has saved the 1,300 public bodies, such as police and local authorities, more than \u00a31bn in the last 16 years, and more than a quarter of that in the past two years alone. Only two national departments, the Highways Agency and the department for communities and local government have joined the fraud-busting scheme, which constantly compares information from 8,000 data sets, some covering millions of people, and flags up anomalies to be investigated."
