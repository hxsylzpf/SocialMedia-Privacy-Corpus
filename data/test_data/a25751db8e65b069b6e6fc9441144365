  "content": "A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team The real danger of copying music (it's not what you think) &gt;&gt; Wired.com Jaron Lanier: It is one thing to sing for your supper occasionally, but to have to do so for every meal forces you into a peasant's dilemma: The peasant's dilemma is that there's no buffer. A musician who is sick or old, or who has a sick kid, cannot perform and cannot earn. A few musicians, a very tiny number indeed, will do well, but even the most successful real-time-only careers can fall apart suddenly because of a spate of bad luck. Real life cannot avoid those spates, so eventually almost everyone living a real-time economic life falls on hard times. What really happens on a teen girl's iPhone &gt;&gt; Huffington Post Fourteen-year-old Casey Schwartz has ditched more social networking services than most people her parents' age have joined. Like many of her friends, Casey has a tendency to embrace social media sites, then suddenly drop them. Skype, Formspring and WhatsApp: All three have suffered this fate. Casey still uses Snapchat, but less than she did last year, and in the span of three months, she's joined, quit, and rejoined Twitter. She's collected banished apps into a folder on her phone labeled \"Stuff Nobody Likes.\" And she's thought about deleting her Facebook account because she checks it so frequently. Remember being 14? Alternatively, looking forward to being 14? Snapchat changes logo amid lawsuit challenging founding of startup &gt;&gt; latimes.com Snapchat, the popular social network startup that lets users send each other photos that quickly disappear, has given its logo a facelift. Since launching in 2011, the Los Angeles-based company has been known for its logo of a ghost making a silly face by sticking its tongue out. But earlier this week, Snapchat rolled out an app update for its Apple users with a logo that shows a face-less ghost. The startup on Thursday told users that the change was not an accident. Why tech responds poorly to crises, and how to do better &gt;&gt; Scripting.com Dave Winer: The first time I saw a tech company blow it in the Internet age was in 1994 when Intel was trying to quell public outrage about a problem with math functions on their Pentium chip. According to Wikipedia, an estimated 1 in 9 billion floating point divides would produce inaccurate results. The problem could be demonstrated in Excel. Intel said the flaw was so small that it didn't warrant any concern by users. They were probably right. But that didn't stop the outrage from escalating. Every time Intel spoke, the problem got worse. Eventually they had to offer replacement chips to any user who wanted one. It might have cost much less if they had admitted the problem at the start. Winer's right; yet equally, people were \"upset\" about something that would hardly ever affect them. Part of why they were upset was that they couldn't predict when they would be affected. Possibly that's the real lesson: people dislike uncertainty with a visceral intensity. BBC Weather launches mobile app &gt;&gt; BBC As soon as you open the app it will automatically detect your location and give you an instant overview of the weather conditions wherever you are. It also gives quick access to the 5-day forecast with the option to look up further detail such as hourly UK forecasts, and three hourly forecasts for international locations, for the next 48 hours. You can find other destinations from the UK and abroad with a simple search and save them to a customisable list of your favourite places. No option to improve the weather, however. (Thanks @slimbowski for the link.) 'This Is Our Signature': iOS 7 &gt;&gt; Daring Fireball John Gruber: There's a sense of place, depth, and spatiality in iOS 7 that makes it feel like hardware. A real thing, not pixels rendered on glass. It's as though Ive has brought the same design goals that have always informed Apple's hardware to software. And here, his team isn't limited by physics. Planes can have zero thickness. But it's a system, in the truest sense of the word. iOS 7 is not perfect; this new design framework will evolve and improve over time, just like iOS's original aesthetic did. Tablet segmentation by usage: explaining the popularity of smaller tablets &gt;&gt; Tech-Thoughts Sameer Singh: Content \"consumption\" is a popular buzzword among analysts to describe tablet use cases. However, this categorization limits itself to a single segment of the tablet users and the products that cater to those users. The usage patterns here are along expected lines and similar to the \"computing\" segment of smartphone users, i.e. heavy social networking/email, messaging, browsing, gaming, etc. The key point to understand here is that most of today's tablets ranging from the 9.7\" iPad to low-end 7-inch tablets cater to this segment. The iOS 7 Power User Challenge &gt;&gt; Fraser Speirs Fraser Speirs: Conventional wisdom said that you couldn't possibly get a desktop OS running on a phone. Conventional wisdom said that you couldn't get rid of a user-visible filesystem. Conventional wisdom said you couldn't require all software on the platform to come through a first-party app store. Right now, just before WWDC 2013, I think it's important to take time to appreciate exactly what iOS has achieved. iOS broke the tyranny of the hierarchical filesystem as a user interface. A concept so complex that possibly the majority of computer users never achieved any level of real competence in its use. A far larger proportion certainly never achieved any kind of mastery. iOS turned the purchase and installation of third-party software from a great opportunity to destroy your computer into something that people do for fun. That is a key point. iOS doesn't require power users; and so power user complaints don't necessarily carry any traction. Except Speirs can think of a lot of power user things he'd like to do - few of which are answered by iOS 7. (Thanks @Avro for the link.) iOS7 &gt;&gt; Apple Watch this video, with commentary by Jonathan IVe and Craig Federighi, and bear in mind a subtitle: \"everything Scott Forstall did was WRONG.\" It makes it much more interesting.
