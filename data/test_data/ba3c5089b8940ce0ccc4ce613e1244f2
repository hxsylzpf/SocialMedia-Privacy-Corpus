  "content": "Three teenage boys in California were arrested for spray-painting a wall after authorities found pictures of the graffiti on the social networking website MySpace.com, police said on Thursday. Two of the boys denied wrongdoing, said police officer Tim Statler. \"Then I showed them the pictures that we had printed off MySpace and they both had wide-eyed looks, mouths open, couldn't believe the cops were smart enough to look on MySpace for their handiwork,\" Mr Statler told KCAL-TV. The graffiti caused about $1,000 (\u00a3510) worth of damage. Police said they would bill the parents.",
