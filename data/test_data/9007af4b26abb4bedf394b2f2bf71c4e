  "content": "At first, Twitter was changing the timeline, and then it was not changing the timeline, and then not changing the timeline next week. But Twitter has now confirmed it has introduced a new feature that does change the way users view messages in their timeline, pushing algorithmically selected \"best\" tweets to the top. Some users responded badly to reports of the new feature over the weekend, saying Twitter should prioritise bugs and dealing with harassment on the site. But Twitter's senior director of product, Jeff Siebert, said reports about the timeline were wrong because the change would not \"insert tweets throughout the timeline or completely shuffle them so there's no order\". It will be called \"show me the best tweets first\", and the selection will show in reverse chronological order at the top of the timeline. All other tweets will show in the next section, again in reverse chronological order. The feature will be accessible on the web and on Twitter's iOS and Android apps. When a user opens the app, it will select what it thinks are the most important tweets and show those at the top of the timeline. The number and type of tweet depends on the user's behaviour, how long they have been away and how often they tweet. Twitter says that in testing, it encouraged more users to tweet and retweet posts. The new feature has been launched to all users as a new option, but after several weeks it will be on by default. It can still be switched off in settings, Siebert said. \"We set out to solve a very special problem on Twitter. Hundreds of thousands of users say Twitter is an essential and engaging part of their daily life, but when they wake up on a Monday or come out of the gym, there's a lot to catch up on. We heard that, and felt that users were missing important tweets.\" Siebert said he anticipated the new feature would be greeted much the same as the introduction of hearts, which replaced stars to mark out favourite tweets on the service. \"People didn't like it at the time but it has been a massive success, and millions of people who had never used the favourite feature have now used hearts.\" Some Twitter users reacted in characteristically colourful language to the introduction of hearts as well as rumours of changes to the timeline, the latter prompting the hashtag #RIPTwitter. Siebert said: \"We're honoured to have a customer base that cares so deeply about the product, and that can use our own platform to give us feedback on the product.\" Siebert said feedback would be combined with data and the experiences of a group of test users who have been using the new feature for several months, though he would not say how many had used it. Twitter has been under huge pressure from investors frustrated by lack of user growth. The service had 320 million monthly users in September 2015 \u2013 the last month for which Twitter released figures \u2013 but grew from only 284 million in the last quarter of 2014 to 307 million a year later. Rampant growth among Twitter's rivals has made investors question the advertising and product strategies of its leadership: Facebook has 1.59 billion users and Instagram 400 million every month, and Snapchat at least 100 million every day. Unlike Instagram, whose aesthetic has quickly attracted advertisers, Twitter has been relatively cautious in its implementation of advertising, offering promoted tweets, promoted trends and promoted ads. Its revenues have been healthy, with advertising up 58% to $569.2m for the third quarter of 2015. Other changes have been mooted by CEO Jack Dorsey, including increasing the character limit from 140 to 10,000 characters. Dorsey said Twitter had noticed users posting pictures to post longer messages but the information could not be searched or analysed in image form. Siebert would not comment on the character limit but agreed that it could present challenges to both Twitter's design and navigation, as well as make more data accessible and searchable. In its latest initiative, Twitter tackled one of its most controversial issues, establishing a new safety council to help develop its management of complex harassment and safety issues of its users. The council includes the Samaritans, the Internet Watch Foundation and Feminist Frequency. In another new development, Twitter is also introducing a new ad format that drops a video ad at the top of a user's feed."
