  "content": "The police force responsible for overseeing the recent anti-fracking campaign in Sussex has apologised after an \"inappropriate\" comment was posted from its official Twitter account in response to comments about undercover officers sleeping with protesters. The force removed the tweet and said it has disciplined the member of staff involved after a smiley emoticon was tweeted from the @Sussex_police account in response to another tweet which asked if police would be infiltrating protest groups at the site in Balcombe and \"fathering children with them\". The initial tweet was a reference to recent revelations about the actions of Metropolitan police officers who spent years infiltrating protest groups, sometimes having long-term relationships involving children. Protesters said the Sussex tweet in response was offensive and gave an insight into the mentality of the police. They also raised concerns about a second tweet which they said made light of police's use of force against protesters. \"This isn't just about causing offence,\" said Danny Chivers from the Reclaim the Power camp that was set up last weekend in the West Sussex town. \"It's an insight into Sussex Police's mindset and how seriously \u2013 or not \u2013 they take these issues.\" He added: \"If their official media people are laughing and joking about causing physical pain to protesters and the devastation caused to people's lives by the behaviour of undercover police, then what does that say about the culture and attitude of the force as a whole?\" The police apologised for the tweet responding to the comment about undercover officers, and removed it shortly after it was posted. \"The response to this tweet was clearly inappropriate,\" said a spokesman for the Sussex force. \"It was a momentary personal misjudgment about the nature of the post and the impact these events had.\" The scale of undercover police infiltration of protest groups was exposed by the Guardian. One of the most shocking revelations centred around the long-term sexual relationships many officers formed with the people they were spying on \u2013 and the devastating impact it had. Harriet Wistrich, the solicitor acting for eight women who had relationships with officers, said the tweet suggested some police officers still did not understand seriousness of what had happened. \"It reflects the institutional sexism of the police that they think it is a laughing matter,\" she said. \"It suggests the police do not realise the seriousness of the violations that took place and the impact they have had.\" Sussex Police said the member of staff responsible had been disciplined. \"An apology was quickly posted and the offending message \u2013 a wordless Tweet with a smiley face \u2013 was removed. We have openly replied to people's concerns, publicly explained why the tweet was removed and sincerely apologised for the offence caused. \"The member of staff monitoring Twitter that night has received formal management advice, is fully aware of their error and understands why it has caused such a strong reaction.\" The second tweet involved the police twitter account posting a comment about the use of pressure points which it said was \"recognised nationally as one of the safest options\" to control protesters. Another person tweeted a link to a picture of a character from Star Trek apparently inflicting a painful grip with the words \"you don't mean ...\" @Sussex_police replied \"National, international and in space! Are you a Star Trek fan?:)\" A spokesman for the force said although this tweet struck the wrong tone it had not caused the same offence as the response to the undercover tweet. He added that Sussex Police had repeatedly made clear that it took the use of force very seriously.",
