  "content": "It's the perfect coming-of-age tale for the Pop Idol generation. Liam Payne, the once baby-faced member of One Direction, is reportedly in a \"blooming\" relationship with Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, the singer who, five years ago, sat on the X Factor judging panel that catapulted him and his boyband to global stardom. The romance seems to be the latest instalment of One Direction's \"boys to men\" saga, kickstarted by Zayn Malik's departure from the group last year to make music videos featuring more tastefully naked flesh than Simon Cowell ever allowed and closely followed by the revelation of Louis Tomlinson's lovechild. Payne, 22, has allegedly been secretly dating Fernandez-Versini (formerly Cole/Tweedy), who is 32 and soon to be twice-divorced, since December when they reunited on X Factor. According to the Sun's extensive coverage, this secret liaison between British pop royalty has taken its toll not only on jealous One Direction fans but also the planet. A detailed map compiled by the newspaper traces the great lengths the pair went to to keep a \"steamy romantic getaway\" to a \"love island\" on Valentine's Day a secret from the prying eyes of the British press. It appears that their clandestine but pollution-heavy routes to the Maldives (Barbados-New York-Dubai-Maldives for Fernandez-Versini and London-Maldives-Hong Kong\u2013LA for Payne) were all in vain, as a \"close pal\" was willing to spill the beans on their cloak-and-dagger getaway to the tabloid press anyway. \"They had an amazing trip and it really made them believe they had something special together,\" an unnamed and therefore totally convincing source told the Sun. \"Being able to completely unwind away from the world's eye is not something that a member of the biggest boyband in the world and one of the UK's biggest style icons get to do often.\" Any suggestions that this relationship might just be a passing fling, as Fernandez-Versini distracts herself from that sticky divorce number two, have been put to rest by Payne's new hand tattoo. The inked rose artwork on his hand appears to be a loving homage to the horticultural illustrations that adorn Fernandez-Versini's lower back and bottom, proving that Payne is indeed \"madly in love\" with the singer, as \"close pals\" have revealed. The true depth of their feelings for each other was also made clear on Saturday night when the pair were apparently spotted strolling down the petfood aisle of a Guildford Tesco in the late hours. Having once dated singer Leona Lewis, eight years his senior, in 2012, Payne is no stranger to dating high-profile singers. But for Fernandez-Versini, whose last husband was a smouldering French restaurateur who she is divorcing after 19 months, this relationship marks a notable change in taste. Nonetheless, offering his showbiz oracle perspective on the romance, Sun reporter Dan Wootton seems highly confident this is, in fact, true love. \"As someone who has known them both for years, it actually makes sense,\" he wrote. \"They are both genuine folk who never expected to find international super-stardom and have struggled to cope with many of the more difficult aspects of fame.\""
