  "content": "28 January 2011, in response to growing public protests \u2013 and fearing mass uprising as had just happened in Tunisia \u2013 the government of then president, Hosni Mubarak, followed the example of Burma, and a few others before it, and disabled internet and mobile phone networks. Why? To prevent people from accessing social media. Jillian York at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society said in an interview at the time: \"Clearly, what's rattled the government is the major role that social media has played in the protests rocking the country's cities, including Cairo. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and even Google Docs have been used in unprecedented ways this time around \u2013 both for coordination, and for disseminating news\". By 11 February 2011, Hosni Mubarak had resigned and observers began to speak of a \"Twitter revolution.\" While many disagree about the exact role social media played in what has become known as 'the Arab Spring', there is no denying that the internet has changed the way networks form and how those networks then challenge established structures. In a Ted talk on 'How social media can make history', New York University academic, Clay Shirky argues that \"the history of the modern world could be rendered as the history of ways of arguing, where changes in media change what sort of arguments are possible \u2013 with deep social and political implications\". His biography on the site describes his work as follows: \"Clay Shirky's work focuses on the rising usefulness of networks ... New technologies are enabling new kinds of cooperative structures to flourish as a way of getting things done in business, science, the arts and elsewhere as an alternative to centralised and institutional structures\". So how does that play out in development? How can social media change how development research is shared and used? How too can social media change the way activists and NGOs campaign? And if NGOs are themselves \"institutional structures\", how do they stand to be changed by social media and online networks? On Thursday 16 May, we will bring together a panel to discuss these and other questions. Join us in the comment threads below from 1pm to 3pm BST. The live chat is not video or audio-enabled but will take place in the comments section (below). To join the panel or simply give your views ahead of the chat, email globaldevpros@theguardian.com.
