  "content": "The Guardian has served us all well by drawing attention day after day to the excesses of spying on individuals and of mass surveillance practised by GCHQ and the US National Security Agency, revealed in the secret material made available by Edward Snowden (GCHQ fears challenge over mass spying, leak reveals, 26 October). In a world of sophisticated global organised crime, terrorism both imported and home-grown, and trafficking of children and modern slaves, I recognise the need for intelligence agencies. Undoubtedly their work has unearthed criminal gangs and terrorist plots, and we have reason to be grateful for that. But Snowden's revelations show a deeply troubling imbalance between their operations and the respect for individual liberty and personal privacy that citizens of a democracy are entitled to enjoy. I congratulate the government on the new powers it has given to the intelligence and security committee of parliament, which has one of the most thoughtful and impressive MPs as its chairman. But it needs to exercise detailed oversight of an intelligence structure that is running out of control, and badly needs a dose of political common sense. Let me offer one current example. I became an active member of the Anglo-German (K\u00f6nigswinter) Association many years ago. Over the course of those years, Germany has become the most transformed country in Europe in terms of its values and its behaviour. It is our most important partner in the European Union, and a significant ally in Nato. Its chancellor, Angela Merkel, was brought up in a country, East Germany, racked by suspicion and distrust, in which there were thousands of Stasi, fellow citizens engaged in spying on one another and reporting everything to a ruthless totalitarian state. It is impossible to imagine any leader more likely to be infuriated by being the object of espionage by her supposedly closest allies. I hope the usually courteous prime minister and US president have already offered personal apologies, and a rock-solid commitment to rein in their respective agencies from such offensive and ill-judged actions. What starts with our closest allies must go on to include our innocent citizens as well. Shirley Williams Liberal Democrat, House of Lords \u2022 David Cameron's response to the scandal of Angela Merkel's phone being tapped was to tell us that \"there are lots of people \u2026 who want to blow up our families\" (Cameron 'agrees' with EU over US spying, 26 October). Is he suggesting that bugging European political leaders' phones will save us from terrorists? Snooping on the entire UK population has nothing to do with democracy, it is the conduct of a totalitarian regime. The coalition government rightly abandoned the previous Labour government's plans for biometric passports. Such schemes simply erode the liberties of the innocent. Most of the British public understand that there are bad guys out there. Cameron needs to represent the public and defend our democracy, and avoid being an apologist for those who are happy to trample over the human rights of the entire population. Christian Vassie Wheldrake, North Yorkshire \u2022 Oliver Cromwell once posed himself the question: can it ever be lawful to resist the lawful authority of parliament? To which he answered that no authority has the right to do anything it pleases regardless of the consequences \u2013 that \"all agree there are cases in which it is lawful to resist\". It seems pretty clear, from some of the pronouncements made by establishment figures, that they, by apparent dint of divine right, see no such limit to their actions, or powers. Furthermore, very soon, mass surveillance will make it impossible for the public, who should be the ultimate arbiters of these matters, to lawfully resist. Kevin Bell Tyldesley, Greater Manchester \u2022 GCHQ is deemed to be our jewel in the crown that enables Britain to punch above its weight. But worship of the Cheltenham-based panopticon is too high a price to pay given the attendant loss of liberty. Better to trade our place at the top negotiating table for an informed open society.
