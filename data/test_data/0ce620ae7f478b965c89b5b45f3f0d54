  "content": "The Telegraph website's 20% traffic boost in June has been attributed to factors including favouring Facebook over Twitter to push content and writing fewer stories overall, according to Jason Seiken. The Telegraph Media Group editor-in-chief said an emphasis on carefully promoting stories with Facebook's more youth-oriented audience in mind has started to pay off, with the social network easily outstripping Twitter as a traffic driver. The surge in Facebook traffic referral in turn fuelled a bumper month of growth in June. Seiken said traffic from Facebook to Telegraph.co.uk grew 61% month on month in June. He added that Project Babb \u2013 the \"antidote to po-faced football coverage\" \u2013 a social media content sharing experiment launched ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, had notched up 1m visits in seven weeks and would continue for the Premier League season. He said he expected Telegraph Media Group to use Project Babb as a template and would adopt more of a start-up mentality to new launches, \"cranking out products \u2026 in 10 weeks\". Seiken said: \"We actually created that huge traffic jump in June producing fewer stories, not more. On the day-to-day operational side, the team has made dozens of changes that add up to the newsroom working better and more efficiently. Seemingly mundane things make a huge difference \u2013 things such as better planning, more creative story conferences, and using audience data to decide what to stop doing.\" Telegraph.co.uk recorded a 21% month-on-month increase in daily unique browsers to 3.9 million in June, with monthly unique browsers jumping 20% to 78.7 million. This compared with Trinity Mirror's national titles online (9.38% rise in daily unique browsers, 6% rise in monthlies), Independent.co.uk (12.7%, 9.6%), theguardian.com (4.75%, 2.2%) and Mail Online (-0.8%, -2.42%). The Telegraph website's Facebook followers have surged from under 600,000 in January to 1.6 million. This compares with other national newspaper websites such as Mail Online with 1.85 million, and the Guardian with 3.4 million (up from 700,000 in September 2013). \"We have found that for every minute put into promoting something on Facebook, we get a significantly larger traffic boost than we do from Twitter,\" Seiken said. \"We still put energy into Twitter, but since there is a bigger bang for effort we put more into Facebook.\" Seiken said the Telegraph had previously failed to tap into the potential of Facebook because of an \"obsession\" among journalists with Twitter. \"We have seen a huge increase in Facebook traffic, an area where we hadn't been focusing,\" he said. \"It had previously been all about Twitter. Journalists are all on Twitter, and obsessed with it, so that is where the energy had gone. An assumption had been made without looking at data.\" In June, Seiken announced a restructure that resulted in a number of long-serving journalists departing, such as former deputy editor and chief political commentator Benedict Brogan, leading to criticism from some quarters. He also revealed plans to recruit 40 new editorial staff, in roles focusing heavily on technology, digital journalism, social media, search and breaking news. \"A lot of [the growth] has been driven by improvements in how journalists are approaching the creation, publishing and promotion of their stories for digital,\" Seiken said. \"For example, planning stories in advance to generate original ideas, getting stories online quickly instead of waiting for the paper, and writing headlines that will do well in search. And the [digitally focused] changes that have been put in place mean we are better able to capitalise on big news events, like a World Cup, but also we've seen growth of 50% or so on desks with no major event like personal finance, travel and culture. Seiken says he has not \"waved a magic wand\" to drive growth, rather focusing on a combination of changes in culture, talent and pushing operational excellence. \"All three are critical, and they are what have made the biggest difference. We've been able to recruit and promote outstanding digital and technology talent. We've been able to begin changing the culture to one that values data, empowers journalists to take risks and moves with great speed.\" Project Babb was designed to stand out from the Telegraph's typical sport style and appeal to 16- to 34-year-olds and attracts up to 70% of its traffic from Facebook at times. Seiken said Project Babb was used as a test bed, such as trying 45 headlines on one article to gauge click-through rates with readers. While Seiken admits that is at the extreme end of the test scale, trying just two or three headlines on a typical Telegraph story can boost click-through traffic by 20% to 30%. \"We're now cranking out products, such as Project Babb and our new iPhone app, in 10 weeks, whereas in the past we would agonise over them for 10 months,\" he said. \"We used to try to be pixel perfect. But working in an agile way \u2013 rapidly launch an imperfect product and then quickly use audience data to inform how we update the product \u2013 results in much higher quality. It took us 18 months to build the worst-rated news app in the Apple Store and 12 weeks to build the best-rated one.\" The success of Project Babb's formula of irreverence and quirkiness has led the Telegraph to keep the site running throughout the upcoming Premier League season. Some have argued that the Telegraph is adopting tactics employed by sites such as Mail Online or BuzzFeed to boost traffic. Seiken said he could double the Telegraph's web traffic by going down the \"click bait\" route, but the goal is to maintain a quality product that people will continue to be willing to pay for. \"We are never going to win being BuzzFeed,\" he said. \"If I were going the route of BuzzFeed \u2013 aiming purely for traffic growth \u2013 it would be fairly easy to double Telegraph traffic overnight by going down the click bait and sensationalism path. I'm not saying that in a derogatory way. But that's not the Telegraph. If you value your journalism, feel like you are creating journalism that has a value, that is worth paying for and that audiences will pay for because it is differentiated from the rest, then the meter is the way to go.\" Seiken admitted he is not a fan of a full paywall, such as those used by the Times and Sunday Times, but that he could foresee \"tweaking\" the metered-access model used by the Telegraph. \"I don't believe in a hard, binary wall, it doesn't work commercially and is devastating for your journalism,\" he said. \"The challenge with metered access is you have to get the balance right. We have not changed the algorithm or fiddled with the number of articles [of the metered access wall]. We constantly review the data [and] might tweak it.\" He said that the publisher has to stay \"true to its roots\" of quality journalism, but not be \"afraid to take risks\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
