  "content": "Steve Ballmer signs a MacBook Pro at Trevecca Nazarene University. It survived. Anyone want to guess how long before it's on eBay? (Here's the happy student's blog post.) Just as a reminder of yesterday's data.gov.uk launch, and a taster of what can be done with the sort of data that's available, here's a view of Mapumental, which shows you what places you can afford to buy within a particular distance of your workplace. (Unless your workplace is \"any coffee shop with Wi-Fi or a decent 3G signal\".) You can sign up for Mapumental - presently it's in private beta."
