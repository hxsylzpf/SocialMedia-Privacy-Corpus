  "content": "Anna Ford has launched a withering attack on the the press complaints commission, denouncing it as \"a pussy cat\" organisation which was \"largely autocratic\". The BBC news presenter, who expressed disappointment that the high court will not allow her to challenge the watchdog's ruling over paparazzi shots of her in a bikini, said the editors who work with the commission held far too much sway on matters of privacy. \"I am disappointed that we were not right to go for judicial review - disappointed because we think the PCC has not upheld its own code of conduct,\" Ford said following today's court ruling. But the BBC presenter and journalist said she did not want new privacy laws introduced that could inhibit investigative reporting. Under the code \"people have a right not to have long lens photographs taken without their permission in a place where they would expect to have privacy\", she said. The photographs showing her and her former partner, David Scott, applying suncream to one another on a beach in Majorca \"was a major intrusion into our privacy and changed the nature of our holiday\", Ms Ford added. \"In a way that any ordinary citizen of this country would understand it was an invasion of privacy that all people would mind about. \"They don't mind having a photograph taken with their permission... but they do mind long lens photographs taken secretly being sold for profit to the press. \"I am pleased that this case has given an element of publicity to the notion of what is private and what is public in life now. \"I am well known and seen regularly on television. Nevertheless, as a person with a family on family holidays in the school holidays, I have a right to privacy,\" she said. The judge said that when Ms Ford and Mr Scott went on holiday \"they were anxious that they should be able to enjoy their holiday undisturbed and unrecognised\". Ms Ford said she had made a point that she had not worn make-up \"nor bother with her hair or in any way be self-conscious whilst she is on holiday\", defying claims that she was courting publicity. Ford said she was \"grateful\" the PCC was not seeking legal costs from her but she strongly criticised the commission, saying it was \"largely autocratic\". The PCC is composed of senior newspaper editors, eight lay members and is chaired by Lord Wakeham. The editors \"hold sway and get their own way a great deal more than they should\", particularly on matters of privacy, she said. Ford added that had she sued the Daily Mail and OK! magazine under the privacy laws enshrined in the new Human Rights Act, she might have got a better result. However, she added: \"I don't wish there to be new privacy laws because I believe very strongly in freedom of expression and its fundamental importance and the role the fourth estate plays in democracy. \"Without that we would have a more secretive society than we already have.\" Ford expressed concern that the government had not fulfilled its promise to introduce a true freedom of information act.
