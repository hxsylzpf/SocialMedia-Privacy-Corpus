  "content": "There is something reassuringly traditional about the neatly typed resignation letters, with a House of Commons letterhead and an attack on the Labour leader within. They are solid and permanent, when everything else seems to be falling apart. And old-fashioned, even if one does tweet a picture of it afterwards, as many MPs have done. But according to reports, those conspiring against Corbyn were far more modern. They used the messaging service WhatsApp. And it wasn't just Labour. There was thought to be at least one WhatsApp group of Conservative MPs exploring ways to stop Boris Johnson becoming leader. Gone are the days of machinations in back rooms and hushed conversations in corridors; the leaders of the two main political parties could be decided on a mobile app more often used by teenagers wondering where to go on a Saturday night. If you don't already use WhatsApp, you probably soon will. A few months ago, WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, went past its billionth user, and it will get bigger (\"We still have another 6 billion people to get on WhatsApp,\" the company wrote in a blogpost). Last year, it delivered more messages than traditional SMS text messages. Since 2010, it has been possible to make voice calls from WhatsApp, which could, predict some tech watchers, spell the end of mobile networks such as Vodafone or O2. It probably won't be long until we can use video calling on it, too; but for now it remains primarily a texting service, only better. Messages are sent over the internet and it is efficient and easy to use. You can message one-on-one, or set up a group in your phone contacts list \u2013 family, say, or friends. Or Labour politicians. Among my groups are different bands of friends, two British family groups and a Turkish one, and a group of old housemates. Other people's WhatsApp groups are more interesting. Members of the British Medical Association's junior doctors' committee used WhatsApp to talk about strike action (1,000 pages of messages were leaked to the press). In the runup to the EU referendum, the remain campaign was accused of using secret WhatsApp groups to discuss tactics, away from official methods \u2013 and away from future freedom of information requests. In 2014, the BBC launched a public health information service during the Ebola crisis for users in West Africa, which eventually reached 25,000 people on WhatsApp. \"We wanted to really try to reach people on their mobile devices. We picked WhatsApp because that's the app that most people had on their smartphones,\" says Trushar Barot, mobile editor at the BBC World Service. In Sudan, amid a government crackdown on the press, people use WhatsApp to distribute news and organise. \"I use it because the security services announced that they are watching Facebook and other means of communication, so WhatsApp is safer in that respect,\" one activist and journalist told the Guardian. In last year's troubled general election in Tanzania, the app was said to have revolutionised political communication. \"WhatsApp is a preferred tool of choice for propaganda, mudslinging, and negative messaging,\" a digital strategist told the Quartz Africa news site. So the reports that the app has been used to influence what happens at the very top of Britain's two main political parties is intriguing, but hardly surprising. Just a few years old, with barely 50 employees, WhatsApp has become one of the most important in the world, and its decisions about the way it is run will have a huge influence on us. In April, WhatsApp announced it was to use end-to-end encryption across its service, meaning a message can only be read by its recipient \u2013 not by the authorities, and not even by the company itself, which would prevent it getting into the kind of privacy fight with the FBI that Apple recently went through. A month earlier, speaking to an audience of mainly tech executives, President Barack Obama had railed against encryption: \"If, technologically, it is possible to make an impenetrable device or system, where the encryption is so strong that there is no key, there is no door at all, then how do we apprehend the child pornographer? How do we disrupt a terrorist plot?\" In May, in Brazil, where WhatsApp has 100 million users, a judge ordered it to be blocked for not sharing information on a drugs trafficking case (a higher court later overturned this). In the UK, the government has regularly hinted that it wanted to ban end-to-end encryption. As it stands, WhatsApp couldn't share information with the authorities, even if it wanted to. And it doesn't want to. \"The desire to protect people's private communication is one of the core beliefs we have at WhatsApp, and for me, it's personal,\" wrote Jan Koum, one of the app's co-founders. \"I grew up in the USSR during communist rule and the fact that people couldn't speak freely is one of the reasons my family moved to the United States.\" Users say it has revolutionised communication. You can say things you wouldn't necessarily dare to on a public platform such as Twitter. And you can keep in touch with people in an easy, more informal way, especially if you don't particularly want indepth one-to-one conversations. Groups spread across the world can instantly message each other without the hassle of email, because most people are attached to their phones. But there are downsides, too \u2013 an infuriatingly chatty group, or the way your phone instantly saves photographs you are sent, which means you end up with thousands of pictures of bridesmaids' dresses/mildly amusing memes/not-safe-for-work photos from people you've met on Tinder. Worst of all are the app's two blue ticks that tell you your message has been read. And you haven't received a reply. Is it worse to know you're being ignored, or to know you can never ignore other people in the same way again? (Although you can change all these things, once you have worked out the settings.) Daniel Miller, professor of anthropology at University College London and director of the social media research project Why We Post, says apps such as WhatsApp and WeChat are an antidote to the large broadcast-style platforms of Facebook and Twitter. \"In every society, people use [social media] differently but, on the whole, you can say that, whereas Facebook has become this public arena, where people are really thinking about how they look to the general public, WhatsApp has brought in smaller groups who can talk more privately.\" The biggest group users, he says with a small laugh, are not politicians (not even those plotting against their leader). \"It's probably families. Say a baby has been born, and the immediate relatives can't get enough pictures of the baby \u2013 it really suits that kind of group.\" The app has managed to transcend generations, he says. Older adults who may have been intimidated by Facebook, or even an email account, are more likely to associate WhatsApp with their phone than the internet. \"They had phones and were getting into texting so something like WhatsApp was relatively straightforward, and not intimidating. And it didn't have that youth association that said it wasn't for them.\" Families, he says, see Facebook as the public-facing area. If there is a wedding, or other family news, \"they will show themselves congratulating each other or celebrating on Facebook just to show other people that they are behaving properly as a family. They almost 'perform' the family on Facebook. All the rows, problems and issues between the family, that's going on on WhatsApp. You have the real family life on WhatsApp and the presentation of the family to the rest of the world on Facebook.\" Another early use Miller noticed was groups of friends or acquaintances coming together to organise a party or a particular event. \"Quite often I was interviewing people and they had 12 different WhatsApp groups going on simultaneously. Some were permanent, and some were not.\" It has led to a whole new load of etiquette anxiety. \"Groups stress me out, with the constant notifications,\" says Kelechi Okafor, a fitness trainer who has used WhatsApp for about five years. \"I know you can switch the notifications off, but I tend to not have groups unless I really need them. There are groups I've been added to, because there was an event.\" One group had around 50 people in it to organise a party, but afterwards the group carried on messaging each other. Okafor left. \"It's easier to leave larger groups. With something like that, you slip out. There was a group I was part of from a studio I used to teach at. When I left, I got messages like: 'You left our group. Did anyone do anything wrong?' That can hurt people's feelings when it's a smaller group.\" The group most loathed by one friend of mine is the one that convenes around organising a stag night or weekend, but then carries on long afterwards: \"When is the polite point to leave the group full of wankers you don't ever really want to talk to again?\" For Okafor, WhatsApp long ago replaced text messages and is starting to take over from email. \"I'm more likely to respond through WhatsApp than I am to respond to email. Emails make me anxious because I know they're likely to be long. WhatsApps are usually quick and to the point, and you're not expected to write much back.\" She uses it to communicate with friends in the US, and family in Nigeria. \"I've noticed people [she meets] saying: 'Are you on WhatsApp?' I think they think it's less invasive, that they're only going to speak to me on WhatsApp, they're not going to call me.\" She is one of the people who repeatedly looks to see if their message has been read. \"I like to know. Then again, this is a problem, because everyone feels entitled to your time. I get annoyed when people do it to me: 'You read my message, and you didn't respond, but I saw you tweeting.' People can keep check on you now.\" I know the feeling. There were other people I contacted for this article, one of whom I messaged on WhatsApp. He didn't get back to me, even though I know he read my message. Because there they were: two blue ticks. The origins of WhatsApp must be one of tech's best stories. Koum and his mother moved to the US from Ukraine when he was 16, to escape rumbling antisemitism and unrest. Both took odd jobs to make a living, topped up by benefits. Later, in 2014, when Koum sold the company to Facebook for $19bn, he dramatically signed the deal in the offices where his mother had collected her food stamps. He started WhatsApp in 2009 after a sometimes tough, often unfulfilling few years. By 2000, both his parents had died and, in the near-decade he had spent working for the internet company Yahoo, he had become tired and disillusioned. Koum came up with the idea of a simple app that would allow you to set your status on your phone to show whether or not you were available. He registered the company in February 2009. It was fortuitous timing. Apple introduced push notifications \u2013 which alerted users to a friend's changing status on the app \u2013 a few months later and his small test group of friends started sending messages to each other. As a profile in Forbes put it: \"Jan watched the changing statuses on a Mac Mini at his townhouse in Santa Clara, and realised he'd inadvertently created a messaging service.\" Pamela Clark-Dickson, lead analyst in consumer services practice at IT and telecoms research firm Ovum, said: \"I think the reason it initially became so successful was it provided a replacement service for SMS [text messages] which was expensive at that time in a number of markets.\" She explained: \"The markets in which WhatsApp took off first were countries like Spain and the Netherlands, where the mobile operators tended to charge higher per message prices per SMS.\" Sending MMS messages \u2013 pictures, videos or even just emojis \u2013 is expensive (most carriers charge around 40p per MMS) but WhatsApp solved this instantly. \"Those markets where the operators have managed to provide price plans that include unlimited SMS managed to mitigate against the adoption of WhatsApp, at least in the early stages. But then what we saw starting to kick in was the network effect. Users would introduce their friends and contacts to WhatsApp. A third effect was the ability to send messages across borders without having to pay high per-message costs. Not only was there a domestic element, but an international one as well.\" At the time, the only other messaging service was BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), but this worked only between BlackBerry phones. A later arrival, iMessage, only works between Apple iPhones. There are other messaging apps, some small and some giants \u2013 in China, for instance, WeChat is huge. But WhatsApp dominates. According to Ovum's projections, in 2017 WhatsApp will have 1.6 billion users, sending 1.5tn messages a month. There are rumours that you will soon be able to share music across WhatsApp, and set up and join public groups. Koum has always been ideologically against having advertisements on the app, but Clark-Dickson says businesses will increasingly use WhatsApp to connect with customers and service users. \"It will enable enterprises to contact users by WhatsApp, things like sending out appointment reminders or notifications that bill payments are due. In Asia, in particular, apps such as WeChat, Line and KakaoTalk, are not just communications platforms any more, they are platforms for the delivery of content and services. Facebook Messenger is trying to go this way as well.\" WhatsApp, she says, \"has been one of the real catalysts for change in the way consumers communicate\"."
