  "content": "Twitter has handed South Tyneside council information about some of its users following the local authority's successful court application in California against the social network, for a disclosure order. South Tyneside is in pursuit of the author of \"Mr Monkey\", a blogger who is said to have defamed three council members and a council official. A council spokesman said that the cost of this overseas adventure was around \u00a375,000. Much has been written already about whether Twitter should or shouldn't have provided details that may identify the users in question, but a policy of complying with court orders isn't exactly odious and, as James Ball points out, it appears that Twitter tells users when such legal actions are on foot so that they can fight the proceedings if they object. An equally important question is whether the action against Twitter is a proper use of taxpayer's money. A spokesman for South Tyneside said: \"The council has a duty of care to protect its employees and as this blog contains damaging claims about council officers, legal action is being taken to identify those responsible.\" While council members and employees can bring defamation proceedings in their own name, as long ago as 1993 it was settled that public authorities are in an entirely different position to individuals when it comes to protection of reputation. When Derbyshire County Council tried to sue the Sunday Times over allegations about its conduct the House of Lords would have none of it: \"It is of the highest importance that a democratically elected governmental body, or indeed any governmental body, should be open to uninhibited public criticism,\" said Lord Keith. \"The threat of a civil action for defamation must inevitably have an inhibiting effect on freedom of speech\". It has not escaped anyone's attention that similar objections can be raised to the legal proceedings brought by the council against Twitter. Moreover, since local authorities are not entitled to sue for libel, South Tyneside has some further explaining to do. In particular, how, and for whose benefit, will the information it has garnered from Twitter be used?",
