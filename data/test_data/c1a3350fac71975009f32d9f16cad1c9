  "content": "Paul Shillito Teacher, London Our school doesn't allow access to social networking sites; there was even a move for a while to block Facebook for staff. However, the kids are able to find ways round it; they can find virtual servers that are able to bypass our firewall. We do have Moodle, a virtual learning environment: the pupils can make an educational community and swap ideas among themselves. However, they tend to use it for settling scores and name-calling. As a teacher, I think this kind of site has got to be part of the future. But one thing that concerns me is how secure these sites are and who can access the personal details students put on them. I am on Facebook and I've yet to see it used as an educational resource - it's more of a social tool. Eve Mitchell Parent, Surrey I use Facebook for contacting my friends and meeting up with people I've lost touch with. It's fun but I'm not sure about bringing social networking sites into schools. I think they are a good idea for promoting socialising and teaching younger people how to use the internet. But if you used Facebook in lessons, who knows who you'd be talking to - lessons could suffer. Our school blocks every type of website, the only thing you can get into is the school website and Google, which is tightly filtered. I think internet use should be more open. I don't think we should access MySpace or Facebook during lesson time, but some social networking sites could be involved in learning as long as they were used at break time or after school. Laura-Liz Partoon Aged 17, West Midlands I think social networking sites are an inevitable evil, but if they can be used in schools in a constructive way, that's great. Kids will use them, with permission or not, and I think one difficulty will be policing that they're being used in the way they should be. I did an Open University course which marked contributions to a discussion in an online topic forum. It was an important part of the marking, and if you didn't contribute to the discussion, you didn't get any marks. This was distance learning and they had to find a way to make us contribute, but I do think it's possibly more likely you'll get more from teenagers from Facebook than from having them hand in a conventional essay."
