  "content": "She prides herself on her support for other women artists, but Taylor Swift lost her cool after she perceived a tweet by Nicki Minaj to be slighting her Bad Blood video. Minaj had been complaining on Twitter and Instagram that neither of her blockbuster videos, Feeling Myself and Anaconda, had been nominated in the video of the year category of the MTV VMAs. She tweeted: \"If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year.\" Clearly stung by what she believed was a reference to her Bad Blood video, which included cameos by famous friends including Cara Delavigne, Ellie Goulding and Lena Dunham, Swift retorted: \"I've done nothing but love and support you. It's unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot.\" Minaj retorted that she had not been calling out Swift, but asked for the singer's support. Responding to a tweet from a fan, the rapper had earlier indicated that she felt that her lack of award nominations were indicative of a music industry in which the influence of black artists is not properly acknowledged. The VMA awards nominations were announced on Tuesday morning and saw Swift way out in front with nine nods in all, including one for video of the year for Bad Blood. Minaj had been nominated for three awards \u2013 best collaboration for Bang Bang, while Anaconda, her ode to the larger female form, is up for best hip-hop video and best female performance \u2013 but missed out on the major categories. Her collaboration with Beyonc\u00e9, Feeling Myself, also missed out on the chance for gongs. The VMA awards are on 30 August and will be presented by Miley Cyrus."
