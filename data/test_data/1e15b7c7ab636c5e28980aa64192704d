  "content": "NowThis is built for distribution. It wears its costs lightly \u2013 small team, little investment in capital-intensive technology, no legacy infrastructure \u2013 and just under two years ago it effectively shut down its desktop presence. \"Homepage. Even the word sounds old,\" is the message that greets visitors on a page now intent on sending them elsewhere. Today, the short form videos NowThis produces generate 1.6bn views per month on other people's platforms. Revenue is shared accordingly. Where once publishers used social media as a promotional tool to pull users back to their own websites, now social networks and messaging apps have morphed into content hosts \u2013 think Facebook Instant Articles, Snapchat Discover, Apple News, LinkedIn Pulse, Google AMP and, even, Twitter Moments. \"Where others saw this trend as a threat, we saw it as an opportunity,\" Athan Stephanopoulos, president of NowThis told an audience at the Reuters Tomorrow's News panel discussion in London earlier this month. This new model begs a few questions, not least about economic sustainability. Speaking at the same event, the Guardian's executive editor of digital Aron Pilhofer said: \"There is the world we wish existed and then there is the world that exists. And the world that exists is one that is increasingly distributed and disintermediated. We can either ignore that and pretend that we can create a destination-oriented business as if it's 1996 or we can engage with it.\" It's a pragmatic response from a legacy publisher. There are other questions too, like how to rethink reader relationships on platforms owned and controlled by others. These are platforms where established publishers compete with a multitude of other sources (some good, some bad) invariably sharing the same or similar content. \"That's a huge challenge,\" acknowledged Nathalie Malinarich, mobile editor at BBC News online. \"When you look at your Facebook feed, after half an hour you've no idea where the news came from ... The key is to find your own voice and to find your own stories.\" For the BBC, establishing its own voice is about impartiality and trust. \"That's a really important thing in an area of distributed content. Who do you trust?\" Echoing Malinarich, Google's head of strategic news and publisher partnerships Eero Korhonen contrasted the tacit trust a reader held for a newspaper with the relationship a user now has with a data-driven social platform. \"They forgave the paper on the days it didn't give them the news they wanted or didn't surprise them because on average the paper delivered,\" Korhonen said. \"The algorithm doesn't know which content to trust.\" So how do you engender trust in an era of distributed content? For Malinarich it's about first principles and transparency. \"When I talk about trust, I'm talking about editorial standards,\" she said. \"You have trusted [the news outlet] to have checked the story, that they are telling you what they know and what they don't know. [It's also about] attribution \u2013 if you got it from somewhere else, say so.\" For Mark Challinor, president of the International News Media Association, trust is about acknowledging that if future revenue models are predicated on highly sought-after reader data, then \"we need to convince users that in return for giving information to us about themselves, we are going to give them a quality service.\" Similarly for NowThis, trust is about a contract with the user to deliver relevant, interesting and entertaining content. \"When somebody likes your page they are essentially giving you authority to enter their news feed. So you have a certain level of responsibility,\" Stephanopoulos told the Reuters audience. And what about an algorithmic solution? The Trust Project, set up with initial funding from Craigslist founder Craig Newmark, is hoping that technology \"can bake the evidence of trustworthy reporting \u2013 accuracy, transparency and inclusion \u2013 plainly into news practices, tools and platforms.\" When the project shared an initial set of practical tactics, academic and author Jeff Jarvis jumped in with a series of technology-led proposals of his own. His suggestions included rigorous citations through links, prioritising original work over rehashes and a corrections service that follows the reader. The idea is to create a series of signals that can help determine the rigour behind the story telling. Jarvis created his wishlist in late 2014. Even though he was writing at a time before social distribution became the norm, many of his suggestions remain appropriate today. But perhaps some don't. It's doubtful, for example, that citations through links maps with attempts by Facebook et al to build something that resembles the AOL and Yahoo!-style walled gardens of 1990s. The hyperlink, unfortunately, appears incompatible with the grand plan of social distribution. Content curation \u2013 combining data-driven filtering with human intervention \u2013 might be another route to create trust in, and ensure the provenance of, the journalism that gets most widely seen. But even this, as Facebook discovered last month, is not without its risks. After all, social platforms might have technology baked in but they don't yet have editorial standards, processes and instinct built in.
