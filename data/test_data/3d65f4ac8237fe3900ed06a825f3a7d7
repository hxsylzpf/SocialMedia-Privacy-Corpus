  "content": "The Wall Street Journal has just rained on (part of) Facebook's parade. Rupert Murdoch's US newspaper on Tuesday launched its all-new Facebook app \u2013 WSJ Social \u2013 48 hours before the big unveil at f8 in San Francisco. From the whispers we've heard already (see Monday's Guardian story on f8 announcements) WSJ Social is in line with what other newspapers, music and video sites will be launching on Thursday. At first glance, WSJ Social appears to channel all of its stories onto Facebook, complete with a hierarchical front page and without that pesky paywall. It's the Wall Street Journal reimagined for a world where sharing rules the roost, as the WSJ head of new products, Maya Baratz, told Forbes: \"[Facebook] really is kind of like another internet.\" Baratz told us that \"users are the editors/curators\" so what stories you see depends on \"who you add as your editor in the app\", meaning that WSJ Social gives up formal control of news editing to the masses. Asked why the WSJ launched two days before f8, Baratz said: \"What better day to launch than a Tuesday?\" Through WSJ Social, Facebook users can subscribe to stories shared by existing friends or by the paper's bosses. Raj Bahl, the consumer products head at WSJ publisher Dow Jones, is all set up with a WSJ Social feed, as is Doug Reiter, an IT director at the WSJ. And if you're feeling uncomfortable in this new parallel universe, WSJ Social lets you click through to read the article on the paper's website. (But by that time, you'll probably be living and breathing inside Facebook.) Another interesting nugget from the WSJ's prelaunch: the top right-hand column of the page, above the sponsored advertising, is close to what we're expecting with the real-time media ticker (as humbly revealed by the Guardian yesterday). The panel currently has a feed of what your Facebook friends are playing online \u2013 for example, \"Josh Halliday is playing The Sims Social\" (I'm not) \u2013 but that could extend to what music you're listening to and what videos you're watching. Expect more where this came from on Thursday.",
