  "content": "The Mail on Sunday has launched an appeal against an injunction preventing it publishing revelations about television presenter Angus Deayton's sex life. A spokesman for the paper confirmed that an appeal for a full hearing into the gag had been lodged with the high court. \"We think there is a strong public interest at stake here and we feel matters should be revealed,\" said the spokesman. \"We are still hoping that the injunction will be lifted so we can publish the full facts.\" Lawyers for Deayton, presenter of Have I Got News for You, have made an application to the judge to dismiss the Mail's challenge. One member of his legal team said he was confident the judge would dismiss the Mail's case before it went to trial at the court of appeal in October. The team believes that a lengthy legal battle will expose details of the subterfuge used by the Mail on Sunday in its investigation of the TV presenter that will damage the paper's credibility. Deayton gagged the Mail on Sunday three weeks ago when he obtained a last-minute high court injunction against the publication of a dossier of information the paper claimed would \"disturb even his closest friends\". The presenter, who has a partner, Lise Mayer, and an 18-month-old son, admitted to a liaison with Caroline Martin, 29, a prostitute, after the News of the World claimed he took cocaine and slept with her twice. Those revelations led to a merciless tormenting on Have I Got News for You. Two weeks after the News of the World story, the Sunday Mirror claimed that during his nine-year relationship with Ms Mayer, Deayton also had a mistress, Stacy Herbert, 24. Faced with further revelations about his private life, Deayton attended a three-hour court hearing at the home of Mr Justice Ouseley. The judge agreed to an order that prevented the Mail on Sunday from the \"communication of any information of, or relating to, Angus Deayton (directly or indirectly) about his health, medical history or condition\". Injunctions relating to the private lives of celebrities have been lifted before. In March, revelations about two extra-marital affairs conducted by Gary Flitcroft were published after the Blackburn Rovers footballer had prevented their exposure for more than a year."
