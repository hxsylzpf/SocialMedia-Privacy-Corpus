  "content": "To trace journalism's erratic transition to the digital world, you only have to look at how dramatically headlines have changed \u2013 and why. Throughout the print era, pictures, standfirsts, opening paragraphs and several other factors helped lure you into a story. Online, headlines have to work far harder on their own, often competing against dozens of others on busy homepages, search results, and most importantly, social media. How compelling headlines are is now the biggest factor in whether stories are a hit or a flop. No wonder we've started to 'pimp' them up out of all recognition, like a boy racer's crudely painted Ford Escort tearing up a motorway screeching for attention. After initially replicating traditional news, tabloid or magazine headlines, we first entered the age of SEO. Ostensibly a stripped down, facts-first style of writing, search engine optimisation was really about tickling Google's probing algorithms with keywords to top the site's results pages. This led to much handwringing on the behalf of journalists who felt their creativity stifled (see also: opening paragraphs). For a while, we all felt like machines, rather than writers. It also, on occasion, baffled readers. I remember once being told that my job, in the event of a celebrity death, was to include both the words \"dead\" and \"dies\" in the same headline to cover any search term people many use. The odd, clunky syntax that followed \u2013 \"Michael Jackson dies: singer found dead in home\" \u2013 prompted users to question why we were ramming home the morbid fact quite so crudely. When social media began to replace search engines as the main way people found content, the shackles of SEO were largely shrugged off and what emerged were \"superlative headlines\". A sort of evolution of tabloid sensationalism, they focused on being earnest and positive. The idea wasn't to shock readers from the newsstand but cosy up to them from their Facebook feed. We called these superlatives headlines \"click bait\", and among the media brands that grew out of the internet age, they seemed enjoyably informal, ironic and playful \u2013 primarily because their stories were all informal, ironic and playful anyway. But then we all tried to join in, and that's where \"click bait\" began to grate and misfire. In February, when the actress Kristen Stewart published a self-penned poem in a magazine, a UK paper (not this one) published the story on its website with the headline: \"Kristen Stewart: Twilight star writes worst poem of all time for Marie Claire\". Stewart's poem \u2013 though hardly Sylvia Plath \u2013 was of course far from \"the worst poem of all time\" (as anyone who has attended an open-mic night will quickly attest). The hyperbole was inserted to generate the clicks that \"Twilight star writes a poem\" simply would not, and many found it jarringly off-brand for the newspaper. Soon, click bait seemed new and fun but insincere and manipulative. Words like \"amazing\", \"astonishing\" or \"greatest\" seemed to lose any real meaning, or as UsVsTh3m editor Rob Manuel put it wryly on Twitter the other day: \"Despite so many promises I can't think of one instance an article on the internet has blown my mind.\" More recently, websites like Upworthy have begun to take the superlative approach one step further to pioneer, with great success, what you might call the \"emotionally manipulative\" headline. Their \"The Things This 4-Year-Old Is Doing Are Cute. The Reason He's Doing Them Is Heartbreaking.\" is a good example of how far the humble headline has come from describing the basics facts of a story to promising the reader \u2013 almost demanding of them \u2013 a strong emotional reaction to it, as if we're all predestined to respond in exactly the same way to whatever we read. Mercifully, the traditional news press have resisted following this particular trend so far, even while being aware that Upworthy articles were viewed and shared hundreds of millions of times last year. One reason is simply good taste. It's one thing for the Times or the Guardian to get a little less stuffy, quite another to publish \"How Putin Has Threatened The Ukraine Will Shock You, The Possible Consequences For International Diplomacy Will Scare You Half To Death!\". But perhaps \u2013 and this may yet prove wishful thinking \u2013 it's because readers have grown more immune to overcooked headlines that often leaves them feeling cheated, in the same way they bored of SEO headlines, or figured out picture galleries of 100 barely distinguishable photos were really just cynical attempts to milk them for page impressions. Just as many people seem to roll their eyes and shrug at Upworthy's over the top headlines, or indeed parody them, as enthusiastically click or share. We're getting less gullible about what lies on the other side of the internet's casual promises. For the media, which so far in the digital age has often resembled a pack of puppies all chasing whichever bright new ball rolls into the garden next, this can only be a good thing. It's easy to measure the clicks you generate, less the people you've annoyed.
