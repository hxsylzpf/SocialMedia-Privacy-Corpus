  "content": "Well Dave says would people please never say Rebekah or Charlie again, as well as Raisa and Andy and Murdoch, and to be quite careful about Hunty, so I will only put that after she came out of the police station I texted IIJMOATRFE at Dave, as a little test, and I went to Mummy, TBH, does it not tell you something that he knew, as in instantly, that it meant Is It Just Me Or Are They Rationing Frizz Ease and actually texted back lol? So the total wrongness of Rebekah saying he could EVER have thought it meant lots of love, I mean, in her dreams, obvs, but I'm like, seriously, FFS, Leveson, DYJ, if Dave wanted to send love would he not have put \"lyl\", for love you lots, like anyone else? How beyond insulting is it to put on record that Dave is some sort of texting special-needs, *puts on so mad I could scream at a judge face*. But Dave just goes fine, KCACO, which even Oik and Haguey know is acronym for Keep Calm and Carry On, we tested everyone at the brainstorming for Haguey's OYB campaign, which should actually be OYJ, since bikes do not go far enough nowadays for a work ethic like Hilto's, and I mean personally I would be very happy to get a jet somewhere because it is actually getting quite difficult to be in Chippy? So I went to Dave, of course we cannot be friends with people who are always around police stations but how about their friends, eg, if the Goveys are friends with Rupert who is friends with RB can we still have the Goveys over and friends of the Goveys, because if not that basically leaves Mummy, Anya and the nannies? And Dave went no worries babes, when you are rescuing the work ethic you do not have time for parties. I was like, please, I can live without R and C &amp; co, but if that's really true, SMN. And Dave went, what? And I went, tell me you're joking \u2013 you seriously don't know it means Shoot Me Now? Dave went, just banter, OK, BANTER? But suddenly I'm like OMG, what if it's all true?"
