  "content": "Economic data can seem boring and soulless. But on the first Friday of every month, it becomes a nerdy and active game on Twitter, as pundits, economists and journalists all comb the unemployment numbers, competing to find the best insight or analysis. Their conversations every month turn the otherwise cold and bloodless business of reading numbers into something like a Sherlock Holmes mystery: what killed employment this month? Was the murder weapon hidden in construction, in manufacturing or in some other sector? The challenge started anew on Friday with jobs numbers that held two crucial mysteries: now that the election is over, can we finally tell \u2013 without a lot of political yelling \u2013 how the economy is doing?; and what was the effect of Hurricane Sandy, which caused over $80bn of damage to New York and New Jersey? For those who don't follow the economics conversation on Twitter, it's a good time to start now that the election is over and the attendant political freakouts are largely quieted. In fact, for those who have tuned out the economic debate, it's finally possible to suddenly start getting absorbed in the otherwise grim business of learning about the economy by combing Twitter. It's helpful to have the context provided by people who notice details so easily and casually that would otherwise pass into the noisy ephemera of social media. The Twitter analysis usually has a rhythm. For instance, there is usually a tweeter who immediately sums up the report in less than 140 characters. Today, that person was Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein. Jobs report says we added 146k jobs in November, unemployment fell to 7.7. Contrary to expectations, BLS says Sandy didn't much matter. \u2014 Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) December 7, 2012 That's easy to understand: The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, reported an addition of 146,000 jobs for the month, bringing the jobless rate down to 7.7%, from 7.9% last month. But the BLS offered an analysis that suggested that Hurricane Sandy wasn't a big factor. That doesn't fit with this week's other unemployment report, the private payrolls reported by ADP and analyzed by Moody's. The ADP numbers suggested that Hurricane Sandy did in fact hit the economy. So the stage is set, with tweeters donning their deerstalker caps and pulling out their magnifiying glasses. They start to examine the evidence. First, there's usually a warning to (and from) the wise not to put total faith in the official unemployment numbers. The math is far from exact, because the BLS uses a survey, and sometimes that survey doesn't cover everything that is happening in the economy. As a result, the first BLS unemployment numbers are often subject to mistakes. They have a large margin of error \u2013 they could be wrong by 100,000 jobs! \u2013 and the numbers usually get revised not once, but twice. That's what happened this month \u2013 the numbers for the previous two months were revised downward. We added 50,000 fewer jobs to the economy than we thought. Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan, issued the best warning to chill out. Downward revisions of nearly 50K are a reminder of how volatile these estimates are. \u2014 Betsey Stevenson (@BetseyStevenson) December 7, 2012 Then the analysis of the actual numbers starts. This is often the best part. The blog ZeroHedge, which takes a severely skeptical view of employment statistics, pointed out one of the worst pieces of data from the unemployment report: the number of unemployed is falling because people are completely dropping out of the labor force, so they're not even being counted any more. Dow Jones reporter Jeffrey Sparshott noticed the same. People out of labor force rises by 540K from 88,341 to 88,883 \u2014 zerohedge (@zerohedge) December 7, 2012 US unemployment rate lowest since Dec 2008, but largely a reflection of people dropping out of workforce \u2014 Jeffrey Sparshott (@jeffatdowjones) December 7, 2012 There are strange and interesting trends \u2013 for instance, that the number of people who found jobs was not so far from the number of people who lost jobs. This sheds a light on one of the biggest problems in the nationwide unemployment crisis: we're barely getting ahead in adding jobs without also losing others. 2.2 million unemployed workers (17.5% of total) found jobs in November. Meanwhile 1.9mm employed workers became unemployed. \u2014 Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) December 7, 2012 It helps to have context on where we are in the unemployment crisis. Many people pointed out that the jobless rate now is lower than any time since December 2008, when Lehman Brothers fell and the economy started to collapse. Eddy Elfenbein noticed that we've only gotten halfway towards adding enough jobs to equal the ones lost during the recessionary times: From Jan 2008 peak to Feb 2010 trough we lost 8.959 million jobs. We've made back 4.608 million or 51%. \u2014 Eddy Elfenbein (@EddyElfenbein) December 7, 2012 Sudeep Reddy, on the Wall Street Journal's economics team, pointed out how long the road is ahead. Clear your calendar for the next five years. If the 2011/2012 pace of job growth continues (avg. 150,000/month), we'll see 6% unemployment by ... late 2017. \u2014 Sudeep Reddy (@Reddy) December 7, 2012 But the central mystery of the jobs report soon captured Twittter: how was it possible that Hurricane Sandy didn't affect employment? Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan (and the partner of Betsey Stevenson) was skeptical that Sandy could have so little impact. He used Twitter as a kind of announcement system to remind journalists to look deeper into the BLS statement. Hint for journos: Before writing that Sandy didn't matter:1. Think about the counterfactual;2. Ask the BLS exactly what their note means. \u2014 Justin Wolfers (@justinwolfers) December 7, 2012 It was easy enough to poke holes in the BLS suggestion that Sandy didn't have a big impact. ZeroHedge, for instance, noticed that construction jobs fell \u2013 when they should have risen, assuming that people were rebuilding after Sandy. What happened to that jump in Construction workers on Sandy reconstruction? \u2014 zerohedge (@zerohedge) December 7, 2012 Offline, Nigel Gault, the chief US economist at IHS Global Insight, agreed. He wrote: \"The BLS said that Sandy didn't have a substantive effect on the figures. We would guess that it probably did some damage to employment in construction (down 20,000) and manufacturing (down 7,000).\" Justin Lahart, of the Wall Street Journal, found other evidence that there some Sandy-related effects on employment. He noticed that 175,000 workers \u2013 25,000 fewer than usual \u2013 counted as part-time workers. The reason looked a lot like Hurricane Sandy, in disguise. 175k workers worked part time, rather than full time, because of bad weather (typical November that number is about 200k) \u2014 Justin Lahart (@jdlahart) December 7, 2012 And Phil Izzo, of the Wall Street Journal, also noted another instance of Sandy by another name: \"not at work due to bad weather.\" Labor says Sandy wasn't a big impact but \"not at work due to bad weather\" at 369,000, highest since snowpacolypse \u2014 Phil Izzo (@philizzo) December 7, 2012 So that settled Sandy. Overall, however, many people thought the employment report was positive. The trend, noted Ben Casselman, is that the jobs numbers have been steadily rising, over the course of a month, a quarter, half a year and a full year. How's this for steady: One-month payroll gain, 146k. Three-month: 139k. Six-month: 139k. 12-month: 157k. on.wsj.com/VOB9vH \u2014 Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) December 7, 2012 And it was hard not to relate the jobs numbers to the fiscal cliff. Many theories have held that business owners have been so worried about the fiscal cliff coming that they haven't been hiring. David Gaffen, counting the jobs report as positive, called that theory a myth. #fiscalcliffmyths No 41 - the jobs market is getting crushed by the fiscal cliff. \u2014 David Gaffen (@davidgaffen) December 7, 2012 For others, it was hard to call the jobs report a complete victory in relation to the fiscal cliff. Leslie Levesque, a senior economist at IHS Global Insight, noted today that consumer sentiment is down sharply in December, indicating that \"consumers are startingto become more aware of the so called 'fiscal cliff' and its implications.\" Indeed, whether on Twitter or away from social media, experts have a complicated relationship with the jobs report. They're reluctant to completely accept merely good news \u2013 they want the best. Doug Duncan, the chief economist at Fannie Mae, wrote in a note to clients today that we're still in a \"sub-par economic recovery\". \"Overall, the economy has created an average of 139,000 jobs in each of the past six months, which is consistent with our view of ongoing modest economic growth and slow healing in the labor market,\" he wrote. On the bright side, housing is still picking up. \"However, this sub-par economic recovery does not appear to be deterring a solid improvement in the housing market \u2026 we anticipate that the housing market will continue to gain momentum in 2013.\" Dr Goose, a pseudonymous tweeter who writes clever limericks about the economy, was driven to describe this good/bad dichotomy in verse. He used the wonky term for the BLS statistics: non-farm payrolls, or NFP. Sure, they're up to average, but there is still grim news underlying them, he pointed out: The NFP numbers elate/By reaching the average rate/But the dirty details/Of the nation's travails/Are anything other than great. \u2014 Dr. Goose (@DrGooseEcon) December 7, 2012 Of course, there are still things to be grateful for, including the end of the election madness. John Hockenberry, the host of WNYC's The Takeaway, welcomed the abandonment of politics as the prism for everything that happens in unemployment. Employment numbers without politics equals REALITY @thetakeaway So relieved not to be asking if job numbers benefit/hurt Obama/Romney! \u2014 John Hockenberry (@JHockenberry) December 7, 2012 Another radio host, WNYC's beloved Brian Lehrer, thought the attention to the BLS was misplaced anyway: This is the day when everyone tweets about BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) when really should be tweeting about BLS (Brian Lehrer Show!) \u2014 Brian Lehrer Show (@BrianLehrer) December 7, 2012 By 11am, everyone was off Twitter and at their desks, doing more analysis of the numbers. You'll find the ultimate angles in Saturday's news stories. But if you were paying attention on Twitter, you probably already know exactly what they will say."
