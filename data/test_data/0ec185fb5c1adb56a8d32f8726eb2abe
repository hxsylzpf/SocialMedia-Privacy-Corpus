  "content": "Never can one person have been stuck in a lift and so many people know about it. Stephen Fry used Twitter to tell his followers (113,068 and rising fast!) that he was marooned in a lift on the 26th floor of London's Centrepoint late last night. \"We could be here for hours. Arse, poo and widdle.\" Still, Fry didn't waste his time in the small metal box. Oh no. He took a picture. \"Engineers on their way in 20 minutes apparently.\" And another one. \"This is getting boring. Morale still high. Hopes of early night dashed.\" But it turned out to have a happy ending. \"We're free!\" he Twittered. \"Nice men from Thyssen freed us. Paramount Club had champagne for us at the bottom. I'm allergic, but nice thought x.\" Next time Fry, who was yesterday giving a talk at the Apple store on London's Regent Street, will presumably take the stairs. Just not to the 26th floor, though."
