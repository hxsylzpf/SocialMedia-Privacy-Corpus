  "content": "Facebook has unveiled sweeping changes to its website \u2013 including partnerships with major music and film companies \u2013 in a bid to transform the world's biggest social network into a key entertainment hub. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, on Thursday announced new partnerships with Spotify, Netflix, the Guardian and other media companies as he said that 800 million people worldwide now use the social network. \"The last five years of social networking have been about getting people signed up,\" Zuckerberg told Facebook's f8 conference in San Francisco. \"Until recently people weren't sure how long the phenomenon would last. Now social networks are a ubiquitous tool used by billions of people around the world to stay connected every day.\" Facebook has in recent months recently ramped up its attempts to attract and keep internet users on the site in the wake of competition from Twitter and a new rival in Google. Facebook is expected to hit the 1 billion user mark within weeks, having doubled the number of active users since February 2010. As part of the changes announced on Thursday, Facebook users will be able to automatically share activity such as viewing, listening and reading in a live \"ticker\" stream, once they have opted in to the feature. The new stream will be separate from the existing Facebook news feed, although popular items \u2013 such as the most frequently played songs among friends \u2013 will appear in the column. \"We are making it so you can connect to anything you want. Now you don't have to like a book, you can just read a book,\" Zuckerberg said. \"You don't have to like a movie; you can just watch a movie.\" Facebook unveiled sweeping changes to users' profile pages, including an online scrapbook, dubbed Timeline, which Zuckerberg said will \"help you tell the story of your life\". Dressed in a plain grey T-shirt, jeans and white trainers, the 27-year-old billionaire said Timeline would allow readers to document important moments \u2013 such as birth, graduation and marriage \u2013 while maintaining \"complete control\" of privacy settings. Unlike Twitter and Google+, which are heavily focused on exchanging messages with friends, Facebook has become an online destination where people can record their own history. Facebook, which attracted a record 500 million people in just 24 hours, now allows users to watch films, listen to music and read newspapers without leaving the website. Rio Caraeff, chief executive of the online music video site Vevo, which is to be offered from inside Facebook's website, said: \"Today's announcement is a big step forward in Vevo's mission to bring more music to more fans in more places. A deeper integration with Facebook will help Vevo grow its scale and reach to new heights, while better targeting our connected, socially-savvy audience.\" While Facebook is keen for its users to stay on the site for as long as possible, Zuckerberg has consistently emphasised that the site is a \"distribution platform\" to other media companies. The social network has moved to strengthen its ties with media partners in recent months as it moves closer to its hotly anticipated initial public offering. Facebook was recently valued at $66.5bn on secondary markets. Its global revenues are expected to reach $4.3bn in 2011, up from $2bn in 2010, according to the research firm eMarketer. Planet Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg's ambitions never stagnate. He made Facebook into the biggest social network on the planet, where friends and family can keep in touch, and figured out a way to generate advertising money from the time spent on the site \u2013 more, in the US, than on Google properties in recent months. But now he wants to go beyond \"like\"; he wants us to \"read\" and \"listen\" \u2013 to look at stories from newspapers and share in the music your friends enjoy. It's a simultaneous expansion of Facebook's idea \u2013 that it should stretch across the internet \u2013 and also an admission that no matter how hard he might try, there's still more of the internet outside Facebook than in, and that peoples'people spend more time away from his site than on it. He wants Facebook to be the centre of your web experience. That's the purpose of the redesign of the \"timeline\" \u2013 the river of experiences recounted by your friends. Rather than being a river, he's offering the chance to organise it, with the photos and videos. The music sharing \u2013 letting friends listen together to songs through free streaming services such as Spotify \u2013 will be an instant hit. \"It isn't trying to block you from listening to songs you haven't bought; it's about helping you discover so many songs you end up buying more content than you ever would have otherwise,\" Zuckerberg said. His other ambition, obviously, is to be the next Steve Jobs \u2013 the person who makes you pay for music online. The key is that he wants Facebook to become the de facto authentication mechanism of the web. Perhaps you're sick of having to remember your login details at every different website you go to (because it's wrong to use the same password everywhere; if one site gets hacked then your online identity is compromised): he wants to make it possible for you to log in everywhere using just your Facebook identity, which of course is almost always your \"real\" identity. (What happens if your Facebook login gets stolen? Ah, that's a different problem.) For Google, still the biggest and most widely used search engine (even if it's not the biggest in Russia or China), Facebook's changes are yet another example of how social networking, a trick it has never mastered, still remains out of reach. Despite launching Google+, its own social networking service, to the world earlier this week, it lags behind by about 680 million users. Facebook, meanwhile, is mutating before our eyes: no longer an evanescent startup, now a giant. MySpace, Bebo, Friends Reunited: they're the past. Facebook more and more looks like the future."
