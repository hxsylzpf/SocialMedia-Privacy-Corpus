  "content": "A controversial online marketing campaign for the Universal Pictures thriller Untraceable has been pulled from Facebook and the video community Seesmic after concerns about the violence of its content. The interactive marketing company Picture Production Company set up a promotional page on Facebook called \"Kill With Me\" ahead of the film's UK launch this Friday. Launched five days ago, the Kill With Me page has been gradually revealing more and more of a visceral torture scene from the Untraceable movie to Facebook members. The Kill With Me Facebook profile included the following text: \"This guy is going to die. You want to see his stinking flesh burn and bleed and blacken? Until he's some twisted dead thing? This is what you want. And I've filmed it especially for you. The more fans I get, the more I'll show ...\" PPC's head of interactive, Dan Light, admitted the company had expected the campaign to be pulled from the social networking site, so had \"other things in place\". According to Facebook policy, groups must clearly label and apply age filters to content that is for over-18s so that younger users cannot access it. Facebook does not allow content that is \"hateful, threatening, or obscene\". PPC's stunt on Seesmic, the video messaging community, caused more alarm when an actor planted on the service briefly disappeared, and was then filmed by a video camera being bound, gagged and seemingly executed. The interactive marketing company had told Seesmic's management in advance that it would be using the service, but a moderator based at the video community site's HQ in San Francisco attempted to call the police over the stunt. Light said that both the clip and the fake murder were very violent, but said the agency wanted to push the boundaries of what is acceptable in an online community with the Untraceable marketing campaign. \"There's that interesting question of whether people are desensitised to things on screen,\" he added. \"They will watch these things, but won't say they watched them.\" Users of social networking sites are often very protective of the spaces they create, which they see as intimate and personal areas for communication with their network. The BBC recently clarified its internal policy on using photographs from social networking sites for news stories, and an earlier promotional stunt by the LonelyGirl15 project on YouTube angered some users who felt they had been misled. \"If we posted a trailer every hour we would be misusing it and would expect a backlash,\" said Light. \"But my view is that if you are entertaining or stimulating the user then you go some way towards earning the right for their attention.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
