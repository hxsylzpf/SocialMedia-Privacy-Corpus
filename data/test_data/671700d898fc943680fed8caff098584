  "content": "A disturbing video of a screaming baby being roughly dunked in a bucket of water is at the centre of a row over internet censorship. The two-minute film appeared on Facebook and showed a woman in a kitchen, believed to be in Indonesia, repeatedly plunging a crying young baby into a vat of water while holding the child upside down and spinning it around. Facebook refused to take it down and the video spread around the world, with some people claiming it was an example of \"baby yoga\" \u2013 and child protection activists arguing it was straightforward abuse. \"What is one person's baby yoga in one cultural context is child abuse in another context,\" said Claire Lilley, the NSPCC's lead on child safety online. \"The baby is flung about in a very violent way which could cause serious damage to its brain and its limbs. We just don't think its appropriate for that to be so easily viewable.\" The NSPCC called on the government minister responsible for internet safety, Lady Shields, to intervene to help safeguard children on social networks. Shields was formerly a vice-president at Facebook. A spokeswoman at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it had received a letter from the NSPCC and intended to respond. As the outrage grew, the video was taken down, possibly by the person who originally posted it, but versions of it were still available on other parts of the internet. Facebook earlier defended its decision not to censor the film, saying it did not break its rules and that to take it down would also mean the site had to ban videos of brutality during the Arab spring or depicting animal cruelty. \"Like others, we find the behaviour in this video upsetting and disturbing,\" said a spokesman. \"We face a difficult choice: balancing people's desire to raise awareness of behaviour like this against the disturbing nature of the video.\" Facebook said it removed any reported instances of the video in posts that supported or encouraged the behaviour. Where people were \"raising awareness or condemning the practice\" it marked videos as disturbing, which means they have a warning screen and are accessible only to over-18s. Peter Wanless, the NSPCC chief executive, said the case raised a wider issue. \"We have now reached the long overdue point where it is time for social networking sites to be held to account for the content on their sites and pay more attention to their safeguarding duties to protect children and young people, whether they are viewing the content or appearing in it,\" he said. Simon Milner, director of policy at Facebook UK, said the video posed a dilemma for the network. But he said sharing such content online could help prevent abuse. \"We have seen from experience that when things like that are shared on Facebook it can and does lead to the rescue of the child,\" he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"We hope very much that this will happen in this case.\" He added: \"We absolutely take extremely seriously the safety of everybody on Facebook and particularly the most vulnerable.\" Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group, which campaigns to preserve openness on the internet, said: \"If you ban people from showing videos where someone is doing something wrong, you stop people being able to comment and criticise. \"This is very tough for Facebook and some sympathy has to be extended to them. It is completely understandable the NSPCC are upset, but setting hard and fast rules [about what to ban] will lead to arbitrary decisions.\""
