  "content": "The Daily Mirror is to appeal against a landmark court ruling awarding Naomi Campbell damages against the newspaper for breach of confidence, it was announced today. The Streatham-born supermodel was last month awarded \u00a33,500 at the high court after the newspaper printed details of her treatment for drug addiction. However, Mr Justice Morland also said he was satisfied Ms Campbell, 31, lied on oath. \"The paper is today lodging an application with the court of appeal for permission to appeal against all aspects of Mr Justice Morland's decision,\" said a statement by the paper's owner, Trinity Mirror. \"We believe the judge made fundamental errors in reaching his decision on the law of confidence and the data protection claim - Naomi Campbell having abandoned her claim to damages for invasion of privacy at the beginning of the trial - and that his decision should be overturned. \"Given that the judge found she had lied to the public and to the court in the witness box, we maintain that he was wrong to award Naomi Campbell her legal costs and we are seeking to appeal against that decision as well.\" Campbell took legal action after the Mirror published details in February 2001 of her attendance at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in King's Road, London. She accepted the newspaper was entitled to publish that she was a drug addict and the fact that she was having therapy. But the model argued that the information that the therapy was being obtained through NA and the details of her attendance at meetings were private and confidential matters. The compensation included \u00a32,500 for her claims for breach of confidentiality and breach of duty under the 1998 Data Protection Act. Mr Justice Morland also awarded an additional \u00a31,000 aggravated damages over a subsequent \"highly offensive and hurtful\" Mirror article that compared the 31-year-old model with a \"chocolate soldier\". Piers Morgan, the editor of the Mirror, said after the ruling he was \"at a loss\" to understand Ms Campbell's argument and that she had won on a \"very small technical point\"."
