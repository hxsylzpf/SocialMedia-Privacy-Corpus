  "content": "Twitter users are no longer able to set their own background pictures as they browse the site, after the company quietly turned off the much-loved feature and replaced backgrounds with a uniform light grey. User-set backgrounds will still be visible when a specific user's feed, or individual tweet, is visited. But when browsing the home timeline, users are now faced with a plain background, rather than one of their own choice. The change was initially made without an announcement, prompting many users to wonder if the site had broken, but a Twitter spokesperson confirmed that the update was deliberate. \"We're removing background images from the home and notifications timelines on web for all users,\" the company told Engadget. \"Now, background images are only available where logged-in users will see them publicly [Tweet pages, list pages and collections pages].\" Some users have speculated that the changes are to pave the way for adverts which take over the whole background. The change has upset some users, who appreciated the ability to personalise their Twitter experience, and one has created a chrome plugin to undo the change. Mika, a coder based in Leipzig, Germany, released the Twitter Background Restorer onGithub on Tuesday morning. \"I bet there's gonna be paid-for background ads now,\" Mika said this morning. \"People are defending it in the comments with 'good, people were myspacing it up anyway' \u2013 you can still see the background on individual tweets!\""
