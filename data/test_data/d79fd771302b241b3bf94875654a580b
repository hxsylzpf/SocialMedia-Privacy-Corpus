  "content": "Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald, and Laura Poitras, the whistleblower and journalists behind the revelations into the NSA's surveillance of American citizens and foreign targets abroad, took questions from Reddit users during an AMA on Monday. They fielded queries on everything from the weather in Moscow this time of year (nicer than the East Coast's right now, according to Snowden) to what role, if any, the issue of surveillance might play in the 2016 US presidential election. The AMA took place on the eve of Citizenfour's HBO premiere. The film, which chronicles the reporting and aftermath of the NSA stories, won the Oscar for best documentary feature on Sunday night. The conversation did not go off entirely without a hitch; there was a mixup with Snowden's user account, which lead to a snarky exchange between Greenwald and a Reddit moderator. But questionable Reddiquette not withstanding, the Q&amp;A was full of insights into Snowden, Poitras, and Greenwald's experiences over the past two years \u2014 and what is yet to come. We've rounded up some of the best moments from their conversation below. On what's changed since the NSA revelations came to light: \"The biggest change has been in awareness....Facts allow us to stop speculating and start building, and that's the foundation we need to fix the internet. We just happened to be the generation stuck with fighting these fires,\" Snowden said. \"Because people now realize the extent to which their privacy is being compromised, they can - and increasingly are - using encryption and anonymizers to protect their own privacy and physically prevent mass surveillance,\" Greenwald wrote. Poitras on the making of Citizenfour, and footage that didn't make the final cut: I do plan to release more footage from Hong Kong shoot. On the first day we met Ed, Glenn conducted a long interview (4-5 hours) that is extraordinary. I also conducted a separate interview with Ed re: technical questions. The time constraints of a feature film made it impossible to include everything. I will release more. She also said she had \"incredible footage\" with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks that she realized later on didn't belong in this film. Snowden on the consequences of US and UK intelligence agencies tampering with SIM cards and why you really should care: \" When the NSA and GCHQ compromised the security of potentially billions of phones [...] they not only screwed the manufacturer, they screwed all of us, because the only way to address the security compromise is to recall and replace every SIM sold by [the manufacturer] Gemalto. Greenwald on the revelation that shocked him most: \"For me personally, the most shocking revelation was the overall one that the explicit goal of the NSA and its allies is captured by the slogan \"collect it all\" - meaning they want to convert the internet into a place of limitless, mass surveillance, which is another way of saying they literally want to eliminate privacy in the digital age.\" Poitras on the risks of traveling to the US \"Starting in 2006, after I came back from making a film about Iraq's first election, I was stopped and detained at the US border over 40 times, often times for hours. After I went public with my experiences (Glenn broke the story in 2012), the harassment stopped. Unfortunately there are countless others who aren't so lucky.\" Snowden on life in exile in Moscow \"Moscow is the biggest city in Europe. A lot of people forget that. Shy of Tokyo, it's the biggest city I've ever lived in. I'd rather be home, but it's a lot like any other major city,\" he wrote. This led to by far the best exchange of the AMA. \"Is winter harsh? Do you ever want to go out, but wake up and find yourself suddenly snowed in?\" asked Reddit user C4. \"Canada, Sweden and North Dakota have pretty harsh winters, too. As does Boston,\" countered Greenwald. \"This kills the joke,\" Snowden replied. Snowden on his one regret: \"Had I come forward a little sooner, these programs would have been a little less entrenched, and those abusing them would have felt a little less familiar with and accustomed to the exercise of those powers.\""
