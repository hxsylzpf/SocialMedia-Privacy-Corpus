  "content": "\u2022 European regulators could bring in tighter rules on what information social networking services can share with each other. According to the Financial Times, an advisory group to the European Commission has recommended tough data protection rules that could scupper the plans of companies like Facebook and Google to let developers hook into their services. \u2022 The excitement over low-cost personal genetic testing could be misplaced, says one leading expert. Francis Collins, former head of the National Human Genome Research Institute in America, says that three leading genomics companies gave highly variable analyses of the diseases he could be at risk of developing. His remarks were reported in the MIT Technology Review. \u2022 Today's Technology Guardian is stuffed full. An interview with Google co-founder Sergey Brin; how the technology behind hot tubs could be a key to renewable electricity; and we look at notorious hacker DVD Jon's latest venture, DoubleTwist.
