  "content": "It was only a matter of time before creative minds began pondering the brave new world where virtual reality intersects with real reality. Take director Spike Jonze, whose film Her was a tender parable about love and artificial intelligence. Or Dave Eggers' prescient, tech-obsessed thriller novel The Circle. Industrial-folk singer EMA has gone one better. Her second album, The Future's Void, may be the first truly \"post-internet\" record (although weirdly Keyboard Cat doesn't feature at all). She wrote it following her experiences online after the release of her debut, 2011's Past Life Martyred Saints, when derogatory comments were posted under her videos on YouTube. \"I went offline feeling unsettled and unsafe,\" she says. The artist formerly known as Erika M Anderson used these feelings to create a mournful elegy to the \"internetification\" of the human race, looking to William Gibson's seminal cyberpunk tome Neuromancer as inspiration. The central theme, she says, came to her in a vision. \"I felt like I had a white cube in my brain which was separate to me and it contained all my publicity photos and videos. I went home and thought about it and realised it was like an AI [artificial intelligence]. I feel like we all have this other entity, this Neuromancer-y thing that's made up of all the information we give up online.\" David Cronenberg are you listening? This could be your musical. EMA unpicks the strange relationship we have with our Facebook and Instagram selves and channels them into doom-filled post-Nine Inch Nails missives. Sample lyric: \"I blew my soul out across the interwebs and screamed \u2026 Disassociation, I guess it's just a modern disease.\" On the track Neuromancer, she sings of a world where people take selfies with abandon but where that narcissism turns inward to create cyber-bullying. Meanwhile the closer, Dead Celebrity, chains the melody of The Star Spangled Banner to lyrics about mourning a star in the digital age (\"Tell me what you want to see when you click on the link of the dead celebrity?\"). \"I didn't set out to make a topical record,\" she says. \"But the album ended up being a black mirror that perhaps will resonate with other people's experiences online.\" The Future's Void is out on 7 April.",
