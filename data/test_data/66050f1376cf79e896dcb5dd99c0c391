  "content": "Tabloid newspapers will be able to carry on using private detectives without fear of jail sentences after a government climb-down was confirmed last night. Ministers decided to table a last-minute amendment to the current criminal justice bill under which a longstanding promise to impose jail sentences for data theft will be dropped. In a compromise with the information commissioner, Richard Thomas, the clause will remain in the bill but its implementation will be suspended. Lawbreakers will continue to face fines. Thomas, who has lost his battle with a press lobby led by the Daily Mail, sought to put the best face on it last night. His office said the clause would still be a \"sword of Damocles\" hanging over future wrongdoers who \"blag\" people's personal details for profit. \"Although of course we would have preferred the clause to have remained unchanged, we understand that the justice secretary will be able to introduce prison sentences if illegal activity continues.\" Thomas produced two reports detailing what he said was a burgeoning black market in illegally obtained information such as BT \"family and friends\" numbers, car licence plate owners, and ex-directory numbers. The Mail group and the Murdoch papers were the most prolific users of convicted private detectives. He demanded the government toughen up penalties, and was supported by NHS officials who fear the public will have no confidence in the proposed large database of sensitive patient records if it is vulnerable to raids by newspapers. But after the bill passed a consultation and both houses of parliament, editors lobbied Gordon Brown. He intervened and ordered the justice secretary, Jack Straw, to drop the jailing clause. Editors who lobbied up to last night's deadline for tabling amendments warned that \"investigative journalism\" was under threat. They claim not to break existing laws, which already allow a \"public interest\" defence.",
