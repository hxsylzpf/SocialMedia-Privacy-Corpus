  "content": "\u2022 Lots of government/military headlines today: the BBC's running a report from Finjan suggesting that computers inside the UK government may have been compromised by Ukrainian criminals. Meanwhile, Wired recounts the story of Brazilian hackers who are piggybacking on US military satellites too and Newsweek has an intriguing report about US soldiers being issued iPod Touches in the field (including ballistics applications for snipers). \u2022 Meanwhile, there's a brewing row over BT Mobile's decision to block access to the Pirate Bay. Users are instead pointed towards the Internet Watch Foundation - which told the Register that it has nothing to do with the decision. Yes, it's mobile broadband - hardly built for peer-to-peer applications - but why are rules meant for child porn being used here? \u2022 And finally, because I'm such a nice man I've got a couple of viral links for you today: Danny MacAskill's crazy bike parkour, and this utterly enchanting stop-motion animation, Wolf and Pig. You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter (@guardiantech, or our personal accounts) or by watching our Delicious feed.",
