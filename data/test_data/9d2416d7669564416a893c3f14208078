  "content": "Max Clifford has become embroiled in a row with the Sunday People editor, Neil Wallis, after the paper negotiated a deal that broke a confidentiality clause set up by the publicist to protect one of his clients, Westlife's Bryan McFadden, from a tabloid expos\u00e9. Mr Clifford hit out at Wallis following the publication of a story about a lap dancer and McFadden in the Sunday People. The man behind many of the most notorious tabloid scoops of the past 20 years said he was \"disappointed\" and his relationship with Wallis had been \"destroyed\" when the paper ran the story after a confidentiality agreement had been drawn up between the lap dancer and McFadden's management. Mr Clifford said he planned to protest to the Law Society, although what grounds he would have for the complaint are unclear. \"I've done a lot of things with Neil,\" Mr Clifford said. \"It's probably not terminal but I don't want to do any deals with the Sunday People at the moment.\" McFadden reportedly had a one-night stand with lap dancer Amy Barker just weeks before his wedding to former Atomic Kitten star Kerry Katona. Barker was paid \u00a315,000 by Westlife's management, through Clifford, to keep the story quiet for the rest of her life. A further \u00a31,000 was paid to Jeffrey Green Russell solicitors, again through Mr Clifford, for advising Ms Barker on the confidentiality agreement. But last week Ms Barker's story appeared in the Sunday People, sparking a flurry of follow-up stories about the pop star's marriage. According to Mr Clifford, Jeffrey Green Russell solicitor Stuart Nuttall, who drew up the confidentiality agreement, also advised Ms Barker on the sale of her story to the newspaper. A Jeffrey Green Russell partner confirmed that Nuttall had advised Ms Barker on both contracts and said he had acted on Ms Barker's instructions at all times. Jeffrey Green Russell said it did not have any duty to Mr Clifford because he was not a client of the firm. Mr Clifford, who clashed with journalist Louis Theroux in a recent edition of his BBC programme, When Louis Met..., has had working relationships with the tabloids and particularly the Sunday red tops for years. He has furnishing them with many of their best scoops. \"I'm known for breaking stories but the reality is that I keep far more out of the papers,\" he said. He added that the editor of the News of the World, Rebekah Wade, and the Sunday Mirror, Tina Weaver, had already turned down the McFadden story. A partner at Jeffrey Green Russell refused to comment on the details of the agreement. \"I can't confirm what our role was, except to say that Max Clifford wasn't our client,\" said a partner at the firm. Wallis was unavailable for comment."
