  "content": "After a decade spent snapping celebrities in the British drizzle, Nick Stern moved to Hollywood for a \"bit of sunshine\". Seven months on, he has become a minor celebrity himself after making a public protest at the way the paparazzi are hounding Britney Spears. His resignation from the LA-based photo agency Splash last month and subsequent appearances on TV - shot in silhouette to protect his anonymity - have highlighted the no-holds-barred behaviour of photographers scrapping for the shot that could be worth a fortune. When Spears was taken to hospital for a mental health evaluation two weeks ago, she did so under the gaze of about 200 photographers and TV camera crews. The police-led evacuation plan cost an estimated $25,000. Stern was unsurprised by the tumultuous scene, having spent months following the singer's every move. The seasoned British tabloid photographer says: \"I'm used to following celebs, sitting outside their houses, and sometimes it gets pretty heated. But it's when there's complete disregard for everybody's safety, when you've got Sunset Boulevard, which is three lanes that goes on for miles, and you've got a convoy of 30 cars travelling at 60 miles per hour in a 35 zone, jumping red lights, that's when it's difficult to see any positive way out of this. \"People say to me, 'What about OJ, the way he was chased?' The attention was as intense but there was a story. Here it's just a day-to-day watch and it's a pack of 20 people every single day which, to me, is not journalism.\" He has warned that someone - maybe Spears herself - could be killed in the ongoing mayhem. The 43-year-old decided to take a break from his own photo agency, First Look, and relocate to the West Coast in August 2007. \"I was looking at the type of work I would be doing and I had my doubts but I thought, 'give it a go, bit of sunshine'.\" The move coincided with a turning point in Spears's turbulent life. Her behaviour became increasingly more desperate as she lost custody of her children and became, in the immortal words of the online gossip colossus Perez Hilton, \"the gift that keeps on giving\". The US publication Portfolio estimates that a photo of Spears can be worth anything from $250 for a quick snap to $500,000 for the \"bald Britney\" pictures. The photo agency X17, which has a team trailing her 24/7, estimates that Spears accounts for a third of its revenue. Every time the troubled singer made an aimless trip to Starbucks or a tanning salon or a Beverly Hills hotel, Stern was part of a jostling pack of paparazzi who trailed her relentlessly, chased her through traffic, helped her change tyres and documented her every incoherent move. \"My resignation wasn't part of some campaigning issue. I just wasn't happy following Britney since the first minute I did it,\" he says. What about those of the cold-hearted opinion that Spears's lust for attention made her a co-conspirator in her own plight? \"People say she phones the paparazzi to let them know what she's up to, which I believe is true, so you quite cynically put that up as your own defence. But there comes a time when you look at what you're doing, you look at how it may be damaging somebody and that's when you need to look at your own conscience, which is what I've done by resigning because it was on my conscience.\" As much as Stern's concern for his former prey seems genuine, his defection from the extended Spears deathwatch could also be attributed to his distaste for spending endless days in a huddle with the neophytes who have taken up his trade without serving an apprenticeship. The blogs that refresh every 12 minutes, the nightly network infotainment shows, the anachronistic-but-still-kicking weekly tabloids: there have never been so many outlets happy to feed the ravenous national appetite for even the scrawniest morsel of celebrity gossip. This has given Los Angeles an underclass - the instant paparazzi - whose numbers are beginning to rival those of the city's vast army of unemployed actors. \"There has been a sea change over the last five years,\" says Ben Everstead, co-owner of the National Photo Group agency. \"Technology is such that you don't have to be that technically skilled as a photographer to go out and get a decent picture of Britney Spears. It's not that there's that many people making great money but there's a whole lot of people making good money, and that's when you get the cowboy element.\" But Stern didn't expect to be leaving London for the Wild West. \"There's no regulation, no control as to who can get into it,\" he says of his fellow reckless drivers and privacy-invaders. \"You can go into any high street store, buy a laptop and a computer and call yourself a photographer. They're not trained. There's no camaraderie between you and them. They keep their heads down, won't even shake your hand if you walk up to introduce yourself. I'm sure that's why agencies hire those sort of people because they're so aggressive, they've got nothing to lose. As long as a picture is worth a high value, anything goes. Dignity \"But there are also agencies - Splash, for example - that do employ good, mainly British, photographers with a journalistic background. We're trying to keep some sort of dignity and professionalism in what we do, but you're up against people who are just breaking the rules.\" Fighting talk. But talk that finds little sympathy from Everstead. \"I don't have a high tolerance for paparazzi who whine about other paparazzi. If you are offended by the way that people ply their trade out here, you're free to go back and do it properly in England,\" he says. LA is host to numerous UK photo agencies such as Splash, WNN and Final Pixx, and it is increasingly rare to spot a C-lister stumbling out of an after-hours club without an accompanying chorus of \"Over 'ere, love. Give us a smile, then!\" So why are there so many? \"Because if you're going to photograph celebs, LA is the Mecca,\" says Everstead. \"I would imagine there's probably not as many people to go after in the UK, plus our weather's better.\" Of the strange interaction between the star and her paps, Stern says: \"It's quite bizarre the way that relationship has developed. The only people who have been through it with her and are still there are the paparazzi. They've been there, some of them, for 10 years, day in day out. She knows them on first-name terms, she knows what cars they drive, she knows who they work for, so, to her, it's the only stability that's there. They're the only people who are always there for her so she probably looks on them as her friends.\" One British paparazzo, Adnan Ghalib, took the relationship a stage further by becoming Spears's boyfriend. So if Stern hadn't been paid to spend seven months living and breathing Britney Spears and another few weeks discussing his reasons for bailing out of her story, would he have had any interest in her? He doesn't pause. \"None whatsoever. She means absolutely nothing to me.\""
