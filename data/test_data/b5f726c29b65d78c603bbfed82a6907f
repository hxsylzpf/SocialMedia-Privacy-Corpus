  "content": "Dear XXXX I am writing to request all the information to which I am entitled to under section 7(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998. In order to assist you with this request, I am outlining some of the areas and occasions on which your organisation may have compiled information on me. As you will understand, this may not be a definite list of such occasions. (Give a description of how you have come into contact with the organisation - the more specific, the better) I would be interested in any discussion or opinions expressed within your organisation of my person, reputation, character, history or behaviour, actual or perceived. I should make it clear that this request should also cover all or any other information you may hold. I hope that you will be able to comprehensively search all your records. The definition of \"personal data\" under the new Act covers both facts and opinions about myself as an individual, as well as information regarding the intentions of your organisation towards myself as an individual. This request should therefore cover any internal/external memos, emails, faxes and any other correspondence or readily accessible data held on computer by your organisation which could be classified as \"personal data\" under the 1998 Data Protection Act. This covers both manual and electronic data. I enclose a photocopy of (proof of your address, such as gas/electricity/telephone bill) as confirmation of the above being my home address. I have also enclosed a photocopy of my passport (or similar, such as driving licence) and a recent photograph of myself to aid your identification. I understand that under the Act, I should be entitled to a response within 40 days. I would be grateful if you could confirm in writing that you have received this request. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours,"
