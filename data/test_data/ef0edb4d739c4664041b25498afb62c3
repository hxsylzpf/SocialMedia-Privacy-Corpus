  "content": "Silver surfers are nothing new, but this one is rather special: Kirk Douglas is officially the oldest celebrity blogger on MySpace and has made it his personal mission to try and inspire \"the younger generation in the hope that they will be able to deal with the mess they inherit\". Douglas has been blogging since March last year when he started plugging his new book. But he quickly moved on to explaining why African-Americans deserve an apology for the slave trade, defying Senator McCarthy's blacklist in the 1950s and why he thinks a bilingual America would be a bad thing. And he was euphoric after Barack Obama's win: \"I'm very happy that our country has made such a historical move. The world will be astounded that the United States has elected a black man to lead them. I never imagined that such an event would be possible during my lifetime. I think our country will now go on a course that permits us to work with other countries.\" The comments on his posts are mostly very reverential, but he says he enjoys all of them whether positive or negative. \"I express my opinion, and I tell them that they don't have to agree with me because it's a free country,\" Douglas told . \"And their answers are very, very interesting.\" He's racked up 4,414 friends, lists his favourite films as \"Champion, Spartacus, Paths of Glory and Lonely are the Brave (I just happen to be in these movies)\" and as for who he'd like to meet? \"Angelina Jolie, when she comes back from Vietnam and if my wife lets me...\""
