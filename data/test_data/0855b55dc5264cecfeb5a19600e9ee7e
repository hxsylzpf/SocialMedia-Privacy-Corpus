  "content": "The precept that there is nothing so trivial that it ought not to be taken seriously has suffered a bottling from social media, which gives licence to the inane to go public and express post-literate banalities and torrents of greetings card treacle, thus revealing an arid void where their brain should be. This is without taking into account the exciting opportunities afforded for expressions of baleful spite worthy of those witch-like stalwarts of French thrillers, les corbeaux, anonymous letter writers whose lives are all grassing-up in green ink, restless curtains and asperity. The difference, of course, is that the poison pens of Twitter folk and their ilk shun murky anonymity in favour of whimsical pseudonymity, so very nearly convinced are they of their self-righteousness. According to a probably mendacious soviet of pollsters, statisticians and PRs, the UK has more subscribers to social media than any other European country. Only the Netherlands is reckoned to have a higher proportion. Broadly speaking, the more northern, the more climatically inclement the country, the greater that proportion. Long winters, home and hearth, wrap up snugly: the decor of the future that's already with us is not soaring megastructures, holidays on the moon, monorails and geodesic domes. It is a teenager's wireless bedroom. Still, there exists, too, half, at least, of the UK's population that has not yet succumbed to this imitation of life, peculiar in being both atomised and collective, both overt and latent. The word virtual is inapt. Parallel is more the ticket. Whatever the moniker, social media is not perhaps as triumphant over primary reality as its far from unbiased collarless panjandrums and slaveringly dependent devotees are prone to claim. There is, after all, not that much that a writer can say in 140 characters: about, indeed, you might hazard, as much as the same writer can say in the 10,000 characters that Twitter is thinking of proposing as a limit to tweets. To blame social media for dumkopf outpourings, whether fond or hateful, is like blaming green ink for the existence of venomous gossips or Clinton Cards for saccharine delinquency. Such media unquestionably provides some worrying clots with an unprecedented instrument. But then so did the telephone, the railway, internal combustion, photography, laudanum, mirror glass, fire, television, gunpowder, the crossbow, distillation, the slingshot, the bridge high across a foaming ghyll. Stuff enters human lives. Some of it sticks around, some of it mutates and matures down the years, some of it is rendered redundant, some of it dissipates entirely. Unless it is binned (Betamax, Sinclair C5, Steve Jobs's several duff wheezes) we can also be sure that what was revolutionary yesterday is accepted with time: the old avant garde is today's establishment orthodoxy. The exceptional is rendered ordinary. It is absorbed, taken for granted, hardly noticed: a cardigan and carpet slippers await everything, so to speak. It is added to humankind's crazes and fashions which are cumulative: nothing needs to make way for the next craze; there is infinite space for another means of transport, another sort of visual stimulation, another school of aggressive begging, a further variety of black ops. Stratum is piled upon stratum. The lower layers of the cassata do not buckle under the weight of those heaped above them. And what endures is unforeseeable. The apparently ephemeral persists. The self-proclaimingly sustainable withers. The future is untellable: futurology is an unintentionally comic pseudo-science, hardly more reliable than haruspication of entrails or counting magpies, and economists nearly always get it wrong: Chancellors passim; Keynes's confident blindness to investment in real estate. Is an app called Vine liable to change our lives, and the lives of our great-grandchildren (should such beings exist after the soon-to-be-scheduled Rapture). No. Absolutely not. Will the very diminutive \"app\" be current 10 years hence? Moot. Vine's logo-font is gauche, the work of a hamfisted typographer. Its content is crass; its comedy (inappropriate word) is so far the other side of infantile it might still be in utero. But as soon as you adumbrate thus, you are beset with misgivings. What if...? What if its exhaustingly unfunny mouth-breathers grow up to finally achieve adulthood at the age of, say, 40 and embrace a different humourlessness, that of conceptual art? This is not an entirely improbable prospect, for this app's provenance is to be found in the milieu of curatorial supremacy and dizzyingly witless installations where a six-second video loops like Vine's are de rigueur and, quite probably, \"performative\" (an adjective stripped of meaning in artspeak). Were those loops to follow Twitter's example and expand, to increase to 60 seconds then to 60 minutes, we would again witness the normalisation and absorption of once-radical technology. The potential ramifications, or unintended consequences, of Instagram's development are more fascinating. Of course, this pictorial \"service\" feeds fantasies and delusions, is a default tool for narcissists, and offers its users a platform from which to deliver more or less bogus simulations of themselves, not least to themselves \u2013 delusion is conditional on self-delusion. But as a race we have always found methods that enable us to mildly abase ourselves with generally harmless ignobility, mischievous dishonesty, venial duplicity. The capacity of technology \u2013 gizmos, gadgets and bits of kit \u2013 to amend human mores is exaggerated by both its champions and its detractors. It is, rather, the bits of kits themselves that are susceptible to mutation, to a versatility discovered by chance. Photography's slow shift from recondite magic to quotidian banality changed painting for ever. What had thitherto been the primary means of visual representation reacted variously. It mimicked photography with microscopic intensity and petitpoint (Brett, Dyce, Grimshaw). More usually, it blithely ignored photography or challenged its veracity, finding new ways of inventing and recording, the old familiar route that passes through all the isms with their competing claims on reality, meaning, truth etc. Now, that quotidian banality: it did not fulfil its base promise until a decade and a half ago when it speeded up with digital democratisation and no film to be tiresomely sent for developing, a feature previously offered only by Polaroid whose potential Joe Orton was, typically, among the first to discern. Were he alive today \u2013 83! \u2013 he would surely rejoice in the precious freedom enjoyed by gifted footballers to diffuse what can only be called \"groinies\" across the world. To achieve perfection may take up to 150 shots; that's four rolls of 35mm film, probably 10 of 120mm. Digital takes the effort out of exhibitionism. Instagram seems to go even further. Its promotion of arguments about empowerment, boosting self-validation, security and, on the other hand, its reputation for fostering insecurity, rupturing self-esteem, causing envy and creating brainharm will no doubt provide agonised commentators with fodder for, oh, months to come. But in their psychoanalytical earnest they miss the point. Which is that this app possesses a morally neutral aesthetic potential that has yet to be exhumed. It is that rare thing in the parallel world, a bit of kit that is reticent about its powers. Its simpering, homely PR is wedded to the unambitious idea that it enables you to bore the entire globe, rather than just your mates and colleagues, with hundreds, instead of dozens, of larky holiday snaps and goofy poses. These are limits, informal rules \u2013 which are, of course, to be bent and broken. Why use such clever, versatile technology in the service of banal \"fun\", threadbare \"tradition\"? Excuse this sentence: digital is not the analogue of analogue. Instagram is a tool that might be used to create a new photography that shuns that art's multiple traditions. It's not as though each frame you shoot burns a hole in your pocket. Frugality is not in order. I have no idea what that new photography will be but I am sure that if we have an end in mind when we begin we'll simply return to where we were.
