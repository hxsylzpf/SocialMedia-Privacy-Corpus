  "content": "Valley watchers report a disturbance in the Twitter force. During some (of the fairly regular) downtime last night, some users said they spotted some ads on the system - though to be fair they could just have spotted a few of the spam messages that seem to be seeping into the network. Photo: lu_lu on Flickr. Some rights reserved. Duncan Riley on TechCrunch is characteristically blunt about it: \"Occasional ads in the Twitter timeline, in a similar fashion to what Twitteriffic users currently see (Twitteriffic runs their own ads on the free version) seems like the only real way to monetise Twitter, aside for premium subscriptions. The only question remaining is how Twitter users will accept the move after a two year free ride.\" When I talked to Ev about this in September (and yes, of course, his ideas may have changed) he wanted to explore a different from of advertising on the service that would be less invasive. He talked about having two types of user: the regular, individual, free users and then corporate users who'd pay to reach those early adopting, very engaged Twitterers. Apple would pay, for example, to have a channel while users could follow them for free. OK - Apple was a bad example because they have zero interest in talking to anyone. But you get the idea. Whether you use Twitter or not, the bigger issue is that this is a very powerful and very compelling social network for the people that use it regularly. The dynamics of Twitter (and we have to allow it some grace in its early days) is that it takes months to build up, or curate, if you like, a really useful, relevant and manageable group. Investing that time and energy into something creates a sense of ownership, and though the service does have to be commercialised at some point it will be a very delicate process - that's something I think Ev Williams and the guys will be extremely aware of. Update: Ev Williams appropriately Twittered that the TechCrunch story is wrong: Ev Williams: \"Odd @techcrunch post about Twitter ads: http://rurl.org/o8a - completely lacks evidence and even states 'There were no ads evident...'?\" Mike Arrington: \"@ev always good to see a major entrepreneur mad at us when I wake up. What did Duncan do now?\" Ev Williams: \"@TechCrunch just, the statement in the headline is not only wrong, but hard to understand how he came to. i'm cool w/random speculation tho!\" Still, it's a question of when Twitter monetises itself, not if."
