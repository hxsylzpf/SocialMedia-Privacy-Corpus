  "content": "Financial inclusion should make transferring money, saving money, and taking out small loans more secure and accessible for people in remote communities. But over the years some financial inclusion projects have exploited the very people they were designed to protect. In South Africa, post-apartheid microcredit schemes were meant to help the disenfranchised but pushed them further into debt. In Bosnia, concerns were also raised about the unintended consequences of increasing access to credit after a substantial increase in child labour was reported in businesses opened through microloans. Today more programmes than ever are being designed to reach those without a formal bank account, so a discussion about whose responsibility it is to protect these new consumers seems timely. Firstly, consumers need more information on the risks and what is expected of them so they can make informed choices. Yet, the levels of financial literacy among consumers at the bottom of the pyramid has not caught up with the pace of the services being offered to them. We need to address where, and to who, consumers should go to for information and advice, and how it should be relayed. Secondly, at an industry level, stronger regulation is needed. According to Hugh Sinclair, chief operational officer of Alliance Microfinance, \"independent regulators need to be empowered along with the ongoing expansion of financial inclusion. The current system is not protecting the people it's designed to empower\". But when financial products serve customers well, government workers can receive their full salary without a middleman taking a cut; women get increased independence with their own account from which money can't be swallowed up by their family; and migrant workers can transfer money home quickly and without a high transaction fee. Is responsible financial inclusion just up to the banks? Or do schools, universities, government, the private sector and NGOs all have a part to play in encouraging responsible money management? If so, how can they collaborate and who foots the bill? And how can we ensure appropriate consumer protection, but also support innovation, competition and sustainability? Join our expert panel on Thursday 30 October from 2-4pm GMT to discuss how to deliver financial inclusion programmes and products more responsibly.
