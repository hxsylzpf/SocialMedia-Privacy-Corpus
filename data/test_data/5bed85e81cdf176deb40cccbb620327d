  "content": "On Thursday, Twitter, Facebook and Blackberry maker RIM will meet the home secretary, Theresa May, to discuss how they can help stop rioting and violent disorder. But should social media companies take more responsibility for monitoring how their networks are used during unrest? What is the right response from social networks to violence and riots, when their platforms are used by the perpetrators? We asked our readers, Facebook and Twitter followers for their thoughts. Should Facebook, Twitter and BlackBerry Messenger be restricted or shut down in times of civil disorder? There was strong reaction from many readers against imposing temporary blackouts on social networks during riots. Many asked how the UK could criticise other regimes for restricting access to social media but still court the idea, while other commenters suggested that those using social media to organise disobedience would find new ways to circumvent any blocking. Bluthund writes: I am wholly against the censoring of social networks during times of unrest because they also help to get information out that could possibly save lives. To me it would be akin to the Government shutting down telephone networks during times of unrest ... No, leave social networks open at all times and if idiots use them for criminal means then these networks would co-operate with the police in handing over details so that arrests are made where appropriate. This way it defends the rights of the majority while still enabling the police to get criminals who abuse our social networks. @RuwaydaMustafah on Twitter agrees: UK Govt ministers are forgetting that social networking helped keep people indoors while there were riots &amp; updated them. @Roborovski says the government's focus is wrong: Government focus on social messaging clamp-down wrong - 24 hour news channels played far greater role in spread of riots Commenter Porgythecat warns of the wider implications of such proposals: How long before Twitter or Facebook gets shut down during a major environmental protest, or worse, Twitter and Facebook start self censoring in order to avoid government regulation. But Barnes651 strongly disagrees: I'd rather social media were shut down if their being shut down would actually help stop looting. I'd rather have a temporary dictator to instill order than have the mess created by thousands of looters. Can all three networks, and in particular the private Blackberry Messenger, do more to help the police - removing groups and pages that incite violence, or deleting incendiary tweets? Commenter Chumbaniya responds: The answer here is yes, unquestionably. Does that have any bearing on whether they should do more? I don't believe so. The capacity to restrict information is there, but that doesn't mean it should be used. Why is there such a mistrust of social networking amongst the older generation that they are so prepared to deny users the same freedom they would unquestioningly expect for the communication methods they favour? Freedom of speech should be independent of medium. I would have thought that goes without saying. @carlybag on Twitter adds: The shutting down of twitter in times of 'uprising' further criminalises right 2 protest, totally against freedom of speech Should Facebook, Twitter and RIM give the police privileged access to their networks at times of civil disorder? On Twitter @paulasantos sees a partnership: Police should work closely with social networks to track riots @Jade_e_e elaborates: #riotresponse no 2privileged access 4police, yes2realtime collaboration. Social networks could possibly monitor accounts inciting violence. @johnroashton says there's an argument for privileged access: Police should be given access to BB network and should have the power to suspend certain accounts during times of crisis. Twitter had minimal involvement, but same principle: the Met should be able to suspend certain accounts temporarily. Should mobile phone companies monitor phone calls or texts sent in a riot situation? An outright no from Kevin S on Facebook: Their only responsibility is to respond to any requests from the police for specific information after the fact. And from @skwashd on Twitter: Unless the police have a warrant/subpoena they have no right to any records. #riotresponse or any other response. Commenter crazyjane adds: It would need severe restriction so that they don't breach the privacy of other users. My fear is that this could easily drift into general surveillance of 'undesirables' (aka any protest group). But a more nuanced response from alistairFrog: If people incite crime or violence on social networks, then the companies should co-operate to help track down and charge the offenders after the event. Censorship of social media is no more acceptable than any other form of censorship. Should writing a few words on a computer or mobile at home be as serious as encouraging people to disorder in the streets? TitusX writes: What happened to the old idea of innocent untill proven guilty? None of anyone's communication should be scanned or read untill they're suspected of doing something that breaks the law. When they break it (as in the riots right infront of the police) they should be arrested and charged. The very idea that we should be talking about infringing people's right to privacy in anyway is a worrying step. Its the thin end of the wedge being forever knocked just a bit further. Punishments for crimes should be relative to the crime, not react to the current national feeling of the people. We seem to have 4 years jail for trying to incite a riot or a few weeks/months for taking part in one, it doesn't add up. Writing on Facebook, Charlie F adds: The issue here is where the buck stops. How much power will authorities have to snoop around social networks? What will constitute suspicious behaviour? Will it only apply to people organising actual riots - what about protests? On Twitter, @Chroliver says: Incitement online cud b as serious as in public-maybe more so cos of increased reach of FB but circumstances shud b considered Commenter obione takes a long-term view: Social Media and large scale unedited electronic media is still new. We just need to be able to guide these new media for general good of the public. Adapting the technology will remain a challenge in the short term for some environments. However, use of any medium to incite violent and unlawful destruction and behaviors should be handled appropriately. The appropriateness depends on the culture and governmental system. All tools need proper cultivation for greater good, including Social Media. Great tools remain great when they are not used for criminal activities. Thanks for all your contributions."
