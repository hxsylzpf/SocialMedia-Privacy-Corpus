  "content": "Facebook will hire an extra 500 workers in the UK when it opens a new headquarters in London, increasing its British workforce by half. The US social media company will employ 1,500 people in London next year when it opens its office, which is under construction in Fitzrovia, close to the West End. Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook's European head, will announce the expansion at the CBI's conference on Monday. She said many of the jobs would be highly skilled roles. Lady Mendelsohn said: \"The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook's story. We came to London in 2007 with just a handful of people. By the end of next year we will have opened a new HQ and plan to employ 1,500 people.\" Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, said the announcement was a further vote of confidence in London as a tech centre \u2013 a position called into question by the vote to leave the EU. Google said last week it would go ahead with plans to build a new headquarters in King's Cross, central London, creating 3,000 jobs. Amazon is leaving its UK base in Slough, Berkshire, after 16 years to move to a 15-floor office on the outskirts of the City next year. Khan said: \"The capital's vibrant tech scene is the envy of Europe, and Facebook's continuing commitment is another sign that London is open to talent, innovation and entrepreneurship from all four corners of the world.\"",
