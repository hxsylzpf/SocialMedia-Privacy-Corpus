  "content": "Going up Appletinis An early noughties revival we can really get down with. Diane Lockhart's lipstick The grande dame of The Good Wife wears the perfect shade of coral at all times. All the more reason to want to be her when we grow up. 'Ace' It's the new awesome. (NB never, ever \"aces\".) Sunspel kilt Kilts are having such a moment and the understated version from JW Anderson's final collection for Sunspel is perfect. Jessica Williams from the Daily Show Comedy crush du jour. Tardiness Forget being fashionably late: Katy Perry was booed after turning up 50 minutes behind time to perform at a Moschino show. Going down BFF selfies All that head-to-head proximity is increasing head lice among teens. Eww. Mr Bigglesworth The villain's pet everyone's talking about is Cashew, the guinea pig from House Of Cards. Socks Feit say their shoes \u2013 a kind of grown-up skater style \u2013 should be worn only sans socks. Since they are our summer shoe of choice, bare feet are the only option. Dirty burgers It's all about steamed dumplings now, as served at Flesh &amp; Buns (don't let the gory name put you off).",
