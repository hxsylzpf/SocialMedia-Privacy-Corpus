  "content": "Over the past few years a proliferation of new Indigenous voices have appeared in the news media, many enabled by a combination of new media and information technologies like smartphones and popular social media platforms. These new black voices are located in diverse places and participate in the news sphere in diverse forms. Many have been assisted in no small part by the @IndigenousX Twitter account. Many others have emerged from Facebook community or group pages. There are also many new new media outlets to write for, such as Guardian Australia, Buzzfeed, New Matilda and Junkee. There's also the persistent audience interest in Indigenous-relevant blogs and much more recently, Indigenous-focused Medium pages. Once upon a time, Murdoch's Australian was seen as the news outlet most dedicated to reporting Aboriginal affairs. That view may still be held by some observers, but how many Indigenous reporters and commentators are writing about Indigenous matters for the Australian presently? The bulk of Indigenous writers and news audiences are certainly looking elsewhere to obtain their information and the trend is towards online consumption via \"social\" at the expense of all forms of \"legacy\" media. It's not only the Australian that's on the wane as a point of access for blackfellas getting their news. NITV \u2013 an Indigenous-specific television channel \u2013 continues to struggle in terms of audience numbers and, arguably, relevance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It's been a similar story with the ABC, which is commonly regarded by Indigenous people as too \"white\" despite that organisation's ongoing efforts to diversify its workforce. The Aboriginal commentator, Celeste Liddle, has recently written about blackfellas shifting towards new media and black-produced news content specifically, as have a raft of media and journalism academics, including Bronwyn Carlson, Michael Meadows, Kerry McCallum, Lisa Waller and Tanja Dreher. Much has been said about the opportunity the new digital technologies provide for realising a genuine path towards self-determination and self-empowerment in a \"mediatised\" contemporary society. The Indigenous public sphere \u2013 or spheres, according to Meadows \u2013 is being reinvigorated. But is the innovative technology enough? Can it alone determine better outcomes for Indigenous participant-users? One grounded theory for the drop in Indigenous interest in these \"old media\" news outlets boils down to a matter of representation. Late last month, an Indigenous-led roundtable convened at the Wheeler Centre in Melbourne's State Library to discuss how to improve the quality and quantity of Indigenous news in Australia's mainstream news organisations. Over the course of a day, Indigenous and non-Indigenous news industry professionals, media and political communications academics, artists, writers and activists identified the problem issues and discussed pragmatic strategies for fixing them. Representation of Indigenous people in senior positions within \"big\" media organisations was a key component in the problems and strategies discussed. Put simply, we need more black producers and editors. It's been 25 years since the recommendations of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody were tabled in 1991. Within that paper was a set of recommendations that specifically concerned the media. Clause (b) of recommendation 205 encouraged all media organisations \"to develop codes and policies relating to the presentation of Aboriginal issues, the establishment of monitoring bodies\", and the implementation of \"training and employment programs for Aboriginal employees in all classifications.\" Between then and now we've seen a diversification of the newsroom through Indigenous cadet journalist and cadet production-crew initiatives. And although the attrition rate is not yet known, there are more blackfellas on the screen, behind the camera, and in the byline. But after a quarter of a century, how many are senior editors or senior producers? In 2015, in my role as an Indigenous researcher for the Centre for Advancing Journalism I was involved in a preliminary audit of Indigenous-owned and/or produced news media outlets. The audit yielded over 150 sources. The identified outlets ranged across \"legacy\" media (in terms of both print and broadcast), new media and social media. Currently, we are developing an online database and mobile application that will, in its simplest form, aggregate these diverse Indigenous news sources and filter relevant information towards Indigenous users. We aim to develop the database and application with industry partners to redefine how Indigenous journalism is practiced and valued. We hope that this may contribute to restructuring what I describe (borrowing from Bruno Latour and Linda Tuhiwai Smith) as \"colonised media systems\". The day after the Indigenous-led roundtable on media representation, I moderated a panel as part of the New News public conference called Not Just News to Us: Disruption and Indigenous New Media. The panellists and I discussed the ongoing difficulty that Indigenous new media outlets like IndigenousX face in obtaining sufficient funding, despite their relevance to blackfellas, and more to the point, despite the vibrant interest in them from dominant research institutions. We discussed the importance of participating in the dominant public sphere, improving institutional listening practices, critical social pedagogy, and the concept of \"infiltration\". Twenty minutes after the conclusion of the panel, new ABC managing director Michelle Guthrie announced in her New News keynote address that Stan Grant, Indigenous adviser to the government on recognition, would be appointed editor of Indigenous affairs coverage. Perhaps surprisingly, I remain ambivalent about the appointment. Key to all of the aspects discussed at the roundtable event and in the panel session was genuine representation and diversity of voice and perspective. As one wag chirped in the Twitterverse: \"Awesome there are so many more media jobs being created for blackfellas now. Shame Stan Grant has all of them.\" \"Our stories, our way\" \u2013 each week, a new guest hosts the @IndigenousX Twitter account to discuss topics of interest to them as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. Produced with assistance of Guardian Australia staff."
