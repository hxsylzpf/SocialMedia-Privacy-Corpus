  "content": "Whether you love it or hate it, there's no denying that the new cultural obsession with documenting pictures of our food on social media channels shows no sign of abating. For some social media naysayers, this behaviour is rude/pathetic/tragic in equal measure, while for those who have wholeheartedly embraced the new social media era, it is an integral part of their online lives. With pictures usually accompanied with a cacophony of hashtags including #foodporn, #tweetwhatyoueat, #instafood ... the list goes on. There are lots of theories about why people like to share pictures of food. In most cases, people are simply documenting their daily lives, of which mealtimes may be a highlight. As eating is one of society's most essential communal activities, sharing food photos is a natural extension of this in a digital age. Some simply love beautiful \"food art\" shots, while others suggest that food has become a status symbol, and by sharing a photo of a meal, particularly from a high end restaurant, you raise your social media hierarchy. No matter the reasons why we share photos of food, we do. Americans are said to be sharing more than 50m photos a day on Instagram alone. And we're clocking up a significant number over here, too. But it's all a bit of harmless fun, right? Wrong. Well, if you're a French chef that is. In recent weeks, a flurry of stories have emerged from the Michelin starred establishments of France, which indicate that certain chefs are fed up with patrons snapping photographs of their deluxe dishes and posting them online. Gilles Goujon, from the three-starred L'Auberge du vieux puits in the south of France, has stated in an interview with news website France TV that foodtography is not only poor etiquette but he believes that when his dishes appear online, it takes away \"a little bit of my intellectual property\". Another chef in La Madelaine-sous-Montreuil has also included a \"no camera\" policy on his menus for this reason. Many of you may already be rolling your eyes at the fact that it is French chefs complaining about intellectual property in relation to their food, however, we can't just pin the blame on the French. US chef RJ Cooper, from Rogue 24 in Washington DC, has made similar claims on Eater, stating: \"They publish food photos without your consent, which is taking intellectual property away from the restaurant. And also, generally, the photographs are terrible. \"If you're publishing something in a public forum without written consent, that's problematic.\" But not all chefs are so unwelcoming of the craze. Justin Llewellyn is the head chef at the award-winning Laguna Kitchen &amp; Bar at Park Plaza Cardiff, and he believes social media has boosted the dining experience and business in general: \"Those chefs complaining about breaches to their intellectual property are fighting a losing battle. You can't copyright food or food ideas, and even if you could I wouldn't want to. Social networks are the new word of mouth. It's the new advertising. You have to move with the times.\" Without going into the legal details, most IP lawyers would be nonplussed about the question of intellectual property and food pictures. Unfortunately for the chefs in question, a plate of food is hard to substantiate as a protected \"work\", and while a chef may often be described as an artist, the profession does not enjoy such strong protection as those artists who wield paintbrushes. In any event, copyright belongs to those taking the photos rather than the chef or the restaurant owner. At the root of the problem is the fact that most of these chefs are upset because they think someone might steal their ideas. However, the majority realise they have no argument and to date no claims have been raised by restaurants who believe their offerings have been devalued by exposure on social media. In any case, our #foodporn pictures show no sign of dwindling. Whether the chefs like it or not.
