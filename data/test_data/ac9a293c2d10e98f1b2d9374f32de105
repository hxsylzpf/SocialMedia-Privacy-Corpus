  "content": "This Thursday, renowned journalist Fred Pearce publishes his definitive account of the story of the emails between climate scientists that were exposed online last year. To mark the new book, The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth About Global Warming, Pearce will be online to answer your questions from 12-1pm on Thursday 17 June. The book's genesis was in a unique mutualisation experiment we ran in February, inviting protagonists in the story to reply online. This is your chance to ask any questions about the story of the climate emails, from how the science community handled the incident, to public belief in climate change and the imminent findings of the independent investigation by the University of East Anglia, whose Climatic Research Unit was at the heart of the furore. Post your questions below and Pearce will do his best to answer as many as possible between 12 and 1pm on Thursday. Please only post questions related to the hacked climate emails \u2013 anything else will be marked off-topic."
