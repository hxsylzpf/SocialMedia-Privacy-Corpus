  "content": "The Senate intelligence committee, led by Dianne Feinstein, this week released a long-awaited report on the CIA's torture program. The documents revealed, in brutal detail, an extensive history of abuse, mismanagement, and obfuscation at the CIA. On Thursday, the CIA director, John Brennan, offered his first public response to the bombshell report. He opened a press briefing at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, by invoking the horrors of 9/11, and while he acknowledged some of failings revealed in the report, he stood firmly behind his agency's staff and mission. Feinstein wasn't about to let his words go uncontested. She (or her communications staff) fired up her official Twitter account and used it to rebut Brennan's statements in real time with the hashtag #ReadTheReport."
