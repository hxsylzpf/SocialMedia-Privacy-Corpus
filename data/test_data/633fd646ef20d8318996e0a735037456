  "content": "A police helicopter had to be scrambled to a party that got out of control last week. The party was said to have been widely advertised on Facebook, and the teenage host was unable to cope with the unexpected guests. This disastrous end to festivities follows a long line of parties that have been shut down by police after they've been overrun by gatecrashers. Even the royal family aren't immune \u2013 in 2003, Aaron Barschak managed to get into Prince William's birthday celebrations and cause a commotion before being apprehended. Have you ever hosted a calamitous event? Have you held a party only for nobody to turn up? Have you ever been to a celebration that the police have had to close down? Tell us your party mishaps, and festive disappointments."
