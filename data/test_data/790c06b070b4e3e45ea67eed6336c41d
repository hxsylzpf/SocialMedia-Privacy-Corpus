  "content": "It should come as no surprise that mobile gaming is a lucrative business now, for the games at the top of the charts at least. Now there are some more figures claiming to prove just how lucrative. Digital goods measurement firm Superdata has published some year-end gaming stats, including the suggestion that were three mobile games grossing more than $1bn in 2014: Candy Crush Saga at $1bn, Puzzle &amp; Dragons at $1.5bn and Clash of Clans at a startling $1.8bn. Mobile games industry website PocketGamer.biz adds a note of scepticism to its coverage of the story, noting that Clash of Clans' publisher Supercell reported revenues of $892m in 2013: \"Now, if we assume that Clash of Clans generated all of Supercell's 2013 revenues, its year-on-year growth for 2014 would be 100%. This is a minimum figure. Conversely assuming Clash of Clans generated the half of Supercell's 2013 revenues, 2014 revenue of $1.8 billion suggests year-on-year growth in the order of 300 percent. This is the maximum.\" Even so, the growth of mobile and its top grossing games in particular \u2013 especially if Clash of Clans' revenues surged in Japan, which was the driver behind Puzzle &amp; Dragon's income \u2013 means you certainly can't rule the $1.8bn figure out. What do you think: are you surprised that the top mobile games might be making this much money? Are they proving that this isn't a bubble, or will these games be replaced by even more lucrative titles in the year(s) to come? The comments section is open for your thoughts. What else is bubbling in technology today? Some links to discuss: Call for more openness from antivirus companies Security expert Bruce Schneier says they were tracking the \"likely US backed\" Regin malware for years without telling. \"My guess is that none of the companies wanted to go public with an incomplete picture. Unlike criminal malware, government-grade malware can be hard to figure out. It's much more elusive and complicated... That is not a good enough excuse, though.\" YouTube in a 'fire drill' over Facebook and Vessel There may be a chequebook war coming for online video creators: and no, I don't mean book publishers looking for the next Zoella. \"Google is offering some of its top video makers bonuses to sign multiyear deals in which they agree to post content exclusively on YouTube for a time before putting it on a rival service,\" claims the Wall Street Journal, noting that Facebook and startup Vessel are looking to tempt top YouTubers to post on their sites first instead. Hachette to sell books on Twitter Physical books, I mean, not ebooks. The publisher is working with e-commerce firm Gumroad on an experiment to sell three printed tomes \u2013 by musician Amanda Palmer, astronaut Chris Hadfield and satirical bible The Onion \u2013 with people able to buy directly from tweets by their authors. \"With so much of our book marketing done socially now, in-stream Twitter purchasing is a natural next step,\" said Hachette boss Michael Pietsch. And it doesn't hurt, surely, to have one more alternative to Amazon. Telegram messaging app claims 50m users Secure messaging app Telegram has announced some milestones. \"Over 1 billion messages are delivered daily. Telegram now has 50 million active users, adding 1 million new signups each week,\" explained a blog post. \"This is insane. 16 months ago Telegram didn't exist, and today it is used by millions of people all over the world \u2013 from Spain and Brazil to Malaysia and South Korea. We spent $0 on advertising...\" What else? The comments section is open for your thoughts on the stories above, as well as your recommendations for other stories worth reading today.",
