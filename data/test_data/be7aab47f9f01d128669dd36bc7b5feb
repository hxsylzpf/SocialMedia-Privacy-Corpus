  "content": "The first cut of Les Mis\u00e9rables, a new screen adaptation of the stage musical from The King's Speech director Tom Hooper, debuted over the weekend at a variety of US venues in special screenings for critics, punters and \u2013 most crucially perhaps \u2013 awards voters. The Daily Beast was quick to label it the new front-runner for the best picture Oscar, with critic Marlow Stern saying: Hooper's film is one of the most joyous, epic experiences you'll have in a cinema this year. It's vaulted past other contenders like Lincoln, Argo, and Silver Linings Playbook in the Best Picture race, and proves that the director's Oscar-winning previous effort, The King's Speech, was no fluke. The editor of awards site In Contention was similarly effusive. Hathaway wins. GOD. I wept. Film's a triumph. They're on their feet here. NYC crowd ate...it...up. #lesmiserables \u2014 Kristopher Tapley (@kristapley) November 23, 2012 EW.com's pundit Anthony Breznican sang from the same hymn sheet. Russell Crowe in #LesMiserables has a Jesus Christ Superstar rock-opera thing going on. Others talk-sing through movie, but he sing-sings. \u2014 Anthony Breznican (@Breznican) November 24, 2012 And a chorus of agreement could be heard right across the pond. First #LesMiserables screening went over extremely well. I'd call it a sure thing Picture nominee for Oscar and the probable Globe winner. \u2014 Dave Karger (@davekarger) November 23, 2012 Anne Hathaway could easily win supporting actress. Her \"I Dreamed a Dream\" is the showstopper. #LesMiserables \u2014 Dave Karger (@davekarger) November 23, 2012 For those who are theater purists, you will LOVE #LesMiserables! Hooper did it right. Having Barks play role again but on film was great! \u2014 Wilson Morales (@blackfilm) November 23, 2012 Hugh Jackman delivers his career best work. Samantha Barks is the breakout star and Eddie \"sings like an angel\" Redmayne OMG!!! #LesMiz \u2014 Clayton Davis (@AwardsCircuit) November 23, 2012 In case I wasn't clear, the #lesmiserables movie is absolutely UNREAL. Ten million points to #TomHooper for doing this musical movie RIGHT. \u2014 Samantha Massell (@smassellsings) November 24, 2012 Sobbed my eyes out. Les Miserables. WHAT AN EPIC MOVIE. #lesmiserables \u2014 Jo Foster (@jo1foster) November 24, 2012 Can't say too much about #lesmiserables until its release but I will say this: it grabs your heart and squeezes it till you cry like a baby \u2014 Lucy Gibson (@LucyRGibson) November 24, 2012 One LES MIZ caveat: went to early screening of THE PRODUCERS in '05 filled with fans of the musical. Walked out convinced it would be a hit. \u2014 Jeremy Smith (@mrbeaks) November 23, 2012 \u2022 Will you be going to see the Les Miserables film? Or should stage musicals stay on the stage and out of cinemas? What stage musicals have made a successful transition screen? Tell us your thoughts in the comment thread below."
