  "content": "New York Comic Con issued an apology on its Facebook page on Friday, for using the social-media accounts of attendees to send promotional tweets that many did not know would be sent. \"This was an opt-in function after signing in, but we were probably too enthusiastic in our messaging and eagerness to spread the good word about NYCC,\" organisers Reed Exhibitions wrote in a statement, a day after high-profile comic artists and fans tweeted their outrage at the intrusion. \"Epic fail, NYCC,\" actor Wil Wheaton said to his 2.5m followers. He later added: \"Someone better get fired for this.\"  \"Not for anything but BOY is that gonna bite you in the ass,\" said the Eisner-winning writer Matt Fraction. The tweets began shortly after Comic Con opened its doors on Thursday. It seemed as if social media was unusually excited about the event. It turned out, however, that many enthusiastic tweets and posts about Comic Con were not written by the attendees \u2013 even though they came from their accounts. It turned out that this year, Comic Con organizers allowed attendees to pre-register online. Part of the registration process allowed fans to link their social-media accounts to the RFID (radio-frequency identification) chips used as unique identifiers in convention badges. A lot of attendees did. When the attendees got to the convention, the chip in their badge started sending out pre-written tweets \u2013 written in a conversational tone \u2013 from the accounts to which it was linked. No one was happy about it, and the internet was soon buzzing with negative reactions. In their statement, organizers said they would not be sending any more tweets from attendees' accounts for the rest of the convention, which runs through Sunday afternoon at the Javits Center in New York. The statement said: \"Please accept our apologies and have an absolutely excellent time this weekend.\" How would you feel if a company started sending out messages from your social media accounts?
