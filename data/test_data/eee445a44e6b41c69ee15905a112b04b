  "content": "We've noted previously how Richard Clayton had a detailed presentation from Phorm, the server-side adware company that is in talks with BT, Virgin Media and TalkTalk to provide its systems. In an exclusive interview on the Guardian's latest Tech Weekly podcast (), Clayton explained that - through a strange quirk - Apple's Safari browser doesn't play ball with the Phorm system, because of the way that the Phorm system passes cookies (it's surprisingly complex; see his PDF writeup) between itself and originating sites. Bad news: if you're using Internet Explorer or Firefox, you'll get tracked - or as Clayton puts it, \"they will intercept your traffic and snoop on it.\" But, he added, \"if a [web page] request does not appear to have been generated by a \"well-known\" browser, then the request will be ignored [by Phorm's system inside the ISP's system].\" Explaining this in an interview with the Guardian's Tech Weekly podcast, Clayton said that this was because many other processes, such as software update checks, can go via port 80, the web browsing channel that Phorm inspects. Dipping into those streams might cause problems. \"So they've concentrated on traffic just from browsers where they understand what will happen.\" But Safari treats cookies differently, he said. \"As far as I can see it's not that that they can't [track users on it] but in practice Safari has some built-in settings which mean that the cookies that they rely on at the end of the process [where you request a page, Phorm inspects it for cookies and whether to serve an ad and passes back a cookie] to serve you up targeted ads will not be sent by Safari because it considers it a privacy risk and doesn't send the cookies.\" Other points arising from the interview, in which the topic of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) 2000, governing snooping on internet traffic, is mentioned a lot: Gmail is legal [under Ripa] only because it's based in the US, not the UK. \"Gmail is sitting out in California and is a bit more tricky for UK legislation to cover it... If [they were based in the UK] they would have to concentrate quite carefully on exactly what they were doing and the extent to which they were parsing incoming email.\" BT could offer the anti-phishing system being touted as a major benefit of Phorm without using the Phorm system. \"If BT wanted to deploy an anti-phishing system they could do that without fluffing around with all the complexity in this system.\" if one person in a household which shares an internet connnection opts out, everyone is opted out of Phorm. But conversely, if one person opts in (even accidentally, say by clearing their cookies) then everyone is opted in. Clayton reserved his greatest ire for BT, saying that the 2006 and 2007 trials \"absolutely\" breached the Ripa: \"because it can't even argue that they got permission from the person who was sending the [web page] requests, so essentially they've been snooping on this data. BT will doubtless say they didn't look at this data, which seems an odd sort of trial... that seems to me extremely wicked of BT. Whether they're going to go to jail for it, one leaves to the courts, but it's not the sort of behaviour one expects from major public - well, private - institutions.\" Phorm said today that narrow interpretations of Ripa like that would mean systems such as Gmail or spam filtering would also be illegal. \"We conducted extensive due diligence on the legality of our system under current interception law,\" it said. These \"have led to only one conclusion \u2014 that Phorm's systems are legal under any full interpretation of the law.\" We did ask BT to comment further last week, and to come in to the podcast to explain BT's position. Its spokesman declined to offer anyone for interview."
