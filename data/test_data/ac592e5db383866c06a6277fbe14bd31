  "content": "Yahoo has closed its acquisition of blogging service Tumblr, paying $1.1bn (\u00a3711.12m) for the company and promising that it will retain its independence. The deal was announced on 20 May, and is the most ambitious move yet by chief executive Marissa Mayer to turn around perceptions of Yahoo as a stagnating internet giant that struggles when bringing innovative startups into its business. \"As promised, Tumblr will continue to operate as a separate business, led by David Karp as CEO,\" wrote Mayer on Yahoo's own Tumblr blog. \"Their product roadmap, their team, and tone will all remain the same as will their mission to empower creators and curators alike to do what they love best: create.\" Yahoo expects buying Tumblr, which attracts 300m visitors a month to the 105m blogs on its site, to boost its new parent company's monthly audience by 50% to more than 1bn visitors. At the time the acquisition was announced, Tumblr said its network of bloggers publish 900 posts per second, with visitors spending 24bn minutes on the site every month. \"We promise not to screw it up,\" wrote Mayer then, to pre-empt criticism of Yahoo's previous record when acquiring popular internet services: online community GeoCities, photo-sharing service Flickr and social bookmarking site Delicious being the three most prominent examples. Under Mayer, Yahoo has been buying lots of smaller startups, including Stamped (social recommendations), Rondee (conference calling), Ghostbird Software (photography apps), Loki Studios (mobile games), MileWise (flight search), Astrid (to-do lists), Jybe (more recommendations), Alike (and more) in 2013 alone. Some of these services were shut down, to be integrated into Yahoo's own apps. Meanwhile, the company was reportedly rebuffed in an attempt to buy a $200m stake in French online video site Dailymotion due to concerns from the French government. Knitting these apps and teams together into a cogent whole will be one challenge for Yahoo in the coming months, as it makes mobile central to its strategy to woo users and advertisers alike. Tumblr will remain independent, though, although Yahoo is hoping that it can help Karp and his team speed up their plans to make money from advertising on Tumblr. The site launched its first sponsored post in 2012, and has been showing more to users of site on desktop and mobile devices in 2013. In May at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, Karp claimed that \"ten out of ten Hollywood studios are buying advertising space on Tumblr\", with the company generating sums in the high six-figures for each campaign.",
