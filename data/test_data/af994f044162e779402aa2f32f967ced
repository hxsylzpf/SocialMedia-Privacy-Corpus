  "content": "Over at the Guardian Music Tumblr we're working hard (aka surfing the web) to bring you all the best in new tracks, album streams, videos, gifs and music news. Here is a round up of the best things we've stumbled upon this week. Leave tips and comments in the thread below, and tell us what you've enjoyed this week. Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor debuts new album artwork and title Sin\u00e9ad gave us new artwork for her upcoming album. The picture saw her hugging her guitar and wearing a leather dress (not the greatest choice in June, but hey). The title of the record will be called I'm Not Bossy, I'm The Boss after Sheryl Sandberg, who continues to be literally everywhere. TV on the Radio on the stage The band performed three previously unheard songs at the BottleRock Festival, and they all sounded pretty damn fresh. Untitled, as of yet. Justin Bieber and Pharrell Williams apologise (separately) Another week, another slew of celeb apologies. This time Justin apologised following reports he'd used racist language and Pharrell apologised for wearing a native Indian headress on the cover of Elle magazine. There are now exactly four pop stars left in the world who haven't said/done something outrageously offensive. Sia continues to be amazing, debuts new song Eye of the Needle Releasing another cut from 1000 Forms of Fear, this is a slower, less-energised affair than Chandelier, but with a chorus just as huge (with woah-woah-woahs). To watch the stunning one-take version of the Chandelier video, click here. Lily Allen and Mark E. Smith go football crazy And by \"go football crazy\", we mean produce unofficial World Cup songs. Not that crazy, really. They're actually quite good too. Listen to both below. Lana Del Rey-watch: Ultraviolence single released Lana, who is significantly more productive than you, has dropped another track from the forthcoming Ultraviolence album. The record nods to The Crystals: \"I can hear the sirens, sirens / he hit me and it felt like a kiss.\" Kanye still thinks J-Kwon's Tipsy is one of the best songs of all time Apparently a year ago, Kanye West cited J-Kwon's dumb-but-fun banger Tipsy as one of the best records of all time. The original interview was in the New York Times, but Buzzfeed are reporting that, slightly slow to the pace, J-Kwon has recently found out. \"It's a classic!\" J-Kwon exclaimed. \"You can't fuck with that. You can quote me on that. Can't nobody fuck with that. They don't even do music like that anymore. Even now, it's still live. It's a crazy club record!\" To be fair, Kanye is a man who once said the following, so his praise is high. Check out if you agree with Kanye with a trip down Tipsy memory lane: Bye!"
