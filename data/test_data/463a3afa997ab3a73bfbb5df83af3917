  "content": "Email and social media have become so integrated in our lives, it can be difficult to discern the exact amount of labour that goes into responding to an email or tweet. While for many of us \u2013 including newly minted freelance writers such as myself \u2013 our email load won't rise to an overbearing level, it's a different matter for authors. On Wednesday, Celeste Ng, author of Everything I Never Told You, which won Amazon's book of the year award, simply tweeted a request to teachers not to assign emails to authors. In a series of explanatory tweets to angry users, who tweeted to chide her for being \"selfish\" and tell her that students should stop reading her book, Ng patiently explained that a teacher required students to obtain a quote from her in order to receive full credit. Other authors quickly came to Ng's defense, noting that responding to upwards of 30 emails from students would constitute hours of unpaid labor. \"We're not robots,\" author Roxane Gay tweeted. \"We do what we can.\" Long gone are the days when to contact an author we would address a letter to her publisher and cross our fingers for a response. How the times have changed. Not even seven years ago, in what would perhaps be the 2008 equivalent of the assignment Ng refers to, I was required to write letters to editors and politicians for my American history class. We could only hope that our handwritten, addressed, and stamped letters would move past the assistant's desk, up the chain of command. But our grades didn't rest on responses. The point was an attempt at engagement, at starting to thinking critically and towards holding those in positions of authority accountable. That was all. Fast forward to the present, when everyone seems accessible because they are merely a click away on Twitter or on their personal sites. Their avatars and the ability to communicate with just a tweet seem to hint at an immediacy we mistake for omnipresence. The issue presented by the debate on Ng's Twitter feed is beyond a simple matter of the relationship between a reader and an author. There is the educational element in which students are being required to contact an author for insight into the work, and then the author's response is determinative of the student's grade. On Small Pond Science, a site about research, teaching and mentorship in the sciences, professor of biology Terry McGlynn notes that he often receives emails from students asking for his \"expert\" opinion for an assignment. \"These students are being trained by their teachers that they are entitled to have access to expert information without having to do any research on their own,\" he wrote in a recent post. It's partly a matter of feeling entitled to information and an author or professor's time, whether it's the teacher assuming this entitlement or angry fans on Twitter. No matter what romantic ideas we hold of authors and their supposed leisurely lives spent writing books, this isn't the reality. Writing requires research, drafting, rewriting and editing. There is so much hidden emotional labor, including interacting with fans in the pressurized environment of social media. While this is part of being an author, it is not her obligation or duty, and as Ng noted, she does her best to interact with fans via email, but cannot always respond as quickly as she would like. To expect Ng to respond to the emails of 30 students is ridiculous. Instead of demanding a response or pressuring an author to respond by docking a student's grade, perhaps it's best to just go back to old-fashioned research."
