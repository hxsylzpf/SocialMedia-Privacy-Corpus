  "content": "Mr Justice Eady, the high court judge whose rulings have shaped UK libel and privacy law in recent years, is to hand over responsibility for defamation and privacy cases from next month. The lord chief justice announced today that Mr Justice Tugendhat will replace Eady as the judge in charge of the Queen's bench jury and non-jury lists, which hear the majority of defamation and privacy cases. Eady's term of office ends on 30 September. The news will be welcomed by some news organisations who have accused Eady of using the Human Rights Act to create a privacy law \"by the back door\". In a speech in 2008 to the Society of Editors, the Daily Mail editor, Paul Dacre, described him as \"arrogant\" and \"amoral\". Eady ruled in favour of Formula One executive Max Mosley when he successfully sued the News of the World on privacy grounds over claims he took part in Nazi-themed orgies. He awarded Mosley \u00a360,000 damages for invasion of privacy. He has also issued a number of gagging orders preventing papers from publishing stories that would identify celebrities alleged to have had affairs. Eady also found in favour of Canadian folk singer Loreena McKennitt, who had objected to a book written by a former adviser on the grounds that it had infringed her right to privacy. McKennit did not claim the contents of the book were untrue [see footnote]. In a speech in March, Eady hit back at his critics, saying he had been subjected to \"personal abuse\" by the media. \"The media have nowhere to vent their frustrations other than through personal abuse of the particular judge who happens to have made the decision,\" he added. \"It has become fashionable to label judges not as independent but rather as 'unaccountable', and as hostile to freedom of speech.\" He said that although it would have been more \"natural\" for parliament to legislate on privacy it was best for the courts to rule on each case as it arises. In contrast to Eady, Tugendhat has generally adopted a more nuanced interpretation of the Human Rights Act, which enshrines a right to privacy in UK law, when he has ruled on privacy issues. He is regarded as more friendly to the press than Eady. Earlier this year, he lifted a superinjunction won by footballer John Terry to prevent a newspaper reporting his alleged affair with former teammate Wayne Bridge's ex-partner. In June, Tugendhat effectively made it more difficult to win libel cases by ruling that claimants must demonstrate an offending article affects them \"substantially\" in a move to discourage trivial actions. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857. For all other inquiries please call the main Guardian switchboard on 020 3353 2000. \u2022 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\". \u2022 This footnote was added on 24 September 2010. It was incorrect to state that Ms McKennitt did not claim that the contents of the book were untrue. Ms McKennitt sued for privacy and not for libel, so the case did not primarily engage with the truth or falsity of the book. However, Ms Ash raised an issue that Ms McKennitt was not entitled to an expectation of privacy because of her conduct in relation to an advance of money, which was detailed in the book. This was challenged by Ms McKennitt. On the evidence, the Judge held that Ms Ash's account in the book was untrue and accordingly her claim for an injunction on the grounds of privacy succeeded."
