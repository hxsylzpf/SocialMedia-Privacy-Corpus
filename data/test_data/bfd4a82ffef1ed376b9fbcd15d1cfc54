  "title": "The ultimate internet glossary: from 4chan to Zynga",
  "content": "4chan 4chan has been in the news recently, as the site that hosted hacked photographs of naked celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence (you may have heard about this). But what is 4chan? Well, basically, it's an aesthetically-ugly-as-sin image board which allows users to post pretty much anything. It was started by a teenage boy in his bedroom (obviously), originally as a means of sharing manga and anime. Nowadays there are various boards dedicated to: gaming, porn, cosplay, and more porn. 4chan is pretty much a destination for trolls, lulz-seekers and fapping idiots, given that everybody posts anonymously. To be fair, there are also boards on fashion and music, and lolcats did originate on 4chan \u2013 so at least there's one redeeming thing about it.

Whatever operating system you are using, there will be tons of apps to download for your smartphone. Useful, entirely frivolous, well designed, badly designed, addictive games, fitness trackers \u2013 you name it. Apps perfectly complement the web; lots of us access the internet more frequently by phone than desktop, especially when it comes to social media. And what did we do without Google Maps on our phones? How did we ever find our way anywhere?

Bitcoin is a crypto-currency, which circumnavigates banks and credit card companies. A bitcoin is transferred from person to person via the internet. Bitcoins are bought and sold and kept in a digital wallet to avoid the double spending problem. But if that all seems a bit opaque, just watch our handy explainer, below. see also: badboy2 \u2013 internet meme started when a user posted a photo on a body-building forum captioned \"I'm 18, do I have potential?\" \u2013 cue humorous, good natured photoshops galore Bad Luck Brian \u2013 meme started in 2012, featuring a teen in plaid sweater vest and braces, befalling a series of embarrassing situations Bebo \u2013 social network founded in 2005.

Sometimes called linkbait, the word \"clickbait\" describes online content which is judged to be mostly lighthearted, less than robust and primarily focused towards hoovering up traffic. Basically, clickbait is geared towards getting people to click through to an article. Headlines therefore attempt to respond to the \"curiousity gap\" a reader experiences when they see a headline which doesn't explain the full context of a story, but does pique the reader's interest enough for them to click. This can either be an intriguing statement or a question. Positive, feel-good stories are also a big part of clickbait, as are CAPITAL letters and exclamation marks!!! Buzzfeed, and especially Upworthy, have pioneered the clickbait-y content and title type. Upworthy's headlines, while at first interesting just for their novelty factor, have since become so annoying that it is estimated at least 17 people a week are killed being hit by computers thrown from windows in a rage. (\"Click Here to Find Out the Strange Way 17 People Died This Week.\") Clickbait's ultimate aim is to be shared, shared again ie. GO VIRAL. The Onion started Clickhole, a site which parodies clickbait. A Twitter account, SavedYouAClick has a mission to do exactly that, writing the answers to particularly clickbait-y headline questions. see also: Candy Crush Saga \u2013 tile-matching based game originally developed for Facebook, then mobile OS (operating systems).

Doge is the best kind of meme in that it shouldn't be funny, but it is. \"It involves superimposing broken English written in multi-coloured Comic Sans on to pictures of shiba inus, a small Japanese breed of dog known for its spirited stubbornness\", explains Alex Hern. It's a rare example of a dog leading a meme, as opposed to the much more internet-friendly cat (as explained here by Buzzfeed's Jack Shepherd). Doge became such a staple of internet culture that it inspired Dogecoin (a variation of Bitcoin), which has so far funded a Jamaican bobsleigh team and a rally car in the NASCAR race. Such impressive. Very wow. see also: Daatch \u2013 mobile dating app for lesbian women dark internet \u2013 network hosts on the internet that are unreachable, often confused with deep web.

Who hasn't found themselves staring at a screen at 2am, lightly dusted in Doritos crumbs, furiously refreshing the page to see if theirs is the winning bid on that original Spice Girls cassette from 96? Or constantly refreshing, sweating, hopin' and a-prayin' that someone outbids you, because you've blown your wages on a \"french shabby chic armchair'\" which is bigger than the actual square footage of your flat? The arrival of eBay's app has just exacerbated this problem. Since eBay (originally called AuctionWeb) was founded in 1995, the following items have been listed for sale: F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet, Britney Spears' hair, New Zealand, Nicolas Cage as a vampire, a ghost in a jar, and, er, the meaning of life. see also: Edward Snowden \u2013 source of the biggest classified information leak in history, exposing NSA and GCHQ snooping, and other worldwide surveillance operations egosurfer \u2013 person who Googles themselves or otherwise displays self-obsessed behaviour online ELI5 \u2013 (explain like I'm 5) a subreddit where users can go to get concepts explained simply email \u2013 things you should never answer when on holiday encryption \u2013 encoding information so that only authorised peeps can see it emoji \u2013 ideograms, basically the lil' graphic icons sent online and by text emoticon \u2013 :-) :-( :-/ :-O :-s &lt;3 Ermahgerd \u2013 meme which consists of a girl with a brace and pigtails holding a series of Goosebumps books overlayed with phrases spelt phonetically. Nobody said memes were easy to understand Facebook Small social network, which is struggling to get off the ground. So far only has 1.23 billion monthly active users, but I'm sure its founder Mark Zuckerberg will make it a success eventually. One day it will take off, a film might possibly be made of its origins, with a supporting role for Justin Timberlake. In an ideal world, it'd be floated on the stock market for $38 dollars a share, with a company value of $104 billion. Unfathomably, Zuckerberg will become a fashion icon for his navy hoodies and pool sliders, inspiring a whole new style called normcore. Then, people will start posting annoying statuses on the site, sharing boring links, and grandparents will join, driving you \u2013 weeping \u2013 into the arms of Twitter. see also: fanfiction \u2013 stories about fictional characters, often written in online fanfic communities and forums.

Idk either but there are huge online communities out there Gif Gifs have acquired a bad rep, namely because people who don't like BuzzFeed and other gif-reliant sites get fed up with them, but the truth is gifs are awesome. That the whole range of human emotions can be captured in a moving image around 2MB in size is a wonderful thing indeed. Or \u2013 as below \u2013 a raccoon stealing cat food from directly under the nose of a cat. There's also some controversy (or should that be contro-versy) as to how gif is actually pronounced. The inventor of the gif has gone on record saying that it is \"gif\" with a soft g.

Now, a hashtag is an inherent part of how we communicate online. A hashtag is the simplest form of metadata tag which allows users on social networks (in particular Twitter, Facebook and Instagram) to categorise their posted content into subject matter or topic, and allows other users to search for these. Essentially, hashtags act as signifiers (shout out to Roland Barthes). In 2014, the term was added to the Oxford English Dictionary. Hashtags can be used at the beginning of posts, mid-post, or at the end. It doesn't really matter \u2013 as long as they're not 134 characters long in a 140-character limited tweet, which is just annoying. Trending hashtags can be related to pop culture subjects, or be utilised for more political purposes. Mostly though, they're just about 5SOS or One Direction. see also: Habbo Hotel \u2013 now known as Habbo, HH was an online hangout for teens allowing users to create their own avatars and socialise in an online \"hotel\" and hotel rooms.

(Some people like to sound clever) Instagram Often disparaged because of the number of people using the social mobile photography app to take pictures of their lunch, the main concern here should be how Instagram is fucking with future historians. How will the Dan Snows of 2050 be able to tell when pictures were taken, if they're all a mixture of sepia, 70s grain and washed-out hues? Basically, 2014 will look the same as 1972 through the lens of Instagram (ok, so pictures have time and date stamps, but ssh, you know what I mean). Of course, the truth is Instagram is rather a charming app which has brought easy, fun and quick photography to the masses, murdering the point-and-shoot market in cold blood. Plus, everybody's life looks better in Easybird. Instagram now also supports video function, and was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion in 2012. see also: I Can Has Cheezburger? \u2013 a website featuring lolcats and other memes, which now also owns sites KnowYourMeme.com and FAILblog ice bucket challenge \u2013 2014 viral campaign to raise awareness of motor neurone disease, via celebrities pouring buckets of ice-cold water onto their heads IM \u2013 short for instant message Imgur \u2013pronounced \"imager\" \u2013 but I still say it \"imger\" \u2013 the site curates images and sorts them relative to popularity.

It is mostly used to create interactive elements on websites, which will work across different web browsers. Most of those snazzy polls and quizzes and interactive widgets on the websites you look at during lunch are probably built with JavaScript code.
