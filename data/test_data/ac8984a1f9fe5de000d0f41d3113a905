  "content": "ITV's This Morning is top of \"a very long list\", including Sally Bercow, wife of the Commons speaker, of those facing legal action from Lord McAlpine over false accusations in relation to child abuse. McAlpine's solicitor, Andrew Reid, said on Thursday that if those on the list failed to come forward to apologise he would have no choice but to sue. Some people, including Guardian columnist George Monbiot, have already apologised. In an interview on Radio 4's The World At One Reid singled out This Morning presenter Philip Schofield who, live on air last week, handed David Cameron a list featuring several Conservative politicians linked to allegations of child sex abuse, which he had compiled after a three minute internet search. Reid also mentioned Bercow, who had tweeted, \"Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*\" \u2013 a reference to the fact the peer's name was being repeatedly mentioned on Twitter. Reid said he and McAlpine were determined to take tough action after the Tory peer's name circulated on the internet in relation to the 2 November Newsnight broadcast, which wrongly claimed a senior Conservative politician had been involved in child abuse in a Welsh care home. The botched Newsnight story has already cost George Entwistle his job as director general, and McAlpine is preparing to sue anyone who linked his name to the broadcast and damaged his good name. \"The next person on our list is in fact the This Morning programme, run by ITV, where Phillip Schofield managed to embarrass the prime minister and then destroy my client's reputation,\" Reid said. \"What [Schofield] did really was very, very low and I am amazed it was allowed, absolutely amazed. It sent everyone on the internet, those that couldn't read what was there [on Schofield's list] naturally would have been made more keen to see who was referred to, and I think at the top of the list was Lord McAlpine,\" he added. ITV has reprimanded Schofield and three This Morning staff over the incident and Ofcom has announced it is also to investigate whether the broadcast breached its broadcasting code by not offering McAlpine a right of reply. Reid said those in the list would receive a 13 to 14 page letter formally notifying them of legal action, with 48 hours to respond. He said \"Mrs Bercow\" was among the \"well known\" people who had tweeted who McAlpine would be pursuing. \"She hasn't yet been in touch and apologised and I am most surprised she hasn't done so. Hopefully she will and reach an arrangement with us.\" However, Bercow has apologised on Twitter, posting on November 12 that she was \"Very sorry. Was irresponsible &amp; mischievious\" before adding that she did not believe her original tweets were defamatory. Reid added that among those who have already come forward to apologise were Monbiot, who blamed his \"stupidity and thoughtlessness\" for a tweet naming McAlpine. \"We've had two apologies and I'm acknowledging them now. [Monbiot] has sent me two apologies to pass on to Lord McAlpine,\" Reid said. According to Reid, Monbiot said in his apology: \"I am feeling worse than anything else I have ever done, though I realise that is as nothing by comparison to what you have gone through with the help of my stupidty and thoughtlessness.\" Reid hinted however this would not be the end of the matter and Monbiot may also have to make a settlement. \"What we are basically saying to people is, 'look we know, in inverted commas, who you are; we know exactly the extent what you have done and it's easier to come forward and apologise and arrange to settle us because this is cheaper'.\" Monbiot, a high profile green columnist, declined to say anything further when contacted by the Guardian. Reid described the rumour and innuendo that swirled around the internet before and after the Newsnight broadcast as \"so vile, so disgusting\", and said there would be no escape for those who later deleted their tweets. He added that McAlpine's legal team had been watching people who had been taking down tweets but said that they did not understand that \"we already have all the information\" and noted how their tweets have rippled around the world. \"We have managed to find a couple of firms of experts who are able to find the pre tweets, the post tweets, the effect of the tweets and the retweets so what starts as maybe one [tweet], ends up with a hundred thousand or more, \" Reid said. He added that people had to understand that the internet was not just \"a closed gossip coffee shop\", where you can say \"the nastiest thing possible with impunity\". \"Let it be a lesson to everyone that trial by Twitter, trial by the internet, is a very nasty way of hurting people unnecessarily, and it will cost people a lot of money,\" Reid said. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
