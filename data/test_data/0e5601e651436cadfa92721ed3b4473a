  "content": "A man who sparked an outcry on Twitter after tweeting about confronting a Muslim woman on a street in Croydon, south London, and challenging her to \"explain Brussels\" has been arrested by police. The Metropolitan police confirmed that a 46-year-old man had been arrested on Wednesday evening in Croydon on suspicion of inciting racial hatred via social media. He is understood to be Matthew Doyle, a partner at a south London-based talent and PR agency, who tweeted earlier in the day: \"I confronted a Muslim women [sic] yesterday in croydon. I asked her to explain Brussels. She said \"Nothing to do with me\" a mealy mouthed reply.\" The comments, which followed Tuesday's bomb attacks at Brussels airport and on the city's metro system, were later deleted but sparked a furious response from other users of Twitter. Following criticism by other users of Twitter, Doyle tweeted: One of his last tweets on Wednesday evening was to say: \"Thanks all you tweeters for proving I can still do PR.\" Officers for the Metropolitan police in Croydon tweeted on Wednesday that a suspect had been arrested for inciting racial hatred. The force said that a man remained in custody at a south-London police station on Wednesday night. Responses to Doyle's tweet included one from another Twitter user who asked: \"What has a Muslim woman in Croydon, got to do with the horrific events in Belgium, you simpleton?\" Another, referring to the far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik, asked: \"Did anyone accost you on the streets of Croydon after the Brevik shooting in Norway?\""
