  "content": "Social games firm Kabam has been having big mobile hits with games like The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle-earth, Fast &amp; Furious 6: The Game and Kingdoms of Camelot: Battle for the North. Fond of a colon, then. But Kabam is also one of the fastest growing publishers in the mobile games world, as chief executive Kevin Chou explains in an interview with The Guardian. \"We did $180m last year in revenue, and this year we're on track to do well over $300m. We were profitable last year, and we've been profitable every single quarter this year as well,\" says Chou. Kabam is an interesting company, because it's making a lot of money from social games based on big movies, as well as from its own titles like Kingdoms of Camelot, which has made more than $250m across Facebook, web and mobile since its launch four years ago. The company has strong ties with Hollywood too: Warner Bros Entertainment CEO Kevin Tsujihara joined its board last year, while MGM chairman and CEO Gary Barber is a board observer. At a time when the biggest mobile games tend to be unbranded \u2013 Candy Crush, Clash of Clans and Puzzle &amp; Dragons for example \u2013 Kabam's strategy of working with big entertainment brands is relatively unusual. As is its ability to make a decent profit from them. \"The way we do these deals with the movie studios is setting up deals that keep both parties motivated in investing in the franchises for a multi-year period of time,\" says Chou. \"In the past, these films would have $100m marketing budgets, and they'd carve out $500,000 to make a low-quality Flash advergame or something to be played online for free. But the kind of games we're making become massive revenue and profit generators that engage people 365 days a year, in between the movies.\" There's a long and ignoble history of movie games on console, computer and mobile devices alike, where the games follow the plot closely, and play jack-of-all-genres without mastering any of them. Chou says Kabam has found its Hollywood partners willing to try something different. \"We're not trying to recreate the movie in a game, we're trying to create a parallel track that fits within the overall function of what the movie is trying to do,\" says Chou. \"We'll use characters, and sometimes very specific plotlines will appear in the game, but we don't try to follow the plot of the movie itself. Maybe something is mentioned really briefly in the movie, and we'll then dive into that part more deeply in the game.\" Kabam's games are free-to-play, making their money mainly from in-app purchases: mithril in The Hobbit, gold in Fast &amp; Furious and so on, with bundles ranging from \u00a31.49 to \u00a369.99 in price in the now-traditional style. Free-to-play gaming continues to spark arguments among gamers and games developers alike, from criticism of over-aggressive \"monetisation\" tactics in games through to the originality of their content. How does Chou think the quality of F2P games is evolving? \"There is such a difference from the early days of social gaming. You're getting to console-quality graphics on the latest iOS and Android devices, and something like Clash of Clans is highly polished and much closer to competing with a lot of PC games,\" he says. \"For most consumers downloading and playing some of these new free-to-play games, they're going to be delighted by the graphical fidelity. But the second, much more nuanced question is quality in terms of the business model and how content is designed.\" Chou notes that the mobile/social games industry is still figuring out what works, what doesn't work, and what annoys players when it comes to free-to-play games \u2013 and specifically the challenge of creating something that up to 98% of players won't pay for, and in games where they compete against one another, getting the balance right between progression through paying versus playing. \"It's the area that gets gamers the most upset, but publishers are still refining their models,\" says Chou. \"Creating the right balance is really hard, but these kinds of games are really exciting, when you can have thousands of players competing with one another. The industry is still evolving, and people are trying things out.\" Chou is also enthusiastic about the prospect of seeing one of Kabam's main rivals go public in the near future. Candy Crush Saga publisher King has reportedly filed pre-IPO documents in the US, although they won't be made public until just before its roadshow for potential investors. \"The King IPO is really exciting: there hasn't really been a mobile freemium company that's gone public. Zynga is still primarily a Facebook company, and [public] firms like Gameloft and Glu have gone from premium download-type games to trying to figure out the freemium model,\" says Chou. \"King is the first company that gets mobile and free-to-play to go public.\" More on free-to-play mobile gaming - Clash of Clans maker Supercell raises $1.5bn - GungHo Online's mobile game Puzzle &amp; Dragons made $113m in April - Kristian Segerstrale talks free-to-play and the future of gaming How can King avoid Zynga-style disappointment after its IPO, though? One theory I have about Zynga's struggles in recent times is that at the peak of its success with FarmVille on Facebook, a lot of players came to think of the game as an addiction rather than a pleasure. When they kicked the habit \u2013 a phrase I've heard a number of friends and family use about FarmVille \u2013 they didn't want to get sucked in to another 'Ville' game. King may be riding high with Candy Crush Saga, but is there a danger of the same thing happening with 'Saga' games if it doesn't watch out? \"It's a very fair question. The gaming industry needs to prove that it can create sustainable franchises over many years, just like the major movie studios and television production companies do,\" says Chou. \"I think the gaming industry will start to look a little bit more like the television industry: shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones run for multiple years, and that's the model the gaming industry needs to move towards. They don't create Game of Thrones 2, they just create more and more content in the same universe, which fans already love and are excited about.\" Chou says Kabam is currently investing heavily in new games, splitting its resources roughly 50/50 between own-IP and big brands. The company also has a publishing business for third-party developers, which it launched in March this year with 15 games from partners, and an emphasis on localising games from Asian developers for the West. \"That's grown from nothing to tens of millions of dollars as a business this year, and next year we have really big plans for that part of our business,\" says Chou. \"The tablet market is growing at 70%, so you're seeing us double down and take a very large percentage of our profits and reinvest them in future products and services.\" He also thinks that the success of publishers like King is bringing mobile games a new respect from other entertainment industries, including movies and television. \"Two years ago, the top mobile game might make $4m in a single month. Now, Candy Crush Saga is probably making $2m a day, so we're talking about $60m of monthly revenues for that game alone,\" says Chou. \"Gaming hasn't always been put on the same level as film or television, yet it's a market that's growing so fast, and especially with King's IPO and potentially a Kabam IPO, gaming is now elevated. If you're making hundreds of millions of dollars with a franchise, you can invest tens of millions of dollars in making a product. That's the same budget as a Breaking Bad episode.\" Kabam may work more with television brands in the future, with Chou citing the success of EA's free-to-play Simpsons game as an eye-opener for producers in that industry. He's less sure about other entertainment sectors: music, for example. \"I think you'll see more television-based games, and definitely more film. Music is definitely interesting for games, but the music labels are really hard to work with in terms of getting their content and getting a reasonable fee,\" says Chou. But wait: \"potentially a Kabam IPO\". The company has been regularly tipped in recent months to be the next big mobile games firm to go public, and Kabam seems to be happy to fan those rumours, even though Chou \u2013 formerly a VC himself \u2013 does the obligatory dampening-down of the significance of an IPO for his company's long-term strategy. \"Entrepreneurs think of an IPO as an end-point, but the public markets think of it as the beginning point. If your goal is to create a great company with great products, an IPO is just one milestone. it's not even really as important as creating your next great product,\" he says. \"We think of an IPO as a way to realise some of the value, and evolve from a startup into a fully-fledged company. And with a little over $300m in annual revenues and a track record of profitability, we're certainly within the required scale.\" So, when will Kabam go public? \"We certainly weren't interested in being the closest to Zynga's IPO,\" says Chou, suggesting that the negative publicity around that company's performance and share price since it went public was seen as a risk by Kabam's board for its own prospects. \"We're actively looking at King's IPO and having a lot of broad discussions about the right time for Kabam to IPO. We have a very patient board, so we want to make sure the market conditions are good. But as I said, the strategy is to build a company with great products. The IPO is just a realisation of the value.\""
