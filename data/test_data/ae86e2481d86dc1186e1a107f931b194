  "content": "Glory be - is it that time already? Twenty years of Acid House! I vaguely remember wearing cycling shorts (not quite in the manner of Chris Hoy, it has to be said) and a Boy t-shirt around about 1988 which, if you remember, was the second summer of love that happened just before the other second summer of love in 1989. Photo by Helico on Flickr. Some rights reserved. Whatever... there's a flashmob in London to mark the anniversary with details typically scant at this stage: congregate in central London between 6.20 and 6.30pm. All the other details will be secreted out through MySpace, Facebook and the mobile networking site Next2Friends, who want uses to broadcast the event live to the site on the night. It's a far cry from those Spiral Tribes where you have to call the number on the back of a fag packet from the phone box near the pub outside Winchester. The email bulletin says: \"Exact details, in true Flash Mob style, are still under wraps until closer to the event, but the premise revolves around people congregating in central London at 6.20pm for a 6.30pm start, singing the chorus of the seminal 'We call it Aciid' D-Mob track and recreating the vibe of a 1988 Acid House party, decked out in 80's or Acid House fashions where possible.\" Inevitably, some bright spark is setting this up to help flog a book, but it's such a good idea that we'll forgive him. Bring your glow sticks, people."
