  "content": "The Sun newspaper and Heat magazine have settled legal cases with Desperate Housewives' star Teri Hatcher over false claims about her private life. On page four of today's Sun the paper ran an apology for the story, published in August last year, after reaching a settlement with Hatcher, who was represented by the law firm Schillings. \"An article on 2 August last year, 'Wagon Squeals', stated that actress Teri Hatcher had sex romps in her VW camper van at her home,\" the apology stated. \"Although published in good faith, we now accept that the article was totally incorrect and we apologise to Ms Hatcher for the embarrassment caused.\" Schillings said the Sun had agreed to pay substantial damages and some of the actor's legal costs. The law firm added that Hatcher had also settled her legal action against Heat magazine for publishing similar claims in August 2005. In December the Daily Sport agreed to publish a front-page apology and pay costs and substantial libel damages to Hatcher after publishing similar false allegations about her private life. Schillings represented Wayne Rooney in his recent libel action against the Sun and News of the World, which last week saw the two papers pay the footballer \u00a3100,000 in damages. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
