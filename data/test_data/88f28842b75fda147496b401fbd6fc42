  "content": "Ian Poulter last night posted a message on Twitter only hours after Colin Montgomerie ordered his Europe Ryder Cup team to cease all activity on Twitter, Facebook and other social networking sites. Montgomerie had wanted his 12 players to communicate only at scheduled media briefings, determined that they should do nothing to undermine their attempt to regain the trophy from the USA team when the competition starts on Friday. But the captain's request was not instantly heeded, with Poulter posting a message just before 11pm last night. Its contents, though innocuous, pose a test of Montgomerie's leadership. Montgomerie's actions follow a recent furore over a tweet by Kevin Pietersen, which came after the England cricketer was informed he had been dropped. The batsman is one of a number of athletes to find themselves caught out by the social networking site. The USA captain, Corey Pavin, has also asked his players to refrain from interacting with their \"followers\". Montgomerie said: \"Not being a tweeter myself, we feel that tweeting and Facebook and all of these social sites can get one's self into trouble. At the same time I think it's important, the same as Corey, that we focus on the job at hand this week and we are here to try and regain this lovely trophy that Corey has brought back for us. I think that we have to focus on that job and as Corey so rightly says, on Monday 4 October, yes, you'll find the team probably on social network sites. But not until then.\" Poulter responded by tweeting last night: \"For the record Colin hasn't banned twitter, he has asked to be respectful to the teams privacy. I played 7 holes today course is awesome.\" Montgomerie had earlier confirmed that Pietersen's experience had influenced his approach. \"Kevin Pietersen's error changed my view as to that, yes,\" he said. \"I've just asked my team not to [do so] and they have said, 'OK, that's fine, we'll start tweetering or twittering on Monday 4 October.' It's not a ban, because if somebody does it, well, how can you punish someone for it?\" Pietersen revealed that he had not been included in the England squad for the Twenty20 and one-day series against Pakistan last month, before the announcement had been officially made. A few days later the Hampshire all-rounder Dimitri Mascarenhas used undiplomatic language about England's national selector, Geoff Miller, in a tweet. Both players were fined and warned. Montgomerie held the European team's first get-together at Celtic Manor tonight Before the meeting Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell, who has 16,533 followers on Twitter, tweeted: \"We have a team meeting at 6, so will keep you posted on the tweeting ban ... let's hope not!!!! Go Europe!!!!\" Pavin, whose team member Stewart Cink has 1,201,022 followers on Twitter, said: \"We talked about it as a team and we thought it best not to do it. We need to focus on playing and working on preparations and getting ready to play the Ryder Cup. As Colin said, Team USA, whatever they would like to do, tweeting or Facebooking or whatever it may be, they have the opportunity to do that next week and for the rest of their lives.\" Earlier, the USA team touched down at Cardiff airport with Tiger Woods one of several players unaccompanied by a partner, in his case due to his divorce this year following allegations regarding his private life. However Montgomerie expects the world No1 to be a force, despite his relatively modest Ryder Cup record. \"A lot's been written on Tiger's performances. It's just that it's poorer than, of course, his individual record, which is extremely good. So we look forward to seeing how Tiger is going to be playing and who he's going to be playing with, and seeing how we can counteract that, I suppose.\""
