  "content": "Gosh, it's user-generated content week in games news land. Another interesting titbit of information for those folks out there eager to flex creative interactive entertainment muscles has just arrived in the gamesblog inbox: Multiverse Network, a platform technology which allows developers to create their own virtual worlds, has completed its beta phase. Now, anyone who wants to design an MMO can create their own. The application itself is even more interesting as a platform; the creators' aim is to become a kind of Safari/Internet Explorer/Netscape for 3D virtual worlds in the future, providing gateways/portkeys between any of the worlds developed using the software so participants can move from one virtual environment to another with the same digital identity. Each virtual world developed using the Metaverse tools will become like a self-contained webpage-world. So you can take your Level 60 mage, with all the assets and experience you've accrued, from one place to another. Rather nifty. And if those with their ears to the ground are correct, this is the direction our online identities are heading. Look, after all, at Amazon. Or Areae. Great for social networking. Quite exciting for the way we'll interact with internet content in the future. via Wonderland's del.icio.us and Cnet"
