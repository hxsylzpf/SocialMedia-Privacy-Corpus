  "content": "So much for those famed French privacy laws. After Closer magazine's revelations about President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's dalliance comes Paris Match's exclusive peek into the private life of another leading politician. A cover article in the current issue, details the relationship between Arnaud Montebourg, a member of Hollande's socialist cabinet, and film actress Elsa Zylberstein. The piece, \"La love story\", is illustrated with what appear to be paparazzi photographs. Montebourg, who is divorced, is the minister of industrial renewal. He is nicknamed D'Artagnan, after the swashbuckling character in The Three Musketeers, and he may well put Paris Match to the sword. According to the minister's spokesman he is likely to sue the magazine and has previously won cases for breach of his privacy. But the door has been opened as never before in France. Renaud Revel, media editor with l'Express magazine believes Hollande's refusal to sue Closer over his alleged friendship with the actress Julie Gayet has broken a taboo. He is quoted in the Daily Telegraph as saying: \"We are in a new era and can now expect a flood of reports on politicians' private lives... We have turned the page and taken a leaf out of the Anglo-Saxon book. Anything goes.\""
