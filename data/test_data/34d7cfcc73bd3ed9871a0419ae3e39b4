  "content": "I'm apologising in advance in case this article ends up being a tad disjointed. Sorry, I can't help it. The lure of the web keeps whipping my attention away. It's been at least 50 seconds since I last checked my MySpace - and who knows what I've missed out on. I mustn't forget to have a quick look at my Facebook page too. And Bebo. Then I can spend some quality \"me\" time watching a clip of a cat peeing on YouTube. The social networking phenomenon is getting way out of hand. A friend has listed one of her hobbies as simply \"MySpacing\". Which, when I'd first seen it, made me laugh a lot, but I swiftly realised it was a Friday night and I was sat reading profiles in the early hours. Thousands of people are doing the very same thing right this second. Homework sits untouched, dishes remain mucky and office managers up and down the country are wondering why everyone looks busy yet seems to have stopped working. Ironically, the invention of social networking has discouraged everyone from being, erm, sociable. I send messages to my housemates rather than just, you know, talking to them. And what a false social setting it is anyway. It's clogged full of information we don't need to know about each other. Endless lists of favourite bands, books, TV shows. It's not important. When was the last time you met someone in a bar and then reeled off, in order, your top 10 Johnny Depp films? Plus, people are proud to have hundreds of friends - which is lovely - but closer inspection reveals that most of these friends are just bands they happen to like. Fair enough, I suppose. The saddest thing about all this is that I have been sucked in as much as everyone else. My friends list has swelled to an impressive 181, but deep down I know Henry the Hoover isn't a real mate. Shamefully, my lack of self-discipline means I can't face logging off. Just as I try to tear myself away, someone will post something that'll keep me there for another 10 minutes and before I know it, it's 3am. Back in the days of the glorious Sega Mega Drive, my mother allowed me to play computer games only on certain days of the week. As you could expect, this was a unanimously unpopular decision. The Sega Days meant that I wasn't wasting my entire youth trying to thwart that pesky Dr Robitnik. Instead, I'd be out with my football boots on - and having a much better time than I've ever had playing Sonic the Hedgehog, of course. MySpace has no such motherly protection. Boy, how I wish it did. Every day is now a MySpace day. What bliss it would be if after an hour of pointless surfing an error message appeared, telling you bluntly: \"Dear User, session expired, get a life.\" Your only choice would be to click OK, pop outside, have a kickaround and maybe even try talking to your friends in the old-fashioned manner that involves use of your vocal chords. Failing that, my (real) friend Sophie's recent cry for help (posted on MySpace, naturally) offers another valid option. \"Ahhhh I'm meant to be revising!\" she began. \"Will someone please delete MySpace?\" Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to set up a Second Life account."
