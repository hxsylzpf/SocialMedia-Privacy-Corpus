  "content": "The great wall, or to be more accurate, walls of China were constructed using local materials \u2013 stones where it passed through mountains, and rammed earth over the plains. Its digital counterpart, the great firewall of China, is proving harder to construct and even more treacherous to maintain. Today's nomadic hordes threatening dynastic security don't come from Manchuria and Mongolia. They lurk in internet cafes everywhere. There have been two major breaches within six months. Last June, the Chinese government, the most assiduous internet censor on the planet, dropped (or postponed), its Green Dam project four hours before the censorship software was due to be installed in every computer sold in China. Now it faces an even bigger challenge to its authority as an internet censor: does it accept Google's unprecedented announcement that it will not tolerate censorship of its search engine? Or does it allow Google to pack up and go, not just depriving millions of Chinese internet users in the world's biggest market, but inflicting a large dent in China's claim to have arrived as a key player in the global market, a claim it spent so much time and money on the Beijing Olympics to make? It is an unenviable choice, and possibly the reason yesterday for a rather old fashioned, analogue-era response to a digital firestorm which erupted moments after Google's announcement: complete \u00adofficial silence. Google yesterday clambered back on to the moral high ground of this debate, but it was not always so. Four years ago it provoked a torrent of criticism, much of it justified, by agreeing to filter information on politically sensitive topics such as Tibet and the Tiananmen Square protests as the price of entering the Chinese market. It justified the compromise to its \"do no evil\" ethics by arguing that working on the inside would empower Chinese internet users and help open up a vast market. It did not quite work out like that. Guge, as the company is known in China, got only up to 17% of the queries and 33% of the income, the rest going to its Chinese rival Baidu. It has also noted a chill in the atmosphere, criticised by the government for linking to pornography, suffering blockage of google.docs and its subsidiary YouTube. Google pointedly failed yesterday to blame the Chinese authorities for the cyber attacks which targeted its email service and its corporate infrastructure. But reading between the lines, it is clear that the hackers were not just patriotic computer geeks, but professionals in search of dissidents and the \"source codes\" of defence firms. Google's motives may be mixed, but it has, at last, done the right thing. The hackers mounted a transnational attack on privacy by trying to obtain user identifier information stored, not in China, but in the US. In patrolling its own firewall, it attempted to breach others which are just as sensitive to their owners. This will not be lost on an international community keen, thus far, to do business with China. The cost of that engagement to the security of corporations around the world may just have grown astronomically. Whoever launched this attack should now be made to pause for thought, because the consequences for China's painstakingly hewn image as a trusted partner on the global economic stage are potentially far reaching. In seeking to track down a handful of domestic enemies, whose threat to domestic stability the government overstates, the hackers have crossed other frontiers that no foreign government, let alone company, would tolerate. Undermining privacy on your own territory is one thing. Doing it on someone else's patch is another. The episode demonstrates the absurdity of the project: the great firewall is a folly which can never be made to co-exist with the demands of becoming the world's largest exporter. Let it crumble, and soon."
