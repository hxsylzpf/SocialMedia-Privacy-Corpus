  "content": "It's been a funny old few months for Kevin Patrick Smith, former doyen of the low budget indie comedy scene turned (increasingly prickly) semi-hack. First he was pilloried for suggesting that fans might put up the cash to fund his next movie, low budget horror flick Red State. Then there was the incident aboard a Southwest Airlines flight from Oakland to Burbank in February, which saw the film-maker railing at staff after he was ejected for being apparently too overweight to fit in his seat. And finally came the negative critical reactions to Cop Out, his first studio movie as a director for hire, which caused Smith to lash out at film writers the world over via Twitter earlier this week. Now it seems there is finally some good news. Smith has confirmed that Red State will go into production this July, with himself at the helm. Smith is also planning to write and direct a new comedy, Hit Somebody, which will star Seann William Scott as a 70s ice hockey player who likes to use his fists on opponents. There are a number of reasons why Red State, the story of a group of misfits who encounter extreme fundamentalism in middle America, has struggled to find funding. The first is that its central villain is based on Fred Phelps, founder of the controversial militant anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church in Kansas. As a setup, it's not quite Clerks or Mallrats. Secondly, Smith is not exactly in a rich vein of form. 2008's Zack and Miri Make a Porno was supposed to be his comeback movie after a series of duds arguably leading back all the way to 1997's fabulous Chasing Amy, but the critics were non-plussed, and it failed to deliver at the box office. Cop Out, an action comedy starring Bruce Willis, has easily made back its $30m budget at the US box office alone, but its poor critical reception has done little to bolster Smith's reputation as a man whose time has has come and gone. The film-maker remains a notorious figure, whose increasingly tetchy Tweets are regularly picked up and re-reported in the blogosphere. But does he have it in him to make another great movie? And does Red State have the potential to be that film?"
