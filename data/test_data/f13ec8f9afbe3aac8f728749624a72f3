  "content": "What's black, white and red all over? And discreetly stuck on to every member's profile page on Bebo? It's the logo of the Child Exploitation &amp; Online Protection Centre (Ceop). And this is what a panic button looks like in online safety terms \u2013 not, as you may have been led to believe, a giant, flashing, Batphone-esque beacon. Reporting of Facebook's rift with Ceop has been transfixed by this panic button concept, while discussions between Facebook's security team and Ceop have been characterised as hostile, with accusations being lobbed in both directions. With something as important as child safety, don't we deserve more meaningful coverage and a more productive debate? Unarguably, every malicious message, every act of bullying and every hateful comment is unacceptable. And so is every devious and sinister attempt to track down and groom children, which must be identified and dealt with appropriately. So what is there to disagree about? Consider Facebook. In six years, it has grown from a college project to the world's biggest social networking site with 400 million monthly users. It faces an enormous challenge in adjusting its policies on safety, as well as every other corporate issue, to match the scale of its growth. Aware of how incendiary online safety is \u2013 particularly where children are concerned \u2013 Facebook wisely recruited the former FBI agent Max Kelly to oversee security five years ago, and now as many as 200 of the site's 1,200 staff work on it \u2013 from phishing to child grooming. Facebook says it wants to protect children with a safety net rather than a safety button. Last week it added a 24/7 phone hotline, dedicated \u00a35m of ad space to safety education, and improved its reporting procedure. It favours using its vast technical resources to develop algorithms to expose suspicious behaviour. It wants a simplified reporting system that looks and works the same in every country. Now web design is a complex art. Simplifying a \"user interface\" to make a procedure as easy as possible takes time and skill. Facebook isn't perfect, but when you compare its reporting systems with those of MySpace and Bebo, its approach is the most efficient, least cluttered and least confusing. The site has streamlined a system that carefully picks off reports of problems, such as password resets and wonky profile pictures, while sending a report in two clicks. Isn't it worth Ceop learning from that? Bebo does display a Ceop logo on every user profile \u2013 but so small as to be almost pointless. It links not to a reporting form but to an index page on the Ceop site, which links to specialist index pages on each topic, which then link through to specialist charity sites, which then require you to find the link to the section that explains how to get help and register before you can contact someone. It's a dog's dinner. And very far from a \"panic button\". Someone in genuine need had better also be very determined. From Ceop's perspective, Facebook represents the increasingly significant problem of sex offenders using social networking sites to find and abuse victims. Adults may not know Ceop, but it says 5.2 million children now recognise the name and the logo following an education campaign. It claims to have received 253 reports of serious problems on Facebook in the first three months of this year, and wants to know why threequarters of those reports had to come to Ceop directly, rather than through Facebook's reporting procedure. Ceop wants a unified, Ceop-branded reporting system on every site. I don't think that is achievable, because it will never be able to keep up with whatever kids are using these days. I can't see Chatroulette carrying a Ceop logo, and anyway the longer the discussion focuses on a panic button the less time will be dedicated to far more important issues, such as stopping predators and bullies using multiple identities, and preventing children under 13 using the site. Among Ceop's concerns is that reports of threats to child safety are handled by internet experts at Facebook, whereas Ceop uses social workers and police with expertise in identifying and handling disturbing and violent material. Isn't it worth Facebook learning from that? Lastly, it is worth remembering that of those 400 million users around the world every month, the Facebook horror stories are rare. So please, don't have nightmares."
