  "content": "When it comes to the debate over identity cards, forget about Clarence Willcock, the motorist and dry cleaning manager from Finchley, north London, and what happened when PC Harold Muckle asked him to pull over to the kerb back in the winter of 1950. The Ealing comedy of Muckle v Willcock led to the decision by Winston Churchill's Conservative government to abolish Britain's last identity card. More than a half century later, the case has been resurrected and put into battle once again, this time in the argument against the government's latest plans for a national ID card. But the central point in that case - the power of the police to demand \"your papers please\" - simply will not apply to the identity or entitlement card now being proposed. The home secretary, David Blunkett, has repeatedly said that the new card will not be compulsory. Individuals will not have to carry it at all times and the police are not going to be given a new power to demand you produce it. The debate has moved on. It is now about how much information the government has on each of us, how it is used, and what rights are lost by those who don't have what is, after all, being officially called an \"entitlement card\". As Mr Blunkett's white paper made clear earlier this year the proposal is really about setting the first central national database of the 67.5 million who are legally resident in Britain. It is this register, and not the bit of plastic card in our wallet, that is important The white paper makes clear that one of the aims of the scheme is to \"establish for official purposes a person's identity so that there is one definitive record which all government departments can use if they wish.\" Some MPs such as the former chair of Liberty, Fiona Mactaggart, have already told Mr Blunkett that while there was a role for a card that proved identity and no more, \"there is deep anxiety about the privacy implications of data sharing and the fact that people would carry data around with them on the cards\". The government already holds a vast amount of personal information about us, whether it is health records, tax returns, welfare benefit forms, criminal records, local authority records or driving licence data. But the underlying principle remains personal information supplied for one purpose is not used for another. This will not be the case with the identity card register, so the extent of the personal information it holds will be crucial. The government says to comply with the privacy safeguards in the 1998 Data Protection Act it will distinguish between personal data and \"sensitive personal data\". At first sight it sounds a fine distinction. In practice it means the intention is to include on the identity register your name, date and place of birth, home address, unique personal number, national insurance number, passport and driving licence numbers, nationality, sex, photograph, digitised signature, employment status, the card's validity dates and by whom it was issued. It is a long list, but with the exception of employment status, fulfills the criteria of what is necessary \"to prove identity and no more\". The government calls this your \"core personal information\". At present the principles of the data protection legislation would rule out the inclusion of \"sensitive personal data\" such as details of your ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health condition, sexual life or your past life of crime. The Home Office says a more expensive form of identity card scheme, one that would involve the use of a two-dimensional bar code or a memory chip, could be used to store a lot more information - it suggests that some people might want to include details of a medical condition, such as epilepsy or diabetes, that would be helpful to an ambulance crew, or the details of their public transport season ticket. The government stresses that any such extra information on the new identity card would only be included with the consent of the individual themselves. The fear, however, is of \"data creep\". What will start out as a basic identity card will end up as an all-purpose database on each of us. Already we willingly tell banks and others all sorts of details about ourselves in return for services. It is difficult even to register with a newspaper website without revealing your entire personal lifestyle profile. Most of us don't even think twice about giving away our privacy in such circumstances. The danger of \"data creep\" in the national identity card scheme is that we will have helped the government to create an immensely powerful personal database on each of us, not as a result of some damnable Whitehall conspiracy, but because we were only too willing to fill in the form in return for a piece of plastic. \u00b7 Alan Travis is the Guardian's home affairs editor."
