  "content": "A Twitter user trying to code an emoji heart inadvertently discovered a vulnerability which forced the service to temporarily shut down its Tweetdeck client. Twitter has now reopened Tweetdeck, having verified its security fix, but some users are still reporting issues due to caching of the web-based application. The Austrian teenager, who goes by the name Firo online, was experimenting with Tweetdeck, trying to get the service to display the unicode \u2665 character. In the process, he found that anything in a tweet ending with the heart symbol would be treated by Tweetdeck as though it was HTML code, which could be used to change the formatting of tweets, or put an alert on users' screens. Just 14 minutes after discovering the flaw, Firo told Twitter of its existence, but by then it was too late: the vulnerability was in the wild. Ninety minutes later, the first worm \u2013 the name given to a computer attack which is self-replicating \u2013 was created using the flaw, by German IT student @derGeruhn. The tweet uses the same vulnerability to make any user of an affected version of Tweetdeck retweet it automatically. At publication time, it has 81,500 retweets. Although Twitter has announced the flaw is fixed, some users are still reporting issues. The Political Scrapbook blog was hit by derGeruhn's worm on Thursday morning, more than 12 hours after Twitter confirmed the fix. The persistence seems to be related to caching issues: on web-based services, both users' computers and their internet service providers occasionally deliver old versions of webpages to save on bandwidth. Twitter has been asked for further comment on what users can do to be certain they are protected from the vulnerability, but has not responded at publication time.",
