  "content": "Who among us has not taken a picture of our private parts and texted the image to a mate for a laugh or a lover for a bit of flirty fun? Well, quite a lot of us actually. But people do, especially when a little worse the wear for drink. And in an age where social media can lay down a digital trace of one's every youthful indiscretion, the records of these little foolishnesses spell trouble for a whole generation as they make the familiar journey from the folly of youth to the respectability of middle age \u2013 and particular trouble for public figures. Hence Snapchat, a photo messaging app that, after a few seconds, deletes the sent message from the recipient's device and server. Its Stanford University creators deny its purpose is solely for the purpose of sexting, though that is how it has come to be widely used and indeed misused. But any technology that protects our future selves from our teenage stupidities is surely worthy of some degree of praise."
