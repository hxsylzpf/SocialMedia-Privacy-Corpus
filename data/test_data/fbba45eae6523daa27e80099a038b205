  "content": "Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis may have adapted to new editor Ian Katz's digi-tastic regime a little too enthusiastically, judging by Tuesday night's Twitter #fail. Maitlis came a cropper while tweeting about Tuesday's Newsnight, presented by Jeremy Paxman. The elliptical \"Did Bra\" was followed by \"Who knew what In Bradford council about Flowers problems back then? And why didnt they say anythingAsk\". And then \"Arghhh fuck this\", \"Phone. Sorry. It's buggered\" and, in reply to another tweeter, \"it's not the watching its the typing. Why are smartphones so thick\". After a further bungled attempt to tweet about Allan Little's Gettysburg and JFK film, Em threw in the towel \u2013 \"I Give Up. But @alittl film stunning #newsnight\" \u2013 and resorted to the safer Twitter lurker's option, retweeting other users' comments. Monkey's tip of the day: never abuse your appliances (as all Woody Allen fans know).",
