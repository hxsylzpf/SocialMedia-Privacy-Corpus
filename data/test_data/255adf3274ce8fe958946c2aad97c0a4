  "content": "They are the millionaire twins who made a reported $65m after they sued the founder of Facebook for stealing their ideas. Nobody would blame them for driving Ferraris, living a champagne lifestyle and taking a leaf out of Sir Steve Redgrave's book \u2013 the rowing knight famously told interviewers to \"shoot him\" if he ever went near a boat again. But Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are made of sterner stuff. Quite apart from the rigours of studying for an MBA at Oxford University the twins have also signed up for the brutal intensity of the Boat Race. As Tyler explained yesterday, he and his brother are not in rowing for the money. \"Although I've never been an athlete in a very high-profile sport with big salaries, too often we forget about doing something well. It's a foreign concept in modern culture,\" said the 28-year-old after he and his brother were yesterday named in the Oxford squad for the 156th race against Cambridge on the Thames on 3 April. \"For me becoming the best you can be in something that you love, like rowing, is incredibly challenging and what you learn about yourself, the sense of satisfaction as you get older and move on, you'll never forget that. It's huge.\" The twins' ability to cope with competing demands should not be underestimated. They developed the idea for a social networking site while studying at Harvard and then fought a lengthy legal action against Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, claiming he copied their ideas. This ended in an out-of-court settlement for a rumoured $65m in 2008, while the brothers were also training to represent the US in Beijing, where they reached the Olympic pairs final. \"The experience of the law suit and the Olympics helped as it was the first time we had climbed that sort of mountain,\" said Tyler. \"Often people are afraid to be good at more than one thing. I'm not a man who likes to define his identity too narrowly.\""
