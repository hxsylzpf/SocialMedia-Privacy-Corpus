  "content": "The Daily Mail editor-in-chief, Paul Dacre, used a rare public speech last night to attack BBC expansion and the rulings of a leading high court judge, which he claimed were introducing privacy laws via the back door. Opening the annual Society of Editors conference in Bristol, Dacre made an impassioned defence of the popular press and said that the unchecked growth of the BBC had abetted the collapse of ITV's news services. The regional press also needed safeguarding from the \"ubiquity\" of the BBC, which had gone unchecked, he said. \"With its preposterous proposal for 65 ultra-local websites, [the BBC] is going for the jugular of the local newspaper industry. Lines must be drawn in the sand,\" Dacre told the Society of Editors. However, Dacre saved his most stinging attack for the high court judge, Justice David Eady, who he said was harming the British press by imposing a privacy law, with \"arrogant and amoral judgments\". \"The British press is having a privacy law imposed on it, which apart from allowing the corrupt and the crooked to sleep easily in their beds is, I would argue, undermining the ability of mass-circulation newspapers to sell newspapers in an ever more difficult market,\" he said. \"This law is not coming from parliament. No, that would smack of democracy, but from the arrogant and amoral judgments, words I use very deliberately, of one man,\" Dacre added. \"I am referring, of course, to Justice David Eady who has, again and again, under the privacy clause of the Human Rights Act, found against newspapers and their age-old freedom to expose the moral shortcomings of those in high places.\" Dacre highlighted the successful action, presided over by Eady, brought against the News of the World by formula one boss Max Mosley for invasion of privacy earlier this year. \"[Eady] in effect ruled that it is perfectly acceptable for the multimillionaire head of a multibillion sport that is followed by countless young people to pay five women \u00a32,500 to take part in acts of unimaginable sexual depravity with him,\" he said. \"He found for Max Mosley because he had not engaged in a 'sick Nazi orgy' as the News of the World claimed, though for the life of me that seems an almost surreally pedantic logic as some of the participants were dressed in military-style uniform,\" Dacre added. \"Now most people would consider such activities to be perverted, depraved, the very abrogation of civilised behaviour of which the law is supposed to be the safeguard. Not Eady. To him such behaviour was merely 'unconventional',\" he said. Dacre added: \"If mass-circulation newspapers, which, of course, also devote considerable space to reporting and analysis of public affairs, don't have the freedom to write about scandal, I doubt whether they will retain their mass circulations with the obvious worrying implications for the democratic process. \"Now some revile a moralising media. Others, such as myself, believe it is the duty of the media to take an ethical stand. Either way it is a choice, but Justice Eady, with his awesome powers, has taken away our freedom of expression to make that choice.\" Dacre said popular newspapers were being undermined as Britain was being pushed toward the stricter privacy protections of the French and Italian legal systems. He highlighted how, in his role as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission's editors' code committee, he has opposed government moves to limit the freedom of the press. Dacre called for the newspaper industry to promote itself in a more positive way, complaining that the BBC and sections of the liberal media were guilty of a sneering attitude toward the popular press. This had a disproportionate influence on what the judiciary thought of a media that was suffering vanishing revenues, rising cost, shrinking print audiences and the development of a \"cannibalistic\" internet. Against this backdrop, Dacre said, it was time for papers to \"think the unthinkable\" and consider reducing pagination and dropping their cover price to appeal to readers. Regulators and politicians, he added, also needed to allow previously outlawed mergers - particularly in the local press \u2013 to guarantee survival of regional newspapers. \"Too often large parts of our industry only see the dog mess at the bottom of the lamp post and not the illumination and light at the top, now in these difficult times, is the time to celebrate that light,\" Dacre said. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
