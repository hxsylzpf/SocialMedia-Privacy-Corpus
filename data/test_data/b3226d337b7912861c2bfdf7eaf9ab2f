  "content": "The Spanish owner of celebrity magazine Hello! today accused OK! of being fuelled by intense \"obsession and animosity\" in the high court. Eduardo Sanchez Junco told the court OK! copied Hello!'s logos, layouts and editorial style. OK!, which was launched by Richard Desmond in 1993 many years after Hello! first appeared, is seeking \u00a31.75m in damages from the Spanish-owned celebrity title after the latter published six sneaked photographs of the wedding of Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas. In a classic spoiler, Hello! rushed out a wedding special before OK!, which had paid \u00a31m for the exclusive rights to the Douglas pictures. Mr Sanchez admitted he realised the paparazzi photographs would spoil OK!'s exclusive coverage of the wedding but said such a move was par for the course. \"In my opinion the paparazzi did what they always do - spoil an exclusive - and we did what everybody else does, publish what we considered would be of interest to our readers,\" he said. Mr Sanchez also denied Hello! had offered to pay more than OK! for the exclusive rights. He said the total deal the Douglases had agreed with OK! was \u00a31m for the rights plus 25% of any syndication money after OK! had recouped its outlay. This was \"more generous than, or at least equal to\" his offer of $1.5m and 50% of syndication income. Mr Sanchez said he had taken it for granted that OK!'s wedding coverage would be a great success but had to defend the interests of his magazine and provide some coverage for his readers to keep Hello!'s place in the market. If Hello! had not bought the paparazzi pictures, other publications would have purchased them, he said. OK!'s claim that Hello! had intended to cause damage was \"surprising\" when it was OK!'s normal practice to spoil Hello!'s or other magazines' exclusives, he added. Mr Sanchez said his magazine's coverage of Mr Douglas and Ms Zeta Jones had always been fair and balanced and not \"spiteful\" as they had claimed in court. He said Hello! had always treated the couple with \"deference and sympathy\" as this was the magazine's style. \"In our 60-year history we have never tried to damage anyone. Therefore, we would not want to do it to people whom we have always treated fairly and objectively in our reports, portraying them in the best possible light,\" he said. Mr Sanchez agreed with Michael Tugendhat QC, the barrister representing OK! and the Douglases, that his company was known throughout the world by photographers for \"paying generously\". \"Yes, it is known throughout the world, but here in England in particular I find that there are companies much more generous than I am,\" Mr Sanchez said. When asked by Mr Tugendhat whether his company was efficient and correctly administered, Mr Sanchez replied: \"If I was going to give it a mark I would give it six out of 10. What I mean is we are more journalists than businessmen.\" \"The fact that Hello! may not be a magazine trusted by the Douglases I am sorry about that, but it does not seem fair because many, many celebrities trust us.\" \"We have done hundreds of weddings by exclusive, many births by exclusive, and we have never had any problems with anybody, even in those circumstances where we have had the exclusive taken away from us by unauthorised photographs... we have not attached much importance to that.\" Mr Tugendhat suggested that Mr Sanchez had been willing to pay \"much more\" than \u00a31m for the exclusive rights to the Douglas and Zeta Jones wedding. \"Much more? I don't know, but I would have paid more. Double? I believe we would not have done,\" Mr Sanchez replied. To describe OK! getting the story as a disaster for Hello! was an exaggeration, he added, \"but it was bad news\". The case continues."
