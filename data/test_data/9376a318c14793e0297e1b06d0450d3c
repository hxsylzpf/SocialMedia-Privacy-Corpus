  "content": "As Twitter demonstrated what flotation mania really looks like, Deloitte crunched the numbers on the UK's new-issue market this year and revealed an interesting result: floats have done far, far better than the general market. A slight outperformance would be expected since a discount is usually required to sell a job-lot of shares. But the scale is striking. The ten floats of trading companies on London's main market have gained an average of 35% in value since listing. That's about seven times as great as the advance in the FTSE 100 index, using an average from the moment of each company's listing. Everybody knows about Royal Mail's 70% gain. Other big risers include housebuilder Crest Nicholson (76%), estate agent Countrywide (59%) and cables firm Hellerman Tyton (61%). The only major loser has been Esure, down 22%. A sample size of only ten doesn't allow many firm conclusions to be drawn. But one seems clear: it looks as if fund managers, burned by their experience in the go-go years before the banking crash, have learned to drive a harder bargain when they are buying shares from private equity firms. Nine of the ten \u2013 the exception was the postal service \u2013 were backed by private equity."
