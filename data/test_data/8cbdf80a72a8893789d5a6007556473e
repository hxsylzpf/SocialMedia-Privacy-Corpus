  "content": "The government is to review libel law in a bid to stop wealthy individuals and corporations using it as a means to muzzle the media. The law commission will examine alleged abuses and in particular the issue of gagging writs and letters. Critics say libel laws are a playground for the rich and an overhaul is long overdue - ordinary people can't afford to mount action and those that do often use it to silence their opponents. Robert Maxwell was notorious for using writs and injunctions to stop journalists prying into his business and Jeffrey Archer, who is currently serving a prison sentence for perjury, was also notoriously litigious. Experts at the commission will investigate whether the use of gagging writs denies the right to freedom of speech enshrined in the new Human Rights Act. There have been calls for a reliable defence of public interest to protect newspapers which publish potentially libellous articles. There will also be a fresh look at the laws governing libel on the internet."
