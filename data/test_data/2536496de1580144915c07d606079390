  "content": "The fight between James Packer and David Gyngell was a source of mirth, wonder and gags across social media, first in astonishment at a very public bust-up, then about News Corp's efforts to protect its exclusive, expensive photos. Initially there were no pictures, so people invented their own: And evoked memories of another famous (if fictional) media bust-up: Twitter users displayed a wealth of creativity: Then, after winning a reported bidding war to buy the photos, News Corp released its first pics, covered in its branding: Sending social media into a tailspin: And spawning a parody account: Actually, make that two parody accounts: The watermark was fodder for all manner of visual gags: Including the reinterpretation of memorable movie moments: And a new take on the classic \"what charter boat\" insurance ad: The NT News got in on the act: As did SBS: And someone mocked up an elegant exclusive picture of the ABC boss Mark Scott: In some images it was hard to see anything behind the watermark: Some argued the technique should be taken to a whole new level next time: A few Twitter users sought to make a political point, arguing News Corp should employ watermarking to take responsibility for other matters: News Corp's morning tabloids were previewed online: As editors jostled to come up with the best play on words: The most cheeky headline came from the NT News (paying homage to a previous infamous splash): The whole unedifying display was all too much for some people:"
