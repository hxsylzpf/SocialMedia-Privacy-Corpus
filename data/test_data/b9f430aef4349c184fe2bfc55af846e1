  "content": "Sienna Miller's life was made intolerable by a \"campaign of harassment\" by paparazzi photographers, her lawyer told the high court yesterday. Details of the alleged campaign emerged during a preliminary hearing as the actor launched legal proceedings against the Big Pictures photography agency, claiming harassment and invasion of privacy. Miller's counsel, David Sherborne, said the agency had made her life \"intolerable,\" and pursuit by photographers and the publication of intrusive images had caused her \"substantial alarm, fear and enormous distress\". Miller, whose films include The Edge of Love and Alfie, is claiming damages from the agency and its founder, Darryn Lyons. The court heard that the actor had been relentlessly pursued since June, resulting in a \"gross and intolerable violation of her basic rights\". Lyons and the agency are contesting the claims. Last month Miller accepted \u00a315,000 in damages from the Daily Star for photos published in the paper. The paper, which settled the matter out of court, admitted in a public apology that \"Ms Miller was extremely harassed and distressed by persistent pursuit and intimidating tactics adopted by numerous paparazzi\". In February Miller gave evidence at the criminal trial of her ex-boyfriend's brother, Otis Ferry, in which she described photographers pursuing her like \"lunatics\". The case forms part of a growing trend in which celebrities have used the Human Rights Act to claim protection from the media, according to lawyers. At the end of yesterday's hearing the judge, Mr Justice Eady, ruled that the case should go to trial in January."
