  "content": "Three 13-year-old boys have been arrested on suspicion of assault after a video showing a boy being viciously beaten was shared on Facebook. The video, which has been viewed more than 100,000 times after it was posted online, shows a 12-year-old being repeatedly punched and kicked by two boys in an alley. He escapes into a back garden and knocks on the window of the house for help, but is caught up by a boy who is chasing him. In a statement released on Friday evening, West Yorkshire police said it has spoken to the victim's family, who have confirmed he is safe and well. Three teenagers, from the Heaton area of Bradford, were arrested and held in custody on Friday, it added. DCI Terry Long, of Bradford district police, said: \"I would like to thank the public for bringing this incident to our attention, and would like to reassure them that any similar reports will be dealt with positively.\" The video has since been removed from Facebook.",
