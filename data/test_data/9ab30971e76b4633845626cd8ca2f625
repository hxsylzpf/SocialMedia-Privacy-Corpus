  "content": "Morrissey's much-anticipated life story Autobiography has rocketed to No 1 in the Amazon.co.uk bestseller charts after it was officially released last night, leapfrogging David Walliams' Demon Dentist, Eleanor Catton's Man Booker Prize-winning The Luminaries and Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy. A queue has been building since 4pm yesterday outside the Akademibokhandeln Nordstan bookshop in Gothenburg, Sweden, where the singer-songwriter will be appearing for a book signing at 5pm local time today. Details on the bookshop's website stipulate that photography is OK, \"but no close-ups allowed\", and that Morrissey will only sign copies of his book, \"not guitars, loose papers or similar\". In the UK, the Big Green Bookshop in north London held a midnight opening and began selling the book at 00:01 this morning, and UK high street bookselling chain Waterstones reported that \"half the people in head office have already bought a copy. It is flying out this morning. It is very much a book that we should do fantastically well with. We'd love to have events with him \u2013 time will tell if we do. We're ready for him!,\" a spokesman said. Reactions on Twitter to the book, released as a Penguin Classic paperback and as an ebook after weeks of speculation, were irreverent. Comic novelist @jennycolgan tweeted a picture of the book's first page, with the comment \"OMINOUS\". Opening page of the Morrissey book. OMINOUS. RT @jackseale pic.twitter.com/Xh7Ei1oRyl \u2014 Jenny Colgan (@jennycolgan) October 17, 2013 Earlier, Times' columnist Caitlin Moran @caitlinmoran, had suggested a title for the book: \"Very much hope that @simon_price01's title for the Morrissey autobiography \u2013 \"Mein Booky-Wook\" \u2013 catches on.\" Very much hope that @simon_price01's title for the Morrissey autobiography - \"Mein Booky-Wook\" - catches on. \u2014 Caitlin Moran (@caitlinmoran) October 15, 2013 In anticipation of the book's literary qualities, Buzzfeed alluded to Morrissey's broad reading habits, with a list of his finest literary moments: in response to a question from LA Weekly in 2007, \"I love Jane Austen. She's a genius. Do you agree?\", Morrissey replied \"Oh, good grief, yes.\""
