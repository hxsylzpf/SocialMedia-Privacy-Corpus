  "content": "Hollywood is to bring the popular Twilight saga back to life with a series of short films by female directors, reports the New York Times. Studio Lionsgate will release the episodes, titled The Storytellers \u2014 New Creative Voices of The Twilight Saga, via Facebook with backing from the Women in Film organisation. Each will focus on a different popular character from the blockbuster supernatural romance. The directors \u2013 as yet unannounced \u2013 will be chosen by a group of judges which includes Stephenie Meyer, author of the Twilight novels which formed the basis of Lionsgate's five movies, and star Kristen Stewart. The paucity of female directors in Hollywood has come in for increasing criticism in recent years, despite the Oscar-winning success of notable exceptions such as The Hurt Locker's Kathryn Bigelow. Last week a landmark global study backed by the United Nations found that Hollywood continues to encourage gender discrimination by failing to find strong roles for women on the big screen. Meanwhile, a 2013 report commissioned by the Sundance film festival suggested that female directors were struggling in mainstream Hollywood despite appearing in greater numbers in the field of independent film. In July this year, a further study revealed that 75% of employees on blockbuster film sets are male. \"The female voice is something that has become more and more important to me as I've worked in the film industry,\" said Meyer. \"I'm honoured to be working with Women In Film, Lionsgate and Facebook on a project dedicated to giving more women a chance to be heard creatively.\" \"More people than ever before are creating, discovering and engaging with videos on Facebook,\" added Facebook's Dan Rose. \"This collaboration with Stephenie Meyer, Lionsgate and Women In Film is a great opportunity to engage 'Twilight's' massive global audience on Facebook through an innovative premium video program.\" Released between 2008 and 2012, the five Twilight films have grossed more than $3.3bn worldwide."
