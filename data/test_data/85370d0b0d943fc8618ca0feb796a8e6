  "content": "Ed Miliband has developed an unlikely fanbase of smitten teenage girls, after a 17-year-old student declared her admiration for the Labour leader on Twitter and prompted a flood of replies from other young women. A student, known only as Abby, caused a Twitter storm after declaring herself leader of the #milifandom \u2013 a group of enthusiastic Ed Miliband admirers. Fandoms are usually reserved for the likes of Justin Bieber and One Direction, but the #milifandom hashtag has been trending, with scores of young females sharing their affection for the leader. Abby says the Milifandom, which started last week, is \"a movement against the distorted media portrayal of Ed\". Since then, she has reached 12,000 followers on Twitter, with tweeters using the hashtag to express their support. One tweeter described having an \"unexplainable emotional connection\" to the Labour leader, while others posted pictures of the politician with a crown of flowers. Caity later tweeted to say she was supposed to be revising. Many of Miliband fans have been moved to replace their profile pictures with images of him. The Labour party responded to the flood of complimentary comments, saying: \"We didn't see this coming \u2026if you're fired up about Ed, changing Britain, and making your voice heard, we'd love you to be on the team \u2192 labour.org.uk/volunteer.\" Abby later told fellow Miliband supporters that the focus should be on Labour's policies and what they would do for the country. She said: \"#Milifandom is not a joke. It's young people angry at the distorted presentation of Ed, trying to correct that + make themselves heard.\" She added that the movement would remind politicians that they could not ignore young people.",
