  "content": "Spare a thought for the Radio 4 announcer who made the unfortunate slip of suggesting that Albert Speer was once in Spandau Ballet. Hitler's architect never troubled the hit parade, but was sentenced at the Nuremberg trials to 20 years in prison, most of it spent at Spandau prison in west Berlin. The on-air gaffe on Wednesday afternoon had the unlikely consequence of Gary Kemp's new romantics trending on Twitter. \"The nice announcer lady on Radio 4 just said that Albert Speer was in Spandau Ballet. That can't be right,\" tweeted Ben Goldacre. \"Apparently Albert Speer spent 20 years in Spandau Ballet according to Radio 4,\" said Michael Guitar. \"It's not 'True' but it IS pure 'Gold'.\" Whether the resulting Twitter frenzy will result in an extra few listeners for Radio 4's Albert Speer's Walk Around the World, Michael Butt's play about the imaginary journeys of Speer during his time in prison, which airs on Wednesday afternoon, remains to be seen."
