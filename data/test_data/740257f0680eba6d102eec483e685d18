  "content": "The government has struck a deal with Facebook to field ideas from the public on further state spending cuts, it emerged today. Facebook's \"spending challenge channel\" is an expansion of the social networking site's \"Democracy UK\" pages, set up during the run-up to the general election, and will be used to take suggestions from the public for saving money ahead of the spending review. The chancellor, George Osborne, has already asked public sector workers for their views on cuts, to the fury of one trade union. The government claims the exercise has resulted in 60,000 suggestions being put forward in just two weeks. Now, a call has been made to the wider public as \"taxpayers and users of services\" to submit and vote on ideas for where cuts can be made. To complement the online consultation exercise, ministers will meet the public to hear views and suggestions first hand. Writing in today's Sun, Osborne urged readers as taxpayers to come up with ideas between now and the end of August to help the government cut the deficit. \"People know this new coalition government has got to deal with the debt we've inherited if Britain is to avoid economic disaster. That's what the Budget was all about. And as every family knows, when you've got less money you have to spend it better .That means getting your ideas.\" He went on: \"You pay the taxes that fund our public services, so you should also have a say on how we improve public services.\" David Cameron said: \"We are really excited about having Facebook involved in the spending challenge. There's enormous civic spirit in this country where people want to take control and do things in a different way. We are giving people an opportunity with Facebook and I am sure that they will take it.\" Facebook says that more than 1 million people participated on the democracy page in election day polls. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said: \"The government's willingness to reach out and engage with Facebook users is going to go a long way because I'm sure that all the people using Facebook in the UK have a lot of great ideas on how they could do this. \"It's really innovative to open up policy making and engage the public in this way to try and create more social change.\" Osborne today published a sample of ideas put forward by public sector workers in the first phase of consultation. These include merging back-office services for public sector organisations, renegotiating government IT contracts, and switching off office computers over the weekend."
