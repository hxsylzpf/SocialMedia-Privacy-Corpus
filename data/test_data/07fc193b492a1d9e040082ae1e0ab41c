  "content": "Britain's internet service providers are struggling to deal with an intelligence community which doesn't understand how to use the information it receives, according to the head of the industry's trade association. That lack of understanding is compounded by a lack of consultation with the industry when proposing specialist legislation, according to the ISP's Association (ISPA). James Blessing, ISPA's chair, says that legislation such as the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) gives \"powers and abilities and access to all the wrong sort of people who think it's a great idea, but don't understand what they're doing with it\". And because the legislation already gives police and the security services \"everything \u2026 they need to actually access the information they need\", failures often take the form of the authorities failing to ask for the information which would actually be useful. \"When people turn round and say 'well, we can't get this information', you go, 'but you didn't ask',\" he added. \"We don't have this piece of information but we've got all this round the outside of it that will probably actually get you to that piece of information if you'd asked for all these little bits.\" In comments from an interview with industry journal Cable shared exclusively with the Guardian, Blessing said new laws weren't needed to change the system, and that the \"edge cases\" which currently fall through the gaps are \"never going to work\". \"What you have to do is concentrate on the 99% that fits within the legislation we've got,\" he said. \"Tweak the legislation we've got, fine, go for it. Tell us what you want, talk to us as service providers, and we'll have a conversation about how we get the information you actually want and need in a way that helps you.\" Blessing's comments come after the ISPA expressed its \"disappointment\" at the lack of a consultation from the Home Office on new proposals requiring ISPs to retain extra information about users' IP addresses. \"IP addresses can generally only be used to identify a subscriber and not an individual,\" IPSA said in a statement. \"The Home Office needs to do more to consult with industry on its proposals.\" \"Once again there has been a distinct lack of engagement with industry. The government committed to a review of communications data capabilities by David Anderson QC which we supported, yet the Home Secretary appears to have pre-judged the inquiry by re-emphasising the need for a new Communications Data bill, a bill that both relevant parliamentary committees rejected.\" The Open Rights Group has also spoken out against the new requirements, with its executive director, Jim Killock, telling the Guardian that \"in expecting companies to spend millions on recording IP addresses, they are embedding Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (Dripa) and Ripa, both of which are supposed to be reviewed in just over 12 months. \"They are also dealing with a problem that exists because the mobile companies continue to rely on out-of-date technology that means hundreds of people use the same IP addresses. The government ought to be asking providers to invest in IPv6, rather than upgrading their current, limited technology, just for the purposes of further logging our movements.\" Blessing cites IP matching as a major example of the disconnect of technical ability between ISPs and those requesting data from them. \"You speak to some networks and the number of requests for devices they know definitely couldn't have done what they said it's done. Or, 'we want to know where in the country this router is'. And you go, 'it's under my desk'. And they go very quiet when you point out they're talking about the wrong device. \"That's because the people doing the searching stuff need more training, need more skills. The technical guys, the guys on the ground who actually do all the forensic work, who actually know how a network is built, yes they know it. But the guys at the front desk haven't got a clue. \"It's like putting someone on a swivel chair, giving them a shotgun, and saying, 'OK, just hit that target over there. Twice. In a row.' At that point they start spinning round and they go, 'oh I'll just keep on firing'. And you do get that, you can spot when someone is firing lots of scatter gun to try and catch a certain thing. And it happens a lot.\" GCHQ's 'jihad on tech' can only fail"
