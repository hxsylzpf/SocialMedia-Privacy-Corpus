  "content": "A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of hacking into a police computer, it emerged yesterday. The youth, 17, from north London, was arrested in connection with unauthorised access to the Devon and Cornwall police website on June 29, on suspicion of an offence under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. The website home page was replaced with one displaying the word \"hacked\". The teenager has been bailed to reappear at a London police station on August 31. A police spokesman said: \"It is important to note that the force website is a stand-alone system and carries only public information.\""
