  "content": "Platforms such as Facebook will suck as much as \u00a3450m out of the UK news industry in a decade's time, according to a new forecast. A report by strategy consultants OC&amp;C predicts that news producers, especially newspapers, are still to feel the full impact of the shift by younger generations to using social media to find their news. OC&amp;C says that, based on the impact of platforms on other mature media markets such as music, about 30% of annual digital revenue could go to platforms. That would mean the likes of Facebook and Apple taking between \u00a3200m and \u00a3250m a year this year, rising to between \u00a3400m and \u00a3450m from 2026. The organisation says that the impact will be felt in both digital advertising, where platforms are already taking a 30% cut to sell ads for publishers on content such as Facebook's Instant Articles and on Apple News, and in subscriptions. Though many publishers with successful digital subscriptions such as the Financial Times and the New York Times do not currently sell the majority of such products through platforms, OC&amp;C predicts that will become more common in the future. The \u00a3450m OC&amp;C says will be taken by platforms comes on top of continuing disruption to news from the shift to digital that has already cost the UK industry almost half its total revenue \u2013 about \u00a33.5bn \u2013 over the past decade, and will see further falls as digital ads and subscriptions fail to make up for lost print advertising and sales. The report says: \"Most of this would hit the bottom line directly, presenting another challenge to the industry's finances \u2013 and could force brands that have been household names for decades or even centuries to close or radically reinvent themselves.\" The report also says that while more than two-thirds of over-55s still go straight to trusted news brands, about 41% of those under 34 use social media and other platforms as their primary way of getting news. The report says: \"These stark generational differences suggest a future in which platforms displace trusted brands as the key link between news content and audiences.\" OC&amp;C associate partner Toby Chapman added: \"The behavioural shift is kind of inevitable ... you can't just close your ears and pretend it isn't happening.\" The report also warns that the shift to consuming through platforms presents other challenges for news provides beyond lost revenue, with news organisations reduced to mere financiers of journalism that appears elsewhere. Despite the bleak picture painted by the report, its authors say there are a number of measures news publishers can take to mitigate the impact of the shift to consumption on platforms. These include making sure their brand is prominent, both to stand out and to bring people to their own sites, and making the most of partnerships with platforms. They also suggest collaborating with other news organisations and lobbying government for protection. Chapman said: \"There's not doubt this is a bit of a warning signal for the industry, and needs to be treated seriously, but it's not a foregone conclusion. What happened in music does not need to be what happens in news.\""
