  "content": "When BBC Today programme presenter Evan Davis tried to get a job for a Latvian he met at a friend's BBQ by telling his 125,000 Twitter followers that this \"lovely guy\" would have to go home unless he got one, he evidently didn't think Latvia would take offence. But it has. The broadcaster has found himself under fire from the Latvian authorities who have accused him of comparing their country to Mordor, the realm of the evil Sauron in The Lord of the Rings. \"Latvia is not Mordor. Economy is on the rise for the 12 consecutive quarter and unemployment down + the country is gorgeous,\" the Latvia Institute tweeted back. So there."
