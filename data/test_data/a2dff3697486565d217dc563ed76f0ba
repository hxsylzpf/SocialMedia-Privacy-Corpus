  "content": "Here's the thing: I just don't get online clothes-shopping. DVDs, washing powder, large consignments of alcohol: I can see why it's easier to buy these online \u2013 but clothes? I can't get round the basic principle that I need to know what something looks like on me before I part with my cash. So Tesco's new virtual fitting-room, which launched for women only on Wednesday via Facebook for a two-month trial, sounds like a great idea: upload a couple of photographs, and you can create a 3D version of yourself and try on items from the F&amp;F clothing range. It's not the first time such technology has been mooted \u2013 a Berlin-based \"virtual tailor\" called UPcload, which photographs your body shape via webcam and then recommends clothes to fit you, is being tested in Germany and the US, but doesn't go live until next month. So how does the online fitting-room work? First you upload a photograph of your face \u2013 guidance notes suggest avoiding glasses, and sweeping your hair back; unfortunately, the only photograph I have to hand has a fringe obscuring half my forehead, but needs must. Then you choose a hairstyle (I went for a ponytail) and skin-tone, inform the app of your height, weight and measurements (the shy among us will appreciate the assurances that this information won't be shared), and \u2013 ta-dah \u2013 after a moment's thinking time, there she is: your avatar, a computer-generated dress-up doll who appears to be wearing your face. My own looks disturbingly like Danniella Westbrook, and is so slim that I'm convinced the app errs on the side of flattering; but I have fun testing outfits. There are no great surprises \u2013 the clothes I thought might suit me, like a short turquoise dress, look OK; and the ones I knew wouldn't, like a hot-pink shift, look awful. And though we could never call this anything other than a marketing ploy \u2013 a button appears next to your avatar for each garment you try on, inviting you to buy it \u2013 in those terms, it's pretty useful: if you decide to buy something, the app uses your measurements to tell you which size to go for. That turquoise dress came and I tried it on in the flesh: not exactly the same fit as on my avatar, but I liked it. All in all, were other retailers to follow suit, online clothes-shopping might look much more appealing.",
