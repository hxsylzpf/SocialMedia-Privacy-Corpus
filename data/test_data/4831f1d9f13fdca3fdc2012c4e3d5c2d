  "content": "Digital media company Mashable has raised about \u00a310m in a deal with CNN-owner Turner which will see a commercial partnership for video production and \"advertising opportunities\" between the two companies. As part of the deal Turner's TBS and TNT businesses will partner with the internet news provider to co-develop and distribute video content. The agreement will see Turner Entertainment getting access to Mashable's Velocity platform \u2013 an analytics tool which predicts what is going to be popular on social media. It will also mean the online media service will distribute some of the US broadcaster's shows as well as creating \"cross-sales opportunities\". Kevin Reilly, chief creative officer for Turner Entertainment and president of TBS and TNT, will join Mashable's board of directors. Mashable will use the money to expand its video services, including linear TV, and focus on growing the company's branded video division. Money has also come from Time Warner Investments, Updata Partners and others in this latest round of funding. Chief executive and founder of Mashable, Pete Cashmore said: \"Tech is the current vehicle giving this generation a voice; it is the new cultural lynchpin on which all other creative pursuits rely. There is enormous opportunity for a brand that combines tech credibility with cultural influence. Mashable brings that to this next era of media.\" He added: \"The most exciting thing right now is the future of TV. Turner, home to the top rated cable networks, is the perfect partner to bring the best of tech and digital culture to TV in fresh ways.\" Mashable launched its own studios division in June creating serialised video programming and \"branded entertainment\" for the company's website. The company says it has doubled video production over the past year. Recently Mashable struck a deal with France 24, the international news and current affairs public service broadcaster, to launch a French-language version of the social media news site.",
