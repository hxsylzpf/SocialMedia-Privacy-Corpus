  "content": "A major conference next month will consider the age-old - but always pressing - question: what makes good journalism? Clearly, there are new challenges - such as the growth of social media such as Facebook and Twitter - and the phenomenon of WikiLeaks. Then there are modern problems, not least the News of the World phone-hacking scandal and the controversy about privacy injunctions. What should be the role model for best journalistic practice? The BBC perhaps, or CNN, or Al-Jazeera? What of the culture inside Britain's major national newspapers? And, for that matter, what about the standards of web-based journalism? There may be answers, or many more questions, at the third annual summer conference to be staged at the University of Westminster's department of journalism, in company with the British Journalism Review (BJR), on 7-8 June. The keynote speaker will be Richard Sambrook, former head of the BBC World Service. And the panellists include a clutch of media professors - Natalie Fenton (Goldsmiths), Tim Luckhurst (Kent), Julian Petley (Brunel) and Robert Picard (Reuters Institute, Oxford). Working journalists will be represented by Nick Davies of The Guardian, Deborah Davies of Channel 4's Dispatches and Matt Wells, The Guardian's blogs editor. The conference will conclude on 8 June with the presentation of the BJR's Charles Wheeler award for outstanding contribution to broadcast journalism. That will be followed by an interview with Alastair Campbell by BJR editor Bill Hagerty. The fee is \u00a3165 (with a concessionary rate of \u00a385 for students). It covers a lunch, refreshments, two wine receptions, all conference documentation and administration costs. To register, download the registration form.
