  "content": "After the recent Sony email hacking, I'm thinking it might be time to ditch the medium altogether and go back to good old phone conversations. Instead of firing off angry emails, it's time to air our grievances ear to ear, just like we used to in 1994, sitting at a desk that held only a quality pen in a holster, a swinging metal ball ornament and one of those smart leather blotting-paper holders bound in leather. Good times. Because it's increasingly clear that typing out our deepest feelings in electronic format and pressing send might not be the best option. Everything is captured forever in the cloud these days and that cloud is now dripping with our ugliest thoughts. I feel as though it's pretty much guaranteed that everything we've written and wish we hadn't is eventually bound to rain down on us \u2013 like bird poop, only less lucky. A simple phone conversation might save a thousand future shames. The problem with going back to using a telephone, is that I, like many others, have become phone-phobic. While I bang away on an mobile device all day with my lumpy fingers, voice my opinions every two seconds on social media and feel deep anxiety unless my phone is within three metres of my vicinity, I hardly ever use the thing for its original purpose \u2013 to talk to people. And I rarely get calls. When my phone does ring, I fear the worst has happened, and often don't answer. The phone on my desk at work never rings either. Everything, but everything, is done over email. A call seems slightly archaic; like the Rachel cut or carbs. Things were different once. As a child, I was addicted to the telephone. It was a link to the outside world. There was only one phone in our family home and if it rang all the kids would run and fight to see who could get to it first. Most kids practised their phone answering technique, just like we did our written signatures for all of those cheques we were going to write in the future. And we grew up with parents who put on \"phone voice\" \u2013 a little posher than the regular one they used to yell at us to clean our rooms. Answering the home phone was a daily game of roulette. Any given call could either be a best friend wanting to discuss the latest episode of Beverly Hills 90210, or a boring adult trying to get hold of our parents who had already drilled us to say: \"I'll check to see if they're here\". We only learned to distrust phone conversations as we got older. If the Sony hacking revelations reveal anything, it's that of all the millions of emails sent in every workplace every day of the week, if someone wants to find one of them offensive, it's probably there for the picking and will be easier to pick at in the future. So, in the spirit of trying to hang less skeletons up in my personal online cupboard, I'm going to try and call more in 2015, instead of emailing or sending a text. I might even gain those few extra hours spent replying to every work or party plan 75 times before any consensus is reached. And I'll start turning over my new leaf by phoning friends rather than messaging them on Facebook or Twitter this Christmas. Pity most of them probably won't pick up."
