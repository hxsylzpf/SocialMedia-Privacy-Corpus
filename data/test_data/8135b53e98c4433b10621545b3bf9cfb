  "content": "Condi had her boots. Kissinger his aphrodisiac. Hillary \u2026 had her text messages. At least she did, until Adam Smith and Stacy Lambe called it quits (or as they put it, \"TTYL\") on their explosively viral site Texts From Hillary. Most people would say that Smith and Lamble used the easy photo-sharing and meme-disseminating aspects of the popular Tumblr platform to take \"what started as a joke at the bar between two friends\" and turn it into a wildly popular Hillary-celebrating microsite. Those people would be wrong. They rode the wave of Clinton's own growing popularity \u2013 and she has not exactly always been popular. From her nadir in 1996, when her favourable rating was only 43%, to mid-campaign in February 2008 when it went down below 50 again, Clinton has never been as popular, except for immediately after the Lewinsky scandal. But from the moment she took the reins of the state department in 2009 until now, her approval ratings have stayed in the 60s, and that despite Americans' general lack of interest in the machinations in Foggy Bottom. What gives, then? It can't just be the (incredibly flattering) longer hairstyles she's been sporting since ending her presidential campaign almost four years ago, nor just the stylish sunglasses she was sporting in the photos used by Lambe and Smith to generate their meme. She still wears her once-derided trouser suits, is still practised in the exercise of political power, still married to Bill and still has more than a few vociferous fans (though, thankfully, the post-campaign Puma phenomenon appears to have died down). And it's definitely not just about the nuances of her smart power doctrine nor how it is used in practice, as it is hard to imagine that the meme's 100,000 followers on Tumblr and Facebook are all foreign policy aficionados. What she does project now \u2013 which she never quite convincingly did before \u2013 is a sense of palpable contentment with her life and her work. Granted, she and husband Bill are far better off financially than they ever were before, her only daughter is married and settled down and she is openly talking about retirement, like more than a few other people her age. And for the candidate who promised to be the one voters would want answering the 3am phone call, she's now actually doing it \u2013 and doing it at a time when the world is chaotic and the global power structures in flux. She's managing the foreign policy and foreign relations of the most powerful country in the world with, as far as we know, the full support and thanks of the president of the United States. What's not to be happy about? And for a politician hardly known for her common touch \u2013 recall, if you will, the infamous cookie imbroglio \u2013 there's no better evidence that she's completely comfortable than the pictures of her with Smith and Lambe, and the submission she herself signed off on. This is a woman whose ability to down a shot of Crown Royal and choked-up moment barely four years ago inspired tomes questioning her authenticity \u2013 but now she autographs a printed-out comic, of a sort, and the internet goes wild (and begins speculating that she'll run for president in 2016). Of course, it doesn't hurt that she's said barely a controversial thing in four years (diplomats rarely do), and that she appears to be the hardest-working, least-camera-chasing member of the Obama administration. After so many years in the harsh glare of the electoral spotlight, she's managed to build a little mystery about what's behind those sunglasses and on that BlackBerry, and everyone likes a little mystery."
