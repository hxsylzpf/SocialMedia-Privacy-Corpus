  "content": "Actor Francesca Annis is threatening legal action against the Daily Mail after it published allegations about her relationship with film star Ralph Fiennes. Solicitors acting for Annis have written to the Mail claiming the article published yesterday, headlined \"Why I won't stop my lover Ralph straying, by Francesca Annis\", is defamatory and an invasion of her privacy. \"Ms Annis found the comments attributed to her and/or her 'friends' in the article highly pernicious, defamatory, and, despite being untrue, a gross invasion of her privacy,\" her solicitors Schillings said. \"Ms Annis has striven to keep her personal life private and will continue doing so in the future. However, the untrue allegations attributed to her cannot be left unchallenged.\" Schillings went on to say that Annis did not give the Mail an interview and has not told \"friends\" what she is alleged to have told them in the article. However, Schillings added that Annis and Fiennes have now split up. \"Without prejudice to her desire to have the media respect her right to a private life, and, in an effort to prevent further dissemination of the untruths published in the Daily Mail's article, Ms Annis confirms today that she and Ralph Fiennes are to separate.\" MediaGuardian.co.uk contacted the Mail but it had made no comment by the time of publication. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."
