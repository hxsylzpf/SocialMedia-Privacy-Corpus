  "content": "There is something profoundly unsettling and unedifying at the heart of the contemporary information economy. Captivated by shiny devices, services and apps, manipulated by information merchants, and unprotected by barnacle-encrusted law and institutions, we are losing - or have lost - control. This is the message of American legal scholar, Julie E Cohen, a prominent thinker on networked information technologies, visiting London to give the annual Law and Media and Communications lecture at the LSE on Wednesday evening. Cohen, a law professor at Georgetown University and expert on privacy, data protection and intellectual property, sees striking parallels between our current situation and the upheavals that followed the emergence of industrialisation and consumer capitalism. In those eras, rapid economic and technological change ran roughshod over the lives of ordinary people, requiring legal institutions and frameworks to account, slowly and with embedded compromise, for novel harms, losses and systemic concerns \u2013 from abusive working conditions and vast population displacement, to the damage wrought by defective mass-market goods and toxic waste. Today's problems are different, but no less significant, argues Cohen. While regulators chisel inconsequentially at the beguiling monoliths of private power that configure today's information flows and dams, we the citizens have been reduced to raw material \u2013 sourced, bartered and mined in a curiously fabricated \"privatised commons\" of data and surveillance. This oxymoronic terrain is what Cohen calls \"the biopolitical economy of informational capitalism\". In her lecture Cohen outlines the deal we have struck with the \"surveillance-innovation complex\", involving a deeply worrying complicity between state and private actors - \"a mutually satisfactory game of regulatory arbitrage\". Cohen describes how today's information merchants have exploited a narrative valorising \"openness\" and \"participation\", through the particular form of voluntary, public and perpetual sharing of personal information with platforms. This has been the driving factor, she argues, in normalising \"a distinctly Western, democratic type of surveillance society, in which surveillance is conceptualised first and foremost as a matter of efficiency and convenience\". Cohen is unapologetic in countering the standard internet preoccupation with totalitarian states and their censorial ambitions, with the experience of Hollywood moguls, who have, over the past two decades, achieved a deep and seemingly permanent rearrangement of information flows, subject to loosely-overseen (and often overreaching) copyright law. Similarly, she is to the point about the symbiosis between state and private actors on surveillance, or about the way that intermediaries structurally enable harassment that reflects and reproduces traditional hierarchies of power. With reference to scandals such as Gamergate and other instances of hate speech and discrimination online, she argues that those who adopt a position of neutrality fail to protect the vulnerable. Cohen is one of an increasing number of scholars (others include Manuel Castells, John Naughton, Karine Nahon and Giorgio Agamben) and commentators preoccupied with the magnitude of the challenges we face when citizens, lured by Mickey Mouse-faced smartwatches or the reassuring primary colours of a search engine, fall prey to a parasitic system that magnifies inequality and disenfranchises individuals. It is clear that we need to rethink law, entitlements and institutions around how we regulate information, without consenting to untold pages of unread, non-negotiable, we'll-take-everything-but-your-firstborn-child terms and conditions. Her major insight is that existing hierarchies of power are magnified in and through our legacy institutions, law and code, as well as in transnational trade, standards and protocols. Power is ubiquitous - it routes around blockage and regulation, from tax to human rights. But the future of our networked information society depends on ensuring that the system we create counters, and does not reinforce, power asymmetries, allowing all of us to be treated as citizens, not as raw material. \u2022 Julie E Cohen's lecture is at the Old Theatre, Old Building, of the LSE, at 18.30 GMT tonight. The lecture will be recorded and available online."
