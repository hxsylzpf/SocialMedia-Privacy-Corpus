  "content": "\u2022 Some more details have emerged about the Hotmail attack that left thousands of users' account details exposed online. Yesterday it emerged that more than 10,000 users were affected: Microsoft has now confirmed that it was the result of a phishing attack and that it would be blocking the accounts that had been exposed. \u2022 We all know that spending too much time online can be unhealthy for anyone - but researchers in Taiwan have found that a number of conditions increase the likelihood of internet addiction among children. According to New Scientist, research suggests that depression, ADHD and social phobia are among the leading indicators - in a study that is, admittedly, based on self-reported diagnoses. \u2022 This week is the 40th anniversary of the first ever episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus - and what better way to celebrate than by watching some classic moments on the Python YouTube channel? A couple of my favourites: Job Interview and, of course, The Ministry of Silly Walks. Forty years, still funny.
