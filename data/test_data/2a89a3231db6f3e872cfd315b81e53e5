  "content": "The regulator Ofcom has received 60 complaints about Sky News' report about the woman alleged to have tweeted abusive messages about the McCann family. Brenda Leyland was found dead in a hotel room days after she appeared on Sky News as part of an investigation into internet \"trolling\" of the McCanns. She was not named by the Sky News report but was interviewed by reporter Martin Brunt as someone who \"uses Twitter to attack the parents of Madeleine McCann\". Brunt and his team took precautions such as not naming the village where Leyland lived and Brunt referred to her only by her Twitter name, @sweepyface. However, she was subsequently named in several newspaper reports. Most of the complaints to Ofcom are understood to have been made in the last couple of days, rather than in the immediate aftermath of Brunt's report on 2 October. An Ofcom spokesman said: \"It's important to stress that we've not reached a view as to whether an investigation will take place.\" Meanwhile on a Facebook page called Sack Martin Brunt, a petition has been launched calling on prime minister David Cameron to \"launch a public inquiry\" into what it claims is \"trial by television\" had gained 325 signatures. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
