  "content": "Paul Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail, today called on the Commons select committee investigating media intrusion into private life to \"have faith\" in the present system of self-regulation. Dacre, giving evidence to the committee, defended the press complaints commission, of which he is a member. \"We have evolved a system through hit and miss which I think is beginning to work. Have faith in us - I think we'll continue to grow and change. The new chairman will be the impetus to that.\" He also made a robust defence of the British press, adding: \"It can occasionally be inaccurate, it can occasionally be insensitive, it can occasionally behave in an overly competitive fashion but it also has great strengths.\" It was an editor's job to produce a paper that interested readers as much as possible within the framework of the PCC's code of conduct, Mr Dacre told the Committee. \"I have to decide what interests the public and how far to go,\" he said. Dacre said he was present to champion the PCC. \"If I have one job to do today it is to persuade you ladies and gentlemen, if you are sceptical, that the press do take the PCC very seriously and it is in the psyche on every level,\" he said. Dacre said that the recent appeal court ruling that a footballer's involvement with a lapdancer could be reported indicated the courts believed self regulation was working. Dacre said there was no case for making newspapers subject to the kind of fines which currently can be imposed on broadcasters by their regulators. The move would cut the goodwill which underpinned the current system and protected ordinary people, he argued. And the differences between the two industries meant comparisons could not be drawn, he said. \"Television is a monopoly, the BBC is a state monopoly, I would argue - in my more cynical moments - a state monopoly colonised by New Labour,\" he said. \"Newspapers are entirely different. They have no monopoly whatsoever.\" One area that the PCC should look into was how it could protect ordinary people caught up in major catastrophes or other big stories from the sheer numbers of media chasing the story, he said. And both the PCC and the newspaper industry as a whole should do more to get the commission's message across, he said. The body may have \"given the impression it is more concerned about the privacy of the rich and I think that is very unfortunate\", he told MPs. \"In my experience there is an awful lot of ignorance about the PCC even among journalists and some editors,\" he said. \"It has a long way to go in getting its message across to people.\" Dacre drew comparisons between the PCC and MPs self-regulation through the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee. Former Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Elizabeth Filkin had seen her critical reports on a series of leading politicians dismissed or brushed under the carpet, the editor said. Unlike the Commons Committee, which is wholly made up of MPs, editors are in a minority on the PCC, he stressed. When asked what he had to fear from a privacy law, Mr Dacre said: \"I believe it would destroy the PCC effectively, destroy the goodwill and the consensus which are the primary engines of the PCC. \"We are about people - you destroy the PCC, you will destroy the most effective way of defending the ordinary people.\" He said only the rich and powerful could finance a legal challenge of a privacy law, whereas lodging a complaint with the PCC was free. He cited the example of model Naomi Campbell, who spent \u00a3750,000 on a privacy case in which she had to reveal intimate details of her private life and which she ultimately lost. Under the PCC, he claimed, her case would have taken 31 days, would have been free and she might well have won. Earlier PR man Max Clifford branded the PCC \"a waste of time\" although he added he was against legislation that would restrict the freedom of the press. \"It is jobs for the boys, editors looking after editors, the public does not really have a say in that. I do work with the PCC, it is a waste of time, I do my own thing as it is quicker and far more effective. \"We have the most savage media in the world - image is everything, reality comes into it less and less.\" Mr Clifford said his job had shifted from promoting celebrities and stars to protecting them from potential exposure in newspapers. \"We have become very much a celebrity culture, there are more and more celebrities being created every five minutes.\" But the publicist said his main concern was for the majority of the population who could not afford to protect themselves by paying high legal fees. He argued that ordinary people should be entitled to legal aid to fight libel, while he feared celebrities were over-protected. \"The protection for the rich and powerful is massive, often far too much - they get away with murder - but the public has got nothing.\" Despite his criticism of the PCC, he did defend the freedom of the press. \"I do think we have as free a press as possible and that is a good thing. \"If it wasn't for a free press then an awful lot of people would have got away with things and some still do,\" said Mr Clifford.",
