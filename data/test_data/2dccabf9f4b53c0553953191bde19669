  "content": "Data protection laws must be changed to prevent needless deaths from cancer, researchers wrote in the British Medical Journal today. The authorities responsible for the drafting and interpretation of the laws contribute to the problem with their ignorance, said the researchers in an editorial for the May issue of the journal. The confines of the law as set by British legislators do not acknowledge the practical problems faced by researchers trying to procure patients' medical records. The authors, Julian Peto, the chairman of epidemiology at Cancer Research UK, Olivia Fletcher, a lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Clare Gillham, a medical statistician at the Institute of Cancer Research, said: \"The criterion of an overriding public interest has proved to be too ambiguous to be useful,\" The researchers criticised the \"pointless obstacles\" faced by colleagues, which cause \"serious damage\" and possibly death. The medical histories of patients needed for medical research become stuck in a bureaucratic quagmire because data custodians are fearful of litigation under the Data Protection Act 1998, they said. Beyond the law itself, the writers implicate the people responsible for data protection legislation, information commissioner, Richard Thomas, and secretary of state for constitutional affairs, Lord Falconer. They wrote: \"That those who enact and interpret radical social legislation should be so ignorant of its actual effects is alarming.\" The BMJ article highlights a case study of an NHS screening programme into cervical cancer. In accessing the records of women who had died of cervical cancer and a sample of British women, a senior researcher spent almost two years obtaining the data from nearly 100 health authorities. Some records for this study still have not been released to the researchers. The authors say that data custodians do not withhold records for ethical reasons, but for legal ones, and call on a high court judge to set a precedent by stating in a test case that non-commercial medical research should have access to records without informed consent. Cancer Research UK, as an organisation, has endorsed refining the current data protection laws. The cancer charity's head of clinical trials, Kate Law, said: \"Access to patient data is especially important in cancer. Studying the disease in populations is pivotal to our understanding of its causes and in turn helps in areas such as screening and prevention. \"We believe the current legislation relating to the use of medical research data needs to be clarified to prevent potentially damaging confusion. We need exemptions on the use of data for non-commercial medical research, even in the absence of consent, provided, of course, that the research has no effect on the individuals being studied and has been approved by an accredited ethics committee.\" In a letter published in the Times in May 2001, Lord Falconer wrote: \"Data can be used for any medical research purpose under the [Data Protection] act, without the need for the consent of individuals. So Professor Julian Peto is simply wrong when he states that the Data Protection Act is preventing data from being passed to medical researchers.\" A spokesman for the Department of Constitutional Affairs (DCA) said today that Lord Falconer was correct in what he said three years ago. \"There's nothing in the Data Protection Act which prevents access for any medical research purposes without the need for consent from any individuals.\" A spokeswoman from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said: \"The DCA has made it clear that there is nothing within existing data protection legislation that stops medical researchers gaining access to patient records for legitimate reasons. However, the Information Commissioner's Office recognises that the Data Protection Act presents a number of significant challenges to health service data protection officers and we have produced guidance to help them in their duties. The ICO continues to work with national health bodies to improve understanding of their obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998. \"The Information Commissioner's Office is not the author but the guardian of the Data Protection Act and continues to work with many health organisations to assist the health profession in developing a clearer understanding of how the act operates in their sector.\" The ICO has produced guidance on the matter, which is available on its website. Also under scrutiny in the BMJ editorial was the human tissue bill, whose ambiguousness, the researchers claim, is beyond remedy. \"Doctors who store any human tissue that may be used for future research without obtaining informed consent could face punitive criminal sanctions, and many will simply discard it,\" they wrote. The Data Protection Act 1998 came into force on March 1 2000, taking the place of the Data Protection Act 1984. The law sets rules for the use of personal information held in paper and computer records. The human tissue bill is expected to come before the House of Lords in the next few months.",
