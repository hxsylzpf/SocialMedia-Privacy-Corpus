  "content": "Courts are open to the public and the media, with only narrow exceptions. This is at the heart of delivery of justice in a modern democracy and a proud national tradition. The government, the judiciary and people who work in courts want courts to be open transparent and comprehensible to the public and the press. But the courts, over hundreds of years, have evolved into a complex system that is hard for outsiders to understand. In the interests of transparency and confidence in the justice system, people should be able to find out easily, on the internet: what cases are expected to come up in a court from the time that they are scheduled name, address and specific charges in all cases available from the time the case is scheduled (see footnote) the full names, including first names, of judges, prosecution and defence lawyers, witnesses, and other professionals who speak during proceedings (e.g. magistrates' clerks giving legal advice) from when they are known judgements handed down from the end of the working day on which the case is concluded next stage of the case. The longstanding openness of courts must not be compromised by data protection nor copyright. In particular, well meaning but misplaced concerns about the data protection act and copyright must not stop the recording and transmission of information presented in open court. All the above is subject to contempt of court and protection of vulnerable defendants and witnesses \u2013 exceptions to immediate transparency that are fundamental to the efficient, effective functioning of the justice system. Case information should be flagged where restrictions apply and those restrictions set out in writing. People who use information illegally or irresponsibly against the interests of efficient, effective justice or in such as way as to compromise the vulnerable may have their access to information withdrawn. It should be assumed that all information is available to the press and the public, apart from the general exceptions above. The best courts already meet these principles. We would like all courts to do so. Footnote In criminal cases, the following basic information should be readily available The full spelling of a defendant's name Their date of birth and full home address, including door number and postcode The charges against them (including an opportunity to read them) Written copies of any reporting restrictions applicable in the case Charges should be set out in the form used in magistrates courts: \"On 23/07/2011 at Oxford Street, London, assaulted Joe Bloggs Contrary to section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988\u2033 The charter was first published on Talk About Local"
