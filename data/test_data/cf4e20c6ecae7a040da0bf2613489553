  "content": "It is now 20 years since texting began. I have still not properly embraced it. And it's nothing to do with age or gender, so don't accuse me of stereotyping old women. There is nothing wrong with our brains or manual dexterity. I have excellent eye/hand/brain co-ordination, thank you very much, because I play the piano, which means I have to make endless super-rapid decisions and finger movements. I can because I have practised for decades. But I haven't practised texting, because it's a skill I can't be fagged to acquire. Here's why. Yesterday the Daughter texted. She needed a lift to carry a large package somewhere and then proceed to the dentist. Could I pick her up in 10 minutes? No I couldn't. But as I had my hands in the dog's dinner when she texted, I had to stop dog-cooking, wash and dry hands, pick up mobile, read text, answer it \u2013 which I can do, but slowly \u2013 saying I needed half an hour, then return to dog's dinner, resume picking out the skin and bones, when \"ping\", another text. Daughter had replied at the speed of light. More hand-washing, drying, picking up phone. Could I please bring Daughter's blue gloves and glasses and did I have any spare bread? I pecked out another slow answer, back to the dog's dinner, seconds passed, then \"ping\" again, wash and dry hands, back to mobile, dog starving and barking. It's Daughter again: \"You have 11 minutes left.\" Yes, because I've spent the last 19 minutes diddling about texting, when a little chat on the landline would have done the job in two minutes. But Rosemary and I still do our best. \"Meet you wherever at such a time,\" texts Rosemary's son, or whoever. \"Yes,\" she texts, then turns her mobile off, so that if there is a change of another text arrives changing the plan, she knows nothing of it, because she hasn't realised that a mobile has to be on and with you at all times for text to work properly. Notice that I'm not sneering at anyone who can't play the piano, and telling them they must.",
  "lead": "I can text \u2013 albeit slowly \u2013 but what's the point when a phone call would do the job in a fraction of the time?"
