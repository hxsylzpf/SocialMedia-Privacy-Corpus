  "content": "Travel-tracking social network Dopplr has nearly outdone itself in the end-of-year-personal-charts department by coming up with this beast called a 'Personal Annual Report'. Obama's year, as seen by Dopplr. Photograph: Dopplr.com/Flickr/Some rights reserved It's a PDF-format summary of all you Dopplr activity for the year, with visualisations and travel stats, photos, travel schedule and your carbon-polluting data. As a nice touch, you don't even need to do anything to get your hands on one of these; every Dopplr user will receive one automatically in the next week. Dopplr has churned out Barack Obama's personal report for the year as an example, and that's far more impressive than most of us mere mortals. Obama took 234 trips in 2008, according to publicly available data from the US. He spent: \u2022 133 days at home, and 233 days travelling \u2022 He spent the most time in his (now former) hometown of Chicago \u2022 Travelled 337,729km - or 92% of the distance to the moon \u2022 And he produced 42,299kg of CO2 - equivalent to 4.2 Hummers being run for one year. Ooops - a bit of a Hum-dinger. Photograph: Dopplr.com/Flickr/Some rights reserved \"As a man with strong views on climate-change, the environment and energy, the President-Elect will no doubt be very interested in the carbon estimate of his travels during the campaign as calculated by AMEE,\" writes Matt Jones on the Dopplr blog today. \"We've deliberately chosen a provocative visualisation here - a scale of the equivalent CO2 yearly output of Hummer SUVs to convey the estimate in concrete terms. Many of us after all would think very hard about driving such a vehicle, perhaps harder than we do about taking a flight.\""
