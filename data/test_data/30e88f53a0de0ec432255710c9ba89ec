  "content": "\"Life would make a lot more sense if you could hear the laugh track,\" God wrote to humanity in a well-timed tweet on Thursday. The popular parody Twitter account @TheTweetOfGod and its accompanying book The Last Testament: A Memoir by God are to be adapted for Broadway, with a show set to debut in 2015. The man behind both, former Daily Show head writer David Javerbaum, is an industry veteran who collected 11 Emmys at the helm of Jon Stewart's writers room. Religion has a history of selling tickets on Broadway and God himself is likely to be no exception. Matt Stone and Trey Parker's The Book of Mormon broke sales records and scooped up nine Tony awards in 2011, while classic rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar has enjoyed various revivals since it debuted in 1970. \"I am deeply disappointed that Jeffrey Finn has decided to produce this show,\" Javerbaum said earlier this week. \"It will force me to continue my unwanted professional association with God, an abstract entity who has given me nothing but discomfort and agita. It is my desperate hope that we close out of town.\" In the book, God publishes his own 'It Getteth Better' video and clarifies his original writings on homosexuality: I remember dictating these lines to Moses; and afterward looking up to find him staring at me in wide-eyed astonishment, and saying, \"Thou do knowest that when the Israelites read this, they're going to lose their fucking shit, right?\" Unsurprisingly, the book was banned at Walmart. The Twitter account currently has more than 1.2m followers, and often issues well-timed missives pegged to current events. (\"Jesus was the only man to return from the dead and not eat brains,\" said God on the Saturday before Easter.) It was only a matter of time until Broadway came calling. \"The God of this book has a weakness for Broadway musicals,\" the New York Times wrote in its 2011 review. \"He professes to have liked Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat a lot more than he liked either Joseph or that colored coat in person.\""
