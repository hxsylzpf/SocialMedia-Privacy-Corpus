  "content": "Selfie: just saying the word makes me queasy. There's something so\u2026 well, self-satisfied about it: an adoring name for yourself, as if you were your own best friend. But in a world where celebrities are managing and manipulating their own identities, self-portraits are now ubiquitous. And where celebrities go, civilians follow. Now we're all playing the selfie game. This is me on the tube, me on the loo, me getting ready to go out, me, me, me. At the time of writing, the photo-sharing social network Instagram hosted almost 91.5m selfies with the hashtag #me, plus another 34m tagged #selfie. The selfie reflects a world in which we are all our own biographer, our own agent. Only one problem. Most selfies look the same, or fall into one of the following genres: let's call them Hot Sex, Gorgeous Me, Faux Natural, Life Is Fun and Check Out My Style. So there's Justin Bieber, six-packed, naked to the waist, pouting and preening like a porn star; Paris Hilton, camera held just above eye level for the perfect angle, mouth puckered, making love to her iPhone; doe-eyed Shane Warne waking up to an early-morning selfie; Rihanna skinning up with friends; and then all the kids imitating Bieber, Hilton, Rihanna et al. But can a selfie transcend these cliches? Might they reveal as much as a traditional portrait? Or is the whole point that they give nothing away? We asked some famous faces \u2013 politicians and poets, broadcasters, artists and athletes \u2013 to send us their take on the selfie: not pouting, not posed and definitely not lifted from an Instagram feed. (Few of the people on these pages are known for their raging narcissism.) We wanted them queueing for the bus, walking up a mountain in Wales, doing something unexpected.  While it's tempting to believe that everybody is snapping their life away, it soon became apparent that many people are implacably opposed to the idea. My favourite refusal came from the actor Sheila Hancock: \"I hate people who take pictures of themselves and have no intention of becoming one of them. I abhor the way people look at life through a lens. You shouldn't encourage it in any way. What has happened to the Guardian?\" The artist Jeremy Deller sent a sepia photograph captioned: \"Not a selfish, a female industrial worker in South Wales 1870s taken on an iplate camera.\" I said this wasn't what we were after. \"That's the point. I think it's all a bit stupid, a bit Z-list.\" Others had no idea what a selfie was. Perhaps it's because they're so used to being photographed, but actors Andrew Sachs, Tilda Swinton and Russell Tovey all sent in snaps of themselves \u2013 taken by others. So we explained, and got two of my favourites back: Tovey's picture of his French bulldog Rocky, looking lovingly into his eyes. Swinton emailed an apologetic note. \"Ah, I see, didn't get it. Might drop this ball due to Luddite tendencies plus shyness but will try I promise. Yrs sincerely r van winkle (mrs).\" Then she sent a picture of her legs and three springer spaniels. You can't see her face, but it's a perfectly realised self-portrait: sensual, playful. It's surprising how many people, women in particular, did their best to disappear. Actors Olivia Colman and Samantha Morton give us half a face, artist Rachel Whiteread loses herself among the geraniums, singer Neneh Cherry hides in long grass. Film-maker Ken Loach sent a photo of a shop window, claiming it contained his reflection. When we said we weren't buying that, he sent a beautifully composed picture of himself reflected in a car window while on a recce of an Irish bog. And if half faces were a leitmotif with women, so cars were with men. Not in a middle-aged-crisis way, more endearingly wooden. John Hurt stares straight ahead from the front seat, as if having a passport photo taken; ditto Alan Johnson. One of the few old hands we approached was Ricky Gervais. Most of his selfies are taken in the bath. \"I like my baths deep and hot, and once you've washed, there's not a lot else to do, but getting out straightaway would be a tragic waste of world energy and resources. So I take pictures, because whatever I'm doing \u2013 a photoshoot, presenting the Golden Globes or acting \u2013 this is how I always feel on the inside.\" He is not the only one to opt for realism over self-flattery. Knackered Charlotte Church draws a circle with her hand around an eye bag, while just a jigsaw piece of Olivia Colman shows she is pissed off and wants to be home rather than on set. Artist Cornelia Parker, who had never taken a selfie, stresses her wrinkle lines. She soon became obsessed: for days, my inbox kept pinging with new angles and body parts. Another artist, Gillian Wearing, has been taking selfies for decades. She loves both the concept and the word. \"The word 'selfie' is brilliant. It really encapsulates a time: instant, quick, funny. It sounds ironic and throwaway. I did hundreds of self-portraits by Polaroid [the first camera to give instant self-portraits] between 1988 and 2000.\" Selfies are hardly new, she adds. \"As soon as cameras were invented, photographers were interested in capturing themselves. Ever since humans first saw their reflection in a puddle, there has been a bit of self-obsession in us all. Duplicating and creating images of ourselves goes back as far as Caesar, who was the first to put himself on a coin in order to be seen as many times as possible.\" Comedian Sharon Horgan takes selfies for two reasons: to check what she looks like in costume, and to chronicle her many self-inflicted injuries. Here she shows off the plaster used to cover a gash she received after falling off her bike. Grayson Perry declined. Then we had a word with his wife, the psychotherapist Philippa Perry, who takes half a dozen a day, mainly to monitor her lipstick. Under duress, Grayson produced one (his first), but he's unlikely to be a convert. Turns out I am, though. I've started to love them. Often they reveal more than a studio shot, whether it's the DIY surrealism of Bill Bailey's selfie, the cartoon-strip filth of artists Robert and Aline Crumb, or the energy of naked poet Benjamin Zephaniah. Some are just funny (chef Gizzi Erskine doing rabbit ears on a pig's head), some joyous (Adrian Chiles playing Subbuteo with his nephew) some moving (Sinn F\u00e9in's Gerry Adams sending good vibes to Mandela from County Louth). One of our selfies has even made history: after 40 years as a professional photographer, this is Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado's first self-portrait. Even on a smartphone, Salgado manages to convey some of the grandeur we associate with his epic, large-scale landscapes. Maybe there is hope for the selfie, after all.",
