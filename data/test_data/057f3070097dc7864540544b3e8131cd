  "content": "An internet hoax has sent some Twitter users into meltdown, as rumours spread that the site would be closing in 2017. In case there were any doubt: it's not. Everyone seems to be panicking for no good reason. It all started with a YouTuber who put in his Twitter bio that he was voted the \"Most Controversial Youtuber of 2015\". Word spread via fake accounts, and later legitimate ones, that he had single-handedly convinced Twitter to shut in 2017 because of abuse and cyberbullying. The next thing we knew, it was the top trend. Welcome to conspiracy theories in 2016! Also, it's silly season. The reactions were split between people perhaps genuinely scared the site was going to shut down: People wondering what on earth was going on: And those who were just making fun of it all: If you're familiar with the #SaveMarinaJoyce hashtag from a few weeks ago, you'll recognise some of the same tropes appearing on Twitter. It's all for nothing though \u2013 we asked Twitter and they assured us there's no truth to the claims whatsoever. So there we are then. We can get on with our day."
