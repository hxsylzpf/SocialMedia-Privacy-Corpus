  "content": "Don't be fooled by the suggestion that only terrorists, paedophiles and those with \"something to hide\" use encryption on the internet. Anyone who shops online uses it \u2013 though probably without realising that that's what the padlock symbol in the address bar of their browser means. When you see that padlock on a shopping site or bank site, or when you use Skype for video chat, or Apple's iMessage, or BlackBerry's messaging and email systems, or a host of others, your communication is encrypted. If someone breaks that encryption, your details \u2013 such as your credit card, address, and what you're buying \u2013 are theirs to own. Modern computer-based encryption uses \"public-key encryption\", which has been in use since 1973 \u2013 having been developed, in secret, by GCHQ. (It finally admitted its work in 1997.) Public key encryption relies on the fact that it is much harder to figure out the factors of a number \u2013 what numbers were multiplied together to produce it \u2013 than to multiply them to make the number. Quick, what two numbers do you multiply together to produce 323? (Answer at the end.) If you choose two large prime numbers, a computer can multiply them together easily, but it can't deconstruct the result with anything like the same ease. The key to public key encryption is thus to generate large numbers using numbers that only you (or your computer) know. The large number can be published online, and used to encrypt a message using specific and well-tested mathematical formulae. In effect, the large number is a digital padlock which you make available to anyone so they can secure a message. Only you hold the keys to the padlock, so it doesn't matter how many copies are out there. When you link to a shopping site, the creation of the secure link is enabled in the first place by that padlock-and-key process. But if someone can figure out the factors of the big number, they have in effect cracked your padlock. The difficulty of doing so rises with the size of the number: \"brute force\" decryption attempts to find its factors by slogging through the number range. A key's strength is measured by the number of digital bits it uses, and the encryption method. The old benchmark used to be a 40-bit \"key\" encoded with the RC4 algorithm; these days that could be cracked in moments by a standard desktop computer. These days, 256 bits or more (which theoretically should take thousands of years to crack) is common. While the NSA, GCHQ and other intelligence agencies can afford to spend millions on custom-built chips to crack encrypted signals, many hackers have begun to use the power of modern graphics processing units (which drive the screen on your computer) to crack passwords. The latest software can manage 8bn guesses per second \u2013 and crack passwords up to 55 characters long. Crack that, and you can access the user's account \u2013 at which point, encryption might not matter. (Answer: 323 is the multiple of 17 and 19 \u2013 both prime numbers.)"
