  "content": "Instagram will start running adverts in the feeds of British users \"later this year\", the company says, following a trial in the US with ten advertisers. It will also advertise in Canada and Australia. Instagram says it's \"being very methodical and deliberate\" about who is allowed to advertise in users' feeds, and the company has strict rules about what images brands can post. \"No text is allowed on ad imagery in Instagram,\" for instance, and \"Ads should capture 'moments', not products. Ads must not simply be a product shot, in other words.\" The company also reassures users that they won't see the same adverts twice inside the app. Since 2010, Instagram has grown to 200 million monthly active users, and more than 150 million of them have joined since it was acquired by Facebook in 2012 for $1bn. Since launch, Instagram's users have shared 20 billion photos, and now upload an average of 60m pictures per day. In March this year, the company overtook Twitter in US monthly active users. But with its parent company acting as an umbrella, Instagram hasn't felt the same pressure as Twitter to go after revenue. \"As Instagram builds its business, we've put our community first every step of the way,\" writes the company in a blogpost. \"And since introducing ads last November, we've worked with a handful of top brands to draw creative inspiration from the community and create ads that were engaging and felt natural in people's feeds.\" The adverts will follow the same format as in the US: users will see simple image posts, like this from Ben &amp; Jerry's, in their feed. Somewhat oddly, another rule prevents \"heavy use of image filters\", preventing advertisers from using the tool perhaps most strongly associated with Instagram in the eyes of the public. Advertisers have enjoyed their access to Instagram users. Industry journal Adweek reports that Taco Bell's Instagram following jumped 45% in its monthlong campaign, and that Hollister saw a third more viewers of its ads for a range of girls' dresses recall the range than those who hadn't seen the ad. Users themselves were offered \"the ability to provide feedback on ads,\" the company says, \"so we could learn what people liked\u2014and didn't like\u2014and improve over time.\" When the first ad was shown in November, negative reaction was immediate, with user comments including \"wtf this crap needs to not be on my page, this ads shit\" and \"since when were there ads on instagram\u2026 ugh\". But as the ads continued to come, negative reaction died off, and posts like the Ben &amp; Jerry's ad, above, rarely receive negative comments publicly."
