  "content": "David Cameron has been mocked for posting a picture of himself on Twitter looking serious while talking to Barack Obama on the telephone. Several celebrities ridiculed his pose with humorous captions, after the prime minister tweeted the photo and added: \"I've been speaking to @BarackObama about the situation in Ukraine. We are united in condemnation of Russia's actions.\" The two world leaders had been discussing the serious subject of the Ukraine crisis and the movement of Russian troops into Crimea. However, Twitter users soon began to make fun of Cameron's expression on the photo he made public. Actor Patrick Stewart posted a picture of his face next to a tub of Wet Ones, writing: \"I'm now patched in as well. Sorry for the delay.\" US comic Rob Delaney ]also joined the mockery by holding up a tube of toothpaste and adding: \"Hi guys, I'm on the line now too. Get me up to speed.\" George Osborne, the chancellor, has previously been mocked for tweeting a picture of himself with an expensive burger while he worked on the last spending review. Eyebrows were also raised when Cameron posed with Obama and Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt for a selfie at the memorial service for Nelson Mandela in South Africa last year."
