  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission today rejected a complaint about privacy from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Rowling complained about articles in the Daily Mirror, Daily Record and the Scottish Mail on Sunday that reported that she had bought a property close to the estate she already owns in Perthshire. The Scottish Mail on Sunday article, headlined \"JK's Rowling hills\", was accompanied by pictures showing long-distance views of the author's home, the neighbouring property that she had recently bought and the surrounding countryside. Rowling, through her solicitors Schillings, said that the articles, published in October last year, invaded her privacy by identifying the location of her Perthshire home. She complained that there had been a breach of clause 3 of the PCC code of practice. In 2005 the PCC upheld a complaint from Rowling after the Daily Mirror published information that could identify the address of her London home. However, in this case the PCC, which has stated that identifying the location of celebrities' homes may attract stalkers, found that the articles did not name the road the property was on, nor its location in relation to the nearest town. The PCC also said the name of the property, the county where it was situated and the town it was near were already in the public domain. \"While the commission appreciated that the complainant is someone who guards her privacy closely - and clearly objected to the attention given by the press to her property purchase - it did not consider that there was anything in these articles that contravened the code or the commission's guidelines,\" the commission said. \"Restraint upon further publication of the information would, in the commission's view, serve no purpose,\" it added. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
