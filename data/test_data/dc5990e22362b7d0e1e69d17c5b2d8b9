  "content": "A Thai magazine editor has been arrested for posting comments critical of the military on his Facebook page, reports Human Rights Watch (HRW). Thanapol Eawsakul, the editor of Fah Diew Khan (Same Sky) magazine, was detained on Saturday (5 July) and is expected to remain police custody for another three days under a so-called administrative detention order. His message suggested that the ruling military junta, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), had ordered him to stop making critical comments about the military authorities. Since the 22 May coup in Thailand, the military authorities have severely restricted the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. HRW argues that Eawsakul's detention is emblematic of the government's deepening disregard for fundamental rights and freedoms. \"Arresting an editor for a Facebook criticism of military rule shows just how far the junta will go to silence critics,\" said Brad Adams, HRW's Asia director. He continued: \"Arbitrary arrests of dissidents and critics are part of a wider human rights crackdown under military rule in Thailand. \"Concerned governments should take a strong stand and demand that the military authorities fully abide by Thailand's international obligations and build a road map for the restoration of a democratic government based on human rights.\" Source: HRW"
