  "content": "Facebook Connect was announced in May as a way of using your Facebook identity on different sites, such as Digg. Since then, things have been quiet. However, The New York Times now has a big story, Facebook Aims to Extend Its Reach Across the Web, which says: In the next few weeks, a number of prominent Web sites will weave this service into their pages, including those of the Discovery Channel and The San Francisco Chronicle, the social news site Digg, the genealogy network Geni and the online video hub Hulu. It adds: The effort is particularly important for Facebook, which once represented the seemingly boundless promise of the Web 2.0 boom. It desperately wants to make certain the other Web companies do not supplant it and become the most popular hub for online socializing. There's also the little matter of advertising. So far, Facebook has not done much to convert its mindshare into a money stream, but Connect might help: \"It's becoming very clear that advertisers don't know how to advertise on Facebook,\" said Charlene Li, an independent consultant and social media analyst. \"But if you take a group of Facebook friends and put them on a travel site where they are spending more time and generating more ad dollars in a focused area like travel, that is an opportunity ripe for getting revenues back and sharing it.\" Whether you'd actually want to use your real identity on a site like Digg is another matter, of course. It seems to me that the number of sites where you'd want to be identified is a very tiny subset of the web -- though it could be a profitable subset. The story points out that: \"MySpace, Yahoo and Google have all announced similar programs this year, using common standards that will allow other Web sites to reduce the work needed to embrace each identity system. Facebook, which is using its own data-sharing technology, is slightly ahead of its rivals.\" It neglects to mention Windows Live ID Delegated Authorization, which seems to do the same sort of thing. When Microsoft tried this with Passport (used for the Hotmail sign-on) seven or eight years ago, the response was almost universal condemnation and a rival Liberty Alliance Project. But maybe times have changed\u2026.",
  "lead": "Facebook will enable you to take your real identity to other parts of the web, which could bring in more advertising revenue -- if users can be convinced they will be able to retain their privacy"
