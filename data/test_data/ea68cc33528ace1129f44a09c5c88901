Ah, yes, it is the gloriously un-reconstructed Ricky Gervais who has plucked up the nerve to actually break free of the global Twitter love-in, according to the Daily Telegraph. 'I just don't get it,' Gervais said. 'I'm sure it's fun as a networking device for teenagers but there's something a bit undignified about adults using it, particularly celebrities who seem to be showing off by talking to each other in public.' Take that, Ashton Kutcher!"
