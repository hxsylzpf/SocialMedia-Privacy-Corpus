  "content": "Nasdaq's chief executive has apologised for the stock market's handling of Facebook's initial public offering and outlined a plan to offer $40m in compensation. Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq's CEO, said he and other exchange officials \"owe the industry an apology\" for the technical problems that dogged last month's massive share sale by the social network. Neither the apology nor the plan are likely to appease angry stock brokers who are suing the exchange and claim delays and other technical glitches cost them and their customers tens of millions. Knight Capital, one of Wall Street's biggest market makers, has already filed a suit against the exchange claiming it lost as much as $35m because of Nasdaq's mishandling of the Facebook IPO. It called Greifeld's plan \"unacceptable\". \"Clearly we are disappointed that Nasdaq's compensation fund does not come close to covering losses by broker-dealers like Knight that traded Facebook shares on behalf of average investors \u2026 and who suffered losses as a result of Nasdaq's failures,\" the firm said in a statement. The plan has also been attacked by rival exchanges. \"This is tantamount to forcing the industry to subsidize Nasdaq's missteps and would establish a harmful precedent that could have far-reaching implications for the markets, investors and the public interest,\" NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq's main competitor, said in a statement. \"We intend to strongly press our views that Nasdaq's proposal cannot be allowed to permit an unjust and anti-competitive situation.\" Top financial watchdog the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating what went wrong with the Facebook IPO. Nasdaq's systems appear to have buckled under the scale of the share sale leading to delays in the start of trading. When shares started trading, many brokers were unable to ascertain the size and value of their positions for over two hours leading to widespread confusion. Facebook's shares were launched at a price of $38 and briefly soared to over $45 in the early hours of trading. They have since fallen hard and were selling for less than $27 on Thursday morning."
