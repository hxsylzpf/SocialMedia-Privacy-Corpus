  "content": "JK Rowling is said to be upset that a partner in a law firm leaked her secret pen-name. Chris Gossage, who worked at the firm that represents Rowling, directed a friend to the real identity of Robert Galbraith. Despite seeking assurances that this information would be kept confidential, the friend later disclosed the information on Twitter. It is often said that there are no secrets \u2013 that everyone will always tell one person. Have you ever had a secret betrayed in this manner? Have you ever confided in a colleague, only to discover that before long half the company know your business? Have you ever told someone else's secrets? Did you accidentally leak information that you knew was private? Tell us how you keep a confidence."
