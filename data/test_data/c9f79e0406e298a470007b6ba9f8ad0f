  "content": "Alan Johnson, the home secretary, is today meeting three senior MPs who want him to halt the extradition of the computer hacker Gary McKinnon. Former Labour minister Michael Meacher, ex-shadow home secretary David Davis and the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Chris Huhne, will urge Johnson to intervene to ensure that McKinnon goes on trial in Britain, not the US. But the Home Office has played down the prospect of any change of policy, arguing that the home secretary has no power to halt McKinnon's extradition. McKinnon suffers from Asperger's syndrome and is wanted for trial in the US on charges of hacking into the country's military networks. But campaigners believe his only crime is being a \"UFO eccentric\" who searched for evidence of extraterrestrials. In July McKinnon, who is 43 and from north London, failed in his high court bid to avoid extradition. Meacher, who sought the meeting, said: \"Not only has the home secretary got the power but he has the duty to intervene in an extradition case, even after the court process has ended, if there is a real risk of a human rights breach should extradition proceed. \"Gary's medical condition is such that medical experts have concluded there is a grave risk to Mr McKinnon's health if he is extradited to the US. \"There is no reason why he cannot face charges in the UK for an act which took place in the UK.\" Liberty, the human rights pressure group, said they hoped the MPs would bring about a \"change of heart\" from Johnson. Sabina Frediani, a spokeswoman for the group, said: \"The British public are behind the idea that extradition arrangements must incorporate basic safeguards before someone is shipped off across the world, away from friends, family and supporters.\"",
