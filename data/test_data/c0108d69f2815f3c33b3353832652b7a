  "content": "WEXO, Work Experience Online, is a social network for people looking for work experience internships and jobs. It was founded in 2008 but officially launch in February 2009. The site is based in London and has five full-time members of staff plus their own interns. They have seed funding from angel investors. \u2022 Explain your business to my Mum WEXO, Work Experience Online, is a website which offers its members work experience placements, internships and jobs at some of the UK's most dynamic companies. It's free to sign up and members can also use the site to build up a personal network, so we tend to describe ourselves as a Facebook for work experience internships and jobs. People simply register their details, build a profile and search for opportunities in their chosen sector. At the same time, companies can match members to opportunities, allowing them to select the most suitable candidates. The service has been designed to break down the 'it's not what you know, but who you know' barrier traditionally present in industries such as media, marketing, entertainment and fashion and companies on our books currently include Sony Music, Working Title and Giorgio Armani. \u2022 What's your background? After university I went into the City and was an investment banker at HSBC before quitting the rat race and moving to Verbier, where I became a ski instructor and ran my own business. WEXO was the brainchild of my ex-flatmate, Harry Becher. I knew it was dynamite but spent 6 months researching it, trying to convince myself I should stay in the Alps before we embarked on the project together back in London with another old friend Andy Cooke, our Creative Director. \u2022 How will you survive the downturn? The downturn actually works to our advantage, with the site offering opportunities to job seekers, students and graduates. Although the class of 2009 may not be able to secure their ideal job straight away, graduates can still take steps to break into their dream job. With companies unable to afford additional full-time employees, they are becoming more aware of the value internships can bring to their organisation and are open to having graduates work with them for a set period of time. Interns get valuable skills and experience under their belts, and companies benefit from an extra pair of hands in the office. The great thing about WEXO is that the site matches companies and interns based on skill sets to provide a low-cost and effective service. \u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months? We have always aimed to strike a 1:10 balance between companies and members to ensure that the latter have a good chance of being selected for a placement while at the same time our companies have a wide choice of applicants. The company is growing exponentially and with 3000 members and 300 companies on board, and 380 opportunities currently live on the site, I feel confident about hitting our targets of 100,000 registered users by this time next year. \u2022 How do you plan to make money? At the moment sign up is free but we offer paid-for premium levels of service and specialist access. I think this is the way the internet as a whole is heading. We are always developing new revenue streams based on the feedback we receive from our users. Currently companies are actively telling us that they will pay for instant access to our members and adding fringe benefits for members using affiliate marketing is helping increase conversion rates. \u2022 Name your closest competitors We're looking to fill the void between recruitment agencies, job boards and social networks. We're using technology and our contacts to be more dynamic than existing student and graduate websites such as Prospects and Milkround. \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? HR departments have their own inherent systems and beliefs when it comes to work experience, internships and recruitment. The biggest challenge for us is changing the status quo and alerting HR professionals to the benefits of using new and more efficient approaches that are inherent in WEXO's technology \u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch? Obviously Google, but I'm particularly excited about Spotify at the moment and I think Chris Anderson, author of The Long Tail, is very perceptive. \u2022 Who's your mentor? Harry, Andy and I are all friends but have very different characters and skills so tend to bounce ideas off each other. Our advisory board includes John Gordon, (Xtreme Information, Globalista, Intelligence Squared) who brings a fresh perspective based on years of experience across a range of businesses. \u2022 How's your work/life balance? Having spent my twenties working hard and then playing hard, a skew towards work is probably where it should be for a bit. But I still know how to have fun! \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? We want WEXO to be recognised as the destination for students and graduates looking to kick-start their careers in their chosen industry, and have Britain's most dynamic companies using WEXO as a core part of their HR activity. \u2022 What's the most important piece of software or tool you use everyday? We use Skype all the time. What do you think? \u2022 Is specialisation like WEXO's the way to break into the crowded social networking space? \u2022 How will the network keep members as people get jobs and move to the next phase in their careers? \u2022 Will WEXO's 'freemium' model work?"
