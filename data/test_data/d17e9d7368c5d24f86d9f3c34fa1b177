  "content": "Your obligatory Twitter mention of the day: Katie Price, formerly the former glamour model Jordan, has been voted the most annoying celebrity on the social networking site, the Sun reports \u2013 just ahead of her estranged husband Peter Andre, who came second. Stephen Fry was voted best tweeter. At least Andre can take comfort in his chart number - it was two places higher than that reached by his single on its debut in the top 40 on Sunday."
