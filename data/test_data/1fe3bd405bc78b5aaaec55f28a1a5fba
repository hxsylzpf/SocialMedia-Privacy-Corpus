  "content": "A new episode of The Simpsons will be based around Aaron Sorkin's Oscar-winning The Social Network, reports the Sun. One of the film's stars will also be reprising their role \u2013 or should that be two? No, not Justin Timberlake, or the other chap, but Armie Hammer, who played the Winklevoss twins in the film about Facebook. The name of the Simpsons episode \u2013 The Do'oh-cial Network."
