  "content": "They tell me I'm pissed off Yeah, maybe I'm pissed off But I'd rather be pissed off Than be pissed on Hold On Tight - King Blues Back in September, I was lamenting the lack of political engagement by UK artists. There has been a slight increase since then, but none have put their money where their mouth is in the way King Blues has with their upcoming tour. I was handed a record by them a while back and was really impressed with the lyrics in songs like What If Punk Never Happened. The singer, Jonny \"Itch\" Fox, was homeless at the age of 18. \"I was thrown a real lifeline by the Big Issue,\" he says. \"It made it possible for me to no longer have to beg, and also cut down police harassment.\" Now that the band are signed to Field Recordings/Island Records, with their songs being played on Radio 1, they've decided to give something back to the publication. Entry to the gigs on their new tour (starting tonight in London) will be free to people carrying a current copy of the Big Issue. This way, they'll help homeless sellers - and the magazine increases circulation. There are a few other artists, like Dan Le Sac vs Scroobius Pip, who've long used social commentary in their lyrics. But when commentary comes from an artist like Lily Allen, it tends to be a comment on a small part of reality, completely removed from a large part of the population. After all, how much insight into social issues can you have, if you haven't experienced them yourself? There's a big difference between worrying about how you're going to get your next meal - or the absence of a roof over your head - and the \"fear\" that Lily Allen sings about. There's also a big difference between Phil Collins's Another Day in Paradise and King Blues's Let's Hang the Landlord (for one thing, the latter is a lot more cheerful). Maybe the reason for the dearth of gritty social commentary in lyrics is that many bands consist of people from a fairly privileged background. Record companies and radio stations are largely made up of white, university-educated males. In music, as in media, you may be expected to work for free, or get paid a pittance, for the first few months (even years), when you start out. Although, having the right contacts helps, to which I'm sure Lily Allen can attest. As a musician, you have the added costs of rehearsal space, studio time and loss-making gigs. Joe Taylor of Field Recordings tells me that King Blues came out of a DIY/squat scene, which enabled them to get to a certain point with very little money. \"They were still well in debt when we signed them. If you were broke but didn't have the DIY/squat know-how, it would be even harder to break into the business,\" he says. In these times of dwindling record sales, branding and sponsorship are becoming more prevalent as a means for artists to survive and prosper - sometimes without even being signed to a label, as in the Groove Armada/Bacardi venture. Of course, most brands wouldn't be interested in sponsoring an up-and-coming band, but even if they were, they surely wouldn't support an artist with an anti-corporate message. Could this mean we'll end up with even fewer political artists? So buy a Big Issue and get down to a King Blues gig. You'll feel good about helping a homeless person and - possibly - a future recording artist with something to say."
