  "content": "The MPs who dredge their moats and prune their wisteria at the tax\u00adpayers' expense have found a doughty \u00adchampion in Stephen Fry, who told Newsnight this week that all the media fuss about \u00adparliamentary expenses was just a \"journalistic made-up frenzy\", \"a tedious, bourgeois obsession\" and \"not a big deal\". If people were going to lose faith in anybody, he said, it was not in politicians but in journalists, than whom he had \"never met a more venal and disgusting group of people when it comes to expenses and allowances\". A few weeks ago, when the biggest expenses scandal was a \u00a310 claim for the viewing of pornographic films by the home secretary's husband, I also took the view that the fiddling of expenses was not a subject on which \u00adjournalists should pontificate too self-righteously. But the revelations of recent days have exposed the remarkable extent to which politicians now surpass journalists in their greed and corruption. And even if some journalists yearn to be as greedy and corrupt as politicians are, they don't have the chance; for their expense claims are subjected to far more rigorous scrutiny than that provided by the astonishingly \u00adgenerous and easy-going House of Commons fees office. In light of this, it is hard to understand why Fry should care so little about corruption in politics and so much about its \u00adjournalistic equivalent. He must have some deep-seated prejudice against journalism, which would be more understandable if he wasn't a kind of a journalist himself \u2013 a former technology columnist for the Guardian and one of the most popular bloggers on Twitter, with more than 100,000 followers hanging on his every tweet. You would think he would also be grateful to the press for helping to establish him as a \"national treasure\". I live in Northamptonshire beside two Inigo Jones pavilions at a place called Stoke Park, described by Simon Jenkins in his England's Thousand Best Houses as \"a place of ghosts, terraces, choked ponds and empty colonnades\". He's quite right about the \"choked ponds\", except that there's really only one of them. It is indeed very choked and the last time I asked what it would cost to dechoke it, I was told it would be thousands of pounds. Oh, if only I had become an MP rather than a journalist. It could have been paid for out of your taxes. My uncle Robin, who is in his 88th year and lives nearly all the time in Thailand, is a little out of touch with things in Britain. He thinks that two or three pounds is about the right price for a meal in a restaurant and that if you want to buy a haggis, you have to go to Scotland. He doesn't know that haggis is on sale in every English supermarket from Penzance to Berwick-upon-Tweed. Uncle Robin has a friend here in Northamptonshire who is fond of haggis. So when he went up to stay with my sister in Dumfriesshire the other day, he said he would return with one. And he did, only the haggis he brought back was a \"vegetarian\" one. My sister had dashed into a shop in Dumfries to get it for him, but didn't look carefully enough at the label. Its ingredients turned out to be not sheep's innards (\"painch, tripe or thairm\", according to Robert Burns) contained in a stomach lining, but peanuts, walnuts, almonds, mushrooms, oats and other good-for-you things encased in what Macsween, the Edinburgh manufacturer, described rather worryingly as a \"man-made\" skin. We rushed off to Waitrose in Towcester to get the real thing \u2013 also made, of course, by the ubiquitous Macsween, the self-appointed \"guardians of Scotland's national dish\" \u2013 to give to the poor haggis-craving native of this Midlands town. I had told Uncle Robin that we should have done this in the first place, but he said that it was more \"romantic\" to have brought the haggis back from Scotland and that he would go on pretending that he had. Would it be more romantic to go to Pittsburgh to get a bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup, I wondered? It is characteristic of this globalised world that practically everything is available everywhere, or can anyway be ordered with ease on the internet. There is no need to go anywhere for anything. But it's a difficult idea for an 87-year-old romantic to accept. Dame Liz Forgan, the chairwoman of Arts Council \u00adEngland, is an advocate of exposing young children to the music of the most difficult composers without \"the defeatism that believes classical music is inaccessible, out of reach, and somehow to be approached in disguise\". \"Throwing children alive into a boiling vat of great music does them no harm at all,\" she said this week at the Royal Philharmonic Society's classical music awards. She believes this because of her own experience when, at age six, she was introduced by her grandfather to the Liebestod from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde and soon afterwards taken to a concert performance of Elgar's Dream of Gerontius. It was, she said, this \"chronicle of unsuitability\" that had hooked her on classical music. I just want to say how right she is. By a curious coincidence, the first piece of \u00adclassical music I remember hearing \u2013 at about seven \u2013 was also the Liebestod, sung by Kirsten Flagstad, on a 78rpm record belonging to my older brother John, and I love it to this day. The same goes for his recording of Elisabeth Schumann singing Schubert's Heidenr\u00f6slein. More than 60 years later, they would still be among my desert \u00adisland discs. \u2022 This week Alexander greatly enjoyed Fishing in Utopia: \"Andrew Brown's superb book about Sweden, even though it includes the calumnious claim that everyone at the Spectator was drunk after lunch when he was its editor.\" Alexander was also much moved by the soprano Julia Doyle's \"beautiful rendering of Lascia ch'io pianga at a Handel concert at Kings Place\".",
