  "content": "It's four o'clock in the afternoon on a Sunday and French Guiana's rainy season is living up to its name. In the capital, Cayenne, it's bucketing down, pouring off the roofs in cascades and turning lawns into ankle-deep swamps. But a bit of rain isn't going to stop the country's Haitian community. Inside a small hall, music is pumping, flags are waving and dancing is verging on the X-rated. This is the Haitian F\u00eate du Drapeau (flag day) and I've come here with my new couchsurfing friend, Marie, and her Haitian boyfriend, Clenord. Our small group comprises the only non-Haitians in the room, but the gyrating crowd barely bats an eyelid - they're too busy trying to outdo one another in an impromptu dance-off. Marie, a sharp-humoured, 51-year-old English teacher, moved to French Guiana just under two years ago from her native France. However, her involvement in hospitality tourism - the idea of offering free accommodation, guided tours or simply friendship to passing travellers - goes back much further. For more than 20 years, she was a member of Servas, the first formal hospitality network (joomla.servas.org), before recently switching to couchsurfing.com, its younger, more web-savvy alternative. Those looking for a place to stay here can find themselves involved in a chain, with one host introducing you to the next. Even though I did not email Marie through the Couchsurfing website, as is standard practice, I find myself spending a night in her hammock having met her through another local member, Daniel (pictured), a 41-year-old maths teacher, originally from Martinique. I contacted Daniel through the site because, apart from having an online profile with glowing references and a 100% reply rate (always worth noting when trying to find a host), he is also one of the country's few Creole couchsurfers. The plan is for him to give me an insight into Creole life; although, in an unexpected twist, he ends up offering me a slice of Laos. Daniel takes me on a day trip to Cacao, a town in the countryside that was settled in the 1970s by Hmong refugees from Laos. As we wander past stilted houses and through the colourful weekend market, scented with tropical fruits and spices, he asks repeatedly if I like the place, worried it's not \"different enough\". I tell him to rest assured - a Laotian village that's simultaneously part of South America and the European Union is fascinating. In the end, my desire for a slice of local Creole culture is provided by Thomas, a 26-year-old from mainland France who has been in the country for three years. I find him listed on hospitalityclub.org, although it turns out he is also a member of couchsurfing.com and knows Marie, at least via email. Thomas is happy to show me around Cayenne's cultural highlights and suggests we attend a tambor (drum) night. He takes me to a small house in the rundown La Crique district which hosts tambor lessons and where, afterwards, the musicians stick around to show off their skills. What follows is an informal, free concert that lasts until the early hours, as local singers, dancers and passers-by join in. I end up staying with Thomas and his equally welcoming housemates for four nights, but keep contact with Marie, Daniel, Clenord and friends. They take me to the rainforest to spot sloths, to the beach to look for sea turtles, and to the swamplands to search for caiman. We enjoy a barbecue dinner, courtesy of another registered couchsurfer, Stephan, and go swimming with yet another local member, Tibo, who has been posted here by the French Army. We have a couple of nights at the Creek, the nickname for a southern district of Cayenne that my guidebook tells me I should avoid. It is undeniably edgy, but we have a great time barhopping though joints run by Haitians, Brazilians and Dominicans. French Guiana's population is nothing if not diverse. You could \"go local\" here in all manner of ways. An Amerindian called Daniel tells me that if I want to go 100% local I need to mix with the country's indigenous people. This is one base couchsurfing has yet to cover, although perhaps Daniel will help to correct that. Without my hosts, my trip would have been more complicated, much more expensive and far less personal. Thanks to them, it has been one of my most successful travel-networking experiences to date. Who knows whether my luck will continue in Brazil, but I'm optimistic I'll be in safe hands in Bel\u00e9m with mother-and-daughter team, Lucinea and Oriana. Thomas's tips \u00b7 Restaurant Abriba (33 rue des Dahlias, 00594 594 31 98 73) is a small place but offers some of the best traditional Cr\u00e9ole cooking in town. \u00b7 Try the Asian-style soups amid the multicultural atmosphere of March\u00e9 de Cayenne (Wed, Fri and Sat), Cayenne's biggest market. \u00b7 Head to Le Jungle Pub (Boulevard Jubelin) on Wednesday evenings when a Bretagne cook serves up crepes with a variety of fillings. \u00b7 Chez Julietta in Place Mentel. On Monday night, get a free bowl of Brazilian soup when you buy a drink. Also good at the weekend for dancing brega and drinking caipirinhas. WAYN's world \"Wouldn't it be cool if you could visualise your friends on a map?\" said Jerome Touze to fellow 20-something and self-confessed \"entrepreneurship junkie\", Peter Ward, in the pub one day. This was the beginning of Where Are You Now? (WAYN.com), one of travel networking's biggest commercial successes. With 11.7m users and growing by an average of 20,000 new members per day, the site has developed from being a means to simply keep track of friends' whereabouts into a one-stop-shop for all things travel related. You can use it to book flights and accommodation, share tips, arrange events, find an overseas penpal or perhaps even get a date (\"Serious relationship wanted,\" read one recent forum post). Having signed a series of high-profile partnerships with the likes of Money Supermarket and Hotel Club, recent estimates have valued WAYN to be worth around \u00a3100m. No surprise then, that there are several new travel networking start-ups out there, such as Doyoutravel.com and Addictedtotravel.com, hoping to follow in WAYN's footsteps. vicky.baker@theguardian.com"
