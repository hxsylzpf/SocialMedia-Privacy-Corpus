  "content": "Communication is key to any good relationship, even that of landlord and tenant. For many councils and housing associations, working closely with residents is integral to the way they work; it helps them save money and improve services. Andy Orrey, chief executive of Ongo Homes, says it helps him ensure that his organisation provides the right services, in the right places, to the right people. But what opportunity for influence is there for tenants who are not part of a traditional involvement structure, or do not want to be? Or whose landlords are not committed to involving their tenants? In the past it might have been a case of writing an angry letter to the local paper or simply bad-mouthing the council or housing association The rise of social media, and in particular the way the housing sector has embraced Twitter, may have changed all that. Rob Gershon, Philip Green and the pseudonymous Bessy Banks are three tenants who aren't currently part of their landlords' traditional involvement structures and governance but are, in their very different ways, making themselves heard. Gershon is a carer, and blogs and tweets as @Simplicitly. He began blogging as a response to the bedroom tax because he found the policy \"infuriating and senseless. I took to the internet and landed in the world of housing\". Despite receiving information and invitations from his landlord he \"usually sent it back to the council in the recycling\". Gershon believes that the process of involving tenants is a work-in-progress for many landlords and gets frustrated by the PR spin that whitewashes the genuine experiences of many tenants. Gershon's life has undoubtedly changed as a result of his writing and tweeting: \"My opinions now feature in the press and I campaign for social housing. In an ironic twist, I'm about to start a part-time job in resident involvement.\" Green (@apootler) lives on the Boundary estate, Britain's oldest council estate, in east London. He has seen massive changes locally in the 25 years he has lived there, and joined a tenants' association \"that had already seen off the first attempt to take council housing out of the control of the council\". A recent resident-led initiative almost bit the dust after his landlord issued an insensitive communication, but Philip responded by blogging and tweeting about it, and communicated directly with the chief executive. He managed to build bridges with her, and the project will now go ahead. In addition, the chief executive agreed to the estate hosting Fun Palace, a temporary local festival of arts and science, in 2016. \"The Boundary is uniting again \u2013 there's still life in Britain's first council estate,\" says Green. Banks (@CultofBromford) has a different story. She took to social media after she \"got nowhere\" with a traditional complaints route, and used Twitter because it seemed to be the platform of choice for her landlord. It was important to Banks for all communication with her landlord to be viewed publicly and she has rejected requests to take her complaints offline. \"We're amplifying [tenant] voices via our blog,\" she says. Banks compares her story to that of David and Goliath: \"A few people with a computer versus whole departments there to present their housing association in the most favourable light.\" When relations between landlords and tenants soured, there was previously no outlet for frustrations: now both landlords and tenants can use social media to build relationships and improve services. The increasing influence and impact of people such as Gershon, Green and Banks indicate that the tide may well be turning in favour of a more equal tenant/landlord relationship.
