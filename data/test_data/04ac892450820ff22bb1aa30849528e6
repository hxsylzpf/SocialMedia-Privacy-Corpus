  "content": "Good week for Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai, who have been awarded the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize. Estonia, which became the first ex-Soviet state to legalise gay marriage. Bad week for Central African Republic, after fresh clashes broke out in Bangui, the capital, amid growing tension between rival militias. Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta, who appeared at the International Criminal Court for inciting election violence. Quote of the week This week's quote comes from Mery Medina, a Colombian activist with women's rights network Mariposas, about how development would reduce violence in her home country. Peace will come if we have social investment. We lack jobs, good education, medical services. We do not have spaces where children can enjoy their childhoods \u2026 80% of the population live in absolute poverty. All this comes together to create violence.\" What you're saying Reflecting on the future of global development communications, UN Women intern @CatPhillips says campaigns need to avoid one-dimensional portrayals.
