  "content": "Conservative communities secretary Eric Pickles and former Labour deputy PM John Prescott have a history of antagonism, running back to a joke the former made two years ago about the latter's bulimia. Recently, the Tory heavyweight had a fresh dig at Prezza over his department's spending \u2013 particularly on pot plants. Now it appears the battle is heading for Twitter. Apparently Pickles reckons he will soon overtake Prescott in terms of followers \u2013 he currently has 11,600 against Prezza's 38,700. The Daily Telegraph reports that Pickles's followers include Charlie Whelan and Evan Davis \u2013 and despite his role in the frontline of government cost-cutting, his bashing of council-run freesheets could win him a few fans among newspaper publishers too.",
