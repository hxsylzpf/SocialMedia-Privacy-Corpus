  "content": "The thorny issue of whether stars are entitled to have their privacy protected by law remains \"deeply murky\" following today's court ruling on Catherine Zeta Jones' wedding photographs, celebrity PRs have warned. Madonna's media adviser, Barbara Charone, said celebrity culture was at \"fever pitch\" and the courts needed to clarify celebrities' positions. \"It all seems very confused. Just because you're famous it shouldn't mean you are not entitled to a private life,\" said Ms Charone. \"I welcome today's decision but I think it's a shame it's over a case like this. I think you're treading on very shaky ground when your own granny can't even bring a camera to your wedding,\" she added. Mark Borkowski, head of Borkowski PR, said although Zeta Jones and her husband, Michael Douglas, had effectively won their case, tabloid editors would be secretly pleased with today's verdict. \"It doesn't really sort out the issue of privacy - it's been left in very murky waters indeed. All it says to people is you'll have to spend lots of money to defend yourself. I would have thought every Fleet Street editor would be chuckling into their gin and tonics tonight,\" he said. \"Hello! is confused about what this means, everyone is confused about what this means. No one knows where the line in the sand is going to be drawn in these cases.\" Publicist Max Clifford said the ruling \"changed nothing\" and had only served to damage Zeta Jones' reputation. \"Nothing changes because of this decision. It has been a PR disaster for Catherine Zeta Jones and I don't think OK! has come out of it all that well either. \"When Richard Desmond did the same thing over Gloria Hunniford's wedding, Hello! didn't kick up a fuss and I think they've come out of this looking pretty good,\" he said. \"Catherine Zeta Jones has been quoted as saying she was violated because a magazine showed a picture of her eating cake. \"After the images of children with their limbs blown off that we have seen on television over the past few weeks I don't think anyone's going to take too kindly to that.\" Mr Clifford said celebrities were \"totally wrapped up in themselves\", adding: \"I hope the day doesn't come when they have even more power over what is written about them.\" But James Herring, who counts Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan among his celebrity clients, said today's judgment had gone some way to clarifying celebrities' legal rights. \"One key thing is that it undoes the argument that celebrities who choose to put themselves into Hello! have no rights to privacy, which has frequently been cited as a key point of principle,\" said Mr Herring. \"This decision seems to be saying that is not a valid argument. But whether it actually changes editors' behaviour depends on how much they are awarded in damages,\" he added. But few in the PR industry agreed with the assertion of the Hello! publishing director, Sally Cartwright, who said today's verdict would put an end to press spoilers. \"There'll never be an end to spoilers. Any time anyone describes the end of anything over a case like this it tends to mean the opposite. Spoilers are dead, long live the spoiler,\" said Mr Borkowski."
