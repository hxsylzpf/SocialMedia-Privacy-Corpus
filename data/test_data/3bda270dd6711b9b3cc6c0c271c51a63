  "content": "The supermodel Naomi Campbell scored an important high court victory yesterday, confirming that even the most publicity-driven celebrities now have the right to keep some parts of their lives private. But she was branded a liar by the judge, Mr Justice Morland, who found that \"she lied on oath\" when she denied in court she had been rushed to hospital for a drugs overdose. \"She has shown herself to be over the years lacking in frankness and veracity with the media and manipulative and selective in what she has chosen to reveal about herself,\" he said. The judge awarded her \u00a33,500 damages for articles in the Mirror exposing her treatment for drug addiction and then \"trashing her as a person\" after she sued. The judgment - which follows similar actions by TV presenter Jamie Theakston and an unnamed Premiership footballer - was hailed as a landmark case by her lawyers for establishing that everyone in the public eye has some right to privacy. But the ruling failed to create a new law of privacy, and confirmed that celebrities must rely on the existing law of confidentiality, enhanced by the Human Rights Act. The judgment - which followed a week-long hearing last month - also established that it was \"entirely legitimate\" and in the public interest for the Mirror to expose Campbell as a drug addict since she had lied about this in the past, and in the interests of \"balanced and positive\" journalism to reveal the fact of her treatment. But Mr Justice Morland ruled that her confidentiality was breached when the paper went into details of the treatment. That decision led the Mirror's editor Piers Morgan to describe the result as \"a complete farce.\" He added: \"I am at a complete loss to understand what this case is about. She's won on a very small technical point of law in relation to confidence - and what has she achieved? \"She's ensured that when celebrities lie about taking drugs in the future we will just have to expose them and not reveal to the public that they're taking steps to confront their problem. It's a pyrrhic victory.\" He said the paper, which must also pay costs of \u00a3200,000, was considering an appeal. Campbell, 31, who was in Los Angeles yesterday following the Oscars, had originally pursued the paper for invasion of privacy, breach of confidence and breach of the Data Protection Act over the February 2001 article, which accompanied pictures of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. She dropped her privacy claim after her lawyers accepted that privacy was covered by the law of confidence, as extended by article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which became part of English law when the Human Rights Act came into force in October 2000. She then argued that information that the therapy was being obtained through NA and details of her meetings were private and confidential matters; that the Mirror knew this from their source, whom she alleged was one of her former employees; and that there was no overriding public interest in publication. Mr Justice Morland said the \"essential question\" was whether even if a public figure such as Campbell \"courts and expects media exposure, she is left with a residual area of privacy which the court should protect if its revelation would amount to a breach of confidentiality\". He ruled that details of her attendance at NA did \"bear the mark of confidentiality\", since the supermodel had dressed drably and the paper had resorted to \"surreptitious... covert photography\"; that the information was relayed by someone with \"an obligation of confidence\"; and that the Mirror was then \"clothed in conscience with the duty of confidentiality\". The model's lawyer, Keith Schilling, insisted his client was \"naturally delighted\" by the judgment. \"This is a landmark case - it establishes that anyone in the public eye, whether through choice or inadvertently, is entitled to protection for their private lives.\""
