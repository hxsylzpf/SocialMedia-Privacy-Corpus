  "content": "Danny Willett might have come from nowhere to take the Masters. But it was his brother, PJ, tweeting the final hours of the tournament from his home in Birmingham, who stole the spotlight. PJ Willett, who describes himself as \"Author. Teacher. Inexperienced Father\" on his Twitter profile, swore, drank and joked his way through the tense close to the four-day contest that saw his brother become only the second Englishman to wear the famous green jacket. His tweets included digs at Willett's rival, Jordan Spieth, as well untempered emotion as his brother edged closer to the win. At times, his tweets veered into the profane. But they also demonstrated his unrivalled joy at his brother's outstanding performance. And were often totally hilarious. When it became clear that his younger brother had beaten Spieth to take the US Masters title he was overcome. His outpouring won him fans from across the golfing world, and beyond. Willett's tweets were so popular that he started trending in the UK. And he seemed rather pleased with his handiwork. At the same time, sporting greats were paying tribute to Willett's victory, including former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan, who shares his hometown, Sheffield, with Willett. In a reference to the tradition where the Masters winner chooses the menu for the following year's champions' dinner, the 2008 winner, South Africa's Trevor Immelman, tweeted: \"Bangers and mash this time next year....\""
