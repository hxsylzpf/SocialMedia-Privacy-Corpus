  "content": "Facebook lookback videos have been swamping the social networking site over the past month but we've got three spoof specials for you \u2013 a dip into the amazing world of Justin Bieber, a Star Wars special featuring Darth Vader \u2013 and look back over the life of Walter White from Breaking Bad. Although many celebrities enjoy the publicity boost such sites give them, other tire of the insults they recieve, especially on Twitter. Jimmy Kimmel gathered a host of international stars \u2013 including John Goodman, George Clooney, Tom Hanks, Benedict Cumberbatch, Cate Blanchett, Matt Damon and Jon Hamm \u2013 and got them to read out upsetting tweets that they had been sent. One star doing exactly what he has been told this week is Bruno Mars, who filmed a guest appearance on Ellen. The singer had an appontment with a nurse but, unbeknown to her, everything that he said and did was being dictated by Ellen Degeneres via an earpiece. The results are very funny. Game of Throne fans are counting the days until the start of series four and to help the wait go faster, we've got a 15-minute sneak peek. \"Some of the most shocking and mindblowing scenes of the entire series come at the end of this coming season,\" says co-creator David Benioff. Can't wait! There was a long wait for urban climbers Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov before they could gain entry and climb the second tallest building in the world. Shanghai Tower, China, without permission. The pair scaled the 632m skyscraper without any safety gear and had to wait for the clouds to part before they filmed the crazy drop from their 2,000ft-high viewpoint. Falling can't have been far from their minds and is the main feature of another of our videos \u2013 a camera dropped from an aeroplane. It lands in a pig's pen \u2013 but is this some ham's idea of a joke \u2013 or is it real? Whatever you think, it has sizzled up our chart. Guardian Viral Video Chart.
