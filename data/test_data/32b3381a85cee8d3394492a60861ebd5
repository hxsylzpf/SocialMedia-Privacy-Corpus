  "content": "The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) has received more than 850 complaints about the Sun's decision to publish the pictures of Prince Harry naked in a hotel room in Las Vegas as it emerged that two more women are touting photos and video of the controversial strip pool party. The newspaper regulator said it had not, however, received a complaint from any representative of the prince, despite a stiff warning issued by Prince Charles's personal lawyers that publication would be a breach of his son's privacy. \"Almost all the complaints are from members of the public and nearly all are about invasions of privacy,\" said a spokeswoman for the PCC. The Sun carried the photos on its front page on Friday with the headline: \"Heir It Is \u2013 pic of naked Harry you've already seen on the internet.\" It said the royal family was trying to \"muzzle the world's most vibrant newspaper\" and there was a \"clear public interest\" for publication, claiming it was important its readers were fully informed about a \"legitimate public debate about the behaviour of the man who is third in line to the throne\". St James's Palace, which had used law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis to warn papers that publication would be a breach of the PCC's code of conduct in relation to photos taken on private property, said it had \"no comment to make on the photos or the prince's privacy\". Harbottle &amp; Lewis had said there was no justification under English law to publish and that \"the only possible reason for publication of the photographs is one of prurience and nothing more\". Reaction to the Sun's decision was mixed: press freedom campaigners came out in support but some media lawyers branded it a cynical move designed to make money from increased sales. The Daily Mail demanded explanations about the royal protection officer who apparently watched while the game of strip pool was being played and was photographed by the young women who were at Harry's party. Public relations consultant Max Clifford said he received two calls \"within two or three hours of each other\" from two American women on Thursday who claimed to have more video and photographic evidence for sale. \"They said they have very interesting material and was I the same person who represented Simon Cowell and would I represent them? I said 'no'. There was a silence. I said I don't think it's right. It's an invasion of privacy,\" Clifford said. The photos used by the Sun and seen by millions around the world were first sold to the Los Angeles showbiz site TMZ and then syndicated internationally by celebrity news agency, Splash News which was charging British titles \u00a310,000 for the set of photos. The Sun's decision to publish amounted to a complete U-turn by the paper: 24 hours earlier it had acquiesced to Prince Charles's request not to proceed with publication on the grounds that it would be a breach of clause three of the PCC's code of practice, which says it is \"unacceptable\" to use photos of people shot in private places. Instead, it went ahead with a mock-up of the pictures using a naked picture of a 21-year-old female intern and the paper's picture editor. Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth defended the Sun's right to publish pictures of Prince Harry naked, saying on Friday it would be \"sad\" if newspapers could not print something that was so freely available on the internet. The decision to publish comes at a sensitive time for British newspapers which are facing the threat of statutory regulation from Leveson inquiry into media ethics. Sources at News International said the decision was not taken lightly, but there was a feeling that if they did not publish, \"a line would be drawn in the sand in the wrong place\" in terms of the boundaries for privacy claims. Media lawyer Mark Stephens said there was \"no public interest\" in publication and claimed the Sun had \"broken the law cynically, and obviously with a view to obtaining publicity\"\" Stephens said: \"He [Lord Justice Leveson] will be sitting there looking at what the Sun has done, and thinking, 'I'm going to have to regulate for the lowest common denominator, because I can't trust them to look after themselves'.\" But Padraig Reidy of Index on Censorship said the debacle showed that Leveson was having a chilling effect on press freedom: \"We are in a climate where editors are thinking twice about and it would be sad if this timidity became the dominant force in our press. I think the palace did send out a semi-threatening letter and this played into the hands of the papers and made it a press freedom issue.\" Louise Mensch, the Conservative MP for Corby, said there was a \"clear and demonstrable public interest\" in the photographs. There is no indication that other British newspapers will follow the Sun and publish the photos. The Daily Mirror said it decided not to publish because it felt \"it would be in clear breach of the PCC editors' code of practice regarding intrusion of privacy, which we signed up to\"."
