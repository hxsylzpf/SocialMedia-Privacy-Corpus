  "content": "Until last month, a meerkat was just a small mammal associated with insurance and a periscope was something one would expect to find on a submarine. But now \"Periscoping\" and \"Meerkating\" are the latest social media trends. Twitter feeds have filled up with the words \"LIVE NOW\" as the apps, which allow people to live-stream video from their mobiles, have exploded in popularity. Both Meerkat and Twitter's Periscope, which was launched Thursday, are very easy to use, prompting excitement about the possibilityfor both journalists and users to report live from the scene of major events. As the apps have grown, news organisations across the world havebegun experimenting with how to use them. Last week, the Economist was one of the first news organisations in the UK to trial Meerkat, using it to explain UK deflation. Economics correspondent Henry Curr answered questions, sent in by readers on Twitter, on a live stream, as inflation fell to 0% for the first time in recent memory. Economist deputy editor Tom Standage explained that while the use of Meerkat was an experiment, live streaming was something of which the 171-year-old publication should do more. \"Live streaming is fun and has the informality of Twitter rather than the seriousness of TV, so we should do more of it,\" he said. \"We think Meerkat/Periscope would be a great way to engage with our Twitter audience in the run-up to the British election.\" On Thursday, the launch of Periscope coincided with the first of the UK election debates. As David Cameron and Ed Miliband were interviewed by Jeremy Paxman, pulling in more than 3 million viewers on Sky and Channel 4, the competition between Meerkat and Periscope was almost as fierce. Periscope has many of the same features as Meerkat but \"makes Meerkat look like a tech demo\", according to Guardian reporter Alex Hern. The ability to save videos for later within the app and close Twitterintegration have led many to argue that Periscope is superior. Sky news, one of the broadcasters hosting the Battle for No 10 programme last week, used Periscope to give a behind-the-scenes look before and after the live Q&amp;A section of the debate. Sky journalist Joe Tidy livestreamed the view from behind the camera and walked around the \"spin room\", where journalists and broadcasters were analysing the night's events. He also used the chat and \"love heart\" functions to encourage the 200 viewers to post questions, comments and reactions, keeping them engaged. \"I think the online audience enjoyed seeing things from another angle in an exciting, chaotic way,\" he said. \"I think I and other reporters will use it a lot. It's a really easy way to go live very quickly without needing anyone else or any other kit. I think Periscope/ Meerkat will be used on a case-by-case basis for more fun things to enhance our social media storytelling.\" The main appeal of both apps is their potential for live-streaming breaking news events. In the 24 hours after the launch of Periscope, two breaking news stories were broadcast through the app. When a building collapsed in New York City's East Village, bystanders began sharing what they could see with Periscope. The Huffington Post publicised a link to one of the streams on Twitter and at one stage, one stream had more than 600 people watching. On the US West Coast, reporters for NBC4 Los Angeles used Periscope and Meerkat as they followed a dramatic police car chase. Gadi Schwartz and Kenny Holmes were just finishing their shift when they heard the station helicopter following a high speed taxi and they decided to put the possibilities of Periscope to the test. Schwartz said: \"We had been experimenting with Periscope and Meerkat throughout the day so I decided to fire up Periscope. At one point we could see the chase approaching us from behind so we pulled to the side of the freeway and let the suspect and pursuing officers pass. The taxi flew by, and we put our viewers close enough to see and hear a bare rim shooting sparks and dragging along the freeway with California Highway Patrol in hot pursuit. \"It's not something people normally experience live and we were excited to share our first-hand view.\" As well as being extremely easy to use, live-streaming from a mobile can allow journalists to report in ways previous unavailable. Schwartz explained: \"Eventually, the pursuit reached an area usually too dark for our news helicopter to follow. Ordinarily at this point, now 12am, our live coverage would have ended completely. But both phones still had juice in their batteries and we could still see how directly engaged the viewers had become in the chat so we continued on for another 2+ hours.\" Schwartz said that the audience watching the police chase stream was diverse. It attracted about 500 or 600 people from across the US as well as Australia, Canada, Europe and the Middle East. A separate stream on Meerkat had about 160 viewers. These viewers were also engaged with the story, even using the chat function to help Schwartz and Holmes with directions when they were lost in the desert. The numbers aren't exactly huge, but so soon after launch, there's clearly potential to build. There are of course still many issues with both Meerkat and Periscope, particularly the inability to stream in landscape format, which makes it very difficult to use the footage online or on television. But despite drawbacks, journalists and users are excited about what these apps can do and how they will change the way breaking news is reported. Schwartz said: \"I'm excited at any new opportunity to bring people closer to the news as it unfolds and [Thursday] night left me with the distinct feeling that something about live coverage has changed.\""
