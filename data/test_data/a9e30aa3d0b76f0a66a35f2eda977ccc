  "content": "Yahoo said on Wednesday it had discovered another major cyber attack (saying data from more than 1bn user accounts was compromised in August 2013). This is the largest such breach in history. The hackers forged cookies - files that stay in the user's browser cache so that a website doesn't require a login with every visit. The faked cookies allow an intruder to access users' accounts without a password. The company believes the hacks are connected and that the breaches are \"state-sponsored\". The Yahoo hack is the latest to compromise massive amounts of user data. Over the last few years companies like MySpace, Tumblr, TalkTalk and Ashley Madison have also fallen victim. Along with email addresses and passwords, breaches can reveal bank details and family information which can be used for identity theft.. We want to hear from people affected by hacking . What happened and how did it impact on your life? Were your bank details revealed? Share your stories with us below the line.",
