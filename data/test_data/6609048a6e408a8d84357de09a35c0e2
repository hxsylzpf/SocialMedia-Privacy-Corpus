  "content": "As the world changes, so art changes with it. New mediums emerge, demanding the same legitimacy that has over time been afforded to the novel, to photography, cinema and television. And as we become familiar with the conventions of these new forms they have the potential to transform the way in which we think about live performance. Just as our understanding of Shakespeare is shaped by the printing presses that he paid so little attention to, so too the future could well be defined by the new resources we have at our disposal to remember, to study and to reproduce the theatre of our own time. A new project launched today attempts to re-imagine the means by which we record live theatre, embracing the visual, the devised, the intimate, the interactive, the durational, poly-platial, the site-specific. It aims to dramatically transform the means by which a work continues to exist after the live performance is over, and in so doing forge a space for these unusual practices within the great canon of theatre history. It's a courageous project, one that acknowledges the failure of conventional modes of documentation \u2013 the play script, the photograph, the DVD \u2013 to adequately map the evasive theatrical landscape of contemporary performance, asking the bold question: what else that's around today might be a better fit? Supported by the Arts Council and the National Theatre Bookshop, the project, called simply Mossflower, is starting small; should it be successful, however, there are already plans in place to greatly expand its scope and ambition. For now though it is beginning with three \"significant\" theatre pieces, each of which it intends to document in a dizzyingly original way. The first project under way is to re-conceive of Complicite's maths-themed light and magic show A Disappearing Number as a full-length graphic novel, written by Simon McBurney and illustrated by the brilliant Dave Gibbons. The aim is to represent the piece's elaborate visual trickery with equal force and poetry as the words of the piece. The episodic flow of the graphic form is intended to more delicately convey the movement of the piece than photography or video, and allow creative space for future artists to interpret each \"panel\" as they might presently a line or a stage direction. Also already planned is a dazzling attempt to transform Punchdrunk's majestic version of The Masque of the Red Death into a beautifully rendered first-person online videogame. Created in partnership with legendary game designers Valve using the same game engine as Half Life 2, the project will allow online players to roam around a stunning simulacrum of BAC's labyrinthine Victorian home. Excitingly, this piece also offers the tantalising possibility of an additional real-world encounter, with the first 20 people to complete the game having the opportunity to discover a specially-commissioned new piece hidden somewhere in London. Finally \u2013 at least for now \u2013 there comes a daring reanimation of one of Tehching Hsieh's legendary one-year performances via the medium of Twitter. Every hour on the hour for a whole year a tweet will be published announcing simply \"Tehching Hsieh was present\". At the end of the year the piece will begin again. The hope is that this project will continue indefinitely \u2013 a radical means by which audiences everywhere can engage directly with the full durational weight of this truly remarkable piece. All of this, however, is simply the beginning. Other works by theatremakers including Tim Etchells, Chris Goode and Katie Mitchell are strapped to the operating board awaiting the same treatment. A brave new world awaits, and I for one am looking forward to it.",
