  "content": "If you have never heard of Thomas Barnes, he would probably be pleased. The first great editor of the Times \u2013 the man who in the 1820s and 1830s built it to a level of authority and influence few newspapers have since equalled \u2013 was not keen on seeing his name in print. More or less the first time it appeared in his own paper was in his death notice, a two-line classified ad that made no mention of his job. His editorship was at one point sufficiently hidden that several other people, including the paper's proprietor, John Walter, had to deny holding the post. And for several years his chief political source was a correspondent known, even to him, as \"B\". Last week, Barnes's heirs at the Times won the right at the high court to name one of his heirs in journalistic secrecy: the award-winning police blogger NightJack, who has now taken down his website and been reprimanded by his employer. It is odd to see this particular crusade pursued by the former temple of anonymity in the British press, a paper so proud for so long of its own secrets. It is true that UK journalists no longer have such an urgent need for anonymity. James Harding can go out in public and proclaim himself editor of the Times without the least risk of having his ears cropped for seditious libel. Not even NightJack \u2013 or detective constable Richard Horton, as we know now \u2013 has to fear that. But, writing in the Times, he did suggest that, as well risking some pain for his family and for Lancashire Constabulary, exposure might have put him in a degree of physical danger. \"Over the years, I have dealt with some unpleasant characters. I know that some of them have made determined but unsuccessful efforts to find me and I believe that some of them are still looking. I didn't want their task made easier.\" Bloggers who do not bear the physical dangers of police work have also been made anxious by the NightJack case. After all, even bloggers who do not discuss their work or sex lives have to bear pressures individually that for journalists are handled mostly institutionally. Tom Reynolds wrote on Random Acts of Reality \u2013 his blog about London ambulance work, which initially concealed his identity: \"I'm mindful that a lot of exceptionally interesting, thought-provoking blogs might now come to an end. \"What is to stop companies and public bodies from hunting down people who may have been negative about them? What blogger, with bills to pay and mouths to feed, is now going to take the chance of lifting the lid on mismanagement, badly though policies or idiotic governmental decrees when there is the very real chance that their identities can be revealed for nothing more than a lurid headline on someone's chip wrapper?\" Psuedonymity and anonymity can be abused, of course. But they can also be used well, and in the service of the public, as hundreds of years of British journalism has intermittently proved. Today's journalists receive bylines routinely and bitch about the pseudonymous comments under their pieces. Do we believe that they are radically more responsible than journalists a generation ago, when bylines were rare? Does anyone find the pseudonymous columnists in the anonymous Economist radically less responsible than their counterparts in the byline-laden Spectator? Or the Times's anonymous obituaries more scurrilous than the bylined ones in the Guardian? Does the prominence of the 3am Girls' photographs make them that much more sober and careful than our own pseudonymous Media Monkey? I can see how Lord Justice Eady, who delivered the verdict in the NightJack case, detects a \"trend towards openness\" in British life. Where journalists want greater openness in their own organisations, I'd agree with them. But I can't see how any journalist with a grain of awareness about their craft and its history can join in a blanket condemnation of all anonymous writing.",
