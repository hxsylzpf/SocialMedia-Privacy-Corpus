  "content": "While some publications use SEO-friendly headlines to send out bland Tweets, Smithsonian Magazine (@SmithsonianMag) has distinguished itself as the adorable and beloved nerd of publication Twitter by sharing facts with subtle sass. It's been around since Fall 2008 \u2013 sharing cicada recipes and explaining why wealthy Americans used to marry poor British nobles. Natasha Geiling is the Twitter feed's most recent wrangler and has been working with it since July. She said: I stumbled upon it as a job out of college, and it has been so much fun taking over the reins of the Twitter feed. It's a job that really does itself in many ways \u2013 we publish such interesting articles in a wide range of topics, so it's easy to tweet out real attention grabbers! The Twitter feed is part of the magazine's deep social media presence, which includes a Facebook page, a Tumblr and an Instagram account, where it allows contributing photographers to run the feed for a week. Geiling was able to get @SmithsonianMag to answer a few questions for Status Update. What was your first screen name? I can't remember our first screen name \u2026 which is ironic, because our first magazine cover featured elephants, and you know what they say about an elephant never forgetting \u2013 observations have shown that elephants hold grudges for years, even toward tribes that hunt them. But remembering is a leisure reserved for elephants and print \u2026 on Twitter everything is so quick, it's hard to remember what happened last week, let alone years ago. What was your worst day ever? Any day that the internet in the office is running slowly \u2013 it's hard to get tweets out when the internet isn't cooperating. What is your favorite smell? A copy of Smithsonian magazine hot off the press. Who would you invite to your ideal dinner party? Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano), the guys from @Radiolab and Miss Piggy. What cocktail are you most like and why? A Long Island Iced Tea \u2026 a little bit of everything, and strong, but so much fun you don't even notice. But unlike a Long Island Iced Tea, there's no regret when you consume me. What are three items you will always find in your refrigerator? Frozen meals, various leftovers from weeks ago that no one has claimed for lunch, and one passive aggressive note on the outside of the refrigerator. What were you doing at midnight last night? Resting silently and preparing for a day full of tweets. What did your last text message you received say? It was a quote from Zoolander from Smithsonian magazine's multimedia producer. \"Hansel, he's so hot right now.\" I try to work in as many references to this cinematography classic as I can. What is a word you say a lot? #Panda. Between the baby panda, panda cam and panda science, it's a popular topic. Who was your first crush? @Nasa. From classic Neil Armstrong photos to Bobak Ferdowsi's faux hawk, I just can't get enough. What was your worst injury ever? I'm still not a verified Twitter account! It's a huge injury to my ego. National Geographic's twitter account is verified but not me. No love. What is the last song you listened to? \"The Sounds of the Universe\", a selection of space sounds turned into music by Mickey Hart, the former Grateful Dead drummer, and George Smoot, a Nobel Prize-winning cosmologist."
