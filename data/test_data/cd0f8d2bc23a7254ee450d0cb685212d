  "content": "Social gaming company We R Interactive has added former EMI chief executive Elio Leoni-Sceti and Paul Fitzsimons, a former media partner at private equity group Apax Partners, to its roster of high-profile investors. They join media names including Fru Hazlitt, ITV's commercial and online director, Eric Fellner, co-chair of Bridget Jones film producer Working Title and ad agency founder Peter Mead in a $5m (\u00a33.07m) second-round fundraising, which saw all existing shareholders increase their stakes. We R Interactive, founded last year by former Sony and Eidos executive David Rose, creates social games for smartphones and websites including Facebook. The venture aims to be a British rival to Zynga, the maker of successful Facebook game FarmVille. The funds will be used to support the development and global expansion of We R's first game, I AM PLAYR, a football-themed title which can be played on Facebook or on a dedicated website. Players see through the footballer's eyes and decide his actions on and off the pitch. We R is planning further titles in music and fashion. The group is chaired by former media analyst Richard Dale. \"In a very short period of time We R Interactive has proven its credentials as a company, bringing real innovation to the online gaming space, and a relevant new product genre which builds on a diversified revenue model,\" said Leoni-Sceti. He is investing through the private equity business, Leoni Sceti Group, set up by his cousin Patrick Leoni-Sceti, which he has chaired since leaving troubled EMI earlier this year. We R generates revenues from players, who pay to buy kit for their characters, and product placement. Brands paying to feature include Nike, Ginsters pasties and the Red Bull drinks brand. Since the first fundraising in July last year, I AM PLAYR has acquired 140,000 monthly unique users. \"We're delighted to be adding to our already great register of shareholders. Their commitment is a great endorsement of our business model,\" said Rose. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
