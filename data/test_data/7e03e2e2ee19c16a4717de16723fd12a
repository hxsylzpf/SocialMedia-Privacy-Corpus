  "content": "Can you remember the first violent \"war snuff film\" you watched on the internet? I can't. But one of the early ones that still sticks in memory was that one of the soldier in Chechnya, someone was sawing his leg off on the battlefield. It's an internet classic now. It was 2001, just after the 9/11 attacks; online video was still a nascent phenomenon \u2013 there was no YouTube, no Facebook, no Twitter. Like many of my peers, in late 2001 I spent a lot of time online digging around on Islamist websites linked with al-Qaida to try and make sense of who was behind the attack on New York. I wanted to understand the role the internet played in forming and maintaining the social bonds of this global movement that flew planes into our buildings. I'd seen gore before on and offline, and I'd seen plenty of internet shock material published for entertainment and gross-out ogling purposes on sites like rotten.com and Stile Project. But seeking out and watching explicit online videos that documented torture and politically-related killings for news purposes was, for me and others, not yet a daily routine. It is now, and I don't know if that's an entirely good thing. I do believe that truth is a good thing. And to the extent that the flood of bloody videos pouring out of Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Libya and elsewhere right now document the truth, they are important. As commercial cable news networks (at least, in the US) evolve into something more like entertainment channels than the news outlets they began as, our access to these ugly streaming truths matters even more. Distant shots of missile drops are less likely to inspire empathy than a YouTube clip of a man in Libya whose lower jaw has just been blown off, who is still shouting for freedom. And yes, that video exists; the tireless Twitter chronicler Andy Carvin at NPR (@acarvin) tweeted it last week, along with many other videos like it. (I don't know how he does it; I could not keep up his tolerance or his pace.) But human beings do not have an endless capacity for empathy, and our capacity is less so in the mediated, disembodied, un-real realm of online video. At what point does access to war gore become harmful to the viewer, and at what point do each of us who observe this material for the purpose of reporting the story around it, become numb or begin to experience secondary trauma? \"I keep having to remind myself that we're bearing witness,\" Andy told me recently, when we were discussing how the volume of material was affecting him personally. \"Otherwise, I think I would've lost my mind.\" The risk of mental health consequences from viewing explicit, violent material like this is real. I know what my tolerance is, and it changes; I know what I need to do to cope with the stress, the internal psychic reverberations of witnessing the death or suffering of strangers, over and over, in a video embed window on my laptop. While these clips may be crude, in production value terms, they are not always \"unedited\"; understanding what they mean, what they document, and how to put them into context, is a difficult task. Access to the ugly raw material itself is important. Reliable analysis of that material, however, is equally important. Those who provide that service deserve our respect, as does the power of the material itself. These videos document human lives. Discussion thread shortcut The author of this piece, Xeni Jardin, has been participating in the conversation below as XeniJardin. This is an excerpt selected by a Cif editor: Al3ph asks: [\u2026] These videos aren't shown on the television and they're not shown on mainstream newspaper websites. Not entirely sure even YouTube will host them. They're not something I've ever stumbled across. No, whatever excuses people make - as with porn! - you do have to go actively looking for 'em. Like you I'm a digital old-timer, a digital native. I worked out a long time ago that there are things I need to protect myself from online; things there is no benefit for me in seeing. Why do you make it part of your \"daily routine\"? XeniJardin responds: @Al3ph, for those of us who work in news, yes: seeking out and viewing information about conflict is routine. [\u2026] I think what's new here is that never before have so many videos of this nature been so readily available to both reporters and \"civilians;\" one can log on to YouTube and cruise through this footage all day if you wish. It's so readily available to casual observers, right next to the dog-on-a-skateboard videos and Rebecca Black caterwauling.",
