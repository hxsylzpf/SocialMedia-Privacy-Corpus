  "content": "There are few things that make me more suspicious of a company than when they push out some sort of news announcement late on a Friday afternoon. It's almost always bad news, purposely intended to miss the news cycle and seem like old hat by the time Monday morning rolls around. This sort of damage limitation technique is a time-honoured tradition: the West Wing called it taking out the trash; Labour spin doctor Jo Moore gave it when she suggested that September 11, 2001 was \"a good day to bury bad news\". So when an email popped up in my inbox at the tail end of Friday from Facebook that started out by saying \"apologies for the late timing\", my radar immediately went off. And then, it turned out, the email was detailing a $9.5m legal settlement between Facebook and a number of litigants over its controversial Beacon advertising system. So was Facebook burying bad news? Or just running late? I think the answer's pretty clear - and I don't think we should let Facebook get away with it so easily. Beacon, if you remember, was an advertising system put in place by Facebook late in 2007. It took activity you conducted on other websites - for example buying a DVD from an online retailer - and sent that information back to Facebook. The idea was that all your friends would see your actions on their page (\"Bobbie has just bought True Blood on DVD!\") with a link so that you could follow suit; something which would be useful advertising for the companies and drive purchases. That prospect proved pretty controversial with users - not least because it monitored all activity, regardless of whether you were signed into Facebook or not - and in December 2007, Mark Zuckerberg personally apologised for what he called \"lots of mistakes\" in the way the system was handled. But things really hit the fan last summer, when a class action lawsuit was lodged against the company on behalf of Facebook users, alleging that the scheme was too difficult for users to opt out of, and that it wasn't telling them the whole truth. Anyway, there's your context. What Facebook announced on Friday afternoon was that it had come to an agreement over that lawsuit - with proposals that would see two things happen if a judge in San Jose approves the settlement. Those things are: - That Beacon will close down entirely (it is still running at the moment - That Facebook will put forward $9.5m to settle the case, with the money used to create a foundation \"to benefit internet users\" - by which it means funding online privacy and security initiatives. The statement from Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt dealt with this as a net positive - Facebook had learned a lesson and internet users would get this great new foundation to make their online life better. \"We learned a great deal from the Beacon experience,\" he said. |For one, it was underscored how critical it is to provide extensive user control over how information is shared. We also learned how to effectively communicate changes that we make to the user experience... We look forward to the creation of the foundation and its work to educate Internet users on how best to control their privacy; engage in safe social networking practices; and, generally, enjoy themselves more online by having knowledge that gives them a greater sense of control.\" What you can probably hear through the corporate speak, though, is one great big sigh of relief. The major reason that the social network was absolutely desperate for this case to go away - and for it to miss the news cycle - is that privacy is a very, very big deal to Facebook. Like many other companies, Facebook wants to be seen as a champion of people's privacy online. However, unlike some competitors who pay lip service to the idea, I believe that Zuckerberg and friends genuinely value privacy, and for good reason: owning people's identities online is the central plank of what makes the company different. Most users register with their real names, meaning that Facebook has a lot more identifying information than other sites out there - and as long as you trust it, Facebook can use that \"privacy\" (its access to your private data) to its advantage. Lose that trust, however, and millions of people could turn away from Facebook - even it does have 300 million people on board. Beacon was the biggest mistake the company has made in its short life, though it has chipped away at other areas of what we consider public and private with things like the news feed and terms of service. But Facebook's staff know that they have to be seen to be getting privacy right. That concern with privacy is why it's treading carefully with new projects in this area, and probably pretty happy to announce the news late on a Friday. And it's why the company hired lobbyists in Washington and Brussels - including former Lib Dem MP Richard Allan. And it's why Facebook is happy to pay $9.5m to make this thing go away.",
