  "content": "Hello! has been condemned for publishing \"misleading\" photographs of the Cornish home of the actor, Kate Winslet. The press complaints commission upheld a complaint that stated the pictures Hello! used to illustrate a feature were taken by the previous owner before the house was sold to Winslet. The article, published in March, claimed to depict Winslet's \"Cornish hideaway\". It used pictures of the property's interiors, complete with the owner's possessions. Mrs Lesley Brain, the previous owner, objected because the feature did not make it clear the photographs were taken before Winslet bought the house. In its adjudication, the PCC stated: \"The commission could understand the complainant's embarrassment and irritation at the misleading impression that had been created.\" Phil Hall, the editor of Hello!, denied the feature was misleading, saying the photos had been taken by the Times, with the agreement of Mrs Brain, and had been published before. In a separate case, the PCC rejected a complaint from the BBC chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, and the director general, Greg Dyke. The pair had objected to a Daily Mail article by the columnist, Stephen Glover, which had the headline: \"Blair, the BBC and a shameful use of cronyism\". The article claimed a memorandum had been issued by the head of BBC radio news, Stephen Mitchell, which stated the Labour MP, Keith Vaz, was not to be approached directly by reporters in the run-up to the general election. The BBC said the Mail had misquoted the memo, which had actually said the Foreign Office or the Labour Party should be contacted first as long as Mr Vaz claimed he was unwell. The corporation also said it was wrong to suggest Mr Vaz had complained to either Mr Dyke or Sir Christopher as neither were aware of the issue at the time. The BBC also complained that Glover had not approached the BBC for confirmation and had not seen the memo. The Mail claimed it had offered to publish a letter from Mr Dyke, an offer the BBC declined. The PCC rejected the complaint, noting \"there was no dispute that a memo had been issued\". It praised the Mail's offer to publish the BBC's letter and said it \"regretted any breakdown in the relationship between the two parties over this matter\"."
