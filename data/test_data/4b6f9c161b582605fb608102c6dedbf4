  "content": "\u2022 Tech industry financial results continue to flood in, with both Amazon and Microsoft doing well. Jeff Bezos and crew are in rude health with $384m profit off $9.5bn in sales - though still no word on how many Kindles have been shifted. Steve Ballmer, meanwhile, might have a smile on his face as Windows 7 pushed his company to the first sales increase in a year: $6.6bn of net income on revenue of $19bn. \u2022 The push-and-pull about the iPad continues, with no let up in the stream of arguments about whether the name is a bit funny, and whether anyone wants to buy one. But it's Friday, I'm now declaring that stuff officially boring. Instead, here are some more interesting pieces to ponder: first off, a look at what's really in the A4 chip that powers the iPad and secondly some thoughts from Adobe on the lack of Flash support. \u2022 And here's something that gives pause for thought - not just because of the tragic nature of the story, but also some of the implications. In the sentencing of a 17-year-old American woman who was the drunk driver in a car crash that killed her boyfriend, a New York judge took into account Facebook photos posted a month after the accident: that's worth thinking about.
