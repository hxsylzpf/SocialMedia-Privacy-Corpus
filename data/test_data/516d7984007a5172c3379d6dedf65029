  "content": "An \"ethical guide\" to finding out other people's secrets that could provide a template for newspapers has been put forward by Sir David Omand, the government's former security and intelligence coordinator. Omand argues that the security services face a significant challenge in learning how to access the full range of new personal databases that detail the activities and movements of private individuals in a way that is acceptable in a democratic and free society. In his paper for the Institute for Public Policy Research's national security commission, he says: \"The realm of intelligence operations is a zone to which the ethical rules that we might hope to govern private conduct as individuals in society cannot apply. Finding out other people's secrets is going to involve breaking everyday moral rules.\" His guidelines suggest: \u2022 There must be sufficient sustainable cause \u2013 it needs to be justified by the scale of potential harm. \u2022 There must be integrity of motive \u2013 it must be justified in terms of public good. \u2022 The methods used must be in proportion to the seriousness of the business in hand using minimum intrusion. \u2022 There must be proper authority \u2013 it must be authorised at a sufficiently senior level with appropriate oversight. \u2022 There must be a reasonable prospect of success \u2013 no fishing expeditions.",
