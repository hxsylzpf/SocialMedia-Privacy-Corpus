  "content": "The digital era brings new ethical dilemmas for journalists. Chief among them is the question of if and when articles should be removed from a news organisation's website. The issue came up last week in connection with the Guardian's three-day series about police monitoring of people who attend political meetings and protests. Monday's front-page report about personal information stored on intelligence databases was illustrated with a police \"spotter card\", said to have been dropped at a demonstration, which showed the faces of 24 men and women. A note on the front page invited the people pictured to contact the paper with their views. A comment piece from comedian and activist Mark Thomas, who was on the spotter card, appeared the same day. While the story didn't name others, the use of the image caused some disquiet. Two people shown on the card, who complained initially, later agreed to be identified in interviews. An occasional Guardian contributor also objected: \"You should have received approval from every individual shown, or blurred out their faces,\" he said. \"Please at least take the image off your website immediately.\" Two questions arise. First, should the spotter card have been reproduced with the story? Second, assuming the use of the image met legal and ethical thresholds at the time of publication, should the unadulterated image remain on the Guardian's website indefinitely? David Leigh, the Guardian's investigations editor, doesn't believe that the paper intruded on the private lives of those pictured: \"The photos, as far as we can tell, were all taken at public demonstrations,\" he told me. In these circumstances there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. The card was, in any case, reporter Rob Evans told me, already in the public domain: \"It was shown in close-up in the film Taking Liberties, distributed in cinemas and available on DVD,\" he said. \"This wasn't a simple decision, and all those involved thought quite hard about it in advance,\" said Leigh. \"We believed that what we were exposing was strongly in the public interest and that the impact of that exposure would be ruined if we could not publish the spotter card, letting the public see just what was going on.\" A special exemption for journalistic material in the Data Protection Act provides that restrictions on collecting and retaining personal information do not apply where publication is reasonably believed to be in the public interest. In 2002 the court of appeal decided, in Naomi Campbell's privacy case against the Mirror, that the exemption continues to apply once the material is published and it is assumed to extend to storage in web archives. The Guardian has now named 11 of those pictured on the spotter cards, either in articles published with their bylines or in interviews. Does the justification for retaining online pictures of people who haven't agreed to be identified diminish with time? Reporter Paul Lewis sticks firmly to the \"always publish\" principle. \"For us to remove something from the website there has to be a compelling case,\" he said. \"Always publish\" \u2013 the journalist's cri de coeur \u2013 is merely an excellent starting point. The end result is what can (given the legal restrictions) and what should (ethically) be published. A decade or so ago newspapers did not have online existences and stories could not be regurgitated so easily. In the age of online journalism, when search engines can bring up old stories in seconds, we need to consider whether \"always publish\" necessarily means \"publish for ever\" on the web. Leigh objects in principle to removing material from the website. \"The archive should be preserved as a record,\" he said. \"This is an old journalistic principle about not suppressing things.\" He doesn't, however, take an absolutist position: \"If someone comes to us with a compelling personal case it might be right to remove his or her picture,\" he said. \"But since you wouldn't find these people using a search engine I don't think the pictures should be taken down as a matter of course.\""
