  "content": "Status update: looking generally confused. Rowan Atkinson's Mr Bean has celebrated the not insignificant milestone of more than 20 million fans on Facebook. AKA twice as many as Top Gear. And to think, they only ever made 14 half-hour episodes. And two films. And a packet of biscuits (in a deal with Dutch company Verkade, since you ask). That really takes the biscuit. And not to be confused with this Mr Bean biscuit, presumably. Anyway, 20 million fans, eh?"
