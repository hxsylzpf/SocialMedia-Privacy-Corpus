  "content": "James Harding, the BBC News director, believes the corporation has an obligation to deliver local news and the problems facing local newspapers are \"not the BBC's fault\". Harding, the former Times editor, in his first public speech since joining the BBC in August last year, said he thought the view that the corporation should limit its local news output for fear of damaging local newspapers was mistaken. He added that the BBC thrived on competition with local papers and would do \"anything to help\" them, but they should be worrying about internet rivals such as Google and Facebook, not the corporation. Harding said the BBC1 6.30pm regional bulletins collectively get a bigger audience than the preceding early evening national news bulletin \u2013 with about 5.5 million viewers verses 4.5 million \u2013 underscoring the corporation's public service broadcasting obligation to deliver local news. \"I say this because there is what I consider to be a mistaken view that the BBC should rein in its local news coverage for fear of aggravating the economic woes facing local newspapers,\" Harding said on Monday night, delivering the first WT Stead lecture at the British Library in London. \"We have a direct interest in the health of local newspapers and regional newsrooms. We thrive thanks to vibrant public debate and courtesy of the stories and ideas unearthed by our colleagues in rival news organisations,\" he added. \"But, let me be clear, the problems facing the local newspaper industry are not the BBC's fault. The classified advertising market has moved online, but the local newspaper industry's problems lie with the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Gumtree, eBay and a long, long tail of others. \"I am acutely concerned by the pressures facing the local newspaper industry and we at the BBC will do anything to help. But the BBC's primary responsibility must be to serve licence fee payers \u2013 and they want and are entitled to the best possible local news services we can deliver.\" The BBC had started buying rushes from Grimsby-based Estuary TV, the first of the new local TV services launched in November, Harding revealed during a Q&amp;A session after the speech. He added that training was another area where the BBC could help local media. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
