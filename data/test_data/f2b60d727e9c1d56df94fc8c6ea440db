  "content": "The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, warned newspapers last night that increasingly fevered coverage of rape allegations against eight Premiership footballers could prejudice any future trial. Lord Goldsmith's intervention came in the wake of widespread coverage of allegations by a 17-year-old girl that she was attacked in a central London hotel by the footballers. The allegations were carried on the front pages of several newspapers yesterday, as well as on broadcast media and the internet, where websites carried the names of players rumoured to be involved. The Daily Sport meanwhile published the name of a club it claimed was at the centre of the investigation, accompanied by an editorial which said it would be \"foolhardy\" to name individuals. As investigators from Operation Sapphire, Scotland Yard's specialist sex crimes unit, viewed CCTV footage and completed a forensic search of rooms at the Grosvenor House hotel, where the attack is alleged to have taken place, concerns were raised at the prospect of the players' names becoming public. David Blunkett, the home secretary, is keen to avoid legislation and is known to be concerned that if the footballers' names do become widely known the case could be cited by MPs in favour of legislation to restrict what the media can report in such cases. The case, which follows recent police investigations into alleged sexual offences by television celebrities Matthew Kelly and John Leslie (neither of whom was charged), could also have an impact on the Sexual Offences bill, which is due back before the Commons later this month. Currently newspapers and other media are bound by defamation laws and the Contempt of Court Act, which is intended to prevent prejudicial information reaching the public domain but is rarely invoked. Both the home affairs and culture, media and sport select committees have proposed an amendment to the bill that would make it illegal for newspapers to publish the name of anyone being investigated for a sexual offence until they have been charged. Before this case arose Mr Blunkett instructed officials to attempt to engineer a compromise. He is particularly concerned about the role of the police in the naming of players, and has asked the Association of Chief Police Officers for assistance in preventing officers leaking information to the press. Mr Blunkett has also sought to engage the assistance of the media. In the summer the Home Office wrote to Les Hinton, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission's code of practice committee, seeking a hardening of the voluntary code which governs newspaper journalists. In his guidance to editors Lord Goldsmith said he was concerned that evidence in the case was not distorted by \"potentially prejudicial reporting\", and warned editors not to allow their staff to approach potential witnesses. \"Although there have not yet been any arrests, and there may not be any, if there are to be criminal proceedings ... editors should not engage in conduct, nor publish material, including comment, that may create a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the course of justice in these prosecutions.\" The attorney general's warning, echoed by the Metropolitan police last night, emphasises the scale of interest in the allegations, which first emerged in the Sun on Monday. Football has never had a higher profile, and were eight of the game's leading players to face such serious charges the trial would be a huge story. The combination of celebrity and sex tests the media's powers of restraint like no other however, and there are fears that the players could be named in a similar way to Leslie, who was named in connection with an alleged sexual assault on Ulrika Jonsson by TV presenter Matthew Wright. Paul Gilbert, a media lawyer at Finers Stephens Innocent, said that a swift conclusion to the police investigation was crucial both to the fair treatment of the individuals involved and the interests of justice. The police yesterday said they had begun liaising with the crown prosecution service, but declined to say whether charges were likely. \"The longer this goes on without the police either bringing charges or dismissing the girl's allegations the more likely it will be that the names leak out,\" Mr Gilbert said. \"The papers, particularly the tabloids, will not give up on it, and the longer the police leave it the less chance there is that a fair trial can be held. If the speculation goes on for a while and charges are brought the defence will be able to show the judge a pile of newspaper cuttings and claim he will not get a fair trial. That is not in the best interests of justice.\" Mr Gilbert said that the internet posed problems that the contempt laws were ill suited to combat. \"It adds a whole new facet to the problem. You have a completely unregulated environment to which millions have access in which rumours abound. In the eyes of the law, however, I think there is still a difference between a rumour on a website and one published in a newspaper.\" The Internet Service Providers' Association called for clarification of the law regarding their role in police defamatory or prejudicial material published online. \"At the moment it is very confusing when it comes to defamation,\" said a spokesman. \"As internet service providers we are not publishers, yet at the moment we are having to act as judge and jury on what we take down, taking responsibility for content. That is not right, a judge needs to decide this.\" Caught in the web of publicity Matthew Kelly In January the Stars in Their Eyes presenter was arrested over allegations that he sexually abused teenage boys. When the news leaked out Mr Kelly was the subject of lurid tabloid stories about his private life. Five weeks later Surrey police said they had found no evidence to substantiate the allegations and he would not be charged. Pete Townshend Also in January, Pete Townshend made a public statement after the Daily Mail revealed that Scotland Yard was investigating a \"legendary British rock star\" in connection with an inquiry into child pornography. Townshend claimed he was doing research for a campaign against child pornography. In May he received a caution for accessing a website containing child abuse images. David Beckham A story about David Beckham on celebrity gossip website Popbitch in November circulated, via emails, around the country. Lawyers were called in and the defamatory material was removed. John Leslie Amid speculation last October over the identity of the unnamed rapist in Ulrika Jonsson's autobiography, John Leslie was named by TV presenter Matthew Wright in connection with the story. Two papers reported the slip, prompting stories about Leslie, who was sacked as a presenter of ITV's This Morning. Jonsson never named him and no police charges were brought against him. \u00b7 Sally James Gregory"
