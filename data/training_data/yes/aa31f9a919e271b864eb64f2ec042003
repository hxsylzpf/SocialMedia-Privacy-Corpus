  "content": "The Silicon Valley company Path has been fined $800,000, the largest amount ever against an app builder, by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). It has also been bound over on privacy for 20 years after it grabbed customers' address book data and uploaded them to its own servers without permission, and let children under 13 join its service. The FTC, in charge of consumer protection, said that Path's actions had been misleading and offered users \"no meaningful choice\" about the collection of their personal data: even if they didn't select options to find friends on its social network, their data \u2013 including first and last names, phone numbers, email addresses and Facebook and Twitter usernames \u2013 would be taken from users' iPhones and iPads and uploaded to Path's servers. It is illegal under US law to allow children under 13 to sign up to a service without a parent's permission. The FTC said that roughly 3,000 children did sign up to Path. The service presently has about 6 million users. Jon Leibowitz, in his last day in charge of the FTC, said: \"This settlement with Path shows that no matter what new technologies emerge, the agency will continue to safeguard the privacy of Americans.\" The FTC has previously fined app builders, including W3C Innovations, aka Broken Thumbs Apps, for letting underage children sign up. In a statement, Path's founder and chief executive Dave Morin said that it had identified and blocked underage signups before the FTC, and shut down accounts from those disallowed from joining: \"there was a period of time where our system was not automatically rejecting people who indicated that they were under 13,\" Morin explained in a blogpost. The FTC also warned app developers and handset companies that they needed to improve data security on apps and mobile operating systems, and that \"a rush to release may results in dangerous security oversights\". The news that Path was grabbing users' address book contents materialised almost exactly a year ago, when Arun Thampi, another app developer, blogged about his discovery that an early version of the app had uploaded his entire address book. \"I feel quite violated that my address book is being held remotely on a third-party service,\" Thampi wrote. That quickly led to a public apology from Morin, who had launched Path in November 2010, and had suggested that privacy would be a central feature \u2013 in which you would \"share life with the ones you love\", but not the whole web. But the revelation about Path led to the discovery that a number of apps were silently uploading users' address book contents to their own servers: the writer Dustin Curtis reported at the time that \"there's a quiet understanding among many iOS [iPhone and iPad] app developers that it is acceptable to send a user's entire address book, without their permission, to remote servers and then store it for future reference. It's common practice, and many companies likely have your address book stored in their database.\" That, in turn, led to questions for Apple chief executive Tim Cook about privacy, to which the company replied that accessing address books without permission was a breach of guidelines, and would be stopped by subsequent updates. Apple altered the permission system in iOS 6, the latest version of iOS, released in September, so that any app that tries to access the address book must get explicit permission from the user. But there is still no detail on whether that data is copied and uploaded to the company's servers, or simply accessed once for information.",
