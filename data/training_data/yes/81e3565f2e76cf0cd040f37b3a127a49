  "content": "The founder of social networking website Facebook has admitted he \"messed up\" by launching a service that reveals users' online activities to other members. Facebook, which began in 2004 and is the second-largest site of its kind after MySpace in the US, connects university and college students. Earlier this week, Mark Zuckerberg faced revolt from hundreds of thousands of users who labelled the service \"spooky and stalker-esque\". Several days ago he published on his blog a defence of the new products - News Feed and Mini-Feed - telling people to \"\"Calm down. Breathe\"\" while the product was \"evolving\". The News Feed service was introduced to each user's homepage and shows a log of every action of users in the same group - from updating a profile to posting a photo. He argued that the purpose of News Feed and the similar Mini-Feed, which shows personal updates only, was to \"highlight what's happening in your social circles on Facebook\". However, earlier today he published an open letter on his blog, which he started with: \"We really messed this one up\". Mr Zuckerberg admitted the company had failed its users because Facebook \"didn't build in the proper privacy controls right away\". \"This was a big mistake on our part, and I'm sorry for it,\" he said. \"But apologising isn't enough. I wanted to make sure we did something about it, and quickly. So we have been coding non-stop for two days to get you better privacy controls. \"This new privacy page will allow you to choose which types of stories go into your Mini-Feed and your friends' News Feeds, and it also lists the type of actions Facebook will never let any other person know about.\" Last year, Facebook made inroads into Oxford and Cambridge universities and has since sought to connect students at universities throughout Britain. Microsoft last month signed a three-year deal with Facebook to provide online advertising services. Advertising group IPG, the owner of agencies including Lowe and McCann Erickson, took a 0.5% stake in Facebook earlier this year. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".",
