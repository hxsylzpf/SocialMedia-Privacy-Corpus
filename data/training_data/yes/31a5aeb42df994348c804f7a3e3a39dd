  "content": "When Playboy model Dani Mathers shared a photograph of a naked woman in a gym locker room with her thousands of followers on Snapchat last week, the caption she affixed to the illicit image embodied the promise and threat of the cameraphone era: \"If I can't unsee this, then you can't either.\" Seeing something once, for a passing moment of time, only to move on and forget, is no longer the standard form of experience. In countries such as the US and the UK where smartphones are already ubiquitous, we are empowered by technology to capture, record, store and disseminate previously unimaginable amounts of audio and visual information about ourselves and the people around us. Technology no longer places reasonable limits on our ability to perform these acts of documentation, as Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger argued in his book Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age, but as Mathers learned this week, the law does. While Mathers was facing swift social consequences for her Snapchat behavior \u2013 she was widely criticized for body-shaming, banned from the gym chain and reportedly suspended from her job on a Los Angeles radio show \u2013 she also became subject to a criminal investigation, according to the Los Angeles Times. Taking that photograph was \"a flagrant violation of privacy law\", explained Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in privacy and cyber law. \"Naked in the bathroom \u2013 it's uncontested.\" State law forbids individuals from using an instrument (such as binoculars or a camera) to intentionally observe or record in a location where people have a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\". Where that reasonable expectation exists is often up for debate, but it is generally accepted that it includes bathrooms, bedrooms and private homes. \"It's these types of rules that allow video surveillance in stores but not in the bathroom,\" said Chris Jay Hoofnagle, a University of California, Berkeley professor who specializes in information privacy law. Dani Mathers is not the first celebrity to reveal her potential violation of privacy law through Snapchat. On Sunday, Kim Kardashian West posted an audio recording of a conversation between her husband, Kanye West, and Taylor Swift that was allegedly recorded without Swift's consent \u2013 a potential violation of California state law requiring both parties to consent to the recording of communications. Celebrities are also frequently the victims of such crimes \u2013 and not only from overzealous paparazzi. Several professional athletes, including NBA star James Harden and NFL players Julian Edelman and Ezekiel Elliott, have been surreptitiously photographed in bed by women while sleeping, only to have the trophy shots shared on Snapchat or other social media platforms. \"Even celebrities have rights of privacy in the bedroom,\" Citron said. The seemingly ephemeral nature of Snapchats may reduce our perception of the harm of sharing an illicit photograph, but it is actually the taking of the photograph \u2013 not the dissemination \u2013 that violates privacy law. Sharing a photo \"is a distinct issue because of the strong connection to the first amendment, where we don't necessarily want the government calling balls and strikes\", Citron said. \"We have real concerns about the government playing censor.\" Still, Citron says, there are distinct types of information \u2013 social security numbers, bank account information, medical records \u2013 whose publication is not covered by the first amendment. An increasing numbers of states are deciding to include the nonconsensual publication of nude or sexual imagery among those exceptions to freedom of speech through so-called revenge porn laws. \"We want people to have an expectation of privacy so they can freely express themselves,\" Citron said. No one would talk on the phone if they knew that every call was being recorded, for example. \"Sexual expression\" is one aspect of that freedom, she argued. \"That expression matters. Protecting privacy is a way to unlock all these great things about human relationships.\"",
