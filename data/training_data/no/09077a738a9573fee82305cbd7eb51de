  "content": "Bolton Wanderers 2-2 Nottingham Forest Stuart Pearce hailed two first-half equalisers from Britt Assombalonga as Forest secured a point at Bolton. \"With our attacking play we probably deserved to win. We gifted Bolton the first goal, let alone the second, with a poor defensive hash up. But we have some real talent in the team and some real endeavour, so I'm pleased with what I have seen so far. Britt is an outstanding player.\" Bolton's Dougie Freedman also praised the \u00a35m signing. \"It looks money well spent. He's young, he looks hungry, he steps up and takes penalties. Yes, I am a bit jealous.\" Cardiff City 3-1 Huddersfield Town Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says he is expecting a lot more from Kenwyne Jones despite the striker's blistering start to the season. \"Kenwyne has been working hard this summer. He's still not fit enough to play 90 minutes but he does cause the opposition problems. He can get fitter and we're still working on him but he's a big lad and it's hard work. He's played a couple of games just on adrenaline.\" Huddersfield caretaker Mark Lillis said: \"The third goal was tough to take because we felt we could get a result. But the pleasing thing for me at 3-1 was that we kept trying to play.\" Norwich City 3-0 Watford Neil Adams was \"delighted\" by his first win as Norwich manager, which came against a Watford side reduced to ten men after just two minutes by a red card for Joel Ekstrand. \"It's never easy when your opponents go down to 10, because they can get men behind the ball, but we were patient. Obviously the win means everything, but it's not about me, it's about the team.\" Giuseppe Sannino said the referee, Paul Tierney, was too quick to act. \"It was a massive call from the referee when it was not clear. 11 versus 11 and we'd have had a different result.\" And the rest Dave Hockaday secured his first Leeds win, 1-0 at home to Middlesbrough, via a Billy Sharp winner. \u25a0 Birmingham secured their first home league win since October as they beat Brighton 1-0. \u25a0 Blackpool's makeshift side were beaten 2-1 at home by Blackburn. \u25a0 Bournemouth stay top after a 1-0 home win over Brentford. \u25a0 Franck Moussa scored Charlton's dramatic late winner in a 2-1 victory over Wigan. \u25a0 Jake Taylor scored his first goal for Reading in their 1-0 win over Ipswich. \u25a0 Rotherham recorded their first win back in the Championship, beating Wolves 1-0. \u25a0 And Sheffield Wednesday played out a goalless draw with Derby.",
