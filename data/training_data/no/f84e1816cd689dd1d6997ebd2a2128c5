  "content": "Clint Eastwood is among a cast of Hollywood stars stepping in to save Detroit from ruin as General Motors and Chrysler, once the troubled city's biggest employers, continue their long slide towards the scrap heap. Thanks to some lucrative tax breaks, Detroit, and much of the State of Michigan, has become the latest backlot of choice for film-makers. In the past 10 months alone, some 35 production companies have qualified for $48m in payments towards making movies in the state. In return, the movie studios have spent about $65.4m making movies in Michigan since the project began last year. Gran Torino, the latest film directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, is by far the biggest project to benefit from the Michigan plan, while Hilary Swank's Betty Ann Walters started filming last Wednesday. However, the 2,800 jobs created by the movie-making tax breaks pale next to the tens of thousands of jobs shed by GM, Ford and Chrysler, while the $60m or so of revenue is a drop in the ocean, compared to the tens of billions wiped off the value of Detroit's Big Three car makers.",
