  "content": "To explain their playlist, She &amp; Him's Zooey Deschanel and M Ward wrote us a little line about each track ... She &amp; Him's audio advent playlist James Brown \u2013 I Know It's True M Ward: \"A beautiful and rare find.\" Michael Nesmith \u2013 Joanne Zooey: \"This song has such an incredibly beautiful melody. Michael Nesmith is a very underrated songwriter.\" The Carter Family \u2013 Lover's Lane M Ward: \"Probably my favorite musical group of all time.\" Dusty Springfield \u2013 Let Me Down Easy Zooey: \"Dusty Springfield's voice is as great as they come. This is a lesser-known song from her London days.\" Elmore James \u2013 Sho Nuff I Do M Ward: \"My favorite slide guitar player.\" The Louvin Brothers \u2013 My Baby's Gone Zooey: \"The Louvin Brothers are genius. Like the Everly Brothers they are masters of the two-part harmony, but lesser known. It's definitely worth buying all of their records.\" Daniel Johnston \u2013 To Go Home M Ward: \"The Beatles filtered through the mind of Daniel Johnston.\" Ozzie Kotani \u2013 Ku'u Kika Kahiko M Ward: \"Probably my favorite Hawaiian guitarist\" The Zombies \u2013 Whenever You're Ready Zooey: \"One of my favorite bands of all time. This song is a classic. Colin Blunstone is an exceptional vocalist. There is no other group like the Zombies.\" Fats Domino \u2013 What a Party M Ward: \"Great chorus, great voice, great piano, great production.\" Gene Clark \u2013 No Other Zooey: \"He left the Byrds because he was afraid of flying. Gene Clark had a very interesting solo career with many great records. This is the title track from his haunting album No Other.\" Sonic Youth \u2013 Kool Thing M Ward: \"Revolutionary guitars.\"  Christopher Parkening \u2013 Bach: Prelude 1 from Well-Tempered Clavier M Ward: \"Good song to wake up to.\" Billy Joel \u2013 Allentown Zooey: \"This song has an uplifting melody but dark subject matter: my favourite combination. One of Billy Joel's finest.\" She &amp; Him \u2013 Why Do You Let Me Stay Here? M Ward: \"One of the first songs we ever recorded together.\" Ella Fitzgerald and the Ink Spots \u2013 I'm Making Believe Zooey: \"This song puts me to sleep in the best way. I love all of Ella Fitzgerald's duets with the Ink Spots but this is a favourite.\"",
