  "content": "More job losses are likely at regional publisher Johnston Press, which today reported a 56% fall in pre-tax profits last year to \u00a343m. The publisher of the Scotsman and Yorkshire Evening Post said like-for-like ad revenues fell by 26.5%, while total group revenues plunged by almost 20% to \u00a3428m. But an improving trend in the market meant in the first nine weeks of the year like-for-like ad revenue declined 7.3%. The company, which was reporting year-end results for the 53 weeks to 2 January, said that it has closed five papers last year and that 768 staff left the company through a mix of compulsory and voluntary redundancies, retirements and natural attrition. \"With a lower revenue base we have to make sure that the cost structure of the base fits,\" said Stuart Paterson, financial director. But unlike rival Trinity Mirror, which closed or sold 30 titles and had 1,700 job losses last year, Johnston Press did not say it would call a halt to job losses. \"It is not up to me to comment on Trinity Mirror,\" Paterson said. \"But I can't see that statement applying to their acquisition otherwise there would be no synergies.\" Trinity Mirror recently acquired Manchester Evening News from Guardian Media Group, publisher of MediaGuardian.co.uk. But MEN does not become part of Trinity Mirror until the sale is concluded on 28 March. Paterson said new subbing systems, including the controversial Atex content management system, which has led to planned industrial action in Blackpool, would continue to roll out. \"New systems are going into the business and I would like to think that we would end 2010 with less people than when we started.\" He said advertising revenue could be negatively affected by the general election, but that the company was less dependent on public sector and government advertising than it was during the last election in 2005. Despite cost cutting and the collapse in advertising the company still had a margin of 16.4%. \"We are trading slightly above the expectation we had when we refinanced in August last year.\" On paywalls, he said the company had been experimenting with a number of different systems, including holding back content online to see if print circulation was boosted, but that the company was not ready to go public on the results of its trials. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
