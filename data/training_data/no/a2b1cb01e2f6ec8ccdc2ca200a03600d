  "content": "Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City travel to the south coast in search of their first win in four matches. After losing to Manchester United before the international break, City's hopes of securing a top-four finish suddenly look precarious, with in-form West Ham United breathing down their necks. Bournemouth travelled to Dubai for a five-day training camp over the international break and Eddie Howe is keen for the home side to perform after a 5-1 defeat at the Etihad in October. \"It's not one we just want to host and put on a show for them, we want to give them a really good game,\" said Howe.
