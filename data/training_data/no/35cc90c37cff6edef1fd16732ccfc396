  "content": "Rowan Williams, the archbishop of Canterbury, attempted today to bind together the warring factions of the Church of England by appealing for both conservatives and liberals to show mutual tolerance and understanding over issues of gay equality and women bishops. He also placed the church firmly against any liberalisation of the law on assisted dying, describing the granting of a right to die as a moral mistake and an upsetting of the balance of freedoms. However, his warning to Anglicans not to demonise opponents was immediately undermined by a pugnacious statement by the archbishop of Uganda, Henry Orombi, who, with immaculate timing, insisted on his church's support for homophobic \u00adlegislation under consideration by the Ugandan parliament. Williams, who described such legislation as infamous and repugnant, insisted in his address to the Church of England's General Synod, meeting in London: \"Our job is not to secure purity but to find ways of deciding such contested issues that do not simply write off the others in the debate as negligible, morally or spiritually unserious or without moral claims.\" But the archbishop stoutly defended the recent opposition of bishops in the Lords to the government's equality legislation, seeking to define how far the church could discriminate, particularly against gay people, in making secular appointments. \"Very few Christians were contesting the civil liberties of gay and lesbian people in general; nor should they have been. What they were contesting was a relatively small but extremely significant point of detail \u2026 whether government had the right to tell religious bodies which of the tasks for which they might employ people required and which did not require some level of compliance with the public teaching of the church about behaviour.\" The archbishop's remarks came as the synod prepares tomorrow for a debate about whether the church should recognise the small breakaway faction of the US Episcopal Church that has broken with the main body, largely over its affirmation of gay clergy and the appointment of the openly gay Bishop Gene Robinson. The conservative breakaway American faction has been lobbying the synod to secure recognition as the true \u00adAnglican group in the US and held a lunchtime meeting yesterday, from which the media were excluded, to press its case. It has been told by the conservative bishop of Winchester, the Rt Rev Michael Scott-Joynt, that it is a \"godly\" faction. Unlike his colleagues, Scott-Joynt ostentatiously gave only perfunctory applause to the Archbishop of Canterbury's plea for tolerance. In the synod debate tomorrow the bishops are likely to dismiss calls for recognition of the breakaway American faction as premature. The archbishop himself pleaded with the synod not to demonise the mainstream American church but also renewed his frequent request for the Episcopalians not to strain their ties with other churches by electing more gay bishops. He added: \"The freedom that might be claimed by an African Anglican to support anti-gay legislation \u2026 has a serious impact on the credibility of the gospel in our setting.\" Williams told the synod that the church did not assume the right to impose its opposition to assisted dying regulations on the rest of society, but would argue fiercely that granting a right to die was not only a moral mistake but an upsetting of the balance of freedoms. \"Once the possibility is there it will \u2026 create an ethical framework in which the worthwhileness of some lives is undermined by the legal expression of what feels like public impatience with protracted dying and 'unproductive' lives \u2026 the legal initiating of a process whose sole or main purpose is to end life is again to cross a moral boundary and to enter some very dangerous territory in practical terms.\" However, the archbishop's call for a change of heart and an end to the church's \"vicious polemic and stony-faced litigation\" had scarcely been uttered before the Ugandan archbishop's backing for anti-gay legislation was published. Orombi, an ally of the American breakaway faction, insisted in a statement directly at odds with Williams's remarks: \"Homosexual practice has no place in God's design of creation, the continuation of the human race through procreation or His plan of redemption.\" He said the law should not allow homosexual practice as a human right and that \"lesbianism, bestiality and other sexual perversions\" should also be prohibited. He did insist, however, that \"the Church of Uganda is committed at all levels to offer counselling, healing and prayer for people with homosexual disorientation \u2026 the church is a safe place for individuals to seek help and healing.\"",
