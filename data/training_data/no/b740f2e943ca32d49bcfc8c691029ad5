  "content": "Nick Kyrgios' latest effort to monetise his social media profile \u2013 putting his BMW up for sale to his 250,000 Facebook followers \u2013 has caused a mixed reaction online. The 21-year-old Australian, whose on-court behaviour has led to a series of difficult PR moments, posted a photo of the car on his official account, asking fans to message him offers. He wrote: \"Alright \u2013 I don't usually post stuff like this on social media\u2026 but special exception this time\u2026 this was my first car I ever bought, owned from new. The time has come to let it go.\" Among the car's qualities listed with the advert: \"1 owner\u2026 meticulously cared for, regularly serviced, paint protect, only 16,000km, near new tyres, immaculate car, bone leather interior.\" Kyrgios gave short shrift to followers bemused by the informal use of his official account, replying to one who told him to \"concentrate on tennis only\" by saying: \"Thanks Dad.\" Another who said: \"Someone needs money for the clay season's travel\" was told: \"Semis of Miami paid 280k US \u2013 probably not mate.\" He refused to make his asking price public \u2013 but told one follower who offered him $6,000: \"I'll send you the petrol tank lid.\" The world No16 is currently preparing to lead Australia in their Davis Cup quarter-final tie against the US in Brisbane on Friday, amid what he describes as one of the best spells of his career. He said: \"Where I'm at mentally, I'm just competing for every point and playing hard and I haven't really had that mindset before. I'm feeling motivated and I want to get out there more. I'm probably in the best place I've ever been in.\"",
