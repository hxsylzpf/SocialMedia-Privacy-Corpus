  "content": "Theo Walcott will make a surprise appearance for the England Under 21s against Macedonia on Friday night after he was handed a late call-up into the squad as a replacement for the injured Lee Cattermole. Walcott's participation in under-21 fixtures has been a moot topic since the controversy that accompanied his selection for the European Championship in June. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, his manager at Arsenal, was deeply unhappy that Walcott had been asked to play first for Fabio Capello's England team in two World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Andorra, and then the under 21s. Wenger warned Capello that he would \"pay the price\" for his international over-use of the winger. Walcott was granted extended summer leave by Wenger, following his England exertions, but when he did finally appear for Arsenal in a pre-seaosn friendly \u2013 he played the second half of the defeat against Valencia on 8 August \u2013 he tore fibres in his lower back and was forced to spend a lengthy and frustrating period on the sidelines. However, he made his return to first team football in Arsenal's 6-2 victory over Blackburn on Sunday, in which he made a goal-scoring appearance as a late substitute. Capello was at The Emirates to watch Walcott's return and decided that the 20-year-old was not sufficiently fit to merit inclusion in his squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Ukraine and Belarus. But Stuart Pearce felt that his presence in the U21 squad would benefit both him, the player and Arsenal. Although Wenger's view on the matter is as yet unclear, Pearce feels that further competitive football will help Walcott return to full match fitness for his club."
