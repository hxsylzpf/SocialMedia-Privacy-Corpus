  "content": "Steve McNamara, the England coach, spoke of an incredible feeling after guiding the national team to a first triumph in eight years against one of international rugby league's big two. \"The players really deserve it,\" he said, after the defeat of New Zealand 20-14 in the third Test at Wigan that clinched the three-match series 2-1. The success ended a barren run for England or Great Britain against Australia and New Zealand, dating back to GB's 3-0 win against New Zealand in 2007. McNamara, who is now likely to receive an extension to the deal that expired after the victory, said he was delighted to see his side not only beat the world's No1 ranked team but get the better of them across the bulk of the series. \"They [the players] have worked tirelessly over the last few years and although it's not always been the same group throughout, there have been constants all the way to help create this culture,\" he said. New Zealand return to England for next year's Four Nations, that also comprises Australia and Scotland, and McNamara is keen to see his side build on the significant achievement of a series victory. \"We're on home soil again so we've got a chance to carry this on,\" he said. \"There's clearly an appetite for international rugby and for us, now, we've got to maximise this opportunity next year.\" McNamara confirmed there have been no talks concerning his future. \"It's the same as before,\" he said. \"We'd always get the tournaments out of the way, sit down and assess it and I'll speak to the relevant people involved now. \"Representing your country is the finest thing that you can possibly do, but this is something I'll deal with post-tournament. These things aren't simple and I'm in no rush.\"",
