  "content": "The uncle of a Melbourne toddler who was found dead in a suburban creek after being snatched from her pram has branded her unknown killer a coward. Fifteen-month-old Sanyana Sahib was found in a shallow, reedy section of Darebin creek early on Sunday morning, about 17 hours after her mother said she was grabbed from her pram in a park. \"She didn't deserve it \u2026 such a cute little kid \u2026 whoever done it, shame on him, he's a coward and \u2026 shouldn't have done what he had done,\" her uncle, Habib Ali, told reporters outside his West Heidelberg home on Monday. Sanaya's mother Sofina Nikat, 22, told police Sanyana was snatched from her pram at Olympic Park about 10am on Saturday by a man who smelt of alcohol and was not wearing shoes. Nikat said she was pushed to the ground by the man of African appearance who ran off with her daughter towards a nearby shopping centre. She said she gave chase, but raced home to alert police once she realised she could not catch him. Sanyana's body was found by another family in the neighbourhood, who volunteered to search after hearing the child was missing. Ali said his sister was hysterical over her daughter's death and was being cared for by social workers at another location. \"She's quite disturbed and shocked and she's crying a lot,\" he said. \"My entire family is in grief and shocked and we just don't know what to do.\" He said the police were doing a great job and the family believed justice would be served. \"They didn't take much away, a bit of clothes and things,\" he said. Ali said the family had not received the autopsy results and did not know what had happened to his niece. \"It is very frustrating and whoever is out there, whoever has done it, I hope he is caught as soon as possible and dealt with.\" He thanked the family who found his niece's body and asked for his family to be left to grieve in peace. Earlier, assistant commissioner Stephen Leane was asked whether people should be worried that a potential killer was on the loose. \"We've certainly got more police out in that area \u2013 out at Heidelberg and around the parks \u2013 today and probably for the rest of this week just to reassure the community that we are there and that we're taking every step we can to keep the community safe,\" Leane told 3AW. Four childcare centres within 2km of the park told Guardian Australia they would review their usual security provisions, but said no parents had voiced concerns about a potential threat to their children. Fairfax radio host Tony Jones said the apparent calm did not make sense. \"As it stands now we have got a kidnapping, murdering madman on the run,\" he said. \"And it's something that we should be screaming from the rooftops, there should be some sort of hysteria in this town at the moment. But I'm not sensing any of that \u2013 are you sensing any of that?\" Flowers, teddy bears and messages were left near the creek-bed, bearing messages of support for Sanaya's family. The Banyule city council mayor, Craig Langdon, said the community was \"grieving greatly\" and wanted \"an explanation that we could relate to\". \"A random act would be a terrifying thing for all of us \u2026 that would be the worst outcome,\" he told ABC radio on Monday. \"It would be a tragic loss to any family but to find a child like that in the Darebin Creek ... I can't imagine what they are going through,\" he said. Detectives have scoured the crime scene, retraced the steps of the girl's mother and searched the Ali home where the mother and daughter had been staying on a visit. They declined to comment on the case on Monday."
